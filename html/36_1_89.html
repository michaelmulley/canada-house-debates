boards to exempt one-third of their regular indemnity or income

am pleased to present a petition signed by a number of Canadians, 
including from my riding of Mississauga South. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The petitioners draw to the attention of the House that managing 
the family home and caring for preschool children is a honourable 
profession which has not been recognized for its value to our 
society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The petitioners also point out that the Income Tax Act 
discriminates against families that choose to provide direct 
parental care to their children in the home.  This point is also 
raised in the national forum on health report of November 1996. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The petitioners therefore pray and call on Parliament to pursue 
initiatives to eliminate tax discrimination against families that 
decide to provide care in the home to preschool children.

</H3><P align=left>

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B> Pursuant to Standing 
Order 51(1), the following motion is now deemed to have been 
proposed: 
<A NAME="LINK14">&nbsp;</A>
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That this House takes note of the standing orders and procedure 
of the House and its committees. 
</UL>
<P><A NAME="LINK15"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Don Boudria (Leader of the Government in the House of 
Commons, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, when Standing Order 51 was adopted some 
time ago, it was assumed that while party members would change 
from parliament to parliament one House of Commons would not 
differ much in structure and character from its predecessor, and 
that the rules followed in the previous parliament would not 
generally require change to be effective in the new parliament. 
Therefore about halfway through the first session, which is what 
we are doing now, would be the appropriate timing for a review of 
the standing orders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, there would be a debate on the rules of the House itself, 
followed by a more comprehensive review of specific rules by the 
Standing Committee of Procedure and House Affairs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The last two elections have obviously not sustained that 
assumption.  In 1993 there was an unprecedented turnover in the 
membership of the House of Commons.  In 1997, after many years of 
functioning as a three official party chamber, the House returned 
to a five official party system.  Consequently today we are not, 
as anticipated in the standing orders, commencing the process of 
the revision of the rules but are taking stock of a revision 
process that of necessity began virtually the day after the last 
election. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not my intention this morning to attempt a dissertation on 
parliamentary procedure, although I do have a vent for that every 
now and then, but merely to review for the House the ongoing 
situation regarding our rules and how these rules have been 
changing since the last election.  I would like to propose a few 
further changes that the committee might want to consider. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will attempt to put forward a few observations and I look 
forward to receiving views from all hon. members on the rules of 
the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My first observation is that so far the House has functioned 
very well.  According to the pundits of last summer, this was not 
supposed to be the case.  They called it the pizza parliament, a 
House divided in five parties.  It was supposed to be chaotic. 
It was supposed to be unproductive.  In fact, from the very first 
contacts I found that the House leaders of all parties would be 
willing to make this House function.  I thank them for the 
attitude demonstrated to that effect thus far. They have 
demonstrated a sense of responsibility to the Canadian electorate 
which expects all of us on both sides of the House to do our work 
in an orderly and organized fashion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House of Commons is a partisan political cockpit.  It is 
also a legislative workplace.  The task of all House leaders has 
been to adapt its procedures and the composition of the House as 
chosen by the electorate so that both of these realities would be 
given expression.

<A HREF="#LINKT2"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The task of making a five party House of Commons function 
effectively was expedited by all House leaders. Their early 
acceptance of proportionality is one of the governing principles. 
This has led us to agreements on funding for various parties to 
operate research offices, party officials' offices and so on, as 
well as agreement on the composition of committees, rotation of 
speakers and the allocation of opposition days. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We even had to change the amount of time for speeches during 
private members' hour and opposition days in order to permit the 
free flow across the House of Commons. We have also made some 
suggestions to the Speaker on the operation of the daily question 
period. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The proportionality principle I have just referred to has led to 
an increase in the size of the standing committees.  Since the 
membership of the House is after all finite, we were obliged to 
combine a number of committees in order to reduce the overall 
number recognizing the finite situation of the number of members 
available to do the work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps the most immediate obvious change that was brought about 
was in the daily question period.  At least it is the one which 
was noticed immediately by a large number of Canadians. It was 
clear to all House leaders that if the balance between the 
parties was to be maintained, the Speaker would have to govern 
the question period strictly, especially with regard to the 
length of the questions and answers.  I am one who thought the 
answers were usually better than the questions but that is a 
matter for another time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The result is a question period which moves along far more 
swiftly with more succinct questions and answers.  More 
important, more members have the opportunity to participate. This 
has been very successful.  I again congratulate the leadership of 
all parties, the Speaker and of course the table for having 
administered this program which has worked very well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a bit early yet to tell how effective the operation of 
proportionality has been with regard to the standing committees. 
The principle has led to a 16 member committee which is a trifle 
large from the point of view of developing internal cohesiveness 
and rapport.  Its application has also made it more difficult to 
use subcommittees. This has led to a rather heavy committee 
burden on individual members. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Anyone who has worked on a committee whether in this House or 
elsewhere recognizes that smaller and less formal groups have a 
greater possibility to conduct proceedings coherently and that a 
consensus is usually easier to achieve. Nevertheless the 
committee structure satisfies the partisan position of all 
parties.  However we should give some thought in terms of how 
satisfactorily it is working given the large number of people who 
must sit on committees. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Speaking about committees, we should seriously consider 
improving the approval process for travel by committees.  By and 
large, bringing witnesses to Ottawa or alternatively using 
teleconferencing to permit the hearing of witnesses from other 
parts of Canada are more preferable than having committees 
travel.  It is more cost effective and makes greater use of the 
members' limited time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When there is a need for committees to travel, the structure by 
which we seek the permission of the House, the one which requires 
either unanimous consent or debate of a motion in order to arrive 
at the permission for a committee to travel, is somewhat 
cumbersome.  Perhaps an easier and more flexible mechanism could 
be developed for us to achieve a condition whereby a committee 
would be able to travel on those limited occasions when there is 
such a need.

</P>
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Proportionality worked well in allocating opposition days to the 
various parties, in spite of the fact that the number of days 
allocated to supply had to be changed. We will soon have to 
address the issue of the total number of days if the principle 
currently applied is approved and maintained in the fall. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I said earlier, the five parliamentary leaders began their 
consultation process last summer, in the weeks following the 
election, and I want to thank them again. 
When the parliamentary session resumed, we found out that a 
policy of give and take based on mutual respect went a long way 
in resolving almost every problem both rationally and even 
amicably. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a result, we wondered if the House would not benefit from 
long term planning of parliamentary business. Starting in the 
fall and continuing into the winter session, we looked at the 
time available, assessed the volume of parliamentary work for 
the government and decided on a plan for the current session. We 
wanted members from all parties to be able to plan their work 
and activities in their ridings and also to attend the House 
whenever a bill of particular interest to them is put forward. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The process I just described demanded openness and transparency 
on the part of the parliamentary leaders in their discussions, 
which in turn required a kind of self-discipline. 
Of course, there will always be times when, in spite of all our 
good intentions, we will not agree on the time to be allocated 
to debate on a given bill. When this occurs, the government must 
take the measures required to speed up the legislative process, 
if necessary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The planning system also impacts on the committees' agenda, as 
we just saw. Pursuant to their general mandates under Standing 
Order 108, each of the standing committees may undertake 
specific studies, but they must also be aware of the business of 
the House, so as to be able to promptly deal with the 
legislation referred to them by this House. I believe this must 
be a priority for every committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I should point out that a review of our legislative procedures 
was undertaken during the previous Parliament and is still 
pending. 
I am referring to the report of the Standing Committee on 
Procedure and House Affairs dealing with private members' 
business. The report primarily seeks to provide the House with 
the flexibility required to increase the number of private 
members' proposals that can be put to a vote, and to speed up 
passage of votable items. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some members are reluctant to endorse the report because 
government bills must meet all sorts of criteria, while private 
members' bills are not required to meet the same strict 
conditions. However, the good work that parliamentary committees 
do in conducting detailed reviews of these bills leads me to 
believe that private members' bills will be treated very 
seriously to make sure they are properly drafted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Generally speaking, it is our intention to adopt the report of 
that committee. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1025"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT4"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, I should point out with regard to the rules of the 
House and the committees that, in future sessions, should 
private member's bills be automatically reinstated from the 
previous session, the same should apply to government bills. I 
believe the same test should apply to both. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are many other issues which hopefully could be reviewed by 
the Standing Committee on Procedure within the coming weeks and 
months, including our voting system, for instance. 
Should the committee be reluctant to support electronic voting, 
as I hoped it would, it might explore other ways to solve the 
recurring problem of delays in the taking of parliamentary 
votes. I understand the committee has already looked into the 
issue of days and hours of sitting, and I would welcome any 
proposal from the committee in this regard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some members have expressed concern regarding the language and 
procedures of this House, which I would qualify as sometimes 
esoteric. This issue is under review. In Great Britain, a reform 
to this effect is presently under way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will give you the following example. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we table private members' bills in the House, we seek leave 
to introduce the bill and then we introduce the bill.  Both 
motions are deemed to be adopted right away.  If they are both 
deemed to be adopted right away, why have two separate motions? 
One motion to do both tasks would surely be sufficient.  It 
sounds like a repetitive process and it confuses many people, not 
the least of whom are those watching the proceedings or listening 
to the debate in the House of Commons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other point I want to bring to the attention of the House is 
that of the tabling of estimates.  Once the estimates are tabled 
in the House they require a motion to refer them to committee. If 
the House ever decided not to adopt that motion I guess it would 
mean that the House itself rather than the committee would be 
dealing with the estimates. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I cannot see why that motion is not deemed adopted, similar to 
the motion for first reading on private members' bills. 
Otherwise a House that would defeat the motion would be forced to 
deal with the estimates itself in the Chamber, which is a 
procedure we did away with. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The language used in House procedure could be changed. For 
instance, when we table a bill, and the Chair says it will be 
studied at the next sitting of the House, should it not rather 
be “in the near future” or some more realistic expression more 
in tune with reality, instead of this slightly outdated 
language? 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The standing committee may well want to look critically at the 
rules and process of debate with a view toward maintaining a 
vigorous and meaningful exchange of views in the House while 
permitting the House in the end to articulate a clear and 
correctly nuanced conclusion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Several years ago the House decided to remove the automatic 
definition of opposition motions on allotted days as 
non-confidence motions.  The intention was to permit opposition 
parties to raise issues for decisions by the House. On many 
occasions since, such motions albeit sometimes with amendments, 
have actually been adopted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This noble purpose however has been perverted. We have a 
condition now that when some party is proposing a motion it does 
so splitting its own opening round and proposing its own minor 
amendment which makes a substantive amendment to the motion in 
question impossible.  That was not the purpose of the rule when 
it was put in place.  Its purpose has been perverted and I 
suggest respectfully that the committee might want to look at 
this very seriously.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my opinion this House, thus far, has worked well.  It has 
worked well because the leadership in the House, and presumably 
the leadership overall of the respective parties, has wanted it 
to be that way.  The opposite would be equally true.  If the 
leadership of all parties did not want it to work they would have 
some responsibility for creating that condition, should it ever 
occur in the future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the time being, we have worked constructively and we have 
had vigorous exchanges.  That is fine.  Overall the House is 
discharging its function.  Some of our processes can be improved 
and I am sure they will be with the good work of the committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Meanwhile the leadership of all parties has not waited for this 
day and for this debate.  It could not.  We have engaged very 
constructively since the days after the last election and we have 
provided and offered, and the House has accepted, a number of 
amendments which have made this parliament function better and 
which have made all parties participate.  I am pleased that has 
been the case. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I congratulate all members.  I congratulate the Speaker and all 
the occupants of the chair for their good work and the excellent 
support that has been provided to all of us by our table officers 
and our respective staff in the House leadership offices in 
making the changes that we have effected thus far. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I look forward to the contribution of all hon. members in this 
day's debate. 
<P><A NAME="LINK16"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Randy White (Langley—Abbotsford, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I am going to split my time with my colleague from Calgary 
Southwest, the Leader of the Official Opposition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleagues take seriously today the debate and we have waited 
some time for it to come.  The issues that are going to be placed 
before us in the House of Commons today concern the standing 
orders, which are basically the rules that members develop for 
this House to be used in this House.  Members on all sides of 
this House have a vested interest in their improvement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Whilst I would agree to some extent with the Government House 
leader that things have worked well, there is no doubt in my mind 
that things can work better.  That is what we are about, the 
reform of this House of Commons.  A part of that reform comes 
through changes to the standing orders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleagues today are going to spend about 10 minutes each 
talking to these issues.  We could probably spend a lot more time 
talking to each issue.  However, we want to talk about a number 
of serious issues that have been around this House for some time. 
They concern the election of the Speaker, free votes, petitions, 
the Senate, operation of committees, private members' business, 
royal commissions, borrowing money, closure, time allocation and 
order in council appointments.  These are all issues which affect 
members, not only the members on both sides of the House but the 
very constituents that we are here to represent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to spend a few minutes talking about Standing Order 36 
which deals with petitions.  I have long since had a concern 
about petitions.  Many times when we are in our ridings people 
who are looking to develop a petition will say “Can I really 
effect change in the House of Commons through a petition?”  Most 
times we do not have the heart to say “I do not think that is 
working all that well.  Do not go around getting 30,000 names or 
10,000 names because the petition goes into some black hole in 
the House of Commons and you will get a letter back identifying 
the way things are, not the way things should be”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Ironically enough, just before I stood up to speak, a response 
to a petition was delivered to me by one of our pages.  It was a 
petition that I tabled in the House, but my colleagues on both 
sides of the House tabled petitions on this issue which is drunk 
driving.  The response given by the House of Commons to the 
petition is what bothers me most.  The response basically 
indicates that the Criminal Code provides that both impaired 
driving and driving with a blood alcohol content in excess of .08 
are criminal offences.  These people already knew that.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The third paragraph goes on to discuss what the Criminal Code 
says.  It says that some provinces permit roadside suspensions. 
There are various paragraphs describing what the Criminal Code 
reflects. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is nice, but the petitioners had expectations when they 
went across their communities, across the country in some cases. 
They wanted a change to be effected.  They did not want a 
response to their petition saying “This is the way it is”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is one of the problems with this House.  The response to 
change is “This is the way it is”.  But these people want the 
House of Commons to say “We understand your dilemma.  We will 
try to effect a change”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore, Standing Order 36 basically covers the process of 
submitting a petition.  We stand here without debating it, read 
what the people want and away it goes.  Later there is a 
response.  That is not good enough. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>After all, that is the reason we are here.  These people want 
something changed in this country.  We must give them a fair idea 
that at least their ideas, their considerations, their petition 
material will be given consideration in the House of Commons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They have an expectation.  We should have an expectation. 
Therefore I think it behoves us, with respect to Standing Order 
36, that we submit a recommendation to the Standing Committee on 
Procedure and House Affairs and ask the committee to consider, in 
cases where there is a significant number of signatures on a 
petition, giving that petition debate time in the House.  The 
House would debate a motion referring that petition to a 
committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the motion was adopted the committee would be required to 
report back to the House a bill or a motion that would give 
effect to the petitioners' prayer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is the recommendation I make on that.  I do not think that 
in this House we would get opposition to that.  Like many things 
that come into the House and go to committee it can be asked 
“Why do they not come back here?”  “Why do we not legislate 
it?” “Why do we not just make a simple standing order rule 
change?”  That is what we are asking for and that is what I 
expect to be done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, I am going to speak about a topic which is near and 
dear to your heart.  I want to talk about Standing Orders 2 
through 6, which deal with the election of the Speaker. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The rules for the election of the Speaker are contained in these 
standing orders, but it is not really the process of electing the 
speaker that I am going to speak about, it is what happens prior 
to the election of the Speaker. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have seen this for years in the House of Commons.  I noticed 
it as a fledgling MP in 1993 on my arrival to the House.  I did 
not know any of the individuals who we were supposed to elect as 
our Speaker.  I did not know anything about them.  There was one 
member of the Reform Party who had been here previously.  I knew 
nothing about these individuals, about their skills, their 
beliefs, their positions on issues, their visions or their ideas 
for improving parliament, but I was expected to stand here and 
vote for these people.  I think that is wrong. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>After all, we came here as a result of going through nomination 
meetings, disclosing what we believe in, our own personal 
background, and our responses to issues which came up in 
candidates' debates.  None of that happens when we come to the 
House of Commons to elect the Speaker. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not understand it.  In other elections, whether they be 
municipal, hospital, school board, provincial or federal, we all 
insist on this democratic exercise, but when it gets down to the 
primary Standing Orders 2 through 6, the first objective, the 
first duty we have in the House of Commons is to elect a Speaker 
and we have no idea who the candidates are or what they stand 
for.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>After the 1997 election, when we were electing a Speaker, we 
initiated an exercise.  We asked all members from all parties to 
come to a meeting prior to the election of the Speaker to hear 
from the candidates.  Some did not come because they thought it 
was inappropriate, that tradition prevailed.  They said “No, it 
is just going to be an election and I am not going to tell you 
what I stand for”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is going to change in this House.  At that meeting were 
members virtually from most parties, if not all parties.  They 
saw that the prerequisite for becoming the Speaker is some form of 
upfront accountability.  Heaven forbid if we ever in this House 
elect a Speaker who is obviously biased, for instance.  We would 
not want that.  We would not want a Speaker who consistently 
rules with the government.  We certainly would not want a Speaker 
who threatens contempt, for instance, if he wants to prevent 
exposure of his thoughts.  We do not want those kinds of things 
in this House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not saying that has occurred, but we want to make sure that 
the Speaker of the House is elected by members who have full 
knowledge of what that Speaker stands for. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I make the recommendation on Standing Orders 2 through 6 that a 
new practice be added to the standing orders to provide for all 
candidates for Speaker to openly address members of the House 
before the election of the Speaker.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, today we are debating the standing orders, the rules 
whereby this parliament governs itself.  As I gaze about me at 
this great throng of members sitting dutifully at their desks 
after a two week recess, I perceive that some members are perhaps 
a little bored with this subject and perhaps distracted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To provide a little stimulus I would like to start with a little 
story. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Once upon a time there was a king named Jean I, who presided 
over a castle surrounded by a moat with a drawbridge. The 
inhabitants of his castle were divided into two classes: lords 
and ladies who occupied the front benches of the royal throne 
room on state occasions and the peasants who occupied the back 
benches. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One day a group of peasants, or backbenchers as they were 
called, went out to toil in the fields.  As they crossed the moat 
and started down the road they passed a cave from which emerged a 
great dragon breathing fire and smoke.  The fire consumed 50 of 
the backbenchers and sent the rest scurrying back into the 
castle. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When King Jean was told of this terrible tragedy he resolved to 
investigate it himself.  To help him, he took along two of his 
most trusted knights.  They included Lord Bob, the keeper of the 
royal whip, and Lord Boudriavere who had once been a bus boy in 
the castle cafeteria but had risen to high rank through his 
faithful service to King Jean. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As they surveyed the scene of the tragedy they observed three 
things.  They saw the 50 fried backbenchers and said that was too 
bad.  They saw the dragon lying dead from overexertion.  They 
also noticed that the dragon's fire had ignited a seam of coal in 
the cave from which smoke continued to billow. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Lord Bob, who was a straightforward fellow, and had been a sword 
fight referee in another life, said the obvious “The dragon is 
dead.  This is good news.  Let's go tell the backbenchers”.  But 
Lord Boudriavere, who had once been a bus boy in the castle 
cafeteria and had risen to high rank through faithful service to 
the king, said “Not so fast”.  Turning to King Jean he said “I 
see an opportunity here to maintain and increase our control over 
the peasants.  Let us imply, indirectly of course, that the fiery 
dragon still lives.  We can point to the smoke belching from the 
cave as evidence of this.  Let us tell the backbenchers that 
henceforth they can only go out of the castle with royal 
permission and under the supervision of myself and Lord Bob, for 
the safety and protection, of course, of themselves and the 
castle”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>King Jean thought this was a splendid idea and thus the myth of 
the fiery dragon was established.  It was used to coerce and 
control the backbenchers of the kingdom until King Jean was 
defeated in battle by a knight from the west which is another 
story I will tell on some other occasion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is the point that I want to make.

<A HREF="#LINKT8"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a myth in the House that lurking out there somewhere is 
the fiery dragon of the confidence convention, the erroneous 
belief studiously cultivated by the government that if a 
government bill or motion is defeated, or an opposition bill, 
motion or amendment is passed, this obliges the government to 
resign.  This myth is used to coerce government members, 
especially backbenchers, to vote for government bills and motions 
with which they and their constituents disagree and to vote 
against opposition bills, motions and amendments with which they 
substantially agree. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reality is that the fiery dragon of the confidence 
convention in its traditional form is dead.  The sooner the House 
officially recognizes that fact, the better for all.  It is true 
that there was a time when the rules supported the traditional 
confidence convention but that is not the current situation.  Our 
present practice is outlined in Beauchesne's sixth edition, 
citation 168(6): 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The determination of the issue of confidence in the government is 
not a question of procedure or order, and does not involve the 
interpretive responsibilities of the Speaker. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Following the recommendations of the Special Committee on 
Standing Orders and Procedure as well as those of the Special 
Committee on the Reform of the House of Commons, December 1984, 
the House removed references in the standing orders which 
described votable motions on allotted days as questions of 
confidence.  The committee concluded that matters of confidence 
should at all times be clearly subject to political 
determination.  Motions of non-confidence should not be 
prescribed in the rules. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The British parliament, the mother of all parliaments, has 
acknowledged the death of the traditional confidence convention. 
For example, in the British parliament of 1974 to 1979 the 
government was defeated 42 times, 23 times as the result of 
government MPs voting with the opposition and 19 times when the 
opposition parties combined against the government after it had 
slipped into a minority position in 1976. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some of these defeats were on important issues such as economic 
policy and an important constitutional bill.  Yet the British 
prime minister neither resigned nor requested dissolution. 
Despite the current citation from Beauchesne's and these 
historical facts, the myth of the confidence convention still 
appears to live in this parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is in the interest of the majority of the members on both 
sides of the House to dispel the myth of the confidence 
convention and thereby permit freer voting.  I therefore offer 
the following three challenges. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first is to the Prime Minister.  Will he please stand in his 
place in the House and declare his intention to allow government 
members to vote for or against all bills and motions and all 
amendments to bills and motions free of party discipline, and 
that no such vote other than the adoption by the House of an 
explicit motion of non-confidence in the government shall require 
the government to resign?   All he has to do is stand up and make 
that statement.  It would take about 20 seconds and it would 
change the character of this place overnight. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second is to the Standing Committee on Procedure and House 
Affairs to study this issue and report to the House with a view 
to dispelling the myth of the traditional confidence convention 
once and for all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The third is to government backbenchers to test my hypothesis 
for themselves that the fiery dragon of the confidence convention 
is indeed dead, even though with the help of Lord Bob and Lord 
Boudriavere the smoke still appears to be billowing from its 
cave.  I suggest that someday during question period while they 
are awaiting their turn to ask a scripted question they should 
engage in a simple mathematical exercise: count the number of 
people on the front benches and include their parliamentary 
secretaries, and then count the number of backbenchers.  I know 
this is a strenuous intellectual exercise, but if they could 
carry it off they would find there are more backbenchers than 
there are those on the front benches and parliamentary 
secretaries.  Then on some future occasion they could vote down a 
government motion or bill or support an opposition motion or 
amendment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What will happen?  Will the earth open up and swallow government 
members and their political careers?  Of course not.  Will the 
government resign?  Of course not.  Instead the government will 
demand a vote of confidence and since government members 
ultimately outnumber opposition members the government will 
surely win and carry on; but it is possible to kill a bill or 
part of a bill or to change it without killing the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government will do exactly the same thing as the Pearson 
government did in 1968 when it was defeated on Mitchell Sharp's 
budget resolution but then carried the confidence motion which 
immediately followed.  After that incident, Anthony Westell of 
the <I>Globe and Mail</I> concluded: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the principle comes to be accepted that bills can be amended 
or rejected without forcing a change of government—the 
effective power of the opposition and of private members of the 
government party could be strengthened; the power of the cabinet 
to have its own way could be reduced.

votes. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK18"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, there are three 
topics I would like to deal with today, and I will make 
recommendations to the House on all three. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First is the issue of the motions introduced on opposition days. 
The hon. leader of the government touched on this earlier in 
his speech, saying that the opposition had found a way around 
the Standing Orders by amending an opposition motion on an 
opposition day by introducing an amendment from the outset to 
split interventions into two 10-minute interventions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The leader of the government said that, in a way, this changes 
the direction of debate, and uses the Standing Orders to prevent 
something from happening. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to remind the leader of the government that I sent 
him a letter on this subject, requesting that no amendment 
whatsoever of opposition motions be allowed, except by the 
member who moved the motion in the event of a last-minute 
development, so that the essence of the proposed debate is not 
changed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact, an opposition day is one of the rare days when an 
opposition party can control the debate.  It picks the topic and 
makes major speeches, and this gives a party an opportunity to 
make its views known in the House of Commons and to promote a 
particular point of view. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The opportunity for other political parties, particularly the 
government, to change this motion through an amendment that, 
more often than not, will substantially alter the substance of 
the initial motion means that it is no longer an opposition day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The instigator of the motion introduces it in the House but he 
can never be sure, unless he amends it himself or through a 
colleague, by splitting his time, that his motion will be 
debated as is by all the members of the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is my sincere belief, and my first recommendation, that if we 
are to get back to what an opposition day really is, what it 
must do and what it must allow, we ought to ensure that motions 
are not amended except by the person who originated them, to 
reflect changes in the situation or the content of debates. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This would eliminate any possibility of manoeuvring to change 
motions or their nature, or to make the debate totally different 
from what it ought to have been initially. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For opposition days, therefore, I invite the Government Leader 
to at least acknowledge receipt of my letter to indicate  “We 
have decided that we can or cannot follow up on this, for this 
or that reason”. 
The government ought to specify this in the Standing Orders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second point I would like to raise is somewhat more 
delicate, the matter of the Joint Committee on Scrutiny of 
Regulations.  Normally, two of the House of Commons committees 
are chaired by members of the official opposition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The purpose of this is to give some kind of counterbalance to 
the power of the government.  The Standing Committee on Public 
Accounts, which examines government expenditures, is chaired by 
a member of the official opposition, and this is normal.  This 
allows the opposition to be extremely productive in these 
committees by initiating matters and by presiding over the work 
of these committees. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Having opposition members chair the Standing Committee on Public 
Accounts and the Joint Committee on Scrutiny of Regulations sort 
of counterbalances the immense power of the government and its 
team. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1055"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT11"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT11"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1055

<A HREF="#LINKT10"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, there is a problem. The Reform Party, the official 
opposition in this Parliament, decided to assume its 
responsibilities concerning public accounts, but at the same 
time decided not to assume its responsibilities as official 
opposition on the Committee on Scrutiny of Regulations. And yet, 
this is extremely important. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To those who follow our proceedings, the Committee on Scrutiny 
of Regulations may appear as something terribly technical, very 
boring, and very difficult to understand. But it should be 
pointed out that on this committee, members have the opportunity 
to examine the way bills passed by Parliament will be enforced 
in everyday life. The bills we pass are very broad and provide 
for various things. 
They are general policy statements with a number of specifics, 
but each law is accompanied by regulations stating how its 
provisions will be enforced, by whom, and how responsibilities 
will be shared. Regulations are an extremely important part of 
any bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the Committee on Scrutiny of Regulations is chaired by a 
member of the official opposition, this intentionally gives the 
opposition an extremely important role in monitoring government 
action. This gives the opposition a lot of power to scrutinize 
regulations, which do not come to the attention of members of 
this House. People are entitled to know that MPs draft bills, 
but that once a bill is passed by Parliament, its enforcement is 
the government's responsibility. 
Regulations are made by senior officials, people who know how to 
do their job and do it very well, but who are accountable only 
to the government and the Committee on Scrutiny of Regulations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since the Reform Party refused to assume its responsibilities, 
we thought that, as the third party, we could legitimately chair 
the committee since the chairperson must be a member of the 
opposition. The Reform Party refused our request. It is its 
problem. It has the right to do so. It would then have made 
sense for another opposition party—there are four altogether, the 
Bloc Quebecois being the second largest—to chair the committee. 
We thought it was up to the Bloc Quebecois to chair this 
committee, which acts as a government watchdog. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But no. Being the great democrats that they are, the Liberals 
decided to appoint one of their members to chair the committee 
because, for the first time ever, the official opposition was 
refusing to assume its responsibilities. We now find ourselves 
in a situation where the Liberals took it upon themselves to 
appoint a Liberal chairperson to the Standing Committee on 
Scrutiny of Regulations, thus tipping the balance that must 
exist in the parliamentary system. By appropriating the 
committee chair, the Liberals gave themselves an additional 
power, at the expense of the opposition. They took advantage of 
the Reform Party's withdrawal. But this is wrong. It is 
unacceptable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I call upon the democratic sense of the members of this House. 
Today's debate must be free of partisanship, since its purpose 
is to improve the Standing Orders of the House, so that 
Parliament can operate as smoothly as possible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So, I urge the government to restore the situation and to give 
back to the opposition the chair of the Standing Committee on 
Scrutiny of Regulations. It can offer the position again to the 
Reformers—we do not particularly relish the idea, but the 
Liberals can do so if they wish—but if the Reformers continue to 
say no, it would make sense to offer that responsibility to the 
next party, that is the Bloc Quebecois. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By appointing one of its own members to the chair, the 
government just set a precedent. It increased its power over the 
committee's operations, and this is not right. It is not right 
because it affects the very fragile balance that we have here. 
They transferred to the government responsibilities that should 
be assumed by the opposition. Worse, they did not transfer them, 
they took them over. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore—and this is my second recommendation—the Standing 
Committee on Scrutiny of Regulations should have as its chair a 
member of the opposition. 
If it is not a member of the official opposition, it should be a 
member of the Bloc Quebecois or of another opposition party. The 
Bloc Quebecois has always fulfilled that responsibility and 
would be very pleased to continue to do so. This would restore a 
balance. It would only be normal to do so.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I call on the government to correct this anomaly, which almost 
went unnoticed to outside observers, but which says a lot about 
the will of the cabinet to take over more and more powers, thus 
leaving the opposition to fulfil an increasingly less meaningful 
role. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us not forget that a system such as ours works well when 
there is a balance between the opposition and the government, 
when the government is not free to do whatever it pleases, 
unimpeded, when the government must answer to other 
parliamentarians who do not share its point of view and who 
force it to improve its proposals and rules, to introduce better 
legislation.  All citizens benefit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second recommendation is that the Liberal member who 
co-chairs the Standing Committee on Scrutiny of Regulations, 
which is an anomaly, step down and offer the position, as is 
only right, to a member of the official opposition or of the 
second opposition party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The third point is an extremely serious one.  It involves the 
Standing Committee on Procedure and House Affairs.  A few weeks 
ago, during the so-called flag flap, the Standing Committee on 
Procedure and House Affairs was asked by the House of Commons to 
conduct a serious review of the behaviour of members of the 
House whose statements may have been an attack on the integrity 
of the Speaker.  These statements were tantamount to threats. 
Members clearly said that, if the Speaker did not rule in a 
particular way, they would run riot, that he must resign, and 
that they would withdraw their confidence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Make no mistake, this was the first time that such statements 
had been made about the Speaker so directly in all the media. 
The House decided to resort to an existing mechanism, the 
Standing Committee on Procedure and House Affairs, to 
investigate the behaviour of these members. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When members do not behave properly—a very rare occurrence, but 
not unheard of—the House may then, at leisure, turn to this 
committee.  The member is therefore judged by his peers.  A 
member whose conduct may have been questionable or was plainly 
reprehensible is therefore judged by his peers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since I have been a member, this is the second time this 
committee has been used.  The first time, as members will 
recall, was in the case of Jean-Marc Jacob, the former member for 
Charlesbourg, who was accused of trying to corrupt the army, to 
get soldiers to transfer to Quebec after a winning referendum. 
It was quite a to-do, and Mr. Jacob was summoned before the 
committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A Reform motion was ruled in order in the House.  It called on 
Mr. Jacob to explain his behaviour before the Standing Committee 
on Procedure and House Affairs.  The Bloc Quebecois was in 
agreement and Mr. Jacob, a member of the Bloc Quebecois, 
appeared before the committee. 
He was questioned for six full hours on May 2 and 7. During 
these six hours, the committee had the opportunity to put 
questions to Mr. Jacob. Committee members asked as many 
questions as they wanted to, relating to every conceivable 
aspect of this matter in order to get to the bottom of it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There was a lengthy debate. The committee was struck as a 
result of a motion passed by this House on March 18. It tabled 
its report three months later, on June 18. Many were called to 
testify before the committee and, as material witness, the 
member himself, Mr. Jacob, was grilled by parliamentarians for 
six full hours. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We thought nothing of it. We abide by procedure. We figured “If 
you want to examine the conduct of Mr. Jacob, the MP, fine, so 
be it”. The hon. member appeared before the committee and 
answered its questions. 
In that, the Bloc Quebecois showed a great sense of 
responsibility. We abided by the House's standing orders.

</I></B></P><P align=left>When time came to examine the conduct of four other members, 
from the Reform Party and the Liberal Party, who had made rather 
surprising statements concerning the Speaker, we showed up at 
committee with questions to ask. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The committee chair decided that each witness should have 20 
minutes, including five minutes for an opening statement. There 
was 15 minutes left for members to question the witnesses. 
Members of the Reform Party and of the Liberal Party, whose 
colleagues were involved, were entitled to ask questions, like 
everybody else. We have no problem with that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But the fact remains that for the Bloc Quebecois only had five 
minutes to question these members who had threatened, so to 
speak, the Speaker of this House. 
How can any MP, regardless of how brilliant or effective he may 
be, manage to cast light on the unacceptable behavior of another 
MP in five minutes? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberal chairman made use of his authority within the 
committee, with the support of his colleagues and the Reform 
MPs, who were in the same boat, having also made unfortunate 
statements.  They came to an agreement among themselves, and 
they were the majority—imagine, the government and the official 
opposition—and they decided that there would be 20 minutes, no 
more. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We asked whether the questions could go on longer because we had 
things we wanted to ask.  Jean-Marc Jacob was grilled for six 
hours.  We were not asking for six hours per witness, but 
neither were we asking for five minutes. Such is the concept of 
justice in parliament and in committees, where the Liberals and 
the Reform Party are running the show. 
Five minutes to question them, but six hours when a Bloc MP is 
involved. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is what justice is like in this Parliament.  When a Bloc MP 
is in an awkward situation, he gets questioned for six hours, 
and three months are spent on it.  When it is a Reform or 
Liberal MP, their parties vote together, make use of their 
power, and allow us five minutes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is unacceptable, and the people have a right to know.  I 
rose in the House to raise a point of order.  It was an unusual 
situation.  I brought the matter to the Speaker's attention and 
told him “Mr. Speaker, this makes no sense.  How can the work 
get done properly?” 
His reply was “Well now, generally things are done properly in 
committees.  You will sort this out among yourselves, and big 
boys like you ought to be able to reach some agreement”. The 
committee chair, a Liberal, got up and said “Mr. Speaker, the 
member for Roberval is barking up the wrong tree.  The member 
for Roberval ought to know that we have reached agreement for 
witnesses to be able to be called back before the committee”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I bought that, and I sat back down, telling my colleagues “You 
will go back to the committee and ask for the witnesses to be 
recalled, even if it is only for five minutes a shot.  You will 
call them back as often as necessary for there to be a proper 
examination”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Do you know what happened?  The Bloc went back again and called 
for the witnesses to be heard again, as the Liberal member had 
told us in the House. 
The Liberal chairman claimed he was not an undemocratic person 
by saying “You can recall a witness as often as you want. It is 
provided for in the committee's rules”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the committee resumed its proceedings, we asked that the 
witnesses be recalled, but the Liberal and Reform majority 
refused. These Liberal and Reform committee members were in a 
conflict of interest. How can Parliament operate properly if 
special and ad hoc committees, whose role it is to review the 
behaviour of parliamentarians who did something wrong, are 
controlled by people who are in a conflict of interest? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If it is the behaviour of a Liberal member that is reviewed, the 
Liberal majority can of course allocate five minutes to the 
review, as opposed to six hours. The next time it could decide 
on two minutes or, for that matter, 30 seconds. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is the way things work. However, Canadians have the right 
to know that one the most important tools in this Parliament, 
and in all the parliaments I know, is the special committee that 
reviews members' behaviour. Members are judged by their peers. 
However, that committee was manipulated by the Liberal and 
Reform majorities, with the result that it could not do the job 
that had to be done.

proceedings last for six hours. It should be the same for a

hours for a Bloc Quebecois member and five minutes for a Liberal 
member.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg—Transcona, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
it is a pleasure to rise today to participate in this debate on 
the standing orders mandated under Standing Order 51.  I had 
something to do with the creation of this standing order in the 
1980s and I think it has proven itself to be a worthy 
recommendation to provide the House with this opportunity on a 
regular basis.  This is an opportunity for the House to consider 
how it can improve on its procedures which are rooted in 
tradition and in history but which also must be responsive to 
changing political contexts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I begin my remarks by considering two contexts that make the 
House of Commons unique.  The first is the unusual fact that 
there are four opposition parties duly recognized by the Chair 
and the standing orders.  Immediately following the last election 
there was considerable comment in the media about how such a 
parliament would function.  I think it is worth pointing out, as 
the government House leader did, that this so-called pizza 
parliament, an institution for debating matters of public concern 
and for holding the government of the day accountable, has worked 
better than many commentators led us to believe it would. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is true the government has continued to resort to time 
allocation and closure and each of the opposition parties has on 
occasion made full use of the rules of the House to provoke votes 
and debate issues more fully than the government would have 
liked.  But when it has come to the practicalities of planning 
for the orderly consideration of parliamentary business, I think 
it is fair to say that the parties have managed to adopt an 
effective and pragmatic way of dealing with one another and have 
served the public well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This has allowed for an unprecedented degree of forward planning 
of the parliamentary calendar, and the government House leader is 
to be commended for his efforts in this regard.  The whole 
question of legislative planning is a matter which I consider to 
be important and which I regard as some of the unfinished 
business of the special committee of the reform of the House of 
Commons.  I am glad to see we are making progress in that regard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The election of a five party House of Commons did confront the 
House with the challenge of reconciling the new political context 
with the existing standing orders that in a number of ways have 
been designed for some time now around a House consisting of 
three parties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House has already dealt with one of the implications of five 
parties by amending the rules regarding speaking times for 
private members' business under Standing Order 95, ensuring that 
members of all parties can speak in each debate.  We dealt with 
the matter of redesigning question period over the summer of 1997 
after the election. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, other difficulties remain and should be addressed.  For 
instance, Standing Order 74(1) grants the first three speakers in 
a second reading debate 40 minutes of speaking time, a measure 
evidently and obviously designed to apply to a House that has 
three official parties.  As it stands, this standing order gives 
an advantage to some opposition parties over others and increases 
the possibility that not all opposition parties will have their 
first speaker participate on the first day of debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This standing order should be amended to put all parties on an 
equal footing, a change that would have the added advantage of 
allowing for a question and comment period following the first 
speaker of all the parties.  I think this would be a good thing. 
It is often the case that the leaders, the very people members 
might want to question, are exempted from this procedure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>More important, the current supply process does not allow for an 
allocation of debating opportunities that reflects the relative 
strength of the parties in the House.  Standing Order 81(10)(a) 
and (16) set the number of allotted supply days at 20, 8 of which 
are votable.  These numbers do not break down into an equitable 
distribution between the four opposition parties as they are now 
represented in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House leaders have agreed to improvise on the number of 
votable days in the current supply period in order to accommodate 
the current representation of the opposition parties in the 
House.  However, the House should consider formalizing an 
appropriate formula for future supply periods. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second unusual characteristic of this House is not only are 
there four opposition parties in the House but all four of them 
have in the recent past had members sitting in the House who were 
not recognized as belonging to a political party.

<A HREF="#LINKT14"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the previous parliament the members of parliament elected as 
New Democrats and Progressive Conservatives by their constituents 
could not convince either the rest of the House or the Speaker to 
recognize their party status.  In the parliament before that it 
was the turn of the Reform Party and the newly formed Bloc 
Quebecois to have their party status go unrecognized. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is not the occasion to fight past battles for recognition 
of party status.  However what the past disputes have shown is 
that there is no clear definition of party status in the standing 
orders themselves, only a loose and ambiguous series of 
precedents that are often in contradiction with one another. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Given the experience of each of the four opposition parties and 
given that there is not now a party seeking recognition in the 
House for which there would be a conflict of interest, it would 
be opportune for this parliament to carefully consider ways of 
clarifying the rules regarding the recognition of parties under 
the standing orders now that all the parties are on an equal 
footing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House may decide to formalize the most recent Speaker's 
rulings on the 12 member threshold, or it may choose to resurrect 
an earlier tradition of recognizing smaller parties.  But the 
House itself should speak clearly on the matter animated by the 
most generous democratic outlook. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Apart from dealing with the presence of five parties in the 
House which is unique to this parliament, the House should also 
revisit the enduring questions of whether our current 
parliamentary practices give the fullest possible expression of 
the democracy Canadians rightly expect from this institution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think it is fair to say that those questions can be distilled 
to two basic issues. First, is there a proper balance between the 
ability of the government to govern and the ability of the 
opposition parties to hold the government accountable and offer 
alternatives to the government of the day? Second, is there a 
proper balance between the legitimate and necessary operations of 
party discipline and the opportunities of individual members of 
parliament either to dissent from the party line or to put before 
the House consideration of issues that concern them individually? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the House considers how it might address these enduring 
questions there are a couple of historical precedents that should 
instruct us on how to proceed and how not to proceed with changes 
to the standing orders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The example of the Special Committee on the Reform of the House 
of Commons which resulted in what is now called the June 1985 
McGrath report after its chair, the Hon. Jim McGrath, a former 
member for St. John's East, should instruct us on how to proceed. 
The McGrath committee of which I had the honour to be a 
vice-chair offers the good examples of a consensus building 
process as well as a series of specific recommendations some of 
which remain to be implemented and still deserve the attention of 
the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The episode not to be repeated and indeed an episode some of the 
consequences of which should be undone was the unilateral 
imposition of major changes to the standing orders by the 
Mulroney government in June 1991 against the vigorous opposition 
of all of the opposition parties at the time.  I urge members of 
the government not to repeat in any way the unilateralism of that 
regrettable episode and to be guided by their past opposition to 
those measures forced on the opposition parties on which there is 
no consensus. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Among the most undemocratic of the measures introduced at that 
time which offends the principle of striving for a due balance 
between the rights of the government and the opposition was what 
is now Standing Order 56.1.  If the government has been denied 
unanimous consent on a particular course of action, this standing 
order gives the government the right to put the same question 
again during routine proceedings without debate or amendment and 
deems the motion to have carried unless 25 members stand in their 
places to oppose it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This measure was clearly designed for use against small parties 
or factions in situations where a government wanted to act 
quickly and override the required parliamentary process for 
consideration of a government bill or motion.  In essence because 
it sets a threshold which some opposition parties can meet and 
others cannot, its effect is to allow the government to deprive a 
recognized party of party status in particular situations where 
it is convenient for the government to do so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is not to argue that the government should not have at its 
disposal in situations where it feels it must act quickly 
mechanisms to accelerate the parliamentary process.  What makes 
Standing Order 56.1 intolerable is that the government already 
has a wide array of other tools at its disposal to do so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government can use time allocation, closure, and seek 
extended hours. All of these measures balance the right of the 
government to act quickly in particular situations with the 
rights of the opposition parties to insist on due process. 
Standing Order 56.1 removes that balance entirely and without 
such a balance, where a government can act as if it has the 
unanimous consent of the House when in fact it does not, the 
Canadian public remains vulnerable to a parliamentary 
dictatorship.

<A HREF="#LINKT15"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is unfortunate that the government has seen fit to make use 
of Standing Order 56.1 two times in this parliament, even though 
the Liberals opposed and voted against such a change when they 
were in opposition in 1991.  On the first of those occasions, the 
government used it as part of its parliamentary tactics in moving 
Bill C-24 through the House very quickly, the back to work 
legislation concerning the dispute between Canada Post and the 
Canadian Union of Postal Workers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This brings me to the next point about achieving a greater 
balance between the rights of government and opposition. Whenever 
governments want to circumvent the normal proceedings on 
government bills, it is almost always to force back to work 
legislation through the House quickly.  It is almost always a 
case of infringing on the collective bargaining rights of 
Canadian workers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This pattern stands in stark contrast to the direction that has 
been taken in recent years regarding the rights of investors and 
corporations.  In the NAFTA, the WTO and the embryonic MAI, the 
trend has been to put up more barriers to government actions that 
might impinge on the rights of corporations and to make these 
corporations almost immune to government action. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the case of the draft MAI, the proposal is to put in place a 
series of hurdles to public action that would last up to 20 
years, even if governments were elected to withdraw Canada from 
the agreement.  This stands in stark contrast to the rules and 
practices of this House where labour rights can be compromised by 
the passage of back to work legislation in a matter of 20 hours, 
not 20 years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here is another area where our democratic practices must restore 
some balance.  I point to Standing Order 71 which states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Every bill shall receive three several readings, on different 
days, previously to being passed.  On urgent or extraordinary 
occasions, a bill may be read twice or thrice, or advanced two or 
more stages in one day. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This standing order is very vague about what procedures must be 
followed in order to read a bill at more than one stage in a day. 
It is therefore very vague about what must be legitimately done 
to circumvent one of the opposition parties' most important 
vehicles, which is time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Time is not just time to be wasted; time is time to be used. 
Time to consult with interested parties.  Time to make the 
opposing case to the public.  Time to make sure that public 
policy is not conducted in a reckless manner.  What has happened 
over the years is that delay has come to be seen as inefficient 
in a culture of efficiency, rather than seeing delay for what it 
is and can be, which is an integral part of a parliamentary 
process by which time is provided to the public and to opposition 
parties to make sure that a full and appropriate debate takes 
place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I urge the House to consider ways of formalizing the procedures 
for allowing a bill to be read more than one time in a day in 
such a way that gives greater balance between the government's 
ability to act in a timely manner when there is a legitimate time 
constraint and the opposition's ability to do its job well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Clearer rules would have the added benefit of creating a greater 
opportunity for constructive compromises to be arrived at as is 
often the case in back to work legislation, a process that in the 
past has shown parliamentary democracy to be working at its best 
as a vehicle for mediating between competing interests in 
society.  When the government needs the opposition to get 
something through, we then have a meeting of the minds, genuine 
dialogue and genuine amendments to legislation. Things get done 
around here in a way that they should be conducted more often. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are other standing orders giving power to the government 
to accelerate the consideration of government business which need 
some rebalancing.  These are the standing orders governing time 
allocation and referral to committee before second reading. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In regard to time allocation governed by Standing Order 78, it 
is clear that time spent on a bill is a major source of conflict 
between governing and opposition parties.  On most occasions when 
an opposition party makes deliberate use of a filibuster as a 
tactic, or the government resorts to time allocation, the parties 
will ultimately be guided by how the public judges their actions 
in the next election, or for that matter in the next poll, that 
is, such decisions are very often matters of political judgment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However there have been and no doubt will be occasions when 
there will be a widespread and objectively arrived at concern 
that a government is resorting to time allocation too 
precipitously, and that there is a genuine public interest in a 
full debate in the House.  For such a situation it is important 
that the standing orders vest in the Speaker the right to rule a 
government motion for time allocation out of order or 
inadmissible.

<A HREF="#LINKT16"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is right and proper for the Speaker, especially now that the 
House has an elected Speaker, to have the authority to stand in 
the way of a government that was prepared to use time allocation 
to stifle debate when there was a widespread appetite for such a 
debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Giving the Speaker such an authority, even if he or she did not 
use it regularly, and I would not anticipate the regular use of 
such a power, would create the healthy habit of circumspection 
before the government resorted to time allocation.  Perhaps then 
we could move away from the practice of the almost routine use of 
time allocation which really makes a mockery of the procedures of 
the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As regard referrals of bills to committee before second reading, 
it is sad to say that while this measure has the admirable 
intention of expanding the scope of a committee's ability to 
amend a government bill, in practice it has been used too often 
simply as a means to accelerate the passage of bills that the 
government clearly has no intention of allowing the committee to 
amend. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Standing Order 73(1) at present only requires the government to 
notify representatives of the opposition parties before 
proceeding with referral to committee before second reading. I 
urge the House to consider amending this standing order to 
require the agreement of at least some of the opposition parties 
before referral, perhaps along the lines of Standing Order 
78(2)(a) which requires the agreement of a majority of the 
representatives of the several parties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is one further point I would like to raise under the 
heading of rebalancing the rights of the opposition and the 
ability of government to govern.  That is the right of standing 
committees to scrutinize non-judicial order in council 
appointments.  This process is governed by Standing Orders 110, 
111 and 32(6), measures that resulted from recommendations of the 
McGrath report. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although these standing orders are in place and empower 
committees to scrutinize a wide range of public appointments, 
committees are not making use of the powers available to them 
with any kind of regularity. I call on committee chairs and the 
government majorities that support them in committee to allow 
committees to make greater use of these standing orders in the 
spirit in which they were introduced.  If they do not and the 
process withers on the vine, then the House should consider 
strengthening the rules requiring committees to fulfil this 
important function. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the meantime the House should also consider extending the 
process of committee scrutiny to judicial as well as non-judicial 
appointments.  I do not now wish to suggest a particular formula 
for the parliamentary scrutiny of judicial appointments but some 
form of scrutiny must be on the agenda for parliamentary reform. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The introduction of the charter of rights and freedoms 
fundamentally altered the role of the judiciary in our 
Constitution and its relationship to federal and provincial 
legislatures.  As a country we are still in the process of 
assimilating the profound changes the charter has brought to the 
relative power and authority of the judiciary and the 
legislatures.  The House of Commons must participate in that 
process by considering whether the new powers of the court must 
be met with a new level of parliamentary scrutiny. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would now like to address some of the issues pertaining to the 
balance required between the requirements of party discipline and 
the rights of individual members of parliament.  The main 
opportunity for individual members of parliament to play a 
meaningful role in the legislative process, or certainly one of 
the main opportunities, is in committee.  It is in strengthening 
the independence of committees that this House can do the most to 
achieve a better balance between party discipline and the 
independence of individual MPs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The McGrath committee recommended that alternate membership on 
committees be abolished and that members of committees 
themselves, not the party whip, have the responsibility of 
seeking their own replacements.  The thinking behind this 
recommendation was to lead the House of Commons away “from the 
concept that everything in the House of Commons is controlled by 
the whips, the House leaders and the prime minister”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It borders on the tragic to watch situations develop where a 
committee is doing exactly what it is supposed to be doing, 
studying a bill or an issue carefully with the members developing 
an expertise and a collective sense of where policies should be 
headed, and to have the process cut off by a government whip who 
can stop such a process in its tracks. The current rules make it 
easy for whips to undermine the work of committees. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I urge the House to revisit this recommendation of the McGrath 
committee as well as the recommendation that parliamentary 
secretaries not be allowed to sit on committees. Too often we see 
the parliamentary secretaries sitting there as a kind of censor 
or a government point man on the committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another area where the effectiveness of committees could be 
enhanced would be in altering the concurrence process for 
committee reports. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1130"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT17"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>At present any member of parliament may move concurrence during 
Routine Proceedings, but almost always the process results only 
in a single speech by the mover of the motion and the first 
government speaker moving that the House proceed to Government 
Orders.  The current process then is useful only as a dilatory 
mechanism for the opposition with the government retaining full 
control over the debate and any subsequent vote on concurrence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Committee reports are too important a part of the legislative 
process to be reduced to tactical footballs in the procedural 
wrangling between government and opposition.  There must be some 
mechanism to allow for a full debate on important committee 
reports. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One possible mechanism would be to allow a committee that 
presents a unanimous report to recommend to the House that a 
concurrence debate and vote be held on the committee's report and 
that a fixed number of days be set aside each parliamentary year 
as with the supply process for holding such debates should 
committees request them.  These debates could be time limited 
perhaps along the lines of the 180 minute debates with 10 minute 
speaking spots attached to the process of referring a bill to 
committee before second reading. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another area relevant to the status of individual members of 
parliament is the whole question of Private Members' Business. 
This has been the subject of much parliamentary activity in this 
parliament with points of privilege being raised concerning the 
resources available to individual members of parliament for the 
purposes of drafting private members' bills and with the 13th 
report of the Standing Committee on Procedure and House Affairs 
proposing a new method for selecting votable items of Private 
Members' Business. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I just need a few more minutes, Mr. Speaker.  I wonder, with 
unanimous consent of the House, if I could wind up my remarks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  The hon. member for 
Winnipeg—Transcona has asked for unanimous consent for a few 
more minutes to wind up his remarks.  Is there consent? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Agreed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Blaikie:</B>  Mr. Speaker, one thing would concern me 
which I know is not a part of the 13th report. There has been 
significant support expressed for this idea in some quarters of 
the House.  It is the idea that somehow all private members' 
motions and bills should be made votable, uncritically so, that 
their very existence should render them votable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to register my own concern about any proposal that would 
take away from the House's ability to filter what will actually 
become votable.  If we do not have a system at the end, as we do 
now, for selecting what will become votable then we would have to 
have some kind of system at the beginning which would recreate 
what we now have at the end to make sure that the House is not 
put in a situation where it has to vote on private members' 
motions and bills, no matter what their content, no matter what 
the quality of their drafting and so on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a final comment on another matter that has been raised by 
Reform Party members in the House and on which we have supported 
them.  It is the fact that bills keep originating in the Senate. 
This is a practice that was questionable in the past but is even 
more questionable now, given that the Senate does not reflect the 
five party constitution of the House of Commons.  It creates a 
new tension between the two chambers that I think the government 
should take into account when it considers whether or not it 
wants to continue with this practice of originating legislation 
in the Senate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to the election of the Speaker, I think it would be 
appropriate for the standing committee to consider what would be 
appropriate campaigning and what kind of structures the House 
might set up for candidates for the speakership to make known to 
members of parliament their views, their attitudes toward the 
House and so on.  I think this has to be done very carefully. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The initial recommendation of the McGrath committee was that 
there be no campaigning at all because we did not want to bring 
the speakership into the disrepute that sometimes is associated 
with political campaigning.  That spirit has to be respected.  I 
hope we might be able to find a way to meet the needs of new 
members who feel that they do not have enough information about 
candidates for the speakership and at the same time respect the 
original spirit of the McGrath committee that we not have that 
kind of campaign. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My final comment, because I promised not to abuse the generosity 
of the House, is on the matter of free votes.  All votes in the 
House are already free.  This was achieved by the McGrath 
committee.  The dragon to which the Leader of the Official 
Opposition referred, that is to say the confidence convention, is 
slain. What is not slain is the desire for uniformity and for 
obedience which exists within all political parties, including 
the Reform Party and including my own. 
That is what has to be slain if we are to have the kind of 
parliament the Leader of the Opposition called for.  That is 
something that is the responsibility of political parties and not 
primarily the responsibility of the House of Commons.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough, PC):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, as a new member of the House I am extremely proud to 
take part in this important debate which focuses on the rules and 
practices of the House.  This is one of the few occasions when 
the House is required to consider its practices.  Parliamentary 
procedure is as much a part of the Constitution as are the 
written constitutional statutes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The standing orders which govern the House, like all laws, 
should be pliable and flexible to adapt to changing times and 
circumstances. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a member of the Progressive Conservative Party there is a 
proud history of our party to improve the House of Commons.  In 
1979 the Clark government put forward a white paper on the reform 
of parliament.  Tabled by the late Walter Baker, this position 
paper offered as a thesis that “the House of Commons should not 
govern but should poke and pry without hindrance into the 
activities of those who do”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was also the government of the Right Hon. Brian Mulroney 
which struck the McGrath committee to which the hon. member for 
Winnipeg—Transcona referred in his remarks.  It was the same 
government which accepted most of the recommendations of that 
committee.  Indeed I note that some of the reforms which were 
brought to this House have now been proposed by the modernization 
committee of the British House of Commons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was also the Mulroney government which agreed to the secret 
ballot for the election of the Speaker, a measure that Prime 
Minister Trudeau would not accept.  Lest we forget, he was the 
man who characterized members of parliament as nobodies when they 
get 50 feet from the front door.  Quite typical of his attitude. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is obvious that some members may be feeling that they are 
being marginalized as demonstrated by yesterday's antics when one 
hon. member chose to retreat with his seat.  There is a level of 
frustration that exists on the part of members of the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member for Winnipeg—Transcona also referred 
specifically to Standing Order 56.1.  There is a legacy again of 
the Conservative government that has to be referred to here and 
one that we would acknowledge as perhaps being somewhat incorrect 
in this standing order.  Recognizing one is wrong is certainly an 
important part of democracy.  I note that the hon. member across, 
the Minister for International Trade, recently demonstrated that 
when he publicly agreed the Liberal government was wrong in 
opposing free trade some years ago. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to indicate that with Standing Order 56.1 there is the 
concept of unanimous consent as it should be restored to exactly 
that, unanimous consent.  Under normal circumstances the request 
for unanimous consent to move a motion would be a prelude to a 
question being put to the House for division.   The standing 
order now allows a minister to put forward a motion and if 25 
members do not object then the motion is put and carried.  The 
House does not get a chance to decide the matter.  In this 
parliament the government has used the standing order to suspend 
the requirement for quorum despite the fact that quorum is 
prescribed by the Constitution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Essentially this standing order allows the government to run 
roughshod over the opposition and the right to question and hold 
the government accountable is therefore curtailed.  This can be 
an arbitrary exercise of power on the part of the government.  It 
is something that the committee should look at very closely. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to turn my remarks next to Friday sittings.  During this 
debate, particularly in the remarks of the government House 
leader, there was some suggestion that there may be a movement 
afoot to eliminate Friday sittings.  I want to be very clear and 
unequivocal about my party's position on this point.  We are 
completely opposed to any elimination of Friday sittings.  We 
feel that the present arrangement of Fridays is an important and 
integral part of the process.  Fridays can be as effective as any 
other day of the week.  I would suggest that Canadians would take 
a very dim view if the committee were to do away with Friday 
sittings in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government House leader did speak in reference to the spirit 
of co-operation and the desire of those present to make this 
parliament work.  I think that is an apt observation. 
However, as has been suggested by previous speakers, there is a 
great deal of room for improvement. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1140"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT19"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>One area where I might suggest there is room for improvement is 
Private Members' Business.  There are certainly historic reasons 
the private members' process is set up as it is, but I would 
suggest that some of the rules are unnecessarily complicated and, 
more important, costly to the general public. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There needs to be an avenue for members to raise an issue they 
wish to bring to the House on the part of their constituents, but 
they may not wish to pursue it further.  They may wish to simply 
bring it forward at that time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government House leader spoke of the esoteric notions and 
traditions that evolved from Great Britain.  These traditions are 
fine but as I said in my opening remarks we must strive to be 
effective.  The public opinion demands this and we certainly owe 
this to Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One suggestion would be that there be an avenue for members to 
put forward items they do not wish necessarily to be brought to 
the House for decision but instead brought forward for simply 
airing of opinion.  Instead of a lottery based on business items 
before the House, a lottery of members' names would then entitle 
a member to put forward an item of business for complete 
consideration.  This would therefore save a considerable amount 
of time and money wrapped up in the current system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A possible suggestion would be that upon a member's name being 
drawn he could then decide whether it was for discussion purposes 
in the form of debate or simply to be brought forward as a 
motion.  This would be a useful area the standing committee might 
take a look at. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Time allocation and closure have been touched upon as well by 
previous speakers.  There is certainly a recognized need for the 
government to be able to move a motion for time allocation.  That 
is acknowledged.  However the Speaker, as suggested by the hon. 
member for Winnipeg—Transcona, should be empowered to disallow 
the government from invoking this quite draconian motion at 
times, in the event that the Chair is of the opinion that the 
closure motion being invoked is premature. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My next point concerns written questions and answers.  The House 
has agreed to limit the number of written questions but the 
government is being extremely tardy in its answers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Most questions can be answered within two weeks and three weeks 
at the most.  That is a reasonable period of time.  However, 
there is a major problem, I would suggest.  Public accountability 
in the House should insist on prompt and complete answers from 
the government, particularly in light of the circumstances and 
the criticisms of the commissioner of freedom of information. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There needs to be some form of sanctions available to the 
Speaker when the government is not being responsive.  I would 
suggest a form of a yellow card or a penalty box that can be 
imposed on the government when it is not responsive to these 
questions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will now turn my remarks to the estimates.  There are few 
Westminster styles of parliament that have an adequate system for 
scrutiny of the estimates. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yesterday I was at the justice committee where we were examining 
the estimates of the Minister of Justice.  The meeting lasted for 
two hours and about 35 questions were posed to the minister and 
her staff.  That is likely to be the only examination of her 
stewardship over this ministry which comprises several billion 
dollars in the present fiscal year.  I suggest that is simply not 
enough.  Two hours is not enough time to delve into very 
complicated and very crucial issues not only in justice but in 
all of the ministries in this parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to see some experimentation with bringing some 
departmental estimates to the floor of the House of Commons for 
supply, similar to the committee of the whole process that takes 
place at present. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This might mean that the House would have to meet during some 
evenings but a longer debate and examination of beneficial issues 
to the Canadian public, I would suggest, should be of primary 
concern and first on the agenda. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also suggest that ministers, above all members of the 
House, must be willing to subject themselves to the intense 
scrutiny that is required.  It would also lead to a more rigorous 
debate in the House.  The government has talked repeatedly of 
openness and transparency.  These are the buzzwords of the 
nineties. 
However, it seems very reluctant to put that accountability into 
practice.  It shies away from it.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There was mention of the Chair and of the selection of the 
Speaker of this House.  I will add a few remarks to that.  The 
present process allows for the selection of the Speaker through 
an election in which all members of the House have input.  But 
subsequent to that, as Mr. Speaker is aware, the deputy Speakers 
are then selected at the whim or by the will of the prime 
minister. That is not to cast aspersions on the present occupant 
of the chair.  There is certainly ample evidence of the brave, 
courageous and true nature of the present Deputy Speaker.  As 
with the election of the Speaker, there should be a similar 
process of input from other members for the deputy Speakers who 
also occupy the Chair. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If a Speaker comes to the conclusion before the end of a 
Parliament that he or she may not reoffer, a common practice or 
courtesy might evolve, not necessarily a hard and fast rule, 
where that Speaker may choose to step down so that one of the 
deputy Speakers might receive the training necessary to assist 
Parliament in the subsequent convening of the House.  The 
position of the Chair is very important to the ongoing success 
and spirit of co-operation mentioned by the government House 
leader. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will discuss special or emergency debates.  I began with a 
reference to the position paper which the Clark government placed 
before the House in 1979.  I make reference to another document, 
a paper that was placed before the Canadian electorate in January 
1993. It was endorsed by the now Prime Minister and was presented 
by David Dingwall, then opposition House leader, the then chief 
opposition whip who now sits in the House as minister of public 
works, and the two assistant opposition House leaders who are now 
respectively the Deputy Speaker of the House and the leader of 
the government in the House of Commons.  That paper was entitled 
“Reviving Parliamentary Democracy”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those four Liberals endorsed by their leader had this to say 
about special, urgent or emergency debates in the House of 
Commons: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The granting of leave for special urgent or emergency debates 
under the present Standing Order 52 should become more generous, 
thus permitting the House to consider a greater variety of 
important issues that do not command the top of the national 
political agenda. If the House is to claim relevance to the 
interest of Canadians, it must make the most of its opportunities 
to debate issues of current significance. It is time for the rule 
to be restored to its original purpose of enabling the House to 
add important issues to the agenda at short notice.  There is no 
change to any rule required for this step.  The House only need 
make its general will on the question known to the Chair. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is the suggestion in the paper that was tabled by the 
government House leader and endorsed by the opposition leader at 
that time, the current Prime Minister. In 1993 the Liberals were 
telling the electorate an idea that would be embraced by my party 
colleagues and by many members of the opposition, that we should 
have more time for special debates and more open discourse with 
the government.  It was on the timeliness issue.  When something 
arises that needs to be addressed on short notice, this House 
should be amenable and prepared to allow for that debate to 
occur. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the past we have made requests.  The Progressive Conservative 
Party has requested special debates on the disastrous conditions 
that exist in the fisheries on the east and west coasts.  We also 
requested a special debate on the situation that was brewing in 
Iraq.  Yesterday other members made application in this House for 
debates on the megabank mergers.  All these applications were 
refused.  I have had to assure my colleagues that the government 
does not instruct the Speaker on these matters.  It is clear that 
the general will of the House should be conveyed to the Chair.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is time the Deputy Speaker and others including the 
government House leader review the commitment they made while in 
opposition in 1993.  Once again I suggest the present government 
be very wary of what it has said in the past and be prepared to 
live up to its words. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Previous speakers have had a great deal of experience and a 
wealth of knowledge they have put forward in this debate and the 
House has heard some extremely insightful and constructive 
suggestions.  I am honoured to be able to partake in putting 
forward these suggestions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Partisanship aside, the rules that govern all of us will 
continue to govern those who participate in this chamber in the 
future.  We must always be aware of the shifting political signs 
and fortunes and the realignment of power that may some day occur 
because something that is said in this House is very important. 
It may come back again to be used either for or against you. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to conclude my remarks by referring once again to a 
policy paper. The Prime Minister had this to say: “Canadians 
feel alienated from their political institutions and they want to 
restore integrity to them.  That is why we are proposing reforms 
to make individual MPs more relevant, the House of Commons more 
open and responsive, and elections more fair”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those are noble ambitions and they call for action from the 
Liberal backbenchers.  They hold the key.  They must do their 
part.  The solution to the hepatitis C problem does not lie with 
the Minister of Health, it now lies with the Liberal backbenches. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the closing pages of his book <I>1867: How the Fathers Made a 
Deal</I>, Christopher Moore had this to say: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>If parliamentary democracy functioned in Canada, the future of 
Prime Minister Chretien would depend on the Liberal Party caucus. 
If the 301 men and women who Canadians elected in June 1997 
recovered authority over their leaders, they would also recover 
power over the making and changing of party policy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>No constitutional amendment, not even a legislative act, would 
be required to return a prime minister's tenure in office to the 
control of the parliamentary majority, or to make all the party 
leaders answerable to their caucuses.  It would simply require an 
act of moral courage and a little organizing on the part of the 
backbenchers. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>How we collectively write the internal constitution of this 
House does much to decide how courageous we are in the discharge 
of our responsibilities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members on both sides of this House must shoulder that 
responsibility, proudly and diligently. I suggest this is the 
forum and the place to make the necessary changes. 
Self-discipline and restraint when it comes to the use of our 
time are extremely important. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With that in mind, I will conclude my remarks with the hope and 
optimism that this will be a fruitful and useful debate and the 
necessary changes that can be brought about will be embraced by 
the government. 
<P><A NAME="LINK21"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Marlene Catterall (Ottawa West—Nepean, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, we are moving to 10 minute speeches now so I will have 
limited time and will briefly make a few comments on items that I 
hope the procedure and House affairs committee will look at in 
reviewing the standing orders for this parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to make a few comments first on the importance of the 
standing orders.  I think it is important for our constituents 
and for all Canadians to understand that the standing orders are 
the rules that parliament adopts for itself to govern and how we 
carry on the business of the House.  They provide an important 
protection not only for the institution but for each and every 
one of us.  They are an assurance that we can come into the House 
and freely speak on behalf of our constituents without fear of 
being insulted, cut off or treated less favourably than other 
members of the House of Commons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are rules which we as a parliament have accepted and we 
have also accepted the principle, certainly since I have been in 
parliament, that the rules change by consensus. When there is 
agreement among the parties that there is a need for changes to 
make the House work better and allow each and every one of us to 
be more effective then those rules will change. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why I was particularly perturbed by the so-called flag 
flap a few weeks ago when one party chose to bring into the House 
a debate regarding the rules and to make it a partisan issue. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1155"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT22"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>What has preserved civility and respect for one another in this 
House is that we have adopted rules by consensus, by agreement 
and not through partisan confrontation.  That is why this debate 
today is so important.  All members have the opportunity to put 
on record those things about the rules which they think will help 
make Parliament work better and help make their jobs more 
effective. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to mention a few items I hope will be addressed by the 
committee in its review of the standing orders.  First, during 
the last Parliament we had the so-called Boudria solution, when 
the then whip of the government party brought in procedures which 
allowed us to more expeditiously take votes in this House without 
spending countless hours in standing up, being counted and 
sitting down, over and over again.  It is time to look at 
incorporating those rules into the standing orders so they become 
part of the normal procedure of the House and the House can count 
on how they operate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The issue of televising committees, in particular, is extremely 
important to how Canadians understand the work of their 
parliament and their parliamentarians.  My experience is that the 
work of committees is carried out generally in a non-partisan 
way. Committees work on issues that the members have a common 
interest in and try to move forward the agenda of public policy 
in the public interest.  It is extremely important that, as often 
as possible, Canadians have the opportunity to see their 
parliamentarians working in that collaborative way on issues that 
are important to them.  Therefore I encourage the committee to 
look at expanding the use of televising committee meetings. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other issue which the committee has dealt with in a small 
way, and I hope that we will continue, is the clean-up of the 
standing orders with respect to gender.  I was very pleased to 
have the support of all parties in the House when we made a 
recent amendment to the standing orders to get rid of the “he” 
in reference to every person of importance or position who 
operates in parliament.  I trust that in amending the standing 
orders further we will get rid of the archaic reference entirely 
in the standing orders to every important position in this House 
in male terms. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to also speak about members of parliament and the changes 
that have been made in how parliament functions, to better 
recognize that members of parliament have roles in their 
constituency, roles in parliament and also, however little, a 
personal life.  Changes have been made in the procedures and in 
the schedule of the House to allow members of parliament to 
better plan their lives and have a better balance between those 
many different functions they perform.  Again, I hope that the 
committee will look at the schedule of the House of Commons, the 
length of the week, the length of the days, to see whether there 
are further improvements that need to be made. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I briefly refer to the work done by the subcommittee on the 
business of supply which in the last parliament conducted a very 
thorough review of how to increase the effectiveness with which 
this parliament holds government accountable for and has some 
influence over the expenditure plans of government.  A report was 
tabled in the last parliament and will be dealt with again by the 
Standing Committee on Procedure and House Affairs.  I hope it 
will be tabled again with a request for a response from the 
government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To implement its recommendations requires changes in the 
standing orders such as the establishment of a continuing 
standing committee on the estimates; various other measures to 
give committees the opportunity to amend the estimates, to 
improve the responsibility of the government to respond to the 
work of parliamentary committees that have an impact on the 
estimates; to request the finance committee to give priority in 
its prebudget consultations to those committees that have done 
reports on the plans of departments on the estimate and to take 
into consideration the report of those standing committees.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Dawson said in 1962 that there is no part or procedure in the 
Canadian House of Commons which is so universally acknowledged to 
be inadequate to modern needs as the control of the House over 
public expenditure.  Yet this is the core function of parliament, 
to decide how much money the government may have, how it may 
raise it and how it may spend it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I trust that the committee will spend some time on that report 
and incorporate its recommendations into its changes to the 
standing orders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, very briefly I want to speak on the issue of 
confidence.  The official opposition in particular raised the 
issue of free votes.  If anybody examines the records of voting 
in this House they will find that the government caucus, the 
government party, has more often expressed differences of opinion 
in its voting than any of the opposition parties.  I urge them to 
examine their own consciences before they talk too stridently 
about party discipline. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is also important for people to recognize that governments of 
whatever party run on making certain commitments to Canadians. 
While this is not directly related to the standing orders, it is 
important for parliament and for Canadians to recognize that some 
measure of solidarity behind those commitments made to the public 
during an election campaign is what allows a government to keep 
its commitments.  That is one of the most important things in 
restoring the confidence of people in their institutions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I challenge all other parties to do as I believe my own party 
does, to have a very open and frank caucus process which allows 
legislation to come to this House having been thoroughly debated, 
discussed and influenced by all members of the caucus.  I am not 
sure that happens in other parties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The committee has important work before it.  The procedures, the 
standing orders which we accept as parliamentarians, are what 
allows this institution to function in the interests of Canadians 
and in the interests of each and every one of us to be able to do 
our job of representing our constituents.  This debate is an 
important contribution to the work of the committee and I look 
forward to what will be said during the rest of day. 
<P><A NAME="LINK22"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Williams (St. Albert, Ref.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I am 
pleased to participate in the debate regarding the standing 
orders which govern the rules of this House.  I am sure there is 
some decorum in that we can continue to achieve the legislative 
agenda that is introduced by the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will focus my remarks on the issue regarding the business of 
supply which, as the critic of the Treasury Board, tends to fall 
within my purview. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also like to acknowledge the work of the deputy whip of 
the government in the previous parliament where we as a 
committee, including members from the Bloc and others, tabled a 
document called “The Business of Supply:  Completing the Circle 
of Control”.  That document contained many recommendations for 
changes to the standing orders.  I would certainly like to see it 
examined in detail by the procedure and House affairs committee. 
The recommendations of this all party committee had full 
endorsation both by the government and by the opposition in 
making its report to improve the business of supply. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The business of supply deals with the way parliament approves or 
grants to the government the funding it requires to carry out its 
programs and to govern the country for the ensuing year.

<A HREF="#LINKT24"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not think there is any piece of legislation that goes 
through this House faster and with less scrutiny than the 
business of supply which accounts for $150-odd billion of 
spending each and every year.  We go through the business of 
supply in one day's debate.  We approve interim supply without 
any debate because the standing orders do not allow debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Can anyone imagine anything more fundamental and more central to 
government than the way government spends its money?  This House 
has allowed, over many years, its authority to be eroded and 
stolen by the government to the point that we are now simply a 
rubber stamp.  That should change. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think of the ordinary course of business where a a bill is 
introduced and amendments and subamendments to the amendments may 
be introduced and we vote in the reverse order.  We vote on the 
subamendment.  If it carries it would amend the amendment.  We 
then vote on the amendment.  If it carries it changes the bill. 
We then vote on the bill.  If it carries it becomes legislation. 
It is a fairly simple and normal process that is adopted not only 
by this House but by all houses.  It is how committees work all 
over the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, when it comes to the business of supply we reverse the 
process.  When the opposition tables an amendment to the business 
of supply to reduce or to delete an expenditure proposed by the 
government, that causes the President of the Treasury Board to 
introduce a motion to concur with the expenditure as proposed. 
That vote comes first and this House then votes on the entire 
expenditure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us talk about a simple program with which many people 
identify such as TAGS which helps the people in Atlantic Canada. 
No one has any difficulty in helping the people in Atlantic 
Canada through these difficult times.  However, let us say that 
we as opposition would like to make some minor change to that 
expenditure.  We are forced by the standing orders to vote and 
approve the entire expenditure or defeat it entirely before we 
come to the motion that may be to reduce or change it a small 
amount.  After having voted to endorse the entire expenditure, 
how can we turn around and vote to change it? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The standing orders are designed to guarantee that this House 
votes the government's wishes on the business of supply.  That 
cannot be.  I sincerely hope that the procedure and House affairs 
committee looks at this issue very carefully. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The deputy House leader on the government side talked about 
confidence and how she felt that this was being dealt with in 
open debate in caucus.  Open debate in caucus is an oxymoron 
because caucus, as we all know, is a secret debate where the 
votes are in secret and where parties do their own internal 
management in private so that they do not have to wash their 
dirty linen in public. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore, this open debate in caucus is an oxymoron.  If we are 
to have open debate, surely it should be on the floor of this 
House because that is why this House is here.  That is why we 
have <I>Hansard</I>.  That is why we have television.  That is why 
we have recorded debates.  That is why this House is for open 
debate.  To take it from the floor of this place and put it into 
the caucus room where no one has any say, other than their own 
particular members, is an affront to democracy.  We should be 
doing it right here on the floor of the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have seen how confidence has applied.  It is well recognized 
that confidence is rigid in this country.  It is more rigid than 
in any other democracy in the world.  If one person steps out of 
line they are subject to severe punishment for their misdemeanour 
or their perceived misdemeanour.  When they stand up for what 
they believe in or for their constituents they are disciplined. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think of the member for York South—Weston who now sits as an 
independent because he stood up and voted for what he believed 
in. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore, confidence is a lever to guarantee that people fall 
in line regardless of their wishes and it must be relaxed.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to turn to “The Business of Supply:  Completing 
the Circle of Control”.  The procedure and House affairs 
committee has a road map to deal with the business of supply. 
Many hours went into preparing this document.  It has been called 
the best document on the business of supply in 50 years.  It 
deserves to be adopted.  It has the full support of government 
members who sat on this committee.  It has the full endorsation 
of the deputy whip on the government side who was the chairman of 
this committee.  It was adopted by the procedure and House 
affairs committee in the last parliament and tabled in this 
House.  It deserves serious consideration because it gives 
parliament more authority over the business of supply.  It gives 
parliament some discretion to move the money around.  It calls 
for the creation of an estimates committee to study the 
expenditures on an ongoing basis.  It deals with things that we 
never have before us in the House of Commons today called tax 
expenditures. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Finance will stand in this place and announce a 
change in the tax rules.  Let us take a simple example that 
people can identify with, RRSP deductions.  They are a good thing 
but we never have the opportunity to debate whether we are 
getting value for our money through the amount of taxes that are 
forgone.  Does it provide the benefits that are equal to or 
greater than the taxes that are forgone?  Surely we need some 
methodology to talk about tax expenditures. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need to have some methodology to talk about crown 
corporations that suck up taxpayers' money by the millions of 
dollars, yet there is no formal mechanism for having a debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need to talk about loan guarantees that show up in the 
estimates as a $1 item.  They may be for a $100 million guarantee 
to a foreign country or for the sale of wheat or for whatever, 
but they show up as a $1 item.  Only when the guarantee is called 
in and it is too late to do anything about it are we asked to 
approve the expenditure to fulfil our guarantee, again without 
debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is great room for improvement in the business of supply. 
I hope that the procedure and House affairs committee will look 
at this document, “Completing the Circle of Control”, recognize 
that it has all party endorsation, adopt it and amend the 
standing orders accordingly. 
<P><A NAME="LINK23"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Carolyn Parrish (Mississauga Centre, Lib.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, I rise in the House today to talk briefly about the 
business of private members and the recently filed report from 
the procedure and House affairs committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The current system of selecting votable motions and bills is 
based on a draw.  Often there are up to 300 bills sitting in the 
bin and they are drawn for order of precedence.  As all members 
know, they are then sent to a committee that is comprised of a 
chair from the government and one representative from each of the 
House parties.  They decide which bills will be votable.  At any 
given moment there will be five votable bills and five votable 
motions working their way through the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1985 the McGrath committee reviewed this business.  It is an 
ongoing review.  We continued it in the last parliament and we 
revised it in this parliament.  It was referred to the House 
leader as a report, which went through the procedure and House 
affairs committee.  It makes a few recommendations that I think 
are along the line of fine tuning or making the business of 
private members more reflective of what members of the House 
want. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Currently we separate the listings of motions and bills.  As I 
said, we can select five of each to be votable and working 
through the business of the House.  There is time allocated for 
the debate of Private Members' Business and private members' 
debates often result in a vote. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not a static system.  As I have mentioned, it has evolved 
over the years as a response to the demands and concerns of 
members and it is continuously being improved and redefined. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The study that was undertaken in the last parliament was 
endorsed by this parliament.  The recommendations include four or 
five quite different suggestions. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1215"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT27"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT27"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1215
<A HREF="#LINKT28"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border=0 alt="+"></A>
<A HREF="#LINKT26"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>One is the concept of a maximum of five votable bills and 
motions. The committee decided this was an artificial separation. 
Given that they get the same amount of time for debate in the 
House, we would like to see that artificial separation removed. 
In other words any combination of 10 could come forward and be on 
the House agenda. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second recommendation was to alternate the precedence order. 
Right now the bill is put into a draw and is selected literally 
through the luck of the draw. Sometimes there are 300 bills.  A 
private member's bill can stagnate for many years. Sometimes they 
are drawn on a regular basis.  My colleague from Mississauga 
South is probably the champion having had more bills drawn.  He 
probably has shamrocks hanging from both ears. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The system we recommend so that the bill could be pulled out of 
that lottery and brought before the private members committee 
much more quickly is that the bill could be jointly seconded by 
100 members of the House represented by at least 10 members from 
each of the parties in the House.  It is not an easy process but 
it is more orderly.  A bill that is of great interest to a 
majority of the members of the House could then go through the 
seconding process with 100 signatures and go before the private 
members committee to decide on its votability.  We consider this 
a rather strong departure from the lottery system that is 
currently in effect. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The third recommendation concerns when a draw is held before a 
deferred vote.  Votes are deferred all the time and we defer 
private members' votes. The debate is finished in the House, the 
reading is finished, everybody has spoken on the bill and the 
vote is deferred to the following Tuesday for example. We would 
like it to be deemed off the list at that point, once it is 
deferred.  When there is another draw we could then fill that 
space with a new private member's bill.  This is a housekeeping 
rule which gives more bills the opportunity to be deemed votable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another recommendation concerns an issue on which a lot of 
concern was expressed by many private members who came before our 
committee.  When a bill finishes its debate in the House it is 
referred to a committee for amendments and discussion. Sometimes 
because the committee is too busy or maybe because there is an 
ulterior motive that is implied, the bill dies there.  We believe 
that once the bill has had second reading and it has been voted 
upon in the House it is no longer a private member's bill but is 
a bill of the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We recommend that after second reading when a bill is referred 
to a committee it becomes a bill of the House and the committee 
shall report within 60 sitting days.  The committee can ask for 
one extension of 30 days if it is too busy to have considered the 
bill.  If at the end of that period there are no amendments 
suggested, the bill should be deemed reported without amendments. 
That will cause all committees to make sure that a private 
member's bill is treated in the same fashion as a bill of the 
House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fifth recommendation appears on the surface to be a rather 
frivolous recommendation.  Right now we like to separate private 
members' bills from government legislation.  In the normal system 
of voting we start in the front rows and work our way back. We 
suggest for private members' bills on both sides of the House 
that the sponsor vote first and then the voting begin in the back 
rows and work its way forward.  We think this would keep everyone 
honest.  There would be no influence by the front rows on either 
side of the House.  We thought this would be an interesting 
diversion and a way of keeping the thought processes involved 
with private members' bills totally independent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members may recall that the House was prorogued halfway through 
the 35th parliament. The House leader introduced a bill that said 
all bills, government legislation and private members' bills, 
would be reintroduced at exactly the same stage they were when 
the House prorogued.  This is not from one parliament to another; 
it is when there is a prorogation in the middle of a parliament. 
We thought it worked well.  It speeded up the process and it 
stopped private members' bills from dying and having to go back 
through the lottery.  We recommend that be enshrined in the rules 
governing private members business. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Legal advice is very important to private members when drafting 
private members' bills.  We want the bills to be as accurate as 
possible, as votable as possible and as realistic as possible. 
We suggest that the House appoint a law clerk and parliamentary 
counsel for the House of Commons who would be responsible for the 
provision of legislative drafting services specifically to 
members, who would give them unbiased advice and would be without 
any party affiliation.

<A HREF="#LINKT27"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The last recommendation of the report was to give priority to 
members who currently do not have a lot of bills being drafted. 
In other words a member who went to the clerk's office for a 
first effort in a session and did not have three or four other 
bills being drafted would be given priority.  That encourages as 
many members as possible to get involved in the process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we held the review which came up with these recommendations 
a lot of people said that all private members' bills or motions 
should be made votable, that there should be no process to select 
votability.  A lot of people gave us written submissions. A lot 
of people gave submissions in person. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It looks on the surface like a really great idea. Everybody's 
bill would be votable.  It would cut down dramatically the number 
of bills that would have time to go through the House.  It would 
make each of those bills less important.  There would be no way 
of jockeying them into importance.  Every bill would be voted on 
mechanically. The conclusion of the committee at that time was 
not to make every bill votable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I just came out of a procedure and House affairs meeting where 
we are talking about it again.  We are looking at the criteria. 
As I said initially in my remarks, it is an ongoing process.  It 
is here to serve the backbenchers specifically.  It is their 
opportunity to draft legislation and to have an impact on the 
country and the legislation of the country. We will again revisit 
this. It is one of those processes that never stops. We will be 
looking at the criteria.  We will be looking again at the concept 
of making every bill votable. 
<P><A NAME="LINK24"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Bryden (Wentworth—Burlington, Lib.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, I am delighted to follow the remarks of the member for 
Mississauga Centre. I too intend to speak on private members' 
business and I endorse many of the recommendations she made. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I begin by referring to the remarks of the member for Calgary 
Southwest in his speech a little earlier in this debate.  He 
suggested that the government side could very easily have free 
votes.  His proposal was that individual backbench MPs should 
always examine legislation and vote exactly according to their 
evaluation of that legislation and that it should not be a show 
of lack of confidence in the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The problem with that, as the member for Calgary Southwest 
should know, is that each one of us in the backbench does not 
have the resources of the government in examining all the 
legislation the government must put forward.  We also have 
commitments to our ridings. We have commitments and interests and 
specializations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>No individual backbencher on the government side or on the 
opposition side for that matter can possibly hope to examine 
every bit of legislation with the kind of due diligence that is 
necessary to always vote independently. We have to trust our 
leadership.  I do note on the other side that the opposition MPs 
also usually trust their leadership and vote with their 
leadership. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is not to say however that there is not a need for more 
independence to be shown on behalf of backbench MPs.  I think the 
solution for that is in improvements in private members' 
legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the problems is that our role as backbench MPs is not 
seen very clearly by the public.  What we actually do is work in 
committee. We adjust legislation in committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members on the opposition side, and fortunately I am not on the 
opposition side, but the opposition MPs by their criticisms 
contribute in a major way to the progress of legislation.  Their 
criticisms enable backbench government members to arm themselves 
in caucus to push the government in the direction they want to 
go. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, the fact that the Reform Party came to parliament 
in 1993 in such strength certainly gave some backing to those of 
us in the Liberal caucus who are fiscal conservatives and wanted 
to push the Minister of Finance in the direction of cutting back 
spending and bringing down the deficit.  Now there are more 
members of the New Democratic Party. This gives, shall we say, 
ammunition to those members in the Liberal caucus who want to 
push the government in the direction of more social spending.

<A HREF="#LINKT28"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The opposition makes very important contributions to the 
progress of policy and legislation in the House.  The problem is 
that the public does not see this. Some opposition members from 
time to time feel a sense of frustration, as we do occasionally 
in the backbench when we are not recognized for the efforts we 
make in committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We saw an example yesterday in the opposition benches.  A member 
was terribly frustrated by not getting the attention he felt he 
deserved.  I am referring to the member for Lac-Saint-Jean who 
felt it was necessary to take his seat out to the lobby before 
the press in order to get attention. I submit that this was 
extremely juvenile and a great disrespect to the rest of the MPs 
who do feel that we are contributing but do not have to pull 
pranks for the media. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That aside, what can we do as backbench MPs to make the public 
see that we do have an important role in this House, a role that 
they can see on a daily if not weekly basis?  The solution is in 
private members' business.  We have to expand the opportunities 
of meaningful private members' business in this House certainly 
to the extent that the member for Mississauga Centre mentioned 
but even more so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a great opportunity for private members to engage in 
amending existing government legislation. One of the problems now 
in parliament is that when the government enacts legislation it 
does not come up for review again for approximately 10 years. 
This is a formula which exists.  It is a tradition in this 
parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reason is that governments feel there would be a lack of 
confidence in the government if once the law was passed and went 
out and was tested in the field, in Canadian society it was found 
to be inadequate in certain ways.  Past governments have been 
very reluctant to return to the legislation to make the 
adjustments that would make that law better. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We as parliamentarians cannot anticipate all the problems of 
legislation when we pass it.  When legislation gets out into the 
community there are inconsistencies. Examples are the tobacco 
bill, the gun bill and the competition bill.  The competition 
bill is 10 years old and we are only revisiting it now with 
amendments in Bill C-20. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Private members could play a vital and important role in the 
legislative life of this House and this nation by doing more to 
amend existing legislation, to fix it up and make it work better 
in society.  For example the notorious gun bill did go through 
but is not working.  We as members and the government should not 
be afraid if members on all sides of the House introduce an 
amendment to the gun bill and support that change. I would 
propose that we look in that direction to give backbench MPs a 
more meaningful role. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also suggest that we do good service to improve private 
members' business to take the monopoly of writing legislation 
away from the Department of Justice.  Almost all meaningful 
legislation that comes into this House is written by the 
Department of Justice. It is not that the department does a bad 
job in general but the job is sometimes inconsistent. It is the 
old story that if there is no competition in an endeavour then 
the quality of the product deteriorates. If we had better and 
more meaningful bills coming from private members through the 
legislative counsel rather than through the justice department 
maybe we would get an overall improvement in the quality of 
legislation that actually comes before this House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How do we do this?  The member for Mississauga Centre made one 
very good suggestion. This is a recommendation of the 
subcommittee of which she was the chair. She indicated that we 
ought to have a system whereby if an individual member has a very 
good bill and the member can obtain the support of 100 seconders 
on all sides of the House including the opposition benches, that 
bill should jump the lottery and should get on the order of 
precedence.

<A HREF="#LINKT29"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is a way of getting quality bills introduced in the House 
by private members.  It is a very good suggestion.  I hope that 
the report which contains that recommendation is tabled by the 
government and I hope the government will show a certain amount 
of sympathy for doing so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also have to make more time for meaningful Private Members' 
Business.  It is difficult to extend the hours of the House.  I 
would suggest that we do away with private members' motions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Private members' motions do not accomplish anything in the House 
and we all know it.  It is an opportunity for partisan point 
scoring by the opposition.  That is fine and so it should be. 
Sometimes it is an opportunity for partisan point scoring by 
members on the government backbenches.  The reality is that 
private members' motions do not commit the government to do 
anything.  It is a charade.  I recommend very strongly that 
private members' motions be set aside in favour of more private 
members' bills.  That is what we want. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is one flaw in this scenario.  It goes back to what the 
member for Calgary Southwest said.  If we give this kind of 
initiative to backbench MPs will they use it wisely?  Will 
backbench MPs on all sides of the House debate private members' 
legislation intelligently, coherently and with due diligence?  We 
are all human on both sides of the House and sometimes we do not 
do our homework.  One of the problems of giving a lot more power 
to private members to create legislation is that occasionally bad 
bills will slip through. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have a new role for the Senate.  The Senate is dying to have 
something more useful to do.  If we improve the quality of 
legislation that comes from Private Members' Business and make it 
meaningful, the Senate will have the time to give it due 
diligence scrutiny.  It would be a new role for the Senate. 
There would be more public confidence in the Senate.  Improving 
private members' bills would improve public confidence in 
backbench MPs and in the Senate.

Orders to determine whether some changes may be warranted and 
also whether some of the existing provisions should be not only

</I></B></P><P align=left>I salute the open-mindedness of the members of all political 
parties in this House, and particularly the government party, 
which has agreed to hold a debate on the Standing Orders in this 
House. 
I think it is rather unusual to have parliamentarians discuss 
the Standing Orders in this place to allow us to begin a review 
process that will no doubt be taken further by the Standing 
Committee on Procedure and House Affairs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That having been said, while the open-mindedness of the members 
of this Parliament ought to be saluted, I must immediately 
express a concern. It is one thing to discuss the Standing 
Orders in this House, but it is another to take into account the 
recommendations, comments and concerns voiced in this place 
today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Do government and other members of this House have any intention 
of following up on this debate? 
Will this not just be another of those sterile debates we have 
all too often in this place, debates that end up leading nowhere 
or to a unilateral decision by the government? I certainly hope 
not and I do hope the government will take note of what is said 
here today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Right off, I would like to address the issue of the privilege of 
this House. The Standing Orders set out the procedure applicable 
when the privileges of this House have been breached. 
Parliamentary jurisprudence, customs and traditions and even the 
Parliament of Canada Act all show that there are, in this House, 
a number of privileges enjoyed not only by the House as a whole 
but also by individual members in the performance of their 
parliamentary duties here in this chamber.

<A HREF="#LINKT30"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are told that for centuries these privileges have been sacred 
and carry with them certain safeguards. In the past, this House, 
members of this House and other parliaments in the British 
tradition have used provisions provided for in the Standing 
Orders, the legislation and case law to have their privileges 
upheld, privileges which, it must be pointed out, are considered 
sacred. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately we cannot but notice that through the years, maybe 
as a result of changing political mores, maybe as a result of 
expanding communications, who knows, the procedures to uphold 
these privileges have become increasingly toothless. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It has become increasingly difficult to have the Speaker of the 
House rule that, in a matter which, in the opinion of some 
members of this House, represents an obvious breach of the 
privileges of the House, there is indeed a prima facie case of 
privilege or even contempt of Parliament. Once we have gone 
successfully through this first screening, the assessment of the 
matter raised in the House by the Speaker in his wisdom, then we 
must debate a motion usually aimed at referring the matter to 
the Standing Committee on Procedure and House Affairs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First I must point out that, over the years, there might have 
been, on the part of members of this House and the Speaker, 
regardless of the person who sits in the chair, a lack of 
political will not only to enforce procedures protecting 
parliamentary privilege in a concrete way, but also to consider 
any measure aimed at protecting it as being of the utmost 
importance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we debate privilege, which is often referred to the 
Committee on Procedure and House Affairs, we are faced with yet 
another problem. If the question involves in any way the 
government majority or a parliamentary majority made up 
sometimes of only the party in power or other times of the party 
in power and certain opposition parties, it becomes absolutely 
impossible to have it recognized that yes indeed there has been 
a breach of the House's privileges. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am referring specifically to the case that has been before the 
Standing Committee on Procedure and House Affairs.  The facts 
are as follows.  We passed a motion in the House to refer to the 
Standing Committee on Procedure and House Affairs the matter of 
the statements made by certain MPs in the <I>Ottawa Sun</I> that, prima 
facie, constituted, or could constitute, breaches of the 
privileges of the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Obviously, an objective examination shows that these statements 
were made only by members of the government party or of the 
Reform party. 
Accordingly, when we examined the matter in committee, the chair 
and members did everything they could to squelch debate, to keep 
light from being shed on this very murky affair.  The report is 
therefore very indulgent—I use the term deliberately—with respect 
to the members of the House who made these statements.

<A HREF="#LINKT31"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Traditionally, the Speaker of the House does not interfere in 
decisions taken in committee and in decisions taken by committee 
chairs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This, I think, is an aspect of the Standing Orders that deserves 
closer examination because, although each one of us firmly 
believes that the person who occupies the chair in this House 
will act in an objective and impartial manner, so as to protect 
all members' individual rights, we do not, nor will we ever, 
feel this way about committee chairs.  Why?  For the simple 
reason that these chairs are partisan. 
For the most part, they are Liberal MPs with partisan interests 
to defend—which leads me to another question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I said, we do not have the absolute conviction that committee 
chairs will apply, not only the Standing Orders of the House, 
but also the spirit that lies behind them, which is protection 
of individual rights, the parliamentary rights of each and every 
member in this Parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately, we have had this unpleasant experience in the 
Standing Committee on Procedure and House Affairs in connection 
with the référence to committee of statements made by members of 
this House to a daily newspaper which, in the opinion of the 
Speaker, might constitute contempt of the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I shall return later to that question of contempt, if time 
allows, but I would like to take advantage of this debate to 
raise the question of committee chairs.  Traditionally, at least 
two committees are headed by members of the opposition, the 
Standing Committee on Public Accounts, and the Standing Joint 
Committee on Scrutiny of Regulations. It stands to reason that 
this should be the case, since the very nature of the control 
Parliament must exercise over the government's actions is at 
stake. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It would appear that, in the case of the Standing Joint 
Committee on Scrutiny of Regulations, since the Reform Party 
refused to take the chair position, the Liberals decided that 
they would, thus usurping the tradition that this position is 
reserved for the opposition. 
In keeping with the very logic of this committee's serving as a 
control over government regulation through this Parliament, the 
position of chair ought to have gone to the next largest party 
in opposition after the official opposition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will also have to be looking very soon at the matter of the 
weekly timetable for House sittings, and I trust that changes 
will be made which will allow more freedom

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Steve Mahoney (Mississauga West, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
it is interesting to hear members opposite speak about the need 
to show respect for this place.  In a moment I want to get into 
some of that and some of what we might describe as antics that 
have occurred in the House which the House has no ability to deal 
with and that some members opposite have been perpetrating on the 
Canadian public. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am a new member of the House of Commons since the last 
election but I have some comparisons that I would like to share 
between this place and the provincial legislature of Ontario. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have heard speakers talk about the need to make Private 
Members' Business easier to deal with, the need to bring them 
forward and make them votable as they say.  I certainly concur 
with all that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While there is a lot to be said for our parliamentary democratic 
system, there is some frustration that members on all sides feel 
when it comes to putting forth ideas and making achievements. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1245"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT33"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT33"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1245

<A HREF="#LINKT32"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>To give an example, when I arrived here I noticed that we use 
analog clocks in this room.  Our speeches are timed to a 10 
minute timeframe.  We share our time with other members.  I 
suggested to the Speaker that it would be nice to have a digital 
clock, start at 10 minutes and have it count down to zero in 
order to avoid the Speaker's having to cut the member off at the 
end of debate.  Interestingly enough, I received a letter from 
the Speaker saying they have adopted my suggestion. So my first 
great claim to fame in Ottawa is that we are going to have 
digital clocks installed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  What is the problem? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Steve Mahoney:</B>  The problem is it is going to probably 
take two years because we have to wait for the renovation.  It is 
not as simple as taking a clock off the wall, but at least it is 
progress. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the things soon learned when becoming a parliamentarian 
at any level is that you have to be prepared to accept your 
achievements in small doses.  I was pleased in my last session in 
the Ontario legislature to sponsor a private member's bill that 
would prohibit young people under the age of 18 from buying 
lottery tickets.  At first blush this was questioned as can they 
do that now. People were stunned.  I remember the premier of the 
day, Premier Rae, being astounded to find out that there were 
kids lined up in the corner store playing Pro Line sports.  They 
were actually betting their lunch money on Monday night football 
or on the outcome of the NHL hockey game. Everyone was astounded 
to find out it was happening. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The subsequent investigation and publicity took it right across 
Canada and everyone said the kids should not be able to do that. 
I think our society really feels that we should not have kids 
gambling on pro sports in corner stores. That is certainly not 
the vision of the kind of Canada that I or members in this place 
would like to see. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That private member's bill was subsequently supported 
unanimously in the parliament of Ontario and it went through 
first, second, third reading and royal assent in 16 sessional 
days.  This was a record in the province of Ontario and unheard 
of in Canada for any private member's bill to receive that kind 
of attention and success. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I recall as I walked out of the chamber everyone slapping me on 
the back and congratulating me and my colleagues.  My comment to 
one of them was thank you, but the problem is this appears to be 
as good as it gets.  I really think that is the issue.  We come 
here in numbers of 301 with views, aspirations, goals, visions 
and with information from our ridings. Perhaps we have different 
political perspectives on issues of concern to our community but 
we come here looking for ways to make these issues reality.  The 
system is such that in my respectful submission my experience 
here is that one can accomplish more through the caucus system 
than one can through the official system of committees and 
parliament.  I think that is wrong. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reality is that in the experience of the caucus that I am a 
part of the government listens to the people in the backbench who 
are bringing messages and information from their ridings.  I have 
seen numerous examples where policy of this government has been 
changed by intervention from members in the House of Commons who 
sit on the backbenches.  This is a very positive thing, something 
we can be proud of and something our constituents should know, 
but it should go beyond that.  There should be an opportunity 
that goes beyond hoping your name gets pulled out of a drum to 
introduce private members' bills.  If eliminating the motions 
which my colleague suggested earlier would provide more time for 
private members' bills then I think that is a very constructive 
suggestion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to talk about some of the comments I have heard and that 
are heard from time to time about members suggesting we need to 
have more concern about member privileges.  The word privileges 
tends to dominate the landscape here in Ottawa. 
Members are always concerned about their privileges.  We had a 
huge debate because one of the members made disparaging remarks 
at the Olympics about our flag.  We had a huge debate over 
whether her privileges had been violated. We have other members 
who stand up from time to time about comments made outside this 
place, concerned about their privileges.

<A HREF="#LINKT33"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is another word that I do not hear enough members in this 
place talking about and that in my view the standing orders do 
not address.  That word is responsibilities.  Along with 
privileges come responsibilities. When we think of what is going 
on in Ireland, when we think of war torn countries where their 
solution is murder and mayhem to political differences, when we 
realize that the difference between the Prime Minister's desk and 
the Leader of the Opposition's desk is the distance of two people 
holding out extended swords and the tips simply touching, when we 
realize that our weapons are our minds and our ammunition is our 
words and that in this great country we simply use this 
institution to put forth those viewpoints, we realize what a 
cherished responsibility we all have. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was very disappointed in light of that issue of being 
responsible to the House of Commons and responsible to the people 
of Canada because I believe those two issues are intertwined; we 
cannot show disrespect in this place without showing disrespect 
for all Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Beauharnois—Salaberry has made comments that 
were quoted when he was a parliamentary mission to justify his 
reasoning for the separation of the province of Quebec, saying 
that Quebec would be more democratic and more respectful of 
minority rights than under the Canadian federal system if it 
separated. That is contempt for this place. That is contempt for 
this country.  It has no place in this chamber or in this great 
nation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think it is unfortunate that in this House our standing rules 
do not have a mechanism to call that member forward to stand up 
and be accountable for the remarks he made while on taxpayer 
expense travelling under the privilege of being a member of this 
House and denigrating this country and this House and everything 
we stand for. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, the nonsense I saw yesterday of a 24 year old member of 
the Bloc standing up and taking his chair out of this place in 
some kind of a demonstration is just the silliest thing I have 
ever seen in my days of watching this place. I have a 27 year old 
who left home recently.  He moved out on his own and he had the 
good sense not to steal the furniture.  I would suggest that the 
member opposite was just grandstanding to try to make a point of 
some kind.  He should realize that maybe in his case we should 
charge him with theft of chair and maybe we should change the 
locks.  Once a young man leaves home it seems to me that young 
man should try to find it on his own. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would hope that we could look at a way to put in place rules 
in the standing orders to hold all members of this House 
accountable for their actions, to make them respectful of this 
place both in the House of Commons and outside when they are on 
official duties.  I would like to see that kind of amendment take 
place that would bring true dignity and responsibility to 
Canada's House of Commons.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. André Harvey (Chicoutimi, PC):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to 
take part in the debate to improve—and I know you personally 
care a lot about this issue, Mr. Speaker—the democratic process 
and respect for minority groups in every assembly, particularly 
here in the Parliament of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I did not much appreciate the comments made by the member who 
just spoke. He took advantage of an anecdotal situation that 
occurred yesterday and that involved one of our young 
colleagues, who is about the same age as our children. 
Our young colleague was making a statement, asking us to be more 
receptive, to pay more attention to members who do not 
necessarily belong to parties that are well represented here. 
Indeed, it must be understood that numbers, not substance, are 
what matters in this House.

</I></B></P><P align=left>In all assemblies, what people care about and what inspires 
them is ideas, not screams. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Over the years I noticed that, as a rule, it is those with the 
best and most inspiring ideas that we try to silence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not intend to pass judgment on yesterday's incident in the 
House involving the member for Lac-Saint-Jean. Instead, I will try 
to be more open and receptive to the message from our fellow 
citizens, who want Parliament to be a place where the best ideas 
are often put forward by backbenchers or by members of small 
parties, and want these members to be heard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am pleased to sit with the hon. member for Shefford, who cares 
a great deal about young people, children and families. Just 
about all her comments in the House are aimed at improving the 
well-being of families that have problems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are here to promote our ideas. The message sent to us 
yesterday is that poverty is on the rise across the country. We 
have not even been here one year, and on two or three occasions, 
I had the opportunity to express my concern about the 
impoverishment of our society, even though economic indicators 
and figures may say that progress is being made. The fact is 
that poverty is very much on the rise. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have risen in the House on two or three occasions to question 
the government with respect to the message we received from the 
Canadian Conference of Catholic Bishops about the disappearance 
of all social infrastructures.  I would have liked a debate on 
that.  I have put this question to various government members on 
two or three occasions. Yet, governments are no longer doing 
anything to remedy the lack of support for social agencies that 
help the most disadvantaged. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>After I lost my seat in 1993, I had the opportunity to work as a 
volunteer with a national organization known as the United Way. 
This organization does extraordinary things to help the very 
agencies that help the most disadvantaged.  I have not had much 
feedback or positive reaction indicating a new awareness of this 
gradual disappearance and weakening of the agencies there to 
help the most disadvantaged, there, in fact, to help the 
government ensure that the poorest members of society receive a 
fairer share. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are here to convey both our party policies and our personal 
points of view on a variety of issues.  There is not a lot of 
leeway.  Things are improving, but too slowly for my taste. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can give an example.  The Parliament of Canada is not 
particularly accustomed to the presence of five parties here in 
the House.  That is too bad because, with respect to policies 
that are very important for the future of our country, 
particularly everything to do with the throne speech, the 
government's general policies are set out, not necessarily in 
any detail, but very clearly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A party such as ours, a national party whose roots predate 
Confederation, has tried in vain to make it possible for its 
amendments to be put to a vote. 
It has been impossible.  I think that, just because there are 
only 20 of us, and that will soon drop to 19, this is no reason 
why we should not have access to an amended parliamentary 
procedure allowing our amendments with respect to the throne 
speech to be voted on.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Sometimes, all it takes is one parliamentarian. It has happened 
in the past, and the history of the House of Commons shows that 
it is possible for one parliamentarian to push through measures 
that are extremely constructive and important for the future of 
the country. We were not given the opportunity to do so during 
the throne speech debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It happened again with the budget statement. We suggested 
directions we thought were interesting. I am not saying our 
ideas are better than those expressed by the other members of 
this House. All we wanted was to contribute in a constructive 
manner, but we were not allowed to. 
Because we are the fifth party in the House, we were unable to 
push through what we felt were very progressive measures and I 
will give you some examples. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It does not make sense for the government to hoard, keep in the 
bank, $19 billion this year in the employment insurance fund. 
This is absolutely crazy. At a time of high unemployment, when 
we need more money to invest in economic development, in SMBs or 
in training, the government is sitting on $19 billion. Moreover, 
we were unable to have the motion to drastically reduce 
employment insurance premiums, which are still way too high, put 
to a vote. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Tax cuts are another example. There is nothing like tax cuts to 
boost job creation or the economy. I realize that this 
government will argue that they had to reduce the deficit. It is 
always the same old song “When the Conservatives were in 
office—” 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we were in office, we eliminated the $16 billion current 
account deficit. We took structural measures like free trade, 
which made our exports grow from $90 billion to $215 billion. 
All the Liberals are doing right now is pocketing money and 
covering the deficit. I think a more progressive approach is 
required and steps should be taken. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To this end, the House of Commons must be more responsive to 
initiatives from the NDP and the Progressive Conservative Party. 
It is odd that our motions relating to major bills are not 
considered votable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The same is true of committees. We have to wait weeks or months 
to obtain committee reports. Yet we draw inspiration from these 
reports when we take part in the debates in this House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to private members' business, I think we will have 
to take a very close look at this to ensure greater 
responsiveness to such measures, so that as members of the 
third, fourth or fifth party represented in the House of 
Commons, we can try to put across our ideas, which, I am sure, 
would help give Canadian parliamentarians a slightly more 
positive image. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this spirit, I thank you, Mr. Speaker, for granting me the 
privilege of expressing my views.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul DeVillers (Parliamentary Secretary to President of the

comment on the motion on our standing orders, pursuant to S. O. 
51(1). 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe this is a worthwhile debate, even if some consider it 
a mere formality. The standing orders regulate almost every 
aspect of parliamentary procedure, and the legislative process 
could not function without them.  Let us take the example of a 
debate that is still very fresh in our memories, and those of 
all Canadians, the flag flap.  Without a concise set of standing 
orders, the House would find itself in a terrible mess from 
which no one would benefit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the time available to me I will not be able to address all 
questions surrounding the standing orders in any depth. 
I will therefore limit my comments to a few areas, and to some 
related issues of particular interest to me.

</P>
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First I would like to turn to the issue of private members' 
bills, clearly a popular topic in today's debate.  For many 
members, private members' bills are one of the most visible ways 
members can influence the debate of the House and reflect the 
particular concerns of their constituents.  One current problem 
with private members' bills is the system of making bills votable 
or non-votable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Currently a very limited number of private members' bills are 
deemed votable.  This designation is decided unilaterally by a 
subcommittee of the House procedural committee.  There is no 
appeal and no justification given for this decision. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reasons for the designation of non-votable should be given 
to the MP sponsoring the bill.  A right of appeal of the 
subcommittee's decision should be created.  This right of appeal 
would be before the substantive committee most directly concerned 
by the subject matter of the bill.  The committee would be asked 
to study the bill for a limited period of time to give the author 
of the bill a chance to present the problem and the context that 
gave rise to the legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Without unduly tasking committee time this hearing would provide 
a more visible record of the myriad of concerns that members 
raise through private members' bills. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I understand that currently there is an examination of the 
legislative and procedural changes proposed in the last 
parliament by the House affairs and procedural committee.  This 
report contained many suggestions designed to increase the number 
of private members' bills, to increase the number of bills that 
would be votable and to increase the number of those bills that 
could be adopted by the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the government House leader mentioned in his presentation on 
this issue, any of these changes would require the House to 
perform the close scrutiny of private members' bills that 
currently occurs on government bills.  It is clear that increased 
scrutiny would fall in many ways to committees.  My suggestion 
about the right of appeal of votable designation would be a 
compromise between the present system and the proposals of the 
House affairs and procedural committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Committees and the House would not be overtaxed with frivolous 
legislation while private members' bills would get the hearing 
sponsoring MPs deserve and desire. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A related topic is the availability of legislative drafting 
counsel for private members' bills.  Hon. members will be aware 
of the consternation expressed by some members during the 
previous parliament regarding the availability of legislative 
counsel for private members' bills.  Essentially this problem 
arose as the private members' office lost legislative drafting 
advisers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my opinion the innovative project between the House and the 
legislative drafting masters program at the University of Ottawa 
should be attempted again.  This kind of practical experience is 
essential for graduates.  In addition, these students would 
provide an important service for members of parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As lawyers, these masters students are well aware of the 
confidential relationship between the solicitor and their client. 
Furthermore, given the success of the policy in legal internships 
currently available to members' offices, I feel that a similar 
approach to legislative drafting would be welcome. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to comment on the distinction to be made between 
bills that are financial in nature from those that are not.  I 
feel, and I believe I am not the only one, that more and more 
private member's bills are financial in nature. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Subsequent to a reform to the standing orders in 1993, a member 
can, under certain circumstances, introduce a bill which 
involves public moneys, provide it obtains a royal 
recommendation before third reading. 
There is no provision, moreover, to prevent a member from 
introducing a bill which would reduce allocations of funds. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This raises matters of principle, however.  The British 
parliamentary system has bequeathed us certain basic principles 
we have a duty to respect, including that of responsible 
government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians insist that their government be answerable to it for 
its decisions, particularly anything of a financial nature.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This can only be the case if we allow members of Parliament to 
introduce tax bills and if we pass these bills. We should 
probably review the related provisions of the standing orders, 
to ensure that the principle of government accountability is 
fully maintained. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me turn briefly to another issue that has been vigorously 
discussed in this parliament, that of electronic voting.  Let me 
say from the outset that I do not support this initiative. 
Forcing all members to stand in their place and be counted is an 
important part of the job of a member of parliament.  When 
sensitive issues are debated and decided members are forced to 
declare their vote or their lack of vote as the case may be.  I 
feel strongly that electronic voting would remove some of the 
symbolic accountability from this place. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have one last point before concluding. The standing orders 
provide that, during an opposition day, a member of the party 
tabling the opposition motion can amend the wording of the main 
motion. Since the standing orders also allow the member of the 
opposition party who begins the debate to share his or her time 
with another member, that second member has the first 
opportunity to propose an amendment to the wording of the 
motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, this prevents any other member of the House from 
proposing an amendment to the main motion, and not only to the 
amendment to the motion. This procedural tactic is unfair, in my 
opinion, and the standing orders should be reviewed and amended 
accordingly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope members of this House share my views on these issues 
relating to our rules. 
It is our responsibility to ensure the standing orders are as 
concise as possible, if this House is to operate effectively. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK29"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it 
is a pleasure to enter the debate today.  It is an interesting 
debate because it is one of those occasions where we actually 
have a debate in the House of Commons.  People come with ideas 
and exchange them.  Far too often we see ourselves here with our 
set pieces and not listening, but I think the debates on the 
standing order changes have been useful and helpful.  Perhaps it 
is because they affect us all as parliamentarians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the brief time allotted to me I would like to talk about six 
different areas of the standing orders which I believe are in 
need of change.  The first relates to the taking of votes and the 
practice of applying votes, the same practice we have been using 
since the start of the 35th parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While every member of the House would agree that this practice 
has greatly reduced the time it takes to record votes, it is also 
true that this time and money saving measure can and has been 
denied by only a single voice.  In other words, even though our 
vote is recorded in <I>Hansard</I> as having been cast, any one 
member can stand and say he or she wants everybody in the House 
to stand again, again and again, as many as 20 to 30 times in a 
single evening.  Because what is most important is the vote 
itself that is a time waster. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My first recommendation would be that the procedure of applying 
votes by party should be institutionalized in our rules.  Instead 
of requiring unanimous consent, what is now common practice, a 
minimum of five members would be required to force a traditional 
stand up vote.  Such a standing order change would not infringe 
on the voting rights of anyone but would be consistent with the 
rule requiring five members to force a recorded vote.  In that 
sense it is consistent, would speed things up and would make it a 
regular part of voting. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would especially like to pay tribute to someone who works in 
our House leader's office, Mr. David Prest who first came up with 
this idea back in the last parliament and brought it forward as a 
time saver.  One day, if we were ever to send to Mr. Prest the 
amount of money the House saved by using his original idea for 
applying votes, he could retire a very wealthy man.  My hat goes 
off to him for that initiative. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second issue I would like to address is that of House orders 
or motions which direct a standing committee on how to act.  The 
problem I see is that the House may pass a motion, as it did in 
the last parliament, to create, for example, a victims bill of 
rights, or earlier in this parliament a motion to toughen up the 
drunk driving laws.  Once that motion is passed by the House and 
sent to committee there is no guarantee that it will be dealt 
with or resolved in committee.

<A HREF="#LINKT38"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In both instances just mentioned, the motions were brought 
forward by the Reform Party and were supported by a majority of 
the members of the House.  Yet no action was taken at committee. 
It is for this reason that I recommend that committees be 
required to report to the House on the progress of any order 
given to them by the House within a prescribed number of sitting 
days.  There should not be any open endedness about these.  When 
they are referred to committees, they should have to report back 
by a certain date. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Third, I would like to touch on a specific standing order which 
all parties in this House have spoken against at various times, 
Standing Order 56.  Under this standing order when unanimous 
consent is denied, a minister can move a motion without notice, 
without debate or amendment to suspend the standing orders. 
While 25 members rising in their seats can have that motion 
withdrawn, 25 members is a far cry from unanimous consent. At any 
other time when someone asks for permission to table a piece of 
paper, to put a motion before the House, any one person can stop 
that by saying no to the unanimous consent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Standing Order 56, which gives a minister special power to 
suspend the standing orders, is in my opinion dictatorial and an 
abusive rule.  That is why I recommend that Standing Order 56 be 
deleted when we go through these standing orders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fourth item I want to address is Standing Order 73.  It 
allows the government to designate that a bill be referred to 
committee before second reading.  This process evolved, when I 
was first here, in the 35th parliament.  It has evolved, I do not 
think intentionally, into a shortcut for the government which 
basically restricts one stage of the legislative process to 180 
minutes of debate.  The limiting of debate on any bill should be 
considered on a case by case basis which only the House 
collectively can decide.  This should not be a decision left 
solely to the government which can unilaterally decide to limit 
debate on a bill.  Therefore I recommend that Standing Order 73 
be deleted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During that debate on Standing Order 73 it may be that some 
people will say we need something in there to allow for the 
flexibility of amendments, in other words when amendments can 
come to the House.  If this is the case, that is the only part of 
that standing order that should remain.  If the House decides to 
amend rather than delete this standing order, I would recommend 
there be restrictions on the types of bills that are allowed to 
be considered by Standing Order 73.  In other words, bills based 
on ways and means motions should not be allowed to proceed in 
this fashion.  We do not want to see rules of the House used to 
limit debate.  That is a decision for the House as a whole, not 
for the government side alone. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My fifth point relates to the question and comment period that 
follows most speeches in the House.  Under the current rules the 
most important speakers—it could be argued the most 
important—cannot be questioned in debate.  In other words, if 
the Prime Minister, the Leader of the Opposition or the minister 
sponsoring the bill speaks on the bill, we cannot as members of 
parliament question the minister, the Leader of the Opposition or 
the Prime Minister following their speech.  What may be very 
intriguing or may set the agenda for the entire bill or the day's 
debate, instead of a question and answer and a give and take on 
that very important speech, there is nothing.  We are not allowed 
to have an exchange. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The few times that we have asked for unanimous consent to allow 
that exchange to take place have been some of the best debates in 
the House.  It is between a very knowledgeable minister, a very 
concerned backbencher on one side of the House or the other. That 
give and take has made for some very good dynamics and 
interesting debate in the House. A provision should be introduced 
to allow for questions and comments for those people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, I would like to address the issue of committee reports 
tabled in this House.  The vast majority of these reports are 
never adopted by the House let alone acted on.  The 
accountability of the government with regard to its response to 
committee reports must be improved.  I think of times when 
reports come from the procedure and House affairs committee, a 
committee I sit on.  It may have to do with a question of supply. 
It is tabled in the House.

<A HREF="#LINKT39"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House adopts that it be tabled but there is no vote on 
whether it is concurred in.  In other words, for the folks who 
are watching on TV, if we put a concurrence motion forward, we 
start the debate.  I say I would like to debate the tabling of 
that report and I would like to debate the contents of that 
report.  Here is my motion and away we go.  We can do that.  We 
start the debate.  We give our points of view and maybe one or 
two others do. The government inevitably and repeatedly will get 
up and say it is a nice little debate here, folks, but we move we 
return to the orders of the day.  As soon as the government does 
that, the debate is finished.  Instead of dealing with that 
report, the report instead of becoming a report of the House 
drops to the bottom of the government order paper, not the 
House's order paper. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I say those reports are the property of the House and should be 
dealt with by the House.  It is not right when they are defeated 
like that or a motion to go to government orders occurs that the 
report becomes a government order itself.  That is not a 
government order.  I would argue that is a committee report and 
it is not the property of the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In other words, the procedure where a concurrence motion becomes 
a government order once debate on the motion is concluded should 
be disallowed.  It should come back at another date for further 
debate and a decision by the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government should not have control over this process. That 
is why the further recommendation on that is that the House 
always be permitted to have a free vote on a committee 
concurrence motion, if it is in the interest of the House.  Many 
of those motions are adopted by unanimous consent.  They are 
routine motions and we do not want to tie up the House or the 
voting time of the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will be having a report soon from the procedure and House 
affairs committee again on the referral about the comments of 
some of the members of the House and whether they were 
contemptuous. That will come forward in a report.  It will be 
tabled in the House.  I would like the House to decide on that. 
The report from the committee is one thing but because that was a 
decision of the House to send that to committee there is no 
decision of the House to put it to bed once and for all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We end up with a motion or a report and it just hangs there. 
There is no final determination of what to do with it, whether 
the House supports it or opposes it.  It just sits there 
festering away, waiting for a nice day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those changes would make the House more responsive.  It would 
make it fairer to the House as a whole and not just the 
government side.  I think it would make things quicker and 
therefore cheaper.  It would be better all around for both the 
government and the opposition benches. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK30"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier—Montcalm, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
today's Order Paper provides that we should look at the Standing 
Orders and procedure of the House and its committees. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is, in fact, a very important topic, given the government 
machinery and the legal and financial issues we look at here.  I 
think it is extremely important that parliamentarians be able to 
say what they think about what is going on in the House, and 
especially outside it, in committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What I find unacceptable, however, is that no follow-up has been 
announced. 
Members talk, they talk for the sake of talking here, but I 
would love to see the government propose substantial amendments 
with respect to what goes on in the Parliament of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some of the things that go on here are pretty strange.  One 
example is how committees operate.  Since I have only 10 minutes 
to speak, I would like to focus more specifically on the issue 
of committees. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since 1993, I have had the opportunity to sit on various 
committees, including the Standing Committee on Justice, the 
Standing Committee on Finance, and the Standing Committee on 
Procedure and House Affairs.  Each time, the drill is pretty 
much the same. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is most disgraceful is that, when we look at committee 
minutes, we see that, when the Conservatives were in power, the 
Liberals made remarks about these committees, particularly about 
the way they operated. 
They were critical of the way committees operated, of the time 
allowed the opposition, of the way witnesses were questioned, 
and so on.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now that the Liberals are on the other side of the House, they 
behave exactly the same way, and it is all right. This is the 
way it is supposed to be. Personally, I believe it should not be 
so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Currently, the government has too much influence on directives 
and the way committees work. I believe it is bad, because MPs do 
not feel valued when doing very important work in committee, 
where they can have direct access to ministers and effect 
changes. This is the way it should be in a perfect world, but in 
actual fact this is not the case. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Also, I am taking this opportunity, the first I have had in the 
House, to draw the attention of the Chair to the issue of quorum 
and members who are late for committee sittings. I raised the 
issue this morning in committee because this happens all too 
often. Again this morning we had to wait for Liberal members who 
were late. A committee which was supposed to start at 9 o'clock 
started at 9.25 a.m. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a Bloc Quebecois member from a riding in Quebec I have better 
things to do than wait for Liberals so we can have a quorum in 
committee. I know I am digressing a bit, but if we want to 
improve the way the House operates, government members should at 
least have the decency to arrive on time, especially when they 
have received proper notice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This being said, I will return to the topic at hand, which is 
the recognition of the work done by committee members, among 
other things. 
Even though they do not talk about it any more—and I can 
understand why—the Liberals opposite will certainly remember 
the 1993 red book, which contained a whole chapter on giving MPs 
a greater role in the House and in committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In reality these red book promises were also broken. Do you know 
what is most frustrating for an MP who does his job as a 
committee member? I could give you several examples, but I will 
talk about a specific bill, the firearms bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Standing Committee on Justice and Human Rights heard 
numerous experts and witnesses, worked hard and travelled across 
the country. Individual committee members travelled to various 
municipalities and regions to consult local people. We worked 
very hard to improve the bill. At the time, the Bloc Quebecois 
was the official opposition. This took place during the 35th 
Parliament, but I could also talk about the 36th Parliament. 
In this case, however, it was so obvious as to be a good 
example, in my opinion.  The Bloc Quebecois worked like mad to 
propose a series of amendments to the government.  During the 
hearings, which lasted not two or three days but entire weeks, 
the justice committee heard witnesses and experts of all kinds. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the time came to adopt this bill clause by clause and for 
the official opposition, which was the Bloc Quebecois at that 
time, to submit its amendments, what met our eyes on the other 
side?  Liberals I had never seen hide nor hair of in the justice 
committee, who had no clue what they were doing there 
themselves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They had been given a very precise mandate, however, which was 
to help defeat every opposition amendment, and to get the bill 
through without any changes. 
That bill, on firearms, was highly controversial in all Canadian 
provinces, Quebec included.  The Minister of Justice of the day 
appeared before the committee and we reached agreement on a 
point or two. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1330"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT41"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>But as for the rest, the 45 amendments proposed by the Bloc 
Quebecois, only two or three were accepted, not during the 
committee examination but in negotiations in the parliamentary 
corridors. The Liberals who came just to help push the bill 
through knew nothing about these negotiations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is most deplorable, if one wants to make the work of 
members more relevant.  Members are not here just to say yes or 
no, or to do what a minister tells them to. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Speaking of ministers, another thing that is rather frustrating 
to committee members is what happens when the minister 
responsible for this or that department comes to visit. 
Just yesterday, we had the Minister of Justice come to the 
Committee on Justice and Human Rights to debate her department's 
budget.  What was involved was not $200,000 but millions. For 
the Supreme Court alone, the budget is $14 million. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister comes, grants us a mere two hours, and we are 
supposed to be grateful.  There we are, 15 or 16 MPs with some 
fairly precise rules to follow, and very few concrete answers 
forthcoming from the minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is more, the minister can take up half of the time 
allocated to us, when we still have a question or two to ask 
her.  We ask her to come back, but it is not known when she will 
be able to do so.  The Minister of Justice is a busy woman, and 
all the other ministers are equally busy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I see that my time is almost up, but I think that if we want to 
enhance the contribution made here by members while improving 
the parliamentary system, it is time the government took a good 
hard look at this issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would have liked to say a few words about references made by 
this House in the past, like the last one, which concerned the 
Canadian flag. In that case, which was referred to the Standing 
Committee on Procedure and House Affairs, the decision made in 
this place had already been concocted by the Liberals and the 
Reformers outside this House to stifle the matter as quickly as 
possible. And then, to make themselves look good, they referred 
the matter to the committee, leaving the final decision up to 
members. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It does not work that way. There are things going on behind the 
scenes that the public does not see. 
To ensure that democracy is protected, time has come for 
government members opposite to take their responsibilities and 
perhaps to strike a real committee to look into this whole issue 
and improve the Canadian democratic system. 
<P><A NAME="LINK31"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Denis Coderre (Bourassa, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the purpose of 
today's debate seems to be the collective release of emotions, 
group therapy or the promotion of the existing system. As a 
young member whose experience is not as extensive as that of 
some of his colleagues, I will nonetheless offer a few 
suggestions or at least set forth a number of personal 
observations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of course, the purpose of today's debate is not to call the 
parliamentary system into question. One may not like it, 
complain about the government, and keep saying that committees 
do not operate as they should, but it is important to realize 
one thing: we must work together at enhancing the role of 
members of Parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a price to pay for using British parliamentary rules 
and that is the fact that the government sits in this House, 
which is not the case in the American system. There are pros and 
cons. 
It only makes sense that when the government—that is the 
executive branch—sits in this House with the legislative 
branch, it must have some tools to work with. In politics, we 
use checks and balances. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will not start moaning and say that the situation in 
committees is awful. Oddly enough, things work very well in the 
agriculture and agri-food committee, on which I sit, and in the 
official languages committee. We get along, there is no 
arm-twisting, contrary to what some members may claim, and the 
ministers do not come and tell us what to do. No, that is not 
the way we operate. We understand each other and we operate that 
way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, I want to deal with the role of a member of Parliament 
in the House of Commons. 
In my opinion, it is important to give a greater role to 
backbenchers, not only to members of the opposition parties, but 
also to government members.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Quite often, under the existing procedure on specific issues, 
there is a draw; we put members' names in a hat, and then there 
is a draw to determine which member can introduce a private 
member's bill, but it is a long and frustrating process. I 
understand that there used to be a fast track procedure in 
place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think that if at least 100 members support one of their 
colleagues who wants to introduce a private member's bill, this 
legislation should get priority. 
If several members representing all parties agree on a given 
bill and believe there is a consensus, but not necessarily 
unanimity, I think it would be appropriate to give back more 
power to the lawmakers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All this would, of course, take place in the context of how 
parliament works. Earlier, someone alluded to back room 
dealings, saying how awful they are. We will not play holier 
than thou today, because there are some who can play that game 
really well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we asked members how many of them have read all the Standing 
Orders of the House of Commons, we might be very disappointed. I 
must candidly admit that I did not read them all. It is by 
working here that we learn how this place operates. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remember the late Maurice Bellemare in the National Assembly, 
who became minister after Maurice Duplessis told him to learn 
the code of procedure. Those who know how to take advantage of 
the code of procedure can play a very important role. This is 
the way we should look at things. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of course, the role of a member is to be efficient and 
responsible. However, this can be frustrating at times, 
especially when one feels that the government is taking too much 
space. But, as I mentioned earlier, that is the way the British 
parliamentary system works. We have to accept it and use the 
procedure to find ways to play a role. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In our system, the legislative and the executive are one. 
Therefore, to form the government, it takes a majority. A party 
must have a majority. Thus, Bloc members will always complain 
because they will never form the government. 
But one thing is certain: we are so democratic here that we let 
people say just about anything in the House, and we hear them 
often. Not only are the Bloc members allowed to say anything 
they want, but they leave with the furniture. Some are putting 
together a trousseau and taking the chairs. This is so 
democratic. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is certain is that we have an important role to play. We 
must look into ways to improve operations. Earlier we talked 
about committees. I believe that when everybody is acting in 
good faith and interested in making things run smoothly, we can 
get along. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A case in point is the fisheries and oceans committee, which was 
supposed to enjoy greater autonomy. 
If there are people who still say that the government is 
twisting their arm, I think they should take another look at 
things, and rethink how it works. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we listened to the chair, our friend from Newfoundland, it 
was very clear that he had done his homework.  So, what am I 
saying today?  If we all do our homework, if we learn our 
procedure and how things are supposed to be done, we can achieve 
our goals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now, it is clear that the member, despite everything, may feel 
undervalued.  He feels that way because he sometimes has the 
impression that, as a backbencher or opposition member, he does 
not have direct access to certain things, or he feels that the 
government in power can run the whole show.  I must say that I 
completely disagree. 
A member who does his work well and learns all the basics can 
achieve his goals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Undoubtedly, there are times when we are overloaded.  I myself 
sit on three or four committees.  It is clear that we cannot 
always delve deeper and keep up with everything.  That is when 
it becomes necessary to help each other and to find the best way 
of doing things. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have often, however, discussed the issue of how voting takes 
place.

<A HREF="#LINKT43"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I must admit that I find it a bit tiresome when one person rises 
and calls for a recorded vote.  As long as we agree to either 
support or reject a motion, the whip usually says that, with the 
unanimous consent of the House, the members will vote for or 
against. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is clear that a member is not most effective when he must 
rise each time.  Furthermore, it is clear that the whole issue 
of electronic voting has been the subject of numerous 
discussions, but sight must not be lost of the role the member 
plays by taking part. 
Taking the floor time after time on the same subject, whether on 
the amendments or something else, is an enormous waste of very 
precious time. For us, time is precious, and I agree with the 
hon. member for Berthier—Montcalm on that.  Our time is valuable, 
and sometimes there are other things we need to be doing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yet again, I am soft-pedalling it here because democracy is what 
this is all about.  Respect for the institutions and traditions 
has made the country work.  Compared to other countries, we 
probably have one of the best parliamentary systems in the 
world.  That is why we need to be very prudent.  We can make 
some improvements, adjust certain rules, but it is unthinkable 
to question the entire parliamentary system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our viewers must not be given the impression that it is not 
working, and that some shocking things are going on. 
On the contrary, I think we can give ourselves good marks.  The 
MPs are doing a good job, and they have the capacity to assume a 
vital role and to represent their constituents well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In terms of changes to the standing orders, as I have said, I do 
not have the experience my colleagues do, as I was elected less 
than a year ago, but it is clear from all of the debates that 
have gone on since the beginning, on all manner of subjects, 
that if MPs had more opportunity on the issue of bills, that 
might be worthwhile. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we could enhance the role of members by improving certain 
aspects of private members' business, that might prove equally 
worthwhile. 
As for motions, if a little more time were available, not Friday 
afternoon or some evening in the week, and if we could address 
them in “prime time”, as they say, that too might be worthwhile. 
I believe that in this context changes need to be made. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am, however, offended that a good system continually in use is 
still constantly being questioned, so that once again the 
impression is given that the institution is being devalued.  I 
am therefore calling upon my colleagues to be very prudent.  The 
baby must not be thrown out with the bath water, nor the 
building demolished just because the roof leaks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have a good system and I think we can still do good work, 
with a proper knowledge of things and perhaps a few small 
improvements.  But, please, let us not devalue the institution.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I begin by 
apologizing for my voice.  I became hoarse by attending a trade 
fair.  I stood listening to the people of Elk Island for so many 
hours that at the end of the day, from listening so much, I was 
hoarse.  However, I will try to do my best. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the few minutes I have available I would like to address two 
items.  I could probably go on for a whole hour if I were given 
the opportunity but I want to address but two items. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first one has to do with standing orders regarding the 
elections of the chairman of a committee.  On this item my issue 
is really quite short.  It is very succinct.  The way we elect 
the chairman and the vice-chairman of a committee right now is 
totally inadequate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For those people in the gallery or watching on television who do 
not know how this works, most of the time when there is an 
election to a position we accept nominations. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1345"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT45"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT45"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1345

<A HREF="#LINKT44"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, in an ordinary meeting one would ask if there are 
any nominations.  Whoever is in that group can stand up and 
nominate whomever they want.  When the list is complete, either 
by secret ballot, by show of hands or however it is decided, the 
people will choose from the list the candidates they want. 
However, it is just not done that way in the committees here in 
the House of Commons, but it ought to be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The way it is done here is that a person proposes a motion and 
moves the name of a member to be the chairman.  The motion is put 
to a vote and when it is decided that is the end of it.  The 
other people do not even get a chance to have their names put on 
the list. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I have observed, what happens is that normally the first 
person to be recognized is a person from the government side. 
That may be appropriate, but it does not allow for any other 
names to be on the list.  Therefore, instead of having a true 
choice here, it looks as if this is all orchestrated in advance 
and members are merely going through a charade in order to 
confirm what has already been decided in the back rooms.  This is 
not good enough. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What I would like to see happen is that the clerk, who is the 
temporary chairperson of the first meeting of a committee, would 
recognize whomever wants to make a nomination and then keep on 
going until all the nominations are in.  I know that in any 
committee I have been in not everyone wants to accept the 
nomination.  In this process they would have to be asked if they 
are ready to accept the nomination and, if they are, they are put 
on the list. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This list could be easily done by putting the names on a board 
or whatever and then everyone could just vote by number in a 
secret ballot.  The ballots would be counted and the results 
would be announced.  This, to me, is so simple.  It would be the 
right way of doing it, as opposed to the way it is done here 
where, by and large, everybody gets herded into the corral and 
prodded with an electric prod as to what they should do or say. I 
think this method would offer a lot more freedom and would be a 
more democratic choice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It could be that a government member will still win.  I expect 
most of the time that would happen because by the composition of 
our committees the majority of the members of the committee are 
on the government side.  However, sometimes we miss the use of 
the talent of very good people who happen to be in one of the 
opposition parties who would probably do a very good job. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Maybe it would not be such a bad idea to empower more members of 
parliament than just those who happen to be on that side who have 
more colleagues than the other guys.  A party becomes government 
by having more of its colleagues win. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is my first point.  The second point that I want to address 
today is the issue of private members' business.  I have really 
become distressed with private members' business.  I will concede 
that government bills are not unimportant, many are very 
important.  However, I have observed that some of the best ideas, 
those ideas which more accurately reflect the wishes of the 
constituents out there, come from the people who make us hoarse 
from listening to them at trade fairs and other places. These are 
the ideas which are brought to the House by a member of 
parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member of parliament may agree with his or her constituent's 
idea and decide to put it in a private member's bill.  Lo and 
behold, the member does that and it now becomes a process almost 
as unlikely as that of winning the lottery in Canada:  Will this 
bill ever get passed?  A private member's bill has to pass many 
hurdles and some are formidable.  I will admit, having a House 
with 301 members, that it is not practicable for each member to 
have a bill every session.  It would take an awful lot of 
debating time. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1350"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT45"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, I really believe that the standing orders should be 
changed so that much more of the grassroots work that comes from 
our ridings is at least considered in this place where we can 
debate the issues and actually vote on them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I find it particularly offensive when I look at the way private 
members' business works now.  I will accept the lottery draw. 
For those who may not be informed, when we have so many members 
of parliament, a large number of them choose to submit private 
members' business, either a bill or a motion, and that is 
figuratively put into a pail and then they draw the names of the 
people who have submitted bills and motions.  It is a random 
draw.  They choose 30 such items to start with and then replenish 
from time to time as the list is used up. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It may be a very good issue, but if it is not drawn it will 
never be debated.  I do not really know a practical way of 
overcoming that, except that I would like to see the standing 
orders changed to provide more time for private members' business 
so that more of these issues can be brought to the House of 
Commons for debate and vote. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In any case, once they are drawn, that assures one hour of 
debate.  If it is a very good issue and it is drawn, the member 
will say  “Whoopee, my bill got drawn.  We get to debate it in 
the House of Commons”.  They will stand in the House of Commons 
and some of their colleagues on both sides of the House will 
discuss the pros and cons and, in the end, they will say, “That 
was a great time.  Let's go home.  It is the end of private 
members' business”.  There is no vote on it.  The only ones that 
get a vote are the ones which pass the next, almost impossible, 
hurdle and that is the hurdle of being approved by a so-called 
all party non-biased committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here again many good motions and bills are passed over because 
the people on that committee, for whatever reason, think “We 
should not really let the other members vote on this”.  I know 
it is a time constraint because we do have a rule that there be 
two full hours of debate on a bill that is going to be voted on, 
but I would rather have half as many bills and have them come to 
a vote and at least give that individual member the pride of 
going back to his riding and saying, “I really tried”.  But to 
just come with that idea or notion, make it into a lottery, not 
even get it voted on, really gives an empty feeling to an 
important issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am talking about important things like concurrent sentencing. 
I am talking about things like Income Tax Act revisions which are 
so important and which the government just never gets around to. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, not only have you given me the signal that my time 
is up, but as you can hear, my voice is starting to say it is 
time for me once again to listen.  So I will sit down and do 
that. 
<P><A NAME="LINK33"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
seeing the clock I assume I will deliver half of my speech before 
question period and the balance after. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the 1985 report to the House with regard to reform there was 
a quote which I would like to read into the record.  It states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The purpose of reform of the House of Commons in 1985 is to 
restore to private members an effective legislative function, to 
give them a meaningful role in the formation of public policy 
and, in so doing, to restore the House of Commons to its rightful 
place in the Canadian political process. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe that ideal, that objective, still is applicable today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A number of members have commented on the process that private 
members' bills go through.  I would like to deal with the issue 
of private members' bills in the time allotted to me. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have had some success in terms of dealing with private 
members' bills.  If I look back at the record of the 35th 
Parliament, I submitted eight bills, five of which made it 
through the lottery.  One item was made votable and one in fact 
passed at second reading. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1355"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT47"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT47"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1355

<A HREF="#LINKT46"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also had four private member's motions, all of which were 
selected in the lottery.  Two were made votable and both passed 
in this House.  Based on that, I know that I have had more than 
my share of opportunity to bring issues before the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But there is the other side of the coin.  There are many members 
of parliament who have worked many hours to bring forward issues 
that are important to themselves, to their constituents and, by 
and large, to Canadians as a whole.  Many of those bills do not 
see the light of day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The process that we have, a lottery, is basically a game of 
chance.  I wonder in terms of the importance of issues of the day 
whether we should leave the fate of those issues simply to chance 
in a lottery.  I am not a fan of the lottery process.  In fact, I 
believe, as I see from the reform that has taken place in the 
House of Commons over the years, that a call for more efficiency 
within the House seems to be the order of the day.  I for one, as 
a member of parliament, do not want to be in this place less.  I 
want to be in this place more.  I want to hear what members have 
to say.  I want to hear their ideas.  I want to hear what 
rationalization they have. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All of us cannot be up on all issues.  All of us cannot be 
sensitive to the issues, regional issues and local issues.  We 
learn from each other in this place.  What has happened is that 
we have basically restricted the opportunities that members have 
to bring those issues forward. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All members of the House will know that when we go to committee 
there are witnesses who appear before us.  The presentations of 
the witnesses are helpful and informative, but by far the most 
important part of those hearings is the question and answer 
period.  That is where the dynamics take place.  That is where we 
find out what the weaknesses are.  That is where we find out 
where the strengths are.  That is where we find out the most 
important information that we need to know to do our job. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe the same kind of principle should apply to private 
members' business.  When I conclude my remarks after question 
period I am going to make a case as to why we should also have 
questions and comments on private members' business in the House 
of Commons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  I see, my colleague, that you received my 
signal for one minute left.  You have approximately six minutes

</I></B></P><P align=left>My three grown children are trying very hard to accept the fact 
mom is not the same.  She does not smile or laugh as often as she 
used to.  They do not want to talk about the fact that I am 
dying.  I stare at our two beautiful grandchildren and wonder if 
I will live to see them grow up.  I look into my husband's eyes 
and I know that he is afraid of the future.  My husband and I 
have worked so hard, and raised our family, and now it was 
supposed to be our time together.  But, the almost unbearable 
fatigue that I deal with prevents us from going very far or doing 
very much together.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr.

Mr. Speaker, a communist ombudsman is a contradiction in terms.

less concerned about embarrassing Castro than he was about 
freedom and human rights. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Will we see the Prime Minister on television, not glad handing

another major tragedy in Canada by saying who would pay for

which made those breast implants will pay for them.  There are 
ongoing lawsuits.  We do not want to hear this foolish, feeble 
argument any longer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Will the health minister admit publicly that this was a major 
public tragedy in Canada caused by the federal regulators who 
distributed poisonous blood? 
<P><A NAME="LINK81"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
the member cannot escape the larger point.  Whether it is breast 
implants, whether it is pharmaceutical products that caused death 
or other damage, the broader question is at what point does the 
state have a responsibility to pay cash compensation to those who 
are injured because of risks inherent in medical procedures or 
medical devices.  That is a very large question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The ministers of health of Canada, all of them from all 
governments of all stripes, in a very unusual move were unanimous 
in saying that in this particular tragedy in the years 1986 to 
1990 when something could have been done, that is the period when 
compensation should be paid. 
<P><A NAME="LINK82"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Grant Hill (Macleod, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the 
minister says when should the government pay.  The answer is when 
the government is responsible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have here a minister who is hanging on to this legal argument 
as though it were a thread, and that is all he has.  The truth of 
the matter is insurance pays for medical mishaps, but this was no 
accident.  There was incompetence and negligence on behalf of the 
federal regulators. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Will the minister just acknowledge that this was not a medical 
accident? 
<P><A NAME="LINK83"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
the member belittles the legal analysis and then he proceeds to 
create it by talking about negligence and fault. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member illustrates the difficulty of the question because if 
in fact governments are going to pay for that for which they are 
responsible through fault, then indeed the ministers of health 
are right in saying the period 1986 to 1990 is the period during 
which compensation should be offered. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before that hepatitis non-A, non-B, which is what it was called,

yesterday I asked the Minister of Health to show greater 
compassion and to compensate all individuals infected with

Unfortunately, the minister did not follow up on my request. 
Therefore, my question today is for the Prime Minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since the government is looking at a surplus of several billions 
of dollars for 1997-98, does the Prime Minister not think that it 
gives him more flexibility to show compassion and to compensate

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
this is an issue that we have been discussing for a long time in 
this House. The federal government and all the provincial health 
ministers, including the one from Quebec, came to the conclusion 
that, in terms of public interest, the period selected was the 
one for which the public sector had a responsibility. All the 
governments in Canada collectively decided to compensate 
victims, as advocated in the proposal that was approved by all 
health ministers. 
<P><A NAME="LINK86"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier—Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, we 
are not criticizing the agreement reached with the provincial 
governments. Provincial governments will be responsible for 
health care services to these victims, and they have done more 
than their fair share, given the cuts made to transfer payments 
by the federal government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A while ago, the government did not hesitate to compensate all 
those infected with the HIV virus as a result of blood 
transfusions. Now, it refuses to do the same for those infected 
with hepatitis C. Is it not eminently unfair and arbitrary to 
act like this? Is it because the number of HIV victims is much 
lower than the number of people infected with hepatitis C? 
<P><A NAME="LINK87"></A></P>

for the Prime Minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This government obviously has a problem.  It cannot get its

</I></B></P><P align=left>How can the Prime Minister justify his government's decision to

used submarines, just to keep the military happy, but not to

these, Prime Minister? 
<P><A NAME="LINK89"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the 100,000 Canadians who, starting in the year 2000, 
will receive millennium scholarships to pursue their education

very good priorities.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, our 
priorities in this matter are shared by Quebec's Minister of 
Health and the Government of Quebec.  We shared the position 
expressed in the agreement.  We agreed with all ministers, all 
provincial, territorial and federal governments that, for us, 
the priority is to maintain the public health system in Canada, 
and therefore to compensate only those who contracted the 
illness during the period between 1986 and 1990, during which 
time the governments were responsible.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it is pretty clear that the leader of the NDP does not 
like Canadian banks. That is very clear. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to ask a question.  It occurred to me the other 
day, when the NDP government in British Columbia was the only 
government, either provincial or federal, to reduce the taxes 
imposed on the banks in its last budget, the question which 
crossed my mind was, is the NDP government in British Columbia of 
the same party that the one the leader heads? 
<P><A NAME="LINK97"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Scott Brison (Kings—Hants, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the 
Minister of Finance said “the decision on the bank mergers will 
be made by this government, by this Parliament and by the 
Canadian people”. It seems to the Canadian people that the 
Liberal lobbyists and the Liberal sheep over there will decide 
this issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the minister is truly sincere, will he ask the finance 
committee to begin immediate hearings right now to give Canadians 
the access they deserve? 
<P><A NAME="LINK98"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I would simply point out the difference between the 
Liberal members on this side and the Tory members on that side. 
The Liberal members on this side set up a caucus task force some 
time ago. They have gone from coast to coast.  They have had 
hearings on the mergers. They are in the process of putting 
together a very insightful and important opinion.  At the same 
time the members of the Conservative Party have sat there.  They 
have made speeches but they have not done one darn thing. 
<P><A NAME="LINK99"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Scott Brison (Kings—Hants, PC):</B> Mr. Speaker, the PC 
caucus believes that all members in this House deserve access, 
that all Canadians deserve access and that it should not be 
discussed in the back rooms of the Liberal caucus behind closed 
doors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why will the Liberal Minister of Finance not bring this bank 
merger issue out of the Liberal back rooms and into the open? 
Will he ask the finance committee to study this issue beginning 
immediately before the House adjourns for the summer? 
<P><A NAME="LINK100"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, those hearings by the Liberal caucus task force were in 
Vancouver and they were in public.  They were in Peterborough and 
they were in public.  They were in Winnipeg and they were in 
public. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact is that the Liberal members of parliament are preparing 
themselves for the finance committee hearings which are going to 
be held in September.  The only question is, what is the Tory 
party doing apart from speaking to a couple of its banking 
friends on Bay Street?

<P><A NAME="LINK102"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Maurice Vellacott (Wanuskewin, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, a 
captain wanted to lighten his ship's load so on a stormy day he 
warned that the ship would sink unless some men were thrown 
overboard.  Gripped with fear the crew turned on each other and 
as a result several were lost. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The health minister warns that compensating all hepatitis C 
victims will sink the entire medicare ship.  He is deliberately 
creating fear in Canadians so they will be willing to sacrifice 
fellow Canadians who have hepatitis C. How can he use such an 
unethical public relations ploy?  How can he sink so low? 
<P><A NAME="LINK103"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
it is not very often that we find unanimity among all the 
governments in Canada on one issue, let alone an issue as 
difficult as this one.  All the governments in Canada agreed on 
the public policy question of compensation for hepatitis C 
victims.  It was not easy.  It is a tough issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member does not paint it correctly when he describes it 
as he did.  It is a very broad question of just where the state's 
role is in paying cash compensation to people who are harmed 
through the health system, through medical procedures which all 
inherently carry risk. I urge the hon. member— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  The hon. member for Wanuskewin. 
<P><A NAME="LINK104"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Maurice Vellacott (Wanuskewin, Ref.):</B> There is a big 
difference, Mr. Speaker, between accidents, negligence and what 
has occurred in this particular instance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberal Party presents itself as the party that promotes 
Canadian unity and sharing and community, but that is not the 
truth.  At the very first sight of choppy waters it is pitting 
the majority of Canadians against hepatitis C victims. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why is this government attempting to orchestrate a second 
assault on these victims by trying to turn their own friends and 
neighbours against them? 
<P><A NAME="LINK105"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the hon. member speaks as though this was a unilateral act by 
this government.  In fact it was a decision shared in by all 
governments, indeed Progressive Conservative governments among 
them. 
The Government of Prince Edward Island, the Government of 
Ontario, the Government of Manitoba, the Progressive Conservative 
Government of Alberta all agreed that this is the appropriate 
approach.

<P><A NAME="LINK107"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Maud Debien (Laval East, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, my question is 
for the Prime Minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For some time now, the Mexican government has been expelling all 
foreign observers from Chiapas, among them two Quebec women.  As 
a result, the Minister of Foreign Affairs called for 
explanations from the Mexican government, and those explanations 
were totally unconvincing.  For the Prime Minister, the incident 
is closed, but at the same time the Minister of Foreign Affairs 
is proposing the creation of an international commission of 
inquiry into the human rights situation in Chiapas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since the Prime Minister was insisting that human rights be on 
the agenda of the Summit of the Americas, can he tell us what 
exactly the Canadian position is on this matter? 
<P><A NAME="LINK108"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
have discussed this problem with the President of Mexico.  He 
explained that the persons expelled had not complied with the 
laws of that country, and that all foreigners were obliged to 
leave under the circumstances. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Foreign Affairs and myself insisted that work on 
this matter continue.  We even offered the Mexicans the 
possibility of sending a delegation of Canadian 
parliamentarians, and we hope they will accept our proposal. 
<P><A NAME="LINK109"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Maud Debien (Laval East, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, what is the 
logic behind the Minister of Foreign Affairs and the Canadian 
government's desire to create another commission of inquiry, 
when the Canadian representatives on the international civilian 
commission dispatched to Chiapas have been trying to meet with 
him for more than a month now? 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK110"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, the logic is very evident.  A group of 
parliamentarians representing the broad base of Canadian citizens 
would be able to provide this House and the government with an 
accurate and objective assessment of the conditions that are 
taking place in Mexico.  It would be done in a way that would 
enable it to be shared entirely in an open public way without the 
kinds of question marks that relate to the past incident.

have the very real spectre of less banking choices in the 
immediate future for Canadians.  The finance minister is hiding 
behind his task force report hoping the whole issue will go away. 
It is not going to go away and frankly, Canadians deserve an 
answer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our position is very clear: no mergers without competition. What 
is the minister's position anyway?  Does he even have one or do 
we have to wait for him to phone Matthew Barrett, John Cleghorn 
and Charlie Baillie to find out what the position is? 
<P><A NAME="LINK113"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, it is very important to understand the role of the task 
force. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Essentially there are very great changes, globalization, 
technological changes affecting all of the financial services 
industry.  The task force is looking at the evolution of that. It 
is also looking at the insurance industry.  It is looking at the 
roles of credit unions. The task force is putting together the 
context within which the debate in this House and across the 
country will take place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If what the hon. member really wants is to have competition and 
to have a public debate, what he should be prepared to do is 
support the submission of the task force and the debate that will 
follow therefrom. 
<P><A NAME="LINK114"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the 
minister said watches, but they are doing nothing.  It is like 
watching paint dry, frankly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Ordinary Canadians are terrified of what these mergers will mean 
to them and their businesses.  The banks have the shareholders 
speaking up for them, the lobbyists.  They even have high profile 
Liberals speaking up for them, but it is a one-sided 
conversation.  The Minister of Finance is mute on this. Why will 
he not stand up for Canadians and let them know that they are 
always going to have some options?  Why will he not stand up for 
competition? 
<P><A NAME="LINK115"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B>  Mr.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I would simply point out to the hon. member that while the banks 
and other interests may well have Reformers or NDPers standing up 
for them, the Canadian people have this government standing up 
for them.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lorne Nystrom (Qu'Appelle, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, my 
question is to the Minister of Finance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the minister knows, about 30,000 people will lose their jobs 
if the two mega mergers go ahead.  The MacKay task force is not 
looking specifically at jobs.  The Competition Bureau is not 
looking specifically at jobs.  About 30,000 jobs represents the 
size of a small city.  It is no small matter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to ask the minister, in light of that fact, that there is 
no consideration of job loss, is the minister not now convinced 
that we should start immediately with an all party parliamentary 
committee so that people can have their say about job losses in 
this country? 
<P><A NAME="LINK139"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, the government has made it very clear that it is very 
concerned about jobs.  When the final decision is made that will 
certainly enter into the consideration, as well as a number of 
other issues, including competition, service to the consumers of 
urban and rural Canada and the overall state of the financial 
sector industry in this country. 
<P><A NAME="LINK140"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lorne Nystrom (Qu'Appelle, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the 
minister is just saying “watch us”.  I want to know whether or 
not the minister is really getting what I am getting at. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There will be about 30,000 jobs lost.  What does he have against 
letting the people of this country have their say now?  Give the 
people of this country a platform to speak through an all party 
parliamentary committee.  That is what parliamentarians are 
elected for.  That is what parliamentary democracy is about.  Why 
is he afraid of doing that now?  Give the people a chance to 
speak. 
<P><A NAME="LINK141"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B>  Mr.

fact, we intend to do exactly what the hon. member suggests. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, we will do it according to this government's and this

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
that is not what the Minister of Health said at all.  What the 
Minister of Health said is that if we look at the tough question 
of when should governments pay cash compensation to those who 
are injured by risks inherent in the medical system, then you are 
approaching a difficult question of public policy.  Thirteen 
governments agreed on that question of public policy, that in 
this instance they should pay for the period during which 
governments could have done something to change the outcome. 
Governments could have acted and did not during those four years 
from 1986-1990.  That is why we chose that period.  It is a very 
broad question beyond that as to whether everyone harmed should 
be compensated.

<P><A NAME="LINK182"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
rise on a question of privilege with regard to a news release put 
out by the Minister for International Trade on March 30, 1998 
entitled “Marchi meets with Chinese leaders in Beijing and 
announces Canada-China Interparliamentary Group”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister announced in his release: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>International Trade Minister today took part in a series of 
bilateral meetings with senior Chinese leaders and announced the 
establishment of the Canada-China Interparliamentary Group. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no Canada-China interparliamentary group.  There has 
been an application to the joint interparliamentary council to 
establish such a group, but contrary to the minister's perceived 
powers and authority in these matters there is no such 
interparliamentary group until parliament grants such status to 
that group, and that has not happened to date. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have made proposals in committee to revamp parliamentary 
associations to include a greater emphasis on the Asia-Pacific 
countries and on the Americas.  However, none of the changes that 
the minister has proposed or that I might have proposed has ever 
come to pass. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the Canada-China friendship group to advance to the status 
of interparliamentary group it must first apply to the Joint 
interparliamentary Council.  It then must get approval from the 
House through the Board of Internal Economy and the internal 
economy committee of the Senate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister has given the impression that this association will 
be sanctioned and funded by parliament.  I find this to be a 
clear contempt of the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Just to go through a few precedents, Mr. Speaker, the member for 
Calgary—Nosehill brought a similar matter to your attention on 
February 26, 1998.  She complained about an article in the 
Toronto <I>Star</I> naming the head of the Canadian millennium 
scholarship foundation.  Her complaint was not who was named but 
the circumstances which led to the announcement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In that case there was no legislation before the House setting 
up the said foundation.  Nor was the budget statement containing 
the suggestion to set up the foundation adopted.  She argued that 
the situation had brought the authority and dignity of the 
Speaker and the House into question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The precedents are many regarding this issue.  The government 
and its departments are continuously mocking the parliamentary 
system in this manner.  The member for Prince George—Peace River 
raised a similar matter regarding the Canadian Wheat Board on 
February 3, 1998.  During that discussion the member for 
Langley—Abbotsford pointed out that the Speaker was asked to 
rule on a similar complaint in March 1990 regarding a pamphlet 
about the GST. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I made a case on October 28, 1997.  In that instance the 
Department of Finance started to take action before the bill 
authorizing the department to act was passed by the House.  I was 
concerned at that time that these actions undercut the authority 
of parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Your ruling on that question of privilege has been repeated time 
and time again, Mr. Speaker, and I will repeat it once more.  The 
Chair said on November 6, 1997: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—the Chair acknowledges that this matter is a matter of 
potential importance since it touches the role of members as 
legislators, a role which should not be trivialized.  It is from 
this perspective that the actions of the Department are of some 
concern.  The dismissive view of the legislative process, 
repeated often enough, makes a mockery of our parliamentary 
conventions and practices.  I trust that today's decision at this 
early stage of the 36th Parliament will not be forgotten by the 
minister and his officials and that the department and agencies 
will be guided by it.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I would argue that these accumulated complaints, left 
unchallenged, will only continue to give the impression that 
parliament is irrelevant and that the cabinet and its bureaucrats 
run our lives.  This I find to be an offence against our 
authority and dignity in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Cabinet has no role to play in setting up interparliamentary 
groups.  The process is clearly outlined in a document titled 
“Parliamentary Exchanges Policy” adopted by the Board of 
Internal Economy in January 1990.  That document makes absolutely 
no reference to cabinet's authority in the matter of setting up 
interparliamentary groups. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members of cabinet have no right to presuppose if parliament is 
to accept any suggestion put forward by them including 
legislation and the spending of taxpayers' money.  Parliament 
must not be seen as some sort of obstacle that the bureaucrats 
must overcome. Parliament must be respected if we are to function 
in this place. Parliament must not be taken for granted by a 
minister who is looking for a press release or a headline in a 
foreign country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe the House must conclude that the minister and his 
department are in contempt by their actions.  Mr. Speaker, I ask 
that you rule this matter to be a prima facie question of 
privilege, at which time I will be prepared to move the 
appropriate motion. 
<P><A NAME="LINK183"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg—Transcona, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I rise on the same question of privilege.  I thank the hon. 
member for raising the matter.  It is a serious matter that a 
minister of the crown should take it upon himself to announce the 
existence of an interparliamentary group. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This concern is twofold.  First, there is the question of 
process and whether the minister has any right to do so.  I would 
submit, along with the hon. Reform whip, that the minister had no 
right to do so.  I was part of discussions prior to minister's 
departure for China, along with other parliamentarians from all 
parties, about the advisability of trying to go beyond what 
exists now in terms of the Canada-China friendship group and what 
that might be called. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was concerned and I expressed my concern at the meeting I was 
invited to that not only might it be wrong for the minister to 
announce the existence of such a group, but it is obvious the 
concerns I expressed at that time about the appropriateness of 
calling it an interparliamentary group were also ignored. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the traditions of the House with respect to parliamentary 
associations is that parliamentary associations are associations 
between parliaments.  There is no way whatever one thinks of 
communist China that one can maintain that it has a parliament in 
any sense of the word that we have a parliament. In fact in other 
parliamentary associations we have had countries expelled or 
temporarily suspended because they did not have a parliament that 
met Canadian standards of what a parliament was. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the concerns I expressed at the meeting to which I was 
invited was that we were to have some kind of elevated level of 
exchange with China, which I was not absolutely against but was 
concerned as to what we called it.  I did not want it to be named 
in such a way as to call into question the very important 
tradition in the House of only having parliamentary associations 
between parliaments.  We could call it legislative exchange or 
any number of things.  Certainly there are legislators in China. 
How they are elected and whether it is a one party state and all 
those kinds of things do not take away from that fact, but 
whether or not we should call it an interparliamentary group is a 
very serious matter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister is to be doubly condemned, first, for doing it 
without the permission of parliament and, second, for not having 
the sensitivity to call it something other than an 
interparliamentary group. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It just goes to show, Mr. Speaker, that it appears that they are 
willing to breach any principle, to destroy any tradition we 
might have had in the name of trade.  It does not matter any 
more. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The communist Chinese leadership said it wanted an association, 
the equivalent of what we had with the United States.  The old 
Canadian ministers were over there just doing exactly what was 
required of them.  No matter what parliamentary process or 
traditions of parliamentary associations, if that is what the 
Chinese want they will just give it to them because they will do 
anything.  They will kiss anything in order to get more trade. 
That is what this amounts to.  The government will kiss anything, 
anywhere of anybody in order to get more trade and stomp all over 
parliamentary procedure and a strong parliamentary tradition 
about democracies and parliaments.  What for?  So they could 
please their masters in Beijing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is disgusting, Mr. Speaker, and I think you should rule it a 
contempt of parliament.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Derek Lee (Scarborough—Rouge River, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I want to say a few words on this matter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was surprised to hear the statement involving this news story. 
I always regret it as a parliamentarian when matters are brought 
to my attention through the media as opposed to the usual 
procedures here in this House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to say two things.  First, if it is a fact that a 
minister or a ministry acted in a way that would pre-empt a 
decision of this House, prejudge what the House would wish to do, 
prejudge what our parliamentary associations would wish to do, 
then that would be wrong and it would be a matter for concern 
here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a member, I cannot tell for sure all of the precise facts. 
However I want to make it clear, and I hope all members feel the 
same way, that it is simply not the place of a ministry or a 
minister to pre-empt and prejudge this House.  Not only is it 
disrespectful of the House but many members in this House are 
active in the trade and international relations envelope.  I for 
one have an interest in the Pacific Rim as do many members in 
this House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One runs the risk of embarrassing colleagues when things like 
this happen.  If some of us happen to be out in the field and we 
hear that a ministry is doing something purporting to act for the 
House, this would be wrong if it has occurred in that way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second thing I would leave with you, Mr. Speaker, is that if 
the minister's or ministry's announcement in China was more to 
the effect that it was the intention of parliamentarians here to 
set up and create an association or group such as that noted in 
the article, that would not be quite so bad as announcing that in 
fact the thing was to be done or that it was already done. 
<P><A NAME="LINK185"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Randy White (Langley—Abbotsford, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I want to support the comments that have been made which came 
from three different parties basically. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The real question is how many times is this really going to go 
on. I want to remind you, Mr. Speaker, of your own words in this 
House.  I am going to spend a little bit of time on this because 
there is a certain amount of frustration gathering among many 
members in this House on these types of decisions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, I want to remind you of your own words on November 
6.  You said that this dismissive view repeated often enough 
makes a mockery of our parliamentary conventions and practices. 
You concluded by saying that you trusted that your decision at 
that early stage of this parliament would not be forgotten by 
ministers and their officials and that the departments and 
agencies will be guided by that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I challenge you, Mr. Speaker, to determine how often is often 
enough in this House.  Are you not as offended as we are that 
parliament is mocked in this way time and time again?  This is at 
least the third time in this parliament that this has come up. My 
colleagues and I are getting a little tired of quoting these 
words because we are beginning to wonder if they mean anything at 
all to the government.  After all, that is what we are all here 
for.  Our words must count for something. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Having said that, I recognize that without the authority of this 
House, your words, Mr. Speaker, really do not have authority do 
they?  Without our support the Speaker's power and authority are 
limited.  I do not think we should let our institution and our 
Speaker twist in the wind on this issue any longer.  I say let us 
back up the words of our Speaker this time with some teeth.  Let 
us show those teeth and if necessary, let us bite a few 
bureaucrats and ministers with those teeth.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The last time I addressed this issue I quoted from Joseph 
Maingot's <I>Parliamentary Privilege in Canada</I>, page 221 and I 
wish to do so again.  It describes a prima facie case of 
privilege in the parliamentary sense as one where the evidence on 
its face as outlined by the member is sufficiently strong for the 
House to be asked to debate the matter and to send it to a 
committee to investigate whether the privileges of the House have 
been breached or contempt has occurred. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe that the case brought forward by the member for Prince 
George—Peace River on February 3 represented another incremental 
affront on the House and the case for a prima facie contempt of 
parliament against the ministers and their departments had 
reached a flash point at that time.  If the situation had reached 
a flash point on February 3, it caught fire on February 26 in the 
House when the member for Calgary—Nose Hill brought up another 
complaint regarding the millennium fund. Today if we do not take 
action we are at risk of being burnt to the ground and the mace 
melted into a pane of brass.  The cabinet and its bureaucrats 
will have won and the members of this place will have lost the 
final battle. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, I sincerely urge you to allow the member to move 
his motion so we can end this mockery of parliament.  This cannot 
go on any longer.  If it continues to go like this, we will be up 
time and time again in the House.  At some point the Speaker has 
got to put some teeth into this issue. 
<P><A NAME="LINK186"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bob Kilger (Stormont—Dundas, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
want to put on the record that I understand that the minister of 
course was the author of the announcement in question.  I will be 
brief and succinct.  Whatever decision you deem would be the 
correct one, not having been the author of course I cannot be the 
person who would be somewhat admonished, but possibly I might be 
as responsible and maybe even more responsible than the author, 
the minister in question, on this particular issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a member of that body, the Joint Interparliamentary Council, 
which deals with these issues, I am privy to the discussions. 
From time to time, as my colleagues probably do likewise, I make 
estimates, judgments as to where they might go. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will have to stand on my record in terms of respect for the 
institution, the chair and for my individual colleagues. Whatever 
I might have contributed to this matter I will accept my 
responsibilities.  However, I am certainly totally confident that 
there was never any intent, my own, the minister's or the 
government's, to be disrespectful in any way of this institution. 
If in fact I erred in my judgment, I will accept the 
responsibilities and the admonishment of the chair. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My peers, without commenting on the technical aspects of the 
issue raised by my esteemed colleague from the New Democratic 
Party, the member for Winnipeg Transcona, as to parliamentary 
associations and what that in itself can bring through a debate, 
that remains to be seen.  Clearly, Mr. Speaker, to be quite frank 
and honest with you and with my peers and colleagues of the 
House, I could possibly be more responsible than the author 
himself on this issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Chuck Strahl:</B>  Mr. Speaker, on the same issue I could 
add to what I said earlier that I do have a copy of the press 
release of March 30.  It is my first opportunity to go through 
the press release and bring a copy here today. I would be 
prepared to table it if you would like me to do so at this time.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  My colleagues, as you know, I take all 
questions of privilege very seriously in this House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I address myself specifically to the member for Fraser Valley. 
Did I understand the hon. member to say that this particular 
matter was to have gone through the JIC, the Joint 
Interparliamentary Council, and then it was to go to the Board of 
Internal Economy?  Did I understand the hon. member to say that? 
Could he address himself just to those two questions I have. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Chuck Strahl:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the document that I have, 
which is the appendix from the Board of Internal Economy about 
how we establish these associations if we decide to establish a 
new one, is quite explicit.  It does not include the cabinet in 
any way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are two things I would like to underline here, that after 
a probation period of at least two years an ad hoc parliamentary 
exchange group which has already been established be given the 
opportunity to become a friendship group, and after a further 
probationary period this friendship group be allowed to apply to 
the advisory council, which has now been updated to the Joint 
Interparliamentary Council, to become a parliamentary 
association, and that the proposal for the funding for that be 
submitted to the Board of Internal Economy. In other words, it 
has to go through that process, I believe.  None of that has 
happened to date. 
<P><A NAME="LINK187"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  I thank the hon. member for that 
specific information. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He also said that he has in his possession a copy of the 
announcement itself.  I would like him to table that today.  I 
want to take this matter under advisement and I will get back to 
the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do note that four members of the Board of Internal Economy 
have addressed this particular matter today.  I do note that the 
Board of Internal Economy is going to be meeting next Tuesday, 
unless my information is wrong.  I want to put that on the record 
because that to me has a bearing on what I am going to be doing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Chuck Strahl:</B>  Mr. Speaker, in regard to that, you 
should also know that the issue will also be brought before the 
Joint Interparliamentary Council. It is on the agenda for the 
Joint Interparliamentary Council to address at its next meeting. 
The problem again is that it has not been addressed. I am not 
sure what the council may or may not do.  My point of privilege 
is that that has been presupposed by the minister's announcement. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK188"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Stéphane Bergeron (Verchères, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like 
to join the whip of the official opposition in saying how 
important it is for members of the Board of Internal Economy to 
express their views on this issue. I would like to briefly 
express, if I may, the views of my party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The problem facing us at this time is a 
very complex one in that, theoretically, we should have a system 
in which, as Montesquieu would put it, the legislative, 
executive and judiciary powers must be separate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This distribution of powers under the British parliamentary 
system exists only in theory, however, since what we have in 
fact is the legislative power, with the House of Commons and 
Senate that make up parliament, and the executive power, with 
cabinet, the government and its employees. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Furthermore, we well know that the executive power rests with 
the majority party in parliament, which makes this distinction 
rather moot, as I just said. 
The problem facing us, and the whip of the official opposition 
referred to it earlier, is the fact that, for the fourth or 
perhaps even the fifth time in this Parliament or the previous 
one, the government jumped the gun in announcing measures that 
had not yet been considered, let alone approved, by this 
parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this respect, I would just like to add my voice to that of 
the whip of the official opposition in expressing concern about 
this government's tendency to take parliamentarians and their 
support for granted.

<P><A NAME="LINK192"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
before question period I was discussing a recommendation that 
there ought to be questions and comments during debate in private 
members' business. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We just came through question period.  The galleries were 
filled.  People were watching the proceedings in the House.  We 
covered at least 20 different areas of discussion on a sharp 
basis, with interesting insights on behalf of not only the 
questioners but the responders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At committees we see the same thing.  The interventions of the 
witnesses in committee are always interesting.  There is no 
question in my mind or any members mind that the dialogue between 
the members of the committee and the witnesses is by far the most 
illuminating part of committee meetings.  That is where we find 
out the strengths of arguments.  That is where we find out the 
weaknesses.  That is where we find out the raison d'être, for 
making decisions on interesting parts of bills, motions and other 
affairs that come before committees. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we consider what happens when we debate government bills, 
during the 20 minute speeches with 10 minute comment, there is a 
lot of vibrancy in the House.  There is a lot of interaction. 
There is a lot of information.  When we get down to those 10 
minute speeches with no questions and comments, the energy in 
this place goes away.  Quite frankly it goes away because members 
can no longer participate.  I suggest that the quality of 
speeches also deteriorates because there are no questions to be 
asked of that member.  When someone says things which are very 
good, I want a chance to say they are very good and ask for 
elaboration.  If they say things that are obviously off base or 
misinformed, I also want an opportunity to point this out so that 
is not going to be misinformation in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Without questions and comments things can be said in this place 
which are not very helpful to any of the issues which come here. 
The situation is even worse when we get down to private members' 
business.  In private members' business if issue is not votable, 
it is a 15 minute speech and a five minute wrap-up.  One member 
from every other party gets a chance to speak for 10 minutes. 
Nobody else gets a chance to say anything.  It is a tragedy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reason it is a tragedy is there are some very good bills 
which come here.  Members should be told on the floor that they 
have a good bill but there is a problem here and here is what we 
think they should do.  Members should be told they have a bad 
bill and here are the reasons.  We need this interchange and this 
dialogue.  That is when we find out what is good and what is not 
good.  My recommendation to the House is that we do have Q and A 
during private members' business. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Earlier today I had an opportunity to meet with two constituents 
of mine, Gillian Barber and Laura Morris of Port Credit secondary 
school, who are here with the forum on young Canadians. One of 
the items on their agenda is the role of a member of parliament. 
I told them that today I was going to stand up in the House and 
try to do my best to raise some enthusiasm for private members' 
business.  It is an area which I think is losing its impact in 
this place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The issues of votability and the lottery are demeaning to 
members of parliament.  I find it insulting that members of 
parliament, who have worked hard to bring items forward, have to 
go through some arbitrary chance process to get on the order 
paper.  They then have to go through some other virtually 
impossible process to become votable so their item has a chance 
to live.  The probabilities of those things happening are so 
close to zero that there are members in the House who will never 
get an item on the order paper.  This is not right. 
Now is the time for the House to deal with these things.  Now is 
the time for members to say now is a good time to do something 
about this.  Now is the time to say that private members have a 
role to play.  Not only do we have a role to play, but we have to 
be seen to be playing a role by our constituents.

federal legislation reflects things that happen at the federal, 
provincial, regional and local levels.  I want to hear what other 
members have to say about that issue as well.  I do not want to 
think there is a member over there who never had a chance to rise 
in this place to do the best that he or she can to say here is 
what I think, judge me on my ideas, judge me on the rational 
thinking I am putting forward and give me your best shot because 
I know I have done a good job. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members of parliament are not afraid to rise in their places to 
say what they believe on issues of importance to them.  We should 
respect that more and amend the rules of the House so private 
members' business is not given less time but rather more time. 
This place does not meet from 9:00 a.m. to 10:00 a.m.  I would be 
happy to come here to listen to what other members have to say. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have two final recommendations.  When a member puts in a bill 
for drafting, that bill should be grandfathered so nobody else 
can submit a similar bill an usurp that spot.  Once a member has 
reserved an issue, that member should have the courtesy of having 
that issue reserved.  I have a recommendation with regard to the 
carry forward between sessions.   When an item has already been 
picked we should carry forward at the same stage those items that 
have already passed at second reading.  Anybody who is on the 
order paper who has passed the impossible test of going through 
the lottery and the votability thing should also be maintained 
and should also remain on the order paper.

I rise on behalf of the people of Okanagan—Coquihalla to 
participate in this debate on the House of Commons standing 
orders.  It is important not only for the members of this House 
but for the general public as well that we have the tools 
available to us to be able to act in a democratic fashion in the 
House of Commons. If it were not for the democratic tools, those 
rules and the standing orders, we would be at the mercy of a 
majority government that would impose its will on the people of 
Canada. That would leave us as members of parliament as nothing 
more than actors and the House of Commons as a mere stage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will devote my time today to a discussion of royal commissions 
and how they relate to the parliamentary system.  Under the 
current standing orders, royal commissions are not included in 
the rules of the House.  They are separate.  We should review 
that.  I hope the standing committee will look at some of the 
recommendations I bring forward today. In recent history we have 
witnessed some major commissions that have fallen short of what 
the public was hoping to see from them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Commissions should be at arm's length from the government.  They 
may have a fairly immediate impact on legislation that comes 
before the House.  An example would be the Somalia inquiry.  Now 
we have Bill C-25 which is supposed to address the changes in the 
National Defence Act in relation to the military justice system. 
However, the Somalia inquiry made it clear to many Canadians that 
royal commissions do not represent the unbiased and autonomous 
bodies they were intended to be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is with the Somalia commission in mind that I speak in the 
House today with the intent of establishing a practice where 
parliament is required to have input into the mandate of royal 
commissions. It should not just be the executive branch of 
government, but parliament would participate in the mandates of 
royal commissions.  MPs would be active participants through the 
committee system in the appointments of the commissioners and 
they would be active in reviewing the recommendations of royal 
commissions as well.  All such recommendations should be 
automatically referred to a standing committee.  The committee 
would then be required to consider and report to the House.  The 
House could then consider the report. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will look at the Somalia inquiry which was established in 
March 1995. 
This government established the Somalia inquiry with pressure 
from opposition parties in the House of Commons. The commission's 
final report was cut short by the government.

<A HREF="#LINKT67"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I mentioned, commissions of inquiry are to be at arm's length 
from the executive branch but in this particular instance the 
Government of Canada interfered with the commission and did not 
allow it to complete its report.  That is interference. When a 
process where there is judicial independence is wanted, like a 
commission of inquiry, there must be that independence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The incomplete report presented was comprised of five volumes 
and had 160 recommendations.  The Prime Minister put the cost of 
the Somalia inquiry at some $30 million which in reality was 
closer to $13.8 million.  I will get to that discrepancy a little 
later. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister of national defence stated that the government had 
created a commission with the most wide sweeping powers possible 
in Canadian history.  That is a direct quote from the then 
minister of national defence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Somalia commission had the mandate to inquire into and 
report on the chain of command, leadership, discipline, 
operations, actions and decisions of the Canadian Armed Forces. 
It was to look at the predeployment of troops.  It was to look at 
the deployment of troops and it was to look at the 
post-deployment of troops but it was not able to do that because 
again we had interference by the executive branch of government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In other words, what I am saying is that because of the process, 
because of the interference problem with royal commissions, we 
have a system where the executive branch can ask commissioners to 
look at this much information in this much time and with this 
much money to do it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The system is set up now by design, by the government, to fail. 
I think there should be a process where parliamentarians have the 
ability to look into those problems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>From the beginning, the commission of inquiry into Somalia 
became a battle between the commissioners and the Department of 
National Defence over documentation, altered documents, 
government interference on the inquiry's work, the decision to 
halt the inquiry before the work was completed and the final 
recommendations that followed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This government cut the documents short but yet it took almost a 
year for the commission of inquiry which did not even have 
anything to start with, not even a paper clip.  It could not get 
the information required from the Department of National Defence. 
And then when that issue was raised all of a sudden the material 
flooded in. Some 600,000 pages were delivered to the 
commissioners. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a quote from one of the commissioners: “These documents 
arrived in disarray, often without an explanation of their 
significance or context”.  Questions arose about inconsistencies 
in the documentation.  Logs were missing or they included entries 
that had no information in them.  Entries were missing.  They had 
duplicate serial numbers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Commissioner Desbarats stated: “Because attempts were made to 
destroy some documents within national defence headquarters we 
are now embroiled in a detailed inquiry into the whole question 
of cover-up”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We never got to the question of cover-up. The commissioners at 
the start of the inquiry said there was a possibility of a 
cover-up but by the end of the inquiry, in the middle of their 
investigation, they said there were no allegations anymore.  It 
was the issue of cover-up. There was a cover-up and this 
commission was not allowed to continue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Parliament should have been able to intervene and give the 
direction and find out from departmental officials what was going 
on.  But at the time I stood in this House as defence critic for 
the third party in the House of Commons and each and every day 
the minister of national defence would respond to my questions on 
Somalia by saying let the commission do its work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government would not even let the commission do its work. 
That is inexcusable and that is why there must be some controls, 
rules and regulations in place for this House of Commons when it 
comes to commissions of inquiry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to touch on costs.  I did mention earlier that the 
Prime Minister put the cost of the Somalia inquiry at some $30 
million when explaining why the government wanted the commission 
to finish its work.  This is when it was wrapping it all up, when 
the commission had not even progressed half way through the 
mandate. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1545"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT68"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That $30 million figure was inflated.  It was absolutely 
inflated.  We know that.  The day that figure came out, the day 
the Prime Minister made that comment, I contacted by phone the 
Somalia commissioners who told me the accurate figure was $13.8 
million. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was a PR campaign by this government to tell the Canadian 
public we have got to stop, we spent too much money.  It was a PR 
tactic.  Unfortunately it worked.  It should not have happened 
and it is wrong. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, the minister of national defence acknowledged that 132 
of the 160 recommendations of the commission were supported while 
others were simply put on the shelf because they did not fit into 
the plans of the department. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is not even the true picture of exactly what happened 
because, as I explained, the commissioners of inquiry only had 
the ability to look at the predeployment phase and a portion of 
the post-deployment phase, never got to the completion of the 
deployment phase or the post-deployment phase which would have 
looked at the issue of cover-up. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Adams:</B>  Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of 
order.  Members get only one opportunity for a full debate on the 
standing orders.  There has been great interest in changes to the 
standing orders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have been listening very carefully to the hon. member and I 
understand I think at least one point that he has made with 
respect to the standing orders. But I feel that most of the 
member's remarks do not relate to this debate which is required 
in the standing orders on how this House functions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would be grateful if the member would keep to the topic. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B>  I remind the hon. 
member that he should keep to the debate as closely as possible. 
He has only 31 seconds left. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Hart:</B>  Madam Speaker, I know how difficult it is 
to hear about how royal commissions relate to this parliament, 
but this is very much in the context of how royal commissions 
should relate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, I submit that the following be included in the 
standing orders of the House of Commons. One, that parliament is 
required to have input into the mandate, appointment of 
commissioners and recommendations of royal commissions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Two, all recommendations should be referred to a standing 
committee.  Three, the standing committee will then consider the 
recommendations and report to the House. Four, the House will 
then consider the report. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is our responsibility to ensure— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B>  I must interrupt the 
hon. member at this point.  His time has expired. 
<P><A NAME="LINK194"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Karen Redman (Kitchener Centre, Lib.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to take part in the debate under Standing 
Order 51. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a new member of Parliament, I will not delve into the history 
of parliamentary procedure.  Instead I will provide insight into 
the practices that have proved their value to date in the 36th 
parliament and those which may require adjustments to further 
improve the operation and productivity of this House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The structures which have been developed and put in place 
throughout the evolution of parliament serve as road signs for 
those of us within this House to do the business of parliament. 
They allow for an orderly progress of the business of the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the challenges facing parliament immediately following 
the last election was ensuring the equal opportunity of all 
parties represented in this House.  Political commentators called 
it a pizza parliament and suggested it would have great 
difficulty in reaching a five party agreement as to party 
representation and participation in question period and on 
committees. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would be remiss to portray this as an easy process.  In 
reality, the whips and House leaders of all parties represented 
in parliament deserve recognition for endless meetings held prior 
to the commencement of the 36th parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, consensus was reached, basing representation on party 
proportionality, as explained by my colleague from 
Glengarry—Prescott—Russell earlier today.  This consensus among 
all other tenants of parliamentary procedures and rules has laid 
a foundation for fairness.  A demonstration of this fairness is 
evidenced by the election of the Speaker of this House, which 
included members of all political stripes, including an 
independent representative. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1550"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT69"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Party whips are key to the evaluation of fairness in negotiating 
all party agreement.  A team is an apt analogy for the business 
of this House.  A team relies on the input of all members in 
order to play the game.  This House requires the work and 
participation of every member in it to carry out its daily 
business. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yesterday, the member for Lac-Saint-Jean made a statement of sorts 
by walking out of the House of Commons with his seat. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yesterday's event was an example of a member of this House 
dissatisfied with his ability to represent his constituents in 
order to feel he makes a difference.  While it is unfortunate 
that personal frustration occurs, there are avenues where members 
can express their views.  They can offer to enlighten their 
colleagues in this House.  They can bring the concerns of their 
constituents forward to this legislative body and they can 
institute change. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is always room for improvement through the use of standing 
committees, question period, members' statements, votes and 
private members' business as well as House debates.  There are 
many routes with which members of parliament of any political 
view can move their envelopes forward. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our current voting structure balances the philosophical 
overarching decisions with political reality.  Regardless of the 
ongoing debate of our system that voting is archaic and that we 
should move to an electronic method, discarding our treasured 
tradition of rising at our seat, the act of voting will continue 
to be a blending of constituent concerns, party values as well as 
personal points of view. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The current committee structure is key to all party 
consideration and examination of a multitude of facets of any 
given issue or any piece of legislation.  This forum is used for 
reviewing, discussing and amending legislation.  In my estimation 
it is an incredibly valuable process.  The procedure and 
subsequent ability of committees to hold public consultations 
across the country serves to provide Parliament with a regionally 
specific concerns on many key issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a member of the Standing Committee on Finance I saw the 
importance of this consultation firsthand during last fall's 
prebudget hearings.  It is a huge task to consider and 
incorporate the competing needs of Canadians in submitting budget 
recommendations.  There is a great variance whether it is rural 
and urban needs, regional differences, the social demand for 
reinvestment as well as the realization of fiscal responsibility, 
the overall need for budgetary accountability. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The system of consultations worked and it worked well.  The 
budget introduced by the Minister of Finance earlier this year 
reflected the needs of Canadians, the concerns of committee 
members, the input of cabinet and the calculated fiscal 
accounting of the Department of Finance.  Members who feel they 
have no avenue for change need only to review the minutes of the 
finance committee's prebudget hearings and compare them with the 
budget documents to see the correlation that exists. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As for improvements to the operation and work done by standing 
committees there is room for more exploratory work, aiming at the 
proactive development of legislation rather than the reactive 
review of legislation once it has been introduced. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The nature of debate in Parliament is to bring together diverse 
views, both political and ideological, and find consensus or 
majority of opinion.  The process is necessary in the evolution 
of legislation.  Although government bills dominate the 
legislative landscape private members' bills allow individuals to 
lift personal causes or local ideas to a national stage in order 
to receive debate.  Not all private members' bills become 
votable. In reality during the entire 35th parliament out of 408 
private members' bills introduced in this House 119 were debated, 
47 were deemed votable, while a total of 9 passed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While on the surface this ratio may seem less than impressive, 
and I am not about to say that it does not need improvement 
because I believe it does, private members' bills bring issues to 
the attention of all members of this House, including the 
government.  In some cases over time the issues percolate into 
government policy and although it may not be under the exact 
terms of the private member's bill the issue does get addressed.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Earlier in this debate the Reform whip suggested that the 
justice committee failed to report during the 35th parliament on 
an issue of the rights of victims of crime.  This issue 
originated as a private member's bill.  In fact, this is untrue. 
The justice committee tabled a report in the House last April. 
That report is available to all members of the House.  The real 
truth is that Reform members present walked out of the committee 
just as the motion to approve the report was being brought 
forward. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A new committee has undertaken a national consultative process 
on victims rights.  It will be held in June of this year and a 
further report will be tabled in September 1998.  I appreciate 
the opportunity to set the record straight. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As my colleague from Mississauga Centre pointed out, change is 
needed in moving private members' issues forward.  I listened 
with interest to her recommendation and also urge the committee 
to carefully consider an alternate means of dealing with private 
members' bills. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of particular interest is the bringing forward of bills based on 
signatures of support versus the current lottery system. Through 
collecting support of at least 10 members of each party for a 
total of 100 members, private members' bills would have the 
opportunity to be debated based on their perceived importance to 
parliament and Canadians rather than merely left to the luck of 
the draw. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The structured and strict running of question period has allowed 
more effective use of the allotted time.  Throughout the week it 
allows questions of importance to be raised with the appropriate 
minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A recommendation which has been made in the past and which I 
support is weekly in-depth question and answer periods involving 
a designated minister.  I suggest that Friday question periods be 
scheduled with regional ministers on a rotating basis, allowing 
greater debate on issues affecting each region or, in a related 
vein, that each Friday an assigned minister would be available 
for in-depth debate on specific issues relating to their 
portfolios. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This would provide both members of parliament and their 
constituents the opportunity to have local concerns raised in a 
focused forum where the minister will, based on the region or 
portfolio chosen, provide regionally specific responses to the 
questions posed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While much more can be done to improve the accountability and 
the procedure of parliament, I feel it is necessary that we 
continue to adapt parliament to the changing environment.  We 
must safeguard democracy and preserve the valuable traditions of 
this institution. 
<P><A NAME="LINK195"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Robert D. Nault (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Human Resources Development, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, it gives 
me great pleasure this afternoon to talk about the standing 
orders and procedures of the House and its committees. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have been a member of parliament now for 10 years coming up in 
November.  Having come here in 1988 as a member of the opposition 
and now a member of the government, that should give me some 
insight at this point from an individual's perspective as to 
whether the House of Commons as I know it does work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are a couple of concerns that I have as an individual 
member I want to bring forward this afternoon.  Before I do I 
want to talk about the obvious function of parliament itself. 
Parliament has two major functions.  One is legislative and the 
other is accountability. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We should always keep in mind when we are having discussions in 
this place whether those two functions are being adhered to 
closely so that no matter what the government decides to do, the 
legislative agenda of the party in power is brought forward. That 
is obviously the wish of the people, having voted for that party 
to be their government for a period of time. I think it is also 
very important that there is an accountability process built into 
that program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the last 10 years one of the things that has interested me 
most about parliament is the issue of accountability. 
If there is anything that irks the people back home in 
Kenora—Rainy River, it is the fact that they always want to feel 
that members of parliament are being accountable to them the 
taxpayers. This brings me to the first issue which is very 
obvious to all of us in this place. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1600"></A>

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The standing rules and procedures of this House in the last 
number of years have changed dramatically. When I first came to 
this place a member could speak for 20 minutes as a backbencher. 
We could speak freely for 20 minutes on any particular topic. The 
lead speaker could speak for a very long time if he or she 
wished. Now under the procedures they have made it 10 minutes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I bring to the attention of the House the unfortunate belief 
that we are going backward by restricting the freedom of speech 
in the House of Commons.  We should be allowed to speak, within 
reason obviously, for as long as we would like to speak, as long 
as the government's agenda, the government's program is allowed 
to go forward by all parties in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We seem to place restrictions on ourselves.  The thrust of what 
we believe and what we hear from our constituents in the ridings 
is not brought forward in debate in the House of Commons because 
of the restrictions of time limitations which are put on us. For 
example, in the short time that I have, 10 minutes, it is very 
difficult to put a comprehensive argument together about what the 
House of Commons should and should not be doing.  I will leave 
that for a moment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other issue is the one of accountability.  I wanted to speak 
very strongly about accountability because it has two facets. 
Accountability to my constituents means the ability for me to 
stand up in the House of Commons as often as I possibly can to 
defend in this case the program of the government, the party I 
represent.  I explain why we have chosen a particular program, a 
particular initiative for the good of the people as we see it. If 
I cannot do that because there are restrictions, because there 
are agreements between House leaders and between parties which 
restrict the amount of time we can have on a particular bill, I 
do not think it does anyone any good.  It is one of the problems 
we need to look at very seriously. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other is the issue of accountability in the committees.  I 
want to speak specifically about committees.  As a member of 
parliament for the last 10 years I have noticed that in committee 
even though the opposition likes to promote, as I did in 
opposition between 1988 and 1993, the importance of committees as 
it relates to accountability, whenever we decide we want to look 
at the estimates it is the least important thing to the 
opposition members.  They will not say that publicly but in fact 
it is true. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not something which generates a lot of excitement by 
members of parliament in committee.  They continue, as the 
opposition is now doing, to say we should look at the whole issue 
of the estimates for the human resources development department, 
which is the department I am presently on the committee with. 
There are huge amounts of dollars involved in human resources 
development, close to $60 billion.  How often do we look at the 
estimates of human resources development in committee?  So far 
this year, not at all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is now a filibuster in the human resources development 
committee on a piece of labour legislation because members of the 
opposition would like to delay the bill.  They have been sitting 
on the same clause all morning.  That will delay the ability of 
the committee to look at the estimates. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need to seriously look at the importance of accountability in 
committees and give members of parliament the opportunity to 
reflect on those estimates.  As boring as they may seem to people 
on this side or that side, it is one of the major functions of a 
member of parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we can get agreement by members of all parties on all sides 
of the House that they will allow the program of the government 
to go forward, we could then open the rules of this place.  We 
could on the one hand speak on behalf of our constituents as a 
member of parliament and on the other hand make sure that the 
program we ran on as a party and as a politician is moved forward 
in the weeks and months we sit in this place.

<A HREF="#LINKT72"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That brings me to the third and I think the most disturbing 
issue of this parliament and other parliaments as I have seen it. 
It is the issue of private members' bills. For the sake of 
argument there is very little attention or care taken on private 
members' bills and private members' business.  In fact it is 
non-existent if people in this place wanted to be very blunt and 
frank about it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will never get a good system for private members' business 
and for the bills that come to this place until there is an 
acceptance by the Canadian people first and by the members of 
parliament that private members' business is very separate from 
the government's business from the parties they work for and the 
business they believe in. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even though we continue to stand up row by row, individual by 
individual, the fact remains that private members' bills are not 
looked at by the government or by the opposition as private and 
on which they can vote whichever way they choose.  I have seen on 
numerous occasions in this place since 1988 not only the 
government but the opposition using private members' bills as an 
opportunity to send a signal to the Canadian people. Let me give 
one example. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is well known to all of us that if we voted for a Reform 
private members' bill as a private member on the government side, 
they would take the opportunity to use that private members' bill 
and the fact that we supported it to try to embarrass the 
government and the member in the member's constituency.  Because 
of this, there is no ability for members of parliament to feel 
free to support individual private members' bills. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If in fact we were to open up the process and if the Reform 
Party were to stop pretending that they do believe in private 
members' business and that they vote independently, then we could 
get on with the very important work of putting together a private 
members' process, one which would allow us to put forward our 
constituents' points of view.  In rural ridings such as mine we 
do not have the opportunity to debate rural issues as often as we 
would like to do so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I mentioned earlier, the 10 minutes, the short time I had is 
finished, which does not allow me to elaborate on a number of 
other points.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Norman Doyle (St. John's East, PC):</B>  Madam Speaker, 
listening to this debate today I have to say I was impressed that 
there have been so many positive references to the Special 
Committee on the Reform of the House of Commons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to make all hon. members aware that many, many 
years ago this committee was chaired by the former member for St. 
John's East, the Hon. James McGrath.  He represented St. John's 
East for many, many years.  I think he was in this House for 
roughly 21 or 22 years.  It is rare in my experience at least 
that a report which is 13 years old still maintains a certain 
amount of relevance here in parliament.  It says a great deal 
about the quality of work that was done at that time by the Hon. 
James McGrath. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This morning the member for Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough 
referred to the Liberal position paper on parliamentary reform 
which was published back in 1993.  It was published at that time 
under the signature of the prime minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the changes the Liberals promised was for the opportunity 
for MPs to present their grievances here in the House of Commons. 
After all, this is what the people of Canada, our constituents, 
sent us here for.  One of the changes they promised was the 
opportunity to present grievances here in the House of Commons.

<A HREF="#LINKT73"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals said that members of the House and more importantly 
the people they represent have to have the fullest opportunity 
available to place problems and grievances before parliament. 
The rules providing the vehicle for that, such as presentation of 
petitions and members statements, must be revised to facilitate 
that process. We do not have too many opportunities here in the 
House of Commons to present our grievances. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To give one example, a very important thing happened in 
Newfoundland recently.  It affected the member for St. John's 
West, the member for St. John's East and the member for 
Burin—St. George's.  It was the moving of the Marine Atlantic 
headquarters from Moncton to North Sydney in Nova Scotia. The 
member for St. John's West, the member for Burin—St. George's 
and myself wanted the opportunity over the last week or so to 
present our views here on that very important matter.  However 
there was no opportunity for us to do so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Statements by members are only one minute long.  It is very 
difficult indeed to make a case on a very important issue in 
one's province in one minute.  Even in petitions we can only 
speak for 45 seconds to a minute.  It is very difficult to make 
one's case in that period of time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals went on to promise that they would increase the 
time available for members statements but it has not happened. To 
date there has been no effort to do that and no dialogue on that 
issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I encourage the House to make more time available for members to 
raise many of these very important grievances which Canadians 
have against the treatment they receive from their government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Earlier this year the House was asked to approve changes to the 
Constitution regarding the provinces of Quebec and Newfoundland, 
another very important issue.  As the House knows, there are no 
special provisions in the rules regarding the consideration of 
constitutional amendments and there should be.  Since it requires 
only the passage of a single question for the adoption of a 
constitutional resolution, there should be some protection and 
procedures laid out in the standing orders.  There should be a 
mandatory committee procedure and a guarantee that local hearings 
will be held so that Canadians can have access to the members of 
the House of Commons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally in the limited time I have available to me, I want to 
offer an observation about the way the House considers the 
important business of supply and estimates. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I spent many years in the Newfoundland House of Assembly as did 
my colleague, the member for St. John's West.  It is a small 
house with 48 members but that house demanded a much higher level 
of scrutiny and debate before money was appropriated and 
expenditures authorized. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This House needs to look seriously at the estimates process.  We 
owe that to Canadian taxpayers.  We are spending their money. 
This will mean that ministers will have to be more available to 
committees.  There will have to be less game playing on the part 
of witnesses.  There will also have to be more time spent and 
more time made available for the very important business we have 
to conduct here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to endorse the feeling of the House leader who 
spoke this morning concerning the need to simplify private 
members' business.  If there are ways that changes can be made 
and rules changed, then we on this side of the House, if it is to 
give additional time to members to make their constituents' 
cases, would support them. 
<P><A NAME="LINK197"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George—Peace River, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, it is a pleasure for me to join in this debate this 
afternoon.  Hopefully this debate will move the government to 
make some much needed changes to the procedures of this place, to 
the standing orders and to the way in which we conduct business 
in the House of Commons.

<A HREF="#LINKT74"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I note that a number of those preceding me in the debate this 
afternoon referred to private members' business, among other 
issues.  Certainly that is a very important issue for every 
member, regardless of which party they happen to represent in 
this place.  Whether they are opposition members or government 
members, private members' business is a very important issue.  In 
fairness, I think even the backbench members on the government 
side have seen the inherent problems in the process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On a number of occasions when I have written newspaper columns 
at home, done interviews and held meetings in consultation with 
the constituents of Prince George—Peace River I have referred to 
the lottery system of private members' business.  We have to be 
lucky in order to have our bills chosen.  I think this is true of 
all members, or the vast majority of members.  They put a lot of 
time, effort and thought into drafting their private members' 
bills.  In many cases the bills address a specific need that they 
see is lacking in legislation.  Perhaps it has to do with 
something specific to their particular riding or their area of 
the country.  They put a lot of time into drafting their private 
members' bills, introducing them in this place and then they sit 
and wait, and wait, with the slim hope that they might be 
fortunate enough to win the lotto 649 and have their name drawn. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then when they have their name drawn they go to the next step, 
which unfortunately is to go before a supposedly non-partisan all 
party committee to plead their case.  They go on bended knee 
after they have been fortunate enough to be one of the ones to 
have their name drawn.  They go before this committee to try to 
convince it that of the 15 drawn theirs should be one of the 5 
that are fortunate enough to have their bill made votable.  It is 
a process that I have been critical of, as I think a great many 
members have been on both sides of the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Reformers are system changers.  Those of us who were elected in 
the first go around back in the fall of 1993 were sent to Ottawa 
to change the system, to change the way that governance is done 
in Canada.  It is one of the prime reasons for which the people 
of Prince George—Peace River supported me as a Reform candidate 
back in 1993.  They said “We want you to go down there, Jay, and 
try to change the system”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Certainly Reform has been criticized many times over the past 
four and a half years for running up against the wall, the wall 
of the old traditional ways, the old system.  We are constantly 
pushing the envelope and saying that we were sent here to change 
the system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yes, there are a lot of traditions that we respect in this place 
as very loyal, patriotic Canadians, but there are a lot that we 
question.  We say “Just because it has been done that way for 
130-some years, does that make it right?  Does it make it the 
most efficient and the most effective way in which to govern a 
country as large and as diverse as Canada?” There are many areas 
where change is needed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We were sent to Ottawa to change the system, to change the way 
in which Canada is governed.  Of course, ever since our party was 
formed back in 1987 we had our blue book of principles and 
policies which contain sections about democratic reform. 
These were things that we felt, in broad consultation with 
Canadians, should be changed to make parliament more responsive 
to what I call the real world outside these hallowed halls, the 
real world in which the vast majority of Canadians live and work 
each day.

<A HREF="#LINKT75"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore, this debate today is particularly appropriate for 
Reformers.  We are talking about the standing orders, the 
procedures, the traditions and certain things that require reform 
and change. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Hopefully what we viewed yesterday we will not have to view 
again.  A member of this place became so frustrated with the 
process and felt he was failing his constituents and all 
Canadians that he resorted to the atrocious stunt of stealing his 
chair and rushing out of the House of Commons to try to make the 
point to the government that the system needs some serious 
changes, that it is in serious need of a major overhaul.  We are 
not talking about tinkering. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to speak briefly to order in council appointments, 
the system whereby the government makes appointments.  This 
process was widely criticized long before I ever decided to run 
for politics.  I think it is high time we had a different process 
in place for the appointment of individuals to a lot of these 
boards. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the agricultural critic for the official opposition I am very 
aware of this at the moment.  Bill C-4 is currently being debated 
in the Senate.  It has already passed this House.  The bill calls 
for a board of directors to be set up in order to govern the 
Canadian Wheat Board.  Of that board of directors, which will 
consist of 15 individuals, the government, in its infinite 
wisdom, only decided to have the farmers elect 10 of them.  Five 
of the directors will continue to be appointed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think a lot of my colleagues, as well as myself, hear a 
growing resentment from Canadians about a lot of these 
appointments as we travel in our ridings and across Canada.  I 
could run down a long list of some of the ones who are the most 
questionable, individuals who have been appointed to particular 
boards, many of them very highly paid.  In fact, many of them are 
much more highly paid than you and I, Madam Speaker.  They have 
been appointed to these boards with very high salaries and very 
questionable attributes.  It seems that many times, at least on 
the surface, it is more likely because of party affiliation or 
who they supported that they get these jobs, not because of what 
they know or do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Ironically, there is another bill which was being considered 
this morning in the standing committee on agriculture, which is 
Bill C-26.  It also calls for the possibility of a board.  In fact 
it states in the legislation that the minister for agriculture 
may set up an advisory board consisting of up to nine 
individuals, all appointed.  A number of witnesses appeared 
before the committee this morning who raised questions about how 
the individuals will be selected and whether they will 
necessarily be the best people for the job. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I could have gone into a lot of other issues that are important. 
Time allocation and closure come to mind, as well as questions on 
the Order Paper.  There are so many issues that on the surface 
seem dry and somewhat mundane.  People probably do not have a lot 
of interest in them.  But, in reality, once they are explained to 
the viewing public, they show a great deal of interest in them 
because they affect the way in which our country is governed.

<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B> It is my duty, pursuant to 
Standing Order 38, to inform the House that the questions to be 
raised tonight at the time of adjournment are as follows: the 
hon. member for Waterloo—Wellington—Prisons. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK198"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Roger Gallaway (Sarnia—Lambton, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I am pleased to participate in this debate on the motion deemed 
to be put according to Standing Order 51, namely that this House 
takes note of the standing orders and procedures of the House and 
its committees. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this brief period I would like to address two points, the 
first perhaps broad and general in terms of the work of members 
of committees, and the second being a specific recommendation to 
add a new standing order following Standing Order 98 in order to 
correct an obvious problem that continues to sit on the books. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Individuals come to this place with firm convictions that they 
can contribute and can add something to the big picture and, most 
importantly, they can make a difference on issues and matters 
that are of concern to their constituents.  Members come here to 
serve their constituents.  Members come here also as part of a 
political team, a party which reflects in a general way their 
beliefs, their values and their collective attitudes.  An 
election result is the combination of the presentation of the 
individual candidate and the party that the individual 
represents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A member's arrival in the House of Commons is an experience 
which I would suggest flattens the idealistic to the more 
pragmatic because this is, after all, a place of government by 
ministerial responsibility and it is through the ministerial 
system that one must work to see a result or an influence on 
policy and ultimately on decisions.  Through the 18 standing 
committees an individual member of Parliament has an opportunity 
to directly influence decision making in the broadest sense of 
the word. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On October 22 of last year the Ottawa <I>Citizen</I> published a 
column by a writer known as Susan Riley in which she noted: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Everyone knows that the ordinary member of Parliament is a 
pitiful creature, shut out of important decision-making,—ignored 
by the media and ranked below lawyers in public esteem.  Everyone 
has remedies for this sorry situation including more free votes, 
a higher profile and more travel for Parliamentary Committees, 
better decorum in the House and more opportunity for private 
members to introduce their own legislation.  But nobody, 
including MPs themselves is willing to do anything other than 
complain. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In that column she addresses the role of committees. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my experience the 18 standing committees of this House have 
little or no relationship with the minister responsible for the 
department.  In a parliamentary ministerial government it is 
astounding to me that ministers only appear for perhaps two hours 
before a committee to explain why draft legislation is necessary. 
Is it not equally unbelievable that a minister will appear for a 
couple of hours to explain or defend the estimates of an entire 
department involving perhaps billions of dollars? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is pro forma ministerial involvement in the workings of 
committees.  It is an absurd method of paying lip service to 
committees, yet there is no real interchange between the minister 
on the one hand and the committee on the other. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our system of ministerial democratic government is looking for 
change.  As collectives, committees have seen less resources 
devoted to them in terms of support, staffing, travel allowance, 
access to the minister and freedom to travel.  This skewers the 
function of this place.  The executive and the legislative 
function of each department, which is vested in the minister, 
grows more powerful while the counterbalance, which is vested in 
the committee, continues to shrink. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The time has arrived for every member of this House to get 
serious about what this place is and what it might be.  As my 
friend and colleague, the member from Rosedale was quoted as 
saying last year:  “Valuable work is still done in committees. 
It is as if you're dropping a pebble into a deep well”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps members of this House would like to give themselves 
something larger than pebbles to deal with.  This is an issue 
which does not fall along partisan political lines.  This is an 
issue which speaks to the office of member of Parliament and to 
the very institution itself. 
This is an issue on which we as members can agree to move back to 
committees a meaningful role for members.

<A HREF="#LINKT77"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need to move the role of committees to a level of greater 
importance, and this can be done in a number of ways.  We can 
allow some free elections of chairs or we can allow votes in 
committees as are conducted in the British parliamentary system. 
Most important, give back to committees the resources and support 
staff such as researchers and legislative counsel, in order that 
all committee members can receive objective, impartial and expert 
advice in the course of deliberations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Standing committees are not intended to be puppets or extensions 
of the department with which they are aligned.  They are to 
examine, test and recommend improvements in what ministers 
propose.  Yes, there are political and philosophical differences 
in committees but at the same time one cannot assume that any 
department as represented by its minister is always correct or 
always perfect. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yet committees have been disempowered.  The Standing Committee 
on Procedure and House Affairs should be looking at ways to 
return some modicum of real control.  It is easy to say that 
committees are masters of their own destiny.  Destiny I would 
suggest will always be an abstract idea without the supporting 
rules and resources to give that cliche meaning. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other issue to which I wish to speak specifically involves 
the standing orders surrounding private members' bills, namely 
Standing Orders 98 and 99. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact, these private members' bills, after a review by a 
standing committee of this House and third reading, are sent to 
the Senate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There, these bills must be treated like public bills. As we 
know, the Senate committee can take several initiatives. 
However, if an amendment is made during the review by the Senate 
committee and is approved at third reading, the bill will come 
back to the House, which must then reconsider the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact, the House can accept or reject the Senate amendment. It 
is time we recognize that this is a major problem. 
It is simple: there is no means, no process to conclude debate 
on an amendment made by senators. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is the ultimate catch-22.  This is the treadmill that never 
stops yet moves nowhere. The fact is the rules are silent on this 
point with the end result being every time the bill, as amended 
by the Senate, comes before this House, there is no end to the 
process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A private member's bill which has received the approval of this 
House and is amended, however slightly in the other place, can 
come back here and be hijacked forever.  We know there are 
specific rules for debate, namely three hours at second reading 
and two hours at third reading.  Yet when a private member's bill 
returns from the Senate amended, the rules say nothing.  The end 
result is that private members' legislation can be debated 
forever without the closure that a vote on legislation as amended 
by the other place will bring.  We can say this will never happen 
but it has happened. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, this is a simple, pragmatic, easily accomplished 
change to the standing orders specifically which can be made to 
correct this obvious shortcoming.  By adding after Standing Order 
98 a new standing order, a limit of two or three hours can be 
imposed and a vote be required after the period of debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope the Standing Committee on Procedure and House Affairs 
will move to add this section and to correct this obvious 
problem. 
<P><A NAME="LINK199"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Gilmour (Nanaimo—Alberni, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
would like to comment on the Senate. Bills should originate in 
this House and only in this House.  It is we, the elected 
members, who should originate bills.  They can go to the Senate 
afterwards.  That is the way it is meant to be. However, bills 
should not originate in the unelected, unaccountable Senate and 
then come to this House.  They should originate in this House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The standing orders should be amended to say all bills ought to 
begin in the House of Commons.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>My second point deals with the estimates.  Normally it is the 
practice with the estimates to bring the government department 
before committee.  However, in the Senate this does not happen. 
In the 35th parliament it was the first time ever in parliament 
that it started in committee.  I was on the public works 
committee.  We passed a motion within our committee to ask the 
Senate to appear before our committee.  That in turn required the 
unanimous consent of the House of Commons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The chair of our committee brought that motion forward.  There 
was unanimous consent of this House to send a letter to the 
Senate to appear before the committee to justify the estimates. 
The Senate refused.  That is the crux of the problem.  There is 
no vehicle available to Canadians to have the Senate appear 
before any body to justify the money being allotted to it. This 
is not a witch hunt.  This is simply accountability.  We are 
asking the Senate to be accountable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The practice that sets a deadline to have the main estimates put 
to a vote in the House is practical when committees have the time 
and authority to summon departments and agencies to appear before 
them to justify their spending.  That is the normal route with 
the estimates.  As I said earlier, considering that the Senate is 
not bound by an order of the House of Commons or its committees, 
Senate estimates should be allowed to stand over and be 
considered on a day after the last allotted day.  The estimates 
of the Senate would only be considered after the Senate has had 
an opportunity to send a representative to appear before a House 
standing committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At present, the only threat the Commons can make is to vote down 
or reduce the estimates of the Senate.  A hold over might be less 
confrontational and would add another option to bring some 
accountability to the Senate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those sum up my two points.  First, all bills should originate 
in the House.  Second, there should be some vehicle for the 
Senate estimates to come before a body of this House for 
scrutiny. 
<P><A NAME="LINK200"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Reg Alcock (Winnipeg South, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
tomorrow I will have been elected 10 years.  I was first elected 
to the provincial legislature in Manitoba on April 22, 1988 and 
spent five years there before being elected here in 1993. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can recall on more than one occasion standing in the loges in 
the house talking to other members and collectively wondering 
what we were doing much of the time.  We found ourselves involved 
in a series of activities, routines and rituals that grew out of 
the traditions of the house that left a lot of us feeling that 
they were simply a diversion from the work that brought us here 
in the first place.  They were an impediment to doing what we 
thought we were elected to do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Tactically it became important if we wanted to change the course 
of a bill to put pressure on the government by delaying the 
passage of bill through the house.  We had a rule that allowed us 
to speak for 40 minutes.  We had members getting up making speech 
after speech for 40 minutes at a time on subjects that they had 
no passion about, no feeling about, but simply because it was 
necessary to occupy that portion of time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We would organize hundreds of witnesses to come before the house 
committees on bills simply to delay, not to add to the debate, 
not to add to the quality of the work that was being done, but to 
play the tactical games that dominated the activities of the 
house. 
However, there were some things in the provincial house that I 
rather liked when I contrast them with what I am doing here.  I 
want to focus a bit on that.  First I want to compare some of my 
experiences in the provincial house with the ones I had when I 
came here.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I find this place, strangely enough, even though it is almost 
six times the size of the provincial legislature, a more 
accessible place when I wish to speak.  The work I do is no 
different from the work that everybody in the House does.  I 
represent a number of Canadians.  I spend as much time as I can 
in my home community working with people, meeting with them, 
hearing what concerns they have, asking them questions about 
things the House is seized with, taking their opinions and 
bringing them back into this place. It comes back in a number of 
ways. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Compared to the provincial legislature I was in, I find there is 
more accessibility to the floor of the House through S. O. 31s, 
through the question and answer period after speeches in most 
debates and through the late show.  There are opportunities for 
me to rise in the House on a regular basis and put on public 
record the opinions, the feelings and the attitudes of the people 
I represent.  For me it is a significant improvement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also note some changes that have taken place in the House over 
the last few years since I have come here relative to the work of 
committees that I think represent a first important step in what 
could be, not is, a substantial improvement in the functioning of 
committees. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The ability of committees to set their own agendas is an 
important power that committees could exercise more efficiently 
than perhaps they do at the present time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another is the lining up of committees with departments so that 
members of a committee are dealing not with just the legislation 
or just the estimates but with the whole picture of the 
department, the planning documents, the estimates, order in 
council appointments, all the legislation and the annual reports. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We begin to move in a cycle that allows a committee to really 
have input into the operations of a department throughout the 
course of a year.  I think that is an extremely important 
structure and one that has come about in the last few years since 
I have come into this place in 1993. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, it is a flawed process in two important ways.  If we 
look at what happens in September with the consultations done by 
the finance committee there is a focusing of attention in the 
House on that process.  A statement is made by the finance 
minister and the committee goes off to solicit opinion from 
Canadians that then gets reported back to the House and is 
reflected or not reflected, depending on the issue, in the budget 
that comes down a few months later.  It is a process that 
receives a strong mandate from the House and a lot of attention 
from the House and produces a result that I think has grown in 
quality each year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That process works because the finance minister takes it 
seriously.  He pays attention to it.  He works with it.  He 
utilizes it as the tool it really is supposed to be.  It is 
supposed to be all of us going off into our ridings, talking to 
people about the issues before the government at that point in 
time, and the finance minister works with the committee to frame 
those issues.  We collect the opinion, we discuss it, we debate 
it in communities all over the country, then we bring it back on 
to the floor of the House and it plays a part in the final 
document presented in February.  That is a big part of what we 
are here to do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are two ways that process falls apart.  I have chaired a 
committee.  I am on my third minister and I have a terrific 
working relationship with the minister which is very solid and I 
feel we are able to do some good work, but that is not always the 
case.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the member from our side who preceded me pointed out, if the 
minister does not choose to work with the committee, the process 
falls apart and is invalidated.  It is a flaw in way the standing 
orders are structured to hold ministers and departments 
accountable to the committees structured for that purpose. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Committees first came into existence as part of the 
accountability structure.  Members representing constituencies 
from all over the country sat on budget committees and reviewed 
the expenditures of departments because only the House of Commons 
could grant spending authority.  We went through the expenditures 
line by line very carefully.  We questioned them and held the 
departments and ministers to account. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That still goes on in provincial houses.  Ministers sit before 
those committees hour after hour after hour, day after day, until 
answers are arrived at.  Here, as was pointed out, ministers come 
to the committees, make their hour or hour and a half 
presentations, and that is the end of it.  As a result committees 
largely spend no time on the estimates because they are a waste 
of time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One thing that frustrates me enormously is the attitude of the 
House toward new technologies.  They are being taken up all over 
the world.  We see all sorts of computers in all offices now. All 
sorts of technology are being used as productivity enhancements. 
They are used to automate routine tasks so people can focus their 
time and energies on those tasks where their expertise is most 
valuable.  Yet in the House we refuse to adopt those same 
technologies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How many times have members walked out of the House after 
spending three hours voting and asked “what was that for”?  In 
five minutes I could register my opinion on bills my constituents 
are interested in, so why am I wasting my time on activities that 
could be better done in a more efficient way, which would leave 
me free to do the things I theoretically have the skills to do? I 
could meet with my constituents, coalesce opinion, bring that 
opinion here, debate with members from the other side of the 
House and debate theoretically and hopefully toward some sort of 
improved conclusion on a solution to some issue that confronts 
the country.  That is what we are theoretically here to do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we could get away from the attitude that somehow technology 
is an evil that should not be brought into the House and embrace 
it, we may find that it frees us to spend more of our time doing 
the things that we would all prefer to do. 
<P><A NAME="LINK201"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Myron Thompson (Wild Rose, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I will 
speak to a couple of issues regarding the standing orders.  The 
first is debates in the House and the second is Private Members' 
Business. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Shortly after I came here I made a very disappointing discovery. 
I suspected it to be true right from the beginning.  It was 
confirmed on a number of occasions and is a sad situation. For 
example, I arrived here one Monday morning and it was announced 
on the board that there would be a debate that day on whether or 
not we should send troops to Bosnia.  I remember that specific 
debate a few years back, the first time around. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The debate was put forward.  Some people were speaking 
passionately for sending troops to Bosnia while others were 
speaking passionately against it.  The debate was going back and 
forth, across and all around.  It carried on until Tuesday night 
when the House took a vote. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We went through the process of a full two day debate.  We went 
through the process of a 15 minute or 20 minute standing vote.  I 
noticed in that vote that all government members supported the 
idea of sending troops to Bosnia, which is fine if that is the 
way they felt.  Then we voted on this side of the House. The sad 
part of the whole thing was that the troops were already on their 
way on Thursday, before the debate even started. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us stop and think about that for a minute.  We were here for 
two days.  What did it cost—was it a million or $2 million 
dollars—to run this place, to be here debating an issue that was 
already decided? 
That to me was straight contempt of parliament. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1650"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT81"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In other words I have learned in the short four years I have 
been here that decisions are not made in the House as they ought 
to be made.  They are made by the front row, the odd few.  Chief 
bureaucrats could possibly be involved with a certain minister. 
Then they emerge from behind their closed doors and say what they 
will do with a particular issue, whether they will vote yes or 
no.  It does not matter what kind of a debate takes place. 
Nothing will change their minds because they are members of the 
Liberal Party, are the government and will vote the way they are 
told.  That is sad. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then we get the courage and the conviction of some of them, one 
of them being the member from York South—Weston.  He is now an 
independent member because he campaigned against an issue. During 
his campaign he strongly indicated to his constituents that when 
he got to the House of Commons he would push hard for what they 
all said they believed in, scrapping the GST. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the budget came out that year and did not do as he had 
promised his constituencies, his convictions were so strong he 
had to vote against the bill.  Consequently he got fired.  Now he 
sits as an independent on this side of the House.  That is a 
disgrace.  It is an absolute shame. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wonder if the people of Canada who vote for these old line 
parties realize that they are operating and living under a 
dictatorship of a few who make all of the decisions on our 
behalf.  Regardless of all the compassion we put into our 
debates, regardless of how hard we fight for an issue that we 
know our Canadian constituents want, it makes no difference; the 
decision is made by the mighty few. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Conservatives of the Brian Mulroney and Michael Wilson era 
did the same thing.  I cannot think of an issue that was more 
obvious Canadians did not want than the GST.  The message was 
loud and clear by all constituents from all ridings in all parts 
of the country.  However, when it came time to vote the mighty 
few said “You will vote for this.  If you do not you will be 
fired”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Consequently we now have a member sitting in the Liberal 
government, the member of Edmonton Southeast.  He voted against 
the government of the day because his constituents did not want 
it.  I applaud him for having taken that decision.  I do not know 
if he made the wise decision by moving to the Liberal Party 
because it is no different.  It does the same thing.  One day he 
will have to vote against the wishes of his people because his 
government will not let him vote otherwise.  That is a shame. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those kinds of things go on in the House far too often. 
Decisions are made daily by a few.  We are here debating and it 
makes no difference.  Consequently when the wishes of the 
Canadian people are not adhered to, we become about as popular as 
snake's tail in a wagon track.  That is the opinion we will get 
from the people.  How much lower can we get? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are sent here by the people of Canada to represent them, to 
send their voice forward, hoping that it will have an impact. 
These people are our bosses.  They are the ones who have the 
right to fire us, not the group sitting on that side of the House 
or any party.  No people in Canada gave that authority to any 
party.  They hired us through an election and they will get rid 
of us.  Right now the only way they can do that is in the next 
election, and most of the time they will do that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us look at what happened to the Mulroney government with the 
GST.  No one will ever convince me that the reason the 
Conservatives went from the largest majority to a meagre two was 
nothing more than the pressure of voting for something the people 
did not want, the infamous GST.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not know what it would take to get rid of that kind of 
procedure, but it would be nice to tell members they have the 
freedom to vote in the House according to how the people want to 
be represented. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I heard a member on the other side talk about getting feedback 
from his constituents and coming here to represents their views. 
However it does not make any difference in that party because 
they have to vote according to the minister in charge of the 
particular bill and no ifs, ands or buts about it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We live in a democratic country.  Is that a democratic process? 
In a pig's eye.  That has to change.  I do not know what it takes 
to do it, but a free vote would be nice.  We could legislate 
that.  Maybe recall would even be better so the people of Canada 
decide whether a member belongs here rather than a government 
politician.  That is not what they are here for. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Enough said about that.  I want to move to Private Members' 
Business.  A committee is struck to determine whether or not a 
private member's bill is votable.  Even members of the government 
caucus have called a committee which makes a decision on whether 
or not something is votable a kangaroo court. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will give an example.  I presented a bill a couple of years 
ago that would simply give the police the authority to arrest 
upon sight, without a warrant, when people on parole were 
breaking the conditions of their parole.  The committee in all 
its wisdom after debating it decided it was not votable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A few months later one of my colleagues put forward the same 
bill with exactly the same contents.  Guess what?  That one was 
votable.  I had spent a lot of time and money putting together a 
proposal that was denied, and one of my colleagues spent a whole 
lot of time and money putting together the same proposal that was 
accepted.  I guess it is what mood they are in.  I have no idea 
what helps them make their decisions, but that is wrong. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They set out the criteria for a private member's bill to be 
votable.  If it meets the criteria that should be all it takes, 
but no.  I have a hunch somebody over there is saying “don't 
make that one votable”.  They are taking their orders from 
somebody else.  We do not even need that committee.  If it meets 
the criteria let us put it forward. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, I admire the work of individual MPs on all sides 
of the House who have strived hard to bring forward a piece of 
legislation that makes things good for the safety of Canadians, 
for their health and for their welfare.  They are thinking of the 
people.  It is too bad their leaders are not doing the same. 
<P><A NAME="LINK202"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jason Kenney (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, I am pleased to rise to debate the standing orders of 
the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe I am the first rookie member of the class of the 1997 
election to speak to this debate.  I am glad I have the 
opportunity to do so.  One of the reasons I stood for election to 
this venerable institution was precisely because of my passionate 
concern about the state of democracy in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would characterize the state of democracy in Canada as a 
crisis.  Democracy in Canada, as democracy is conventionally 
understood, is imperilled not by any great spectre of tyranny or 
state totalitarianism but rather by the slow, creeping 
incremental gathering of power and authority by the executive and 
judicial branches of government at the expense of the legislative 
branch, the democratic branch, and particularly that branch of 
government as manifest in the House of Commons.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The history of parliament, the history of the development of 
this institution, reaches back over a millennium.  The privileges 
which we here exercise, the right to speak on behalf of our 
constituents, on behalf of the subjects of the Queen, on behalf 
of the citizens of our country, are duties and privileges which 
people have shed blood to secure.  Battles have been fought, wars 
have been waged and men and women have died in order to secure 
the liberties which this institution represents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That conflict which has carried over a period of centuries was 
really a conflict between the authority of the executive branch 
of government and the democratic privileges and liberties of 
common people as represented in their democratic assembly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a first time member of this place, let me make it absolutely 
clear that I have enormous, inexpressible respect for the 
traditions this place represents.  I am a traditionalist. I for 
instance am a strong supporter of our constitutional monarchy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, I support our constitutional monarchy, our institutions 
and our traditions as embodied in this parliament not for the 
sake of supporting tradition but because they embody something 
good.  They embody a tradition of ordered liberty and democracy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This unfortunately is a tradition which is imperilled by the 
fact that this legislature, a legislature which was created to 
provide a meaningful check and balance against the authority of 
the executive branch of government, effectively no longer does 
so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a member from the government said during his remarks, 
parliament essentially has two functions, that of a legislative 
body and the accountability function to hold the executive, the 
governor in council, the cabinet or the government accountable. 
I think on both those mandates of this place we no longer 
exercise the powers of an effective legislature. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I submit that the standing orders of this House have in a sense 
removed any meaningful role from this place and from members of 
Parliament as real legislators, people who can exercise the 
authority granted to us by our constituents within our 
constitutional framework to do the business of democracy here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It has become a truism in this country to refer to our form of 
government as one of electing five year, temporary dictatorships. 
That is not just the words of partisans in the heat of debate, 
that is a sentiment expressed by many eminent political 
scientists, jurists and members of this place both now and in the 
past few decades. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What they see is essentially two devices of the standing orders 
of this place. The executive branch, the cabinet, the 
frontbenches, has managed to force members of parliament, 
essentially on the government side, to surrender any authority 
which they bring to this place from their constituents.  The 
customs of this House do this by imposing a kind of party 
discipline unseen anywhere else in the democratic world, a party 
discipline predicated on the notion that if the government loses 
a vote on a question on a motion or a bill the government will 
somehow fall. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore, as the hon. Leader of the Opposition said in debate 
this morning on this matter, we have created an impossible 
situation where government backbenchers are forced by their 
whips, their ministers, the Prime Minister and their government 
to vote with the government on every single conceivable matter 
except those occasionally designated to be free votes. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1705"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT85"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT85"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1705

<A HREF="#LINKT84"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we all know very well, there is never such a thing as a free 
vote for members of the government.  There is always a party line 
with the government.  Notes are always taken by the whip's office 
about how members vote.  If they hope as a backbench rookie to 
become a parliamentary secretary or, heaven forbid, a minister, 
if they hope to get a fruitful position on a committee in which 
they have interest, then they must toe the party line. It need 
not be that way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other device used to impose this kind of outrageous party 
discipline is the failure of these standing orders in chapter 11 
from sections 86 to 99 to permit private members to conduct 
legislative business here as legislators. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In a completely arbitrary system 30 bills and motions are drawn 
out of hundreds that are submitted for consideration.  If they 
are lucky they get an hour of debate.  If they are particularly 
lucky this star chamber of the private members' business 
committee will select five items to become votable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So what happens is that very valuable legislative initiatives 
which are not on the agenda of the government and of the cabinet 
are almost from the outset given no chance of seeing the light of 
day.  For instance, I have on the order paper a simple private 
member's bill which would recognize a period of two minutes of 
silence on Remembrance Day to commemorate our war dead.  It is a 
motion supported by the Royal Canadian Legion and is a motion 
which I cannot imagine any member of this place in good 
conscience opposing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we amended the standing orders of this place to allow all 
private members' business to become votable, this motion I am 
sure would pass with unanimous or near unanimous support in the 
matter of a few minutes.  I do not think it would require an 
enormous expenditure of the time and resources of this place to 
pass such a motion.  All it takes is the will of the government 
to amend these standing orders to allow business like that, the 
business of democratically elected legislators to come before 
this legislature.  That is all that it requires. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Indeed other jurisdictions have the flexibility to allow such 
business to come before their legislatures.  The mother 
parliament in Westminster passed just such a motion because its 
private members are indeed legislators who can bring issues 
forward for consideration to be voted on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Queen's Park provincial legislature in Ontario passed a 
similar motion because its standing orders allow the same kind of 
flexibility. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We should take a close, long, hard look at our sister 
parliaments, at Westminster, at the Parliament of New Zealand, at 
the Parliament of Australia, at the the congressional system of 
the United States, and there we will see democratically elected 
representatives operating as representatives, operating as 
legislators, operating in the best interests of their 
constituents and not as voting flack for the executive branch of 
government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I call on my colleagues opposite to put up or to shut up.  We 
brought forward a concurrence motion in the fall which would have 
allowed them to make every private members' motion a votable 
motion.  I am sure we will provide them with another opportunity 
to support that kind of fundamental reform so they can actually 
begin to represent their constituents. 
<P><A NAME="LINK203"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Adams (Parliamentary Secretary to Leader of the 
Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I 
am pleased that we are having this debate on the standing orders, 
the rules around which the House of Commons organizes itself. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The standing orders are one of the invisible building blocks 
upon which our society is built and too often we take those 
building blocks for granted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government's highly successful national 
infrastructure program sparked many discussions about the true 
nature of infrastructure in our communities.  Some believe that 
the only real infrastructure is roads and sewers.  Others said 
that theatres, arenas and municipal buildings are equally 
important. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This type of discussion is more important than it might appear 
at first since it encourages us to think about the truly 
important foundations of our communities. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1710"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT86"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT86"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1710

<A HREF="#LINKT85"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>“Infra” of infrastructure simply means under. Therefore the 
term infrastructure means the underpinnings or foundations. If we 
go to the great abandoned cities of past civilizations like 
Pompeii in Italy or Machu Picchu in Peru we find that their 
physical infrastructure, roads, sewers, theatres, arenas, public 
buildings and houses, is still very much in evidence.  Yet these 
are clearly no longer communities.  They died as communities 
while their physical infrastructures, their physical foundations, 
were still in place.  They ceased to exist because their real 
foundations, the critical underpinnings or infrastructures that 
made them communities, failed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact is the real foundations of any community are the 
invisible systems around which people organize themselves, 
including their laws, customs, methods of education and beliefs. 
It is systems such as these that allow people to build and 
maintain the physical structures of their communities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here in the House of Commons we work in the midst of 
extraordinary physical infrastructure, a wonderful chamber in a 
wonderful building.  Yet one day this chamber will be empty, and I 
am not speaking of the long term.  I mean in a year or two. 
This House is going to be moved into the cafeteria of another 
building while this room is renovated.  When that day comes the 
work of the House of Commons will continue as effectively as it 
does here in this wonderful place.  One of the key reasons for 
this is the standing orders, arguably the most important facet of 
the invisible infrastructure on which our parliament is built. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With the standing orders intact we could move the House of 
Commons into a field or a tent and it would work.  Without the 
standing orders we could not function in the most lavish or 
efficient architectural setting. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Parliamentary procedure is the set of rules governing the 
activities of a legislative assembly.  In the Parliament of 
Canada some of these rules are provisions in the Constitution and 
acts of parliament.  For example, the quorum in the House of 
Commons, 20 members, is set in section 48 of the Constitution 
Act, 1867. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Most of the rules are listed in the standing orders of the House 
of Commons, the subject of this debate. Far from being a series 
of unchanging rules, parliamentary procedure, particularly as set 
out in our standing orders, is constantly evolving to adapt the 
capacity of parliament to deal with constantly changing 
environments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The set of rules we know as the standing orders has evolved over 
many centuries, particularly of course since 1867.  Over the 
years this body of rules has had to be durable enough to survive 
the stresses of successive parliaments while being flexible 
enough to fit a great variety of parliamentary situations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the government House leader pointed out earlier in this 
debate, the 35th and 36th parliaments provide excellent examples 
of the strengths and flexibility of our standing orders. In 1993 
one of the largest ever groups of new MPs arrived on Parliament 
Hill.  They came from very diverse backgrounds.  Some had 
previous elected experience at the municipal and provincial 
levels but many found themselves in a parliamentary forum for the 
first time.  That is what democracy is all about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These new members depended on the standing orders as they found 
them to get started with the nation's business.  As the 
parliament unfolded, like parliamentarians before them, the new 
members guided by a minority of experienced members made their 
own adjustments to the standing orders as if they were putting 
their own stamp on them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Amendments made in the 35th parliament are contained in a motion 
by the then government House leader, now Deputy Prime Minister, 
on February 2, 1994.  Those changes included a change to Standing 
Order 73 so that a bill could be referred to committee before 
second reading.  This allows for a form of prestudy of 
legislation. Another was a provision that allows a committee to 
propose and bring in a bill rather than simply dealing with 
legislation referred to it by the House of Commons.  Both these 
changes were designed to strengthen the role of individual MPs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There were also a change in the business of supply to improve 
the consideration of the estimates and a new standing order 
empowering the Standing Committee on Finance to conduct prebudget 
studies each fall.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the purposes of these and other changes was to strengthen 
the role of individual MPs. The 1997 election produced a 
parliament with five official parties, most with a strong 
regional focus.  This was a great challenge for the standing 
orders which were largely developed in two party or three party 
parliaments. The government House leader mentioned this in his 
speech earlier today.  He pointed out what a great test the 
increase in the number of parties was of the strength and 
flexibility of the standing orders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The number of MPs on each committee had to be changed to give 
full representation to the smaller parties.  As this change 
created an increase in the size of each committee, it virtually 
required a decrease in the number of standing committees so that 
MPs and parties could cope with the increased workload. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The appearance of five parties required great change in the 
procedure of question period so that large and small opposition 
parties received their fair share of questions and supplementary 
questions. The five parties required changes in the operation of 
debates in the House, in the order and length of speeches and so 
on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In general, all parties seem to agree that the changes made have 
been very effective.  This parliament is working well for the 
people of Canada.  Once again the House of Commons has adapted to 
a new national political pattern. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The trick with all adaptations of the standing orders is that 
they be effective for the particular parliamentary situation of 
the day without undermining the intrinsic long term strength of 
the standing orders, a foundation of our parliamentary system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Standing Order 51(1) requires that a full scale public debate, 
like this debate, involving all MPs be held at a certain stage of 
each parliament.  This is one of the checks built into the 
standing orders to ensure they cannot be harmed through neglect. 
This rule is a good example of the thought which has gone into 
our standing orders over the years.  It encourages busy MPs to 
put their minds for one day to this important topic. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Over the generations each change in the standing orders has 
required the support of a majority of MPs.  In this parliament 
the active co-operation of five parties was needed.  While 
naturally there have been and still are disagreements among the 
parties and members about particular aspects of the standing 
orders, a feature of this parliament has been the active 
co-operation between the parties where the interests of the House 
of Commons are involved.  Credit should go to the current House 
leaders of all parties.  Most people would agree that particular 
credit should go to the Leader of the Government in the House of 
Commons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Rules of procedure are only as good as the members of parliament 
and their leaders who use and amend them.  The intrinsic strength 
of our standing orders is a reflection of the efforts of 
generations of parliamentarians in Canada and of generations of 
officers of the House of Commons who have watched over the 
standing orders like parents nurturing a child. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am particularly pleased that the government House leader 
indicated that report No. 13 of the Standing Committee on 
Procedure and House Affairs proposing changes to the operation of 
private members' business will be acted upon soon.  These changes 
will further strengthen the role of individual members of 
parliament which has been a continuing theme of the 35th and 36th 
parliaments.  As chair of that committee I thank the standing 
committee and the subcommittee on private members' business for 
their fine work.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mike Scott (Skeena, Ref.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I take the 
opportunity to speak to this motion very seriously.  I begin by 
recognizing some of the things my colleagues said earlier this 
afternoon, things which I think are very appropriate, 
particularly those by the member for Calgary Southeast. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I liken this House and this parliament to a situation I 
encountered not long ago in my riding.  I was visiting a fellow 
in Smithers, British Columbia looking at his pasture and his 
horses.  There was a beautiful horse running through the field. 
I told the fellow it was a beautiful horse.  It was running free 
and the wind was blowing through its mane.  It was obvious that 
it had a lot of spirit. 
He said there was a problem with that horse.  He said he had to 
have it gelded so that it does not produce any offspring.

<A HREF="#LINKT87"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I look at this parliament.  It has all the appearances of a fine 
institution but in fact it is like that horse.  It is neutered. 
This parliament is neutered. MPs have no opportunity to really 
influence or affect what goes on in this House of Commons.  We 
are, except for the executive branch, an impotent institution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It has been said before and it is an often quoted parable by 
Lord Aitken that power corrupts and absolute power corrupts 
absolutely.  It is easy to say that.  Most of us probably agree 
that that is the case at least to a certain point. Let me give a 
graphic example of this truism in action. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What did members of the government on the other side, Liberal 
members, say in opposition in the 33rd and the 34th parliaments 
when the subject of private members' business came up?  They 
fought and they argued and they said that private members' 
business ought to be votable, that when private members, 
backbenchers, take the time, the trouble and the initiative to 
come up with legislation they want to bring into the House that 
at the very least it should be votable. What did the members 
opposite say when they were in opposition in the 33rd and 34th 
parliaments when it came to the authority of committees? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What a joke it is being on a committee in this parliament.  It 
is an absolute embarrassment to me as an MP. I sit on a committee 
as an opposition member. I go there with my ideas.  I try to 
represent not only my party but my ideas and put the best that I 
can forward in that committee.  Other members do that as well, 
including members of the Liberal Party. The committee attempts to 
decide for itself what it ought to do and ought not to do, what 
recommendations it should make to the minister and what 
recommendations ought to go forward, for example what changes 
ought to be made to legislation when we are dealing with 
legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The parliamentary secretary to the minister sits on the 
committee and guess what.  At the end of the day in that 
committee which is dominated by Liberals, and in the previous 
parliaments when the Tories were in power it would have been 
dominated by Tories, the Liberals do what the parliamentary 
secretary instructs them to do.  It is an absolute sham.  It is 
an absolute waste of taxpayers' money.  It is an absolute waste 
of my time as a member of parliament. When I go to the committee 
I am wasting my time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why is it so difficult for the House leaders to get their 
respective members to show up for committee meetings? I will tell 
you why.  It is because the people who show up are not doing 
anything useful and they know it.  Most of the people in this 
room, whether they are on the government benches or in other 
opposition parties, I happen to believe have something to 
contribute, even if I do not agree with their particular 
philosophy. But we are not able to contribute.  We are closed 
off. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our parliament is neutered in a hundred different ways.  It is 
designed that way and is kept that way to make sure that people 
like me, opposition members or Liberal backbenchers, cannot 
affect or influence the outcome of the government's decisions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The only way I have any opportunity to influence what goes on 
here is to hope that in question period I will catch a minister 
off guard or catch a minister on a bad day and end up getting a 
newsclip that night on CTV or CBC or maybe in the <I>Globe and 
Mail</I>. That is going to be my one opportunity as a member in 
this House to achieve something.  Other than that I have no 
opportunity.  I have no avenues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The prime minister and the cabinet do not want to hear from me. 
I am the last person they want to hear from.  The committee 
system is just a way to keep us busy.  It is a way to keep us 
tied up so that we are not actually doing something which might 
interfere with the operations of government, so that we are not 
actually doing something which might get in the way of the plans 
and the intentions of the various cabinet ministers. It is an 
absolute sham. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians may not know every rule.  They may not know everything 
that this House of Commons does. They may not know everything 
about the committee structure. They may not know everything about 
private members' business. 
Many of us had to learn a lot of that after we were elected. I 
submit to this House that Canadians by and large know that their 
parliament is a neutered and ineffective organization. It is 
incapable of operating properly under the present rules. That is 
why the issue of procedure is so important.  It is one way of 
getting at the root cause and one way of making change.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I further submit that there must be a real intention to open up 
the doors and allow power to be shared in this House.  If the 
intent on the part of the executive is to maintain control over 
power, then we are not going to achieve any forward progress on 
this matter.  We can talk about rules, we can talk about 
procedures and we can talk about all the wonderful niceties but 
it is not going anywhere.  Again it is just a waste of our time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the House will bear with me for a minute, I would like to 
quote some of the things that members who are now cabinet 
ministers had to say while in opposition.  This is what the 
Liberals said on time allocation when in opposition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Winnipeg South, who is now a cabinet minister, 
said while in opposition that using closure “displays the utter 
disdain with which this government treats the Canadian people”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Glengarry—Prescott—Russell said “I am shocked. 
This is just terrible.  This time we are talking about a major 
piece of legislation.  Shame on those Tories across the way”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Kingston and the Islands said “What we have here 
is an absolute scandal in terms of the government's unwillingness 
to listen to the representatives of the people in this House. 
Never before have we had a government so reluctant to engage in 
public discussion on the bills brought before this House”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have another quote by the member for Kingston and the Islands. 
While in opposition and talking about the use of closure and time 
allocation he said “I suggest that the government's approach to 
legislating is frankly a disgrace.  It cuts back the time the 
House is available to sit and then it applies closure to cut off 
debate”.  That is a quote from the member for Kingston and the 
Islands.  He is still a member of the House but now he is on the 
government side and guess what?  His opinion has changed.  It is 
now fine to use time allocation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is what Lord Aitken meant when he said that power corrupts 
and absolute power corrupts absolutely.  Once the Liberal Party 
became government and got its hands on the lever of power its 
principles changed.  I do not believe it is the people.  I 
believe it is the whole philosophy behind the government in this 
country going right back to 1867.  It has to change.  The people 
of this country are demanding that it change. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can talk about changing the rules and procedures which is 
fine and well, but until we develop a real will to change the 
system we will not have MPs satisfied with the jobs they are 
doing in this House.  We will not have a real sharing of power. 
We will not have legitimate debates that mean anything in this 
House that will actually change the course of legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the end what we will have is democratic dictatorships where 
we elect a new dictator once every four or five years.  Frankly, 
I do not think going into the 21st century that Canadians are 
going to find that very acceptable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B>  It being 5.30 p.m., 
it is my duty to inform the House that the time for the 
proceedings on the motion has expired.

<P><A NAME="LINK227"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lynn Myers (Waterloo—Wellington, Lib.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, I am pleased to be able to speak today to Bill C-216, an 
act to amend the Access to Information Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1981 when the bill which led to our existing Access to 
Information Act was passed, it was clear the legislators of the 
day had a strong desire to create a new era of government 
openness and accountability.  Today there is no question that 
government is open, transparent and accountable to Canadians, 
thanks to the Access to Information Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While the legislators of 1981 saw fit to exclude a number of 
crown corporations, since making their information accessible 
would possibly harm the public interests, these excluded 
institutions nevertheless have managed to become open, 
transparent and accountable themselves through means other than 
the Access to Information Act.  Our Access to Information Act 
deserves credit for creating a culture of openness which 
permeates the public sector regardless of whether this or that 
public corporation is subject to access laws. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All branches of government are aware of how highly valued 
openness and accountability have become.  Their daily operations 
are guided by that awareness.  Given the kind of public sector we 
have today, the proposed amendment looks like an excessive, 
unnecessary and possibly even hazardous venture. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us discuss Canada Post for the next few minutes, especially 
since the member opposite thinks it makes such a compelling 
argument for revising the act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What do Canadians need to know about Canada Post?  Do they need 
to know, for example, how federal assets are managed?  Of course 
they do.  However they already receive that information from 
sources such as the corporation's annual report and the corporate 
plan summary.  They also receive this information when corporate 
officials are questioned by members of parliament from both sides 
of the House at their regular appearances before parliamentary 
committees. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The members who took part in the February 17 meeting of the 
natural resources and government operations committee can attest 
to the frankness of the discussion when the minister responsible 
for Canada Post and the president of Canada Post answered 
questions on a broad range of subjects. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Do they need to know whether Canada Post cross-subsidizes?  Yes, 
but Canadians already have that answer after several independent 
audits have investigated the allegation.  Most important, 
Canadians can count on getting an annual answer to that question 
not by virtue of new federal legislation but rather by virtue of 
Canada Post's decision to begin reporting its financial results 
on a segmented basis, product line by product line, beginning 
with its 1996-97 annual report.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Do they need to know if Canada Post is open about the handling 
of their complaints or concerns?  Absolutely and certainly.  It 
was for that very reason that the first Canada Post ombudsman was 
named last August.  Thanks to this impartial public advocate 
Canadians will now have new recourse if they feel their 
complaints have not been adequately dealt with. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the ombudsman's investigations find that further recourse is 
possible the individual will get a fair treatment, and rightly 
so, which he or she would deserve.  If the opposite is found then 
the individual will be able to resist and rest assured that 
Canada Post did its utmost to accommodate them.  I fail to see 
what the member's sweeping amendment would add to that process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Frankly, I find it surprising that a party which has always 
proclaimed itself as wanting less rather than more should embark 
on a campaign now to create bureaucrat obstacles to the 
successful management of crown corporations.  It is all the more 
surprising given the Reform Party's platform which advocates the 
privatization of Canada Post.  Clearly, Reform thinks Canada Post 
should become less and not more of a concern to Canadians.  So 
which is it?  We have become used to hearing contradictions from 
the other side of the House and we have yet another example 
before us today on this matter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When he spoke of Bill C-216 during the earlier debate my hon. 
colleague from Mississauga South warned us of the unintended 
consequences of the bill.  I agree with him that we have to be 
very, very careful of there not being such consequences.  Let me 
remind the member, as well as all members who may be enticed by 
the bill, that where Canada Post and other crown corporations are 
concerned Bill C-216 is a solution in search of a problem.  We 
all know that a certain road to a certain place is paved with 
good intentions, but I would caution all members in the House 
against travelling down that road. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By enacting this sweeping amendment to the Access to Information 
Act I believe big business would profit long before ordinary 
Canadians.  In Canada Post's case the corporation would be placed 
at an obvious disadvantage while its competitors would be able to 
collect the information which would allow them to devise 
tailor-made competitive strategics against it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under the disclosure environment the member is proposing these 
competitors would be under no obligation and certainly no 
encouragement to release the same information about themselves. 
With this kind of inequality in the marketplace the demise of 
Canada Post would not be very far behind. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wonder what favour the member thinks he would be doing 
Canadians by removing a key competitor in the area of message and 
parcel conveyance.  I wonder how the member could explain to 
Canadians how less competition is a good thing, especially when 
no Canada Post competitor provides service from coast to coast to 
coast. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians have a committed public corporation in Canada Post, a 
corporation dedicated to providing all Canadians with basic 
service whether they live in Tofino or Port Alberni.  The 
member's bill does nothing but threaten the very foundation of 
that commitment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What about the expense of managing the flood of requests that 
would confront any crown corporation operating in a competitive 
environment should the bill become law?  Did the hon. member 
think about that when drafting his proposals?  Is it true that 
Canadians have a vested interest in crown corporations since the 
government is the sole shareholder?  That is true. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The time and expense of processing access to information 
requests and defending the application of exemptions to corporate 
records cannot be justified. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To amend a piece of legislation you need better reasons than to 
say that some crown corporations must comply with the Access to 
Information Act while others are exempt. Before considering such 
a drastic measure, the public interest would have to be in 
jeopardy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not see any proof of that with regard to Canada Post and 
other crown corporations exempt from the Access to Information 
Act. I have heard no compelling argument to apply the act to 
corporations that are already open and transparent.

<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For these reasons I cannot support a bill that would cause more 
harm than good to these institutions and the Canadians they 
serve.  I would ask that all members do likewise. 
<P><A NAME="LINK228"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Wendy Lill (Dartmouth, NDP):</B>  Madam Speaker, I rise to 
speak today to Bill C-216, an act to amend the Access to 
Information Act.  The amendment aims at changing the definition 
of government institutions in the Access to Information Act to 
include any department or ministry of the Government of Canada, 
any body or office listed or any crown corporation as defined in 
the Administration Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I support the spirit of the bill if the spirit is indeed to 
provide Canadians with greater access and knowledge about the 
operations of government.  As a New Democrat I support greater 
access to information and greater accountability of government 
for spending decisions.  I hope that everyone in the House feels 
the same. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, I would like to see an amendment to the bill which 
would exclude the CBC from its jurisdiction.  The reasons which 
make this exclusion necessary are obvious.  If the CBC were to be 
subject to the Access to Information Act it would no longer be 
able to operate as a public broadcaster at arm's length from the 
government.  This would undermine the legitimacy and credibility 
of the CBC which is mandated by parliament to provide a public 
broadcasting system pursuant to the Broadcasting Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If Bill C-216 defines the CBC as a government institution then 
any information the CBC has in its possession would be accessible 
to everyone.  This could seriously hurt journalistic credibility 
and it would seriously hurt the public's access to important 
information which we depend on our public broadcaster to provide. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me make a case in point.  Last month the CBC did an 
excellent series of radio documentaries on the growing influence 
of the Hells Angels in Canadian society.  This program would not 
have seen the light of day if dozens of individuals had not been 
guaranteed anonymity.  Their safety, their lives and the lives of 
their families depended on the anonymity provided by the 
corporation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Current affairs and news programming depend on an intricate 
system of secure information, guaranteeing sources, building up 
contacts and guaranteeing confidentiality.  All of these 
processes would be made impossible if the CBC became open to 
scrutiny under the Access to Information Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under the bill in its present form, the CBC would no longer be 
able to protect its sources.  All past, present and future 
records under all CBC departments would be subject to access 
applications.  A public broadcaster cannot operate in this 
fashion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is not to say that the operations of the CBC should remain 
outside of public scrutiny.  The CBC is fully accountable in 
terms of providing information to parliament and to the Canadian 
public.  There are ways of holding the CBC accountable which do 
not undermine the very mandate with which it has been charged. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If adopted in its present form, Bill C-216 would substantially 
impede the CBC's journalistic and programming capabilities.  I 
will therefore not be able to support it. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK229"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Antoine Dubé (Lévis, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, it is my turn to 
speak on this subject and, like the other Bloc MPs, I must say I 
am in favour of this bill because it is aimed at providing MPs 
and the general public with greater access to information. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill has only one clause, which extends it to all crown 
corporations, since a number of these are currently excluded, 
such as the CBC, to which my colleague has referred, the 
Canadian Wheat Board and Canada Post. It is intended to avoid 
any ambiguity. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1840"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT98"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, a schedule to the present act calls for the 20 
departments currently in existence within the federal government 
to be listed specifically, along with 109 government 
organizations or agencies.  In order to be really sure that some 
crown corporations are not left out, there is also the Financial 
Administration Act, which applies to all crown agencies 
reporting to the federal government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It seems to me that this is a good idea.  First of all, the 
present legislation has some things in it which reassure me. 
The desire is to extend it to all crown corporations, but it 
must be kept in mind that protection of personal information 
comes under another act.  We know that act prevents the release 
of any kind of personal information, particularly in the case to 
which my colleague referred. 
The purpose is to protect any information concerning private 
citizens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As far as businesses are concerned, as soon as there is a 
question of commercial relations, of competition, there are also 
provisions to protect companies, even the three crown 
corporations currently under discussion, which would now be 
subject to the act.  The others are already covered and are 
protected in the event of business competition.  I have trouble 
understanding the reservations some colleagues may have with 
this, as it is clear in the Privacy Act and the Access to 
Information Act that they are protected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another reason we are in favour of this bill is that a committee 
was struck to include all parties in the House, the Standing 
Committee on Justice.  It began to study the whole matter in 
March 1987, at which time it was already recommending extension 
of the Access to Information Act to all crown corporations. 
So, this goes back a long way. And all parties were represented. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The CBC in particular argued in its brief to the committee that 
the corporation felt it was being targeted by the Access to 
Information Act and claimed to be restricted with respect to a 
number of programs it planned to broadcast. Arguments similar to 
those I mentioned earlier were put forward. The disclosure of 
any form of personal information was prohibited under the law. 
This meant that the CBC would be protected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, while in favour of extending the bill to all crown 
corporations, I have a number of concerns. As a member of 
Parliament, I asked several of my colleagues from different 
parties how long it takes to obtain information under the 
current access to information legislation. It depends on the 
subject of course. 
Those who managed to obtain information under this act in less 
than three weeks or 20 days were few and far between. Some said 
it could take as long as three months. That is quite a long 
time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Often, while not refusing to provide the information requested, 
the access to information commission will ask for further 
details, thus delaying the process even further. I do not think 
it is in the public interest to allow this to go on any longer. 
However, the bill put forward by our colleague from the Reform 
Party does not go that far. It simply seeks to apply the bill to 
a few more corporations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me give you another example. Given the time it takes the 
access to information commission to provide information—it can 
take up to three months, as I said—some government service 
policies were established. 
For instance, it is the policy of the former Federal Office of 
Regional Development for Quebec, or FORD-Q, now known as the 
Economic Development for Quebec Regions Agency, to wait three 
months before providing information like the name of companies 
benefiting from a government program. That is a very long time.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In many cases, the grant or loan is awarded. Even in the present 
situation this gives very little opportunity, for instance to an 
opposition MP or even the media, to acquire information, given 
the turnaround time.  Since it takes so long, people are often 
going to give up trying to find out, and just let it go. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my capacity as the member for Lévis, in the fall of 1996 I 
was involved with a subsidy for the building of a vessel for the 
Department of National Defence.  The Lévis shipyard had made a 
tender but was not selected, it seems, as the top bidder. 
I tried to analyze their tender.  I can tell you that this was 
back in August 1996 and at that time, because it was related to 
defence, we managed to get some of the information, but 85% of 
what I would have been interested in was deleted.  They said 
that these parts revealed defence equipment specifications, or 
contained data that could be harmful to the competitive nature 
of a manufacturer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the present time, the system we have is far from perfectly 
accessible.  On the contrary, because of the delays, the 
mechanisms, the exclusions set out in so many legal provisions, 
it is difficult to obtain all the information requested. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to take advantage of the fact that there has just 
been a vote to state that it is most unacceptable for anyone in 
this House to want to vote against Bill C-208.  It was finally 
adopted with the support of the majority, but this was a bill 
that called for penalties for falsifying or concealing official 
documents.  I am somewhat concerned to see that some people 
would not want to see information as freely available as the 
public would like it to be.  I am astonished that the NDP, a 
party I respect greatly for its defence of social causes in 
general, for its defence of citizens, would object to the 
public's having easier access to information.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Pankiw (Saskatoon—Humboldt, Ref.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, I am pleased to have the opportunity to rise today in 
the House and speak in favour of Bill C-216 which has been 
introduced by my colleague from Nanaimo—Alberni. Bill C-216 
would make all crown corporations subject to the Access to 
Information Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As it now stands, some crown corporations are subject to the act 
while others are not.  For instance while the ports of Halifax 
and Montreal are exempt from access to information, other ports 
are not. Canada Post, the CBC, the Export Development Corporation 
and the Canada Lands Company are also shielded from access to 
information requests. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What Bill C-216 does is bring some measure of public 
accountability to these crown corporations. While they receive 
taxpayers' dollars, taxpayers have no right to delve into 
particular aspects of the operation of those corporations. Surely 
everyone can recognize the unfairness of the present situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During the 1993 campaign the Liberals promised openness and 
transparency in government.  However, five years later they have 
still kept this veil of secrecy over particular crown 
corporations.  The Liberal cabinet has consistently argued that 
some organizations cannot be open to access to information 
because it would place them at a competitive disadvantage.  They 
argue that their competitors could access sensitive information 
about their operations. This is simply not the case. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As was pointed out in December when Bill C-216 was in its first 
hour of debate, section 18 of the Access to Information Act 
allows the withholding of financial, commercial, scientific or 
technical information.  Anything the corporation deems to be 
sensitive or of substantial value does not have to be disclosed. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1850"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT100"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Section 18(b) of the act specifically states that what does not 
have to be revealed is “information the disclosure of which 
could reasonably be expected to prejudice the competitive 
position of a government institution”.  I cannot see how this 
could be any clearer.  I also cannot see how cabinet expects us 
to swallow its story about placing crown corporations at a 
competitive disadvantage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-216 is about accountability and the public's right to 
know how their dollars are being spent.  When Canada sold Candu 
reactors to China the financing was handled through the Export 
Development Corporation.  The Export Development Corporation is a 
lending institution backed by taxpayers' dollars.  Essentially we 
lent taxpayer money to China so that it could use it to buy 
Canadian reactors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This unusual way of structuring foreign purchases of Canadian 
products raised concerns among many taxpayers.  However, getting 
to the bottom of this deal and answering the legitimate concerns 
of taxpayers is impossible since the EDC is not subject to the 
Access to Information Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have heard similar concerns in the west as it applies to the 
Canadian Wheat Board.  While Bill C-4 will remove crown 
corporation status from the wheat board, the bill has yet to pass 
the Senate and so the board to this day remains a crown 
corporation and thereby is exempt from access to information 
requests. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Farmers cannot get any information relating to grain sales, 
sales contracts or administrative and general expenses.  They 
cannot get any information as to why the board has been unable to 
collect some $7 billion in overdue payments from particular 
countries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada Post has also come under fire because of its exemption 
from the Access to Information Act.  Competitors have complained 
that the Canadian post office uses its mail monopoly to 
cross-subsidize its courier company Purolator.  Canada Post 
denies that this is happening but it also refuses to completely 
open its books to public scrutiny. Canada Post is able to 
cross-subsidize and then deny it in the face of competitors' 
complaints. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Radwanski report released in October 1996 did a complete 
mandate review of Canada Post.  The report recommended that 
Canada Post be opened up to public scrutiny.  Recommendation No. 
30 of the Radwanski report reads “that Canada Post Corporation 
be made subject to the freedom of information act and to annual 
audit by the auditor general”.  As with many recommendations in 
that report, the Liberals simply ignored it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was pleased to note that during the first hour of debate on 
the bill, the bill received support from most parties in the 
House.  Liberal backbenchers supported it, the Bloc Quebecois 
spoke in favour of it and the Conservatives offered support in 
principle. It is encouraging to see that parties in the House can 
support good legislation coming through private members' 
business. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The situation reminds me of a similar circumstance involving a 
bill from the member for Sarnia—Lambton.  The member introduced 
a bill that would ban negative option marketing.  It had the 
support of the House but like C-216 it was denounced by cabinet. 
That is a strong statement in itself with respect to how 
government runs, its structure and the influence of individual 
MPs.  That is a debate for another day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am just simply pleased that the majority of parties in this 
House can see the need for Bill C-216 and are prepared to support 
it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>John Grace, the information commissioner, said of Bill C-216 
“It will make citizens better able to judge the performance of 
their governments and more informed voters.  The guarantee of 
public access to government documents is indispensable in the 
long run for any democratic society”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In a democracy there can never be enough public scrutiny, never 
enough accountability.  Bill C-216 provides more public scrutiny 
and more accountability.  It can only serve to strengthen our 
democratic system and our institutions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am looking forward to the vote on this bill. I urge all 
members of the House to vote in favour of this very important 
piece of legislation.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The Access to Information Act provides certain basic rights to 
Canadians.  I am proud of the fact that Canada has been 
considered a world leader in this field since the act was 
proclaimed in July 1993. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Citizens have an unprecedented right of access to federal 
government records. Valuable concomitant privacy protection is 
afforded by the companion legislation, the Privacy Act. 
Government departments and agencies annually respond to between 
12,000 and 13,000 requests under the Access to Information Act 
and to approximately 40,000 requests under the Privacy Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada now has about 15 years of experience with and scrutiny of 
the Access to Information Act. I welcome this opportunity to 
discuss means by which this legislation can be improved. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This private members' bill proposes to subject all federal crown 
corporations to the Access to Information Act and would 
accomplish this by changing the definition of government 
institution in section 3 of the present act.  The present 
definition refers to “any department or ministry of state of the 
Government of Canada listed in schedule I or any body or office 
listed in schedule I”.  Bill C-216, which we are debating today, 
adds to the definition “any crown corporation as defined in the 
Financial Administration Act”.  The passage of this bill would 
summarily bring more than 20 additional federal institutions and 
agencies under access legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am convinced that the intent of this bill is laudable in that 
its objective is to enhance the accountability of government 
organizations.  I also subscribe, as I know do all of my 
colleagues in the House, to more openness in government and to 
the opportunity for us as citizens to have more information.  But 
I believe a negative impact on the commercial interests of crown 
corporations will result from this bill if it passes. This 
negative impact would largely outweigh any possible support in my 
mind. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must remember that crown corporations have been created as 
the result of a deliberate choice of the Parliament of Canada to 
deliver particular programs and to deliver particular services by 
means of organizations other than the private sector or 
traditional departments and agencies of government.  These 
corporations have a responsibility to serve the public interest 
but to do so within a commercial environment.  This means that to 
the greatest extent possible they must be permitted to operate on 
a level playing field with their competitors, free from 
administrative burdens associated with other government 
bureaucracies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In our previous debates on this matter, several issues have been 
raised.  We have considered various exemptions within the current 
legislation that might provide adequate protection for the 
business interests of crown corporations.  Section 18 has been 
cited by the proponents of this private members' bill as a 
possible means of protection, and I use the term possible 
advisedly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would suggest though that section 18 provides only a 
discretionary exemption.  It allows federal institutions to 
withhold information, the release of which would be injurious to 
the commercial interests of those organizations and more 
importantly to the interests of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There appears though to be no agreement as to whether the act in 
its current form or even as amended by this bill offers the 
necessary protection to the commercial interests of various crown 
corporations. We therefore have to turn to the obvious questions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Are we prepared to jeopardize the financial viability of these 
organizations by subjecting them to this legislation without 
first consulting to determine what unique factors exist within 
their market environments?  Further, are we prepared to risk 
injury to the public interests that crown corporations serve by 
not first ensuring that we have adopted the appropriate 
protective mechanisms for their operations? I am not certain we 
should be taking risks like these unnecessarily. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wish to address the issue of the administrative burden and the 
concept of the level playing field. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Access to Information Act imposes a costly administrative 
burden on institutions.  It is one thing for a government 
department to assume these burdens.  It is quite another thing 
for a venture that is supposed to be commercially viable to do 
so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>According to recent statistics it costs on average more than 
$1,000 to complete a request submitted under the current 
legislation.  These same statistics show that federal departments 
and agencies recoup less than 1% of the cost of providing 
information to applicants.

</I></B></P><P align=left>In the commercial world this is not good business.  In the 
context of overhead it automatically places crown corporations at 
a competitive disadvantage with their private sector 
counterparts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I refer to the level playing field, I am referring to the 
fact that providing a right of access to information held by 
crown corporations could make them vulnerable to unscrupulous 
competitors.  Some could view this right as an opportunity to 
submit unreasonable and voluminous requests, as has been the 
experience of some government agencies, particularly in the 
provincial sphere.  I am thinking now with respect to access to 
information requests. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even if the corporation is ultimately able to protect its 
sensitive information, the processing activities associated with 
responding to a barrage of requests could be crippling. 
Processing charges for applicants, which are stipulated within 
the access to information regulations, are minimal.  There are 
many private sector companies with very deep pockets.  They could 
sustain a very long and costly campaign without fear of 
retribution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The same problem would not happen with a private commercial 
venture.  There is no Access to Information Act that would allow 
someone to harass them or to go after them for a prolonged period 
of time with voluminous requests. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In summary, I want to emphasize four points concerning crown 
corporations and the potential impact of Bill C-216. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, crown corporations were created to serve the public 
interests in a commercial rather than in a bureaucratic or 
heavily regulated environment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, at this time the provisions of the Access to Information 
Act as presently drafted would not guarantee adequate protection 
for the commercial interests of crown corporations if this 
amendment were to pass. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Third, subjecting corporations to access legislation could 
impose an undue and unfair administrative burden on their 
operations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, failing to consult crown corporations to determine 
their market environments in advance of scheduling them under 
this act would expose them, in my view, to unnecessary 
competitive risks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We all appreciate the intent of Bill C-216.  Although I favour 
more openness in government, I cannot accept this bill.  I 
believe it is too simplistic a solution for a complicated 
problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to thank the hon. member for bringing this bill forward 
and giving us the opportunity to debate this issue.  It is timely 
that he did so today because, by coincidence, the justice 
committee had an opportunity to meet with the commissioner.  This 
bill, while it may be a good start, is too simplistic a solution. 
I think it was H.L. Mencken who said that for every complicated 
problem there is a simplistic solution and it usually does not 
work.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. André Bachand (Richmond—Arthabaska, PC):</B> Madam Speaker, 
first, let me say that we will support Bill C-216, since it is a 
step in the right direction. I was very surprised by the 
comments of the government member who just spoke, putting a 
price on democracy. There is indeed a price to be paid for 
democracy. However, it is not an expenditure, but an investment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is very surprising to see that Bill C-216 would not be 
supported for reasons of money. The government invests hundreds 
of millions in democracy, and it should fulfil that financial 
commitment to the end. 
I am extremely surprised that this bill will not be supported 
for financial reasons. I am surprised and very disappointed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other argument raised by the government is that the act may 
not be able to include all crown corporations. If so, why is the 
government not prepared to review the whole legislation? We must 
first include everyone, put everyone in the same boat. Everyone 
must be covered by the same act, the Access to Information Act. 
If sections 18, 19 and 20 are incomplete, then let us work on 
them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We cannot oppose Bill C-216. It is simply not possible. The 
moment there is a link with the federal government—whether 
monetary or historical—it means there once was a financial link 
and we must be able to conduct some audits. 
Several sections of the Access to Information Act are complete, 
including those that protect individuals, competitiveness, trade 
secrets, and so on.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think we can be very open, but the government should stop 
saying it is against Bill C-216 for whatever reason, such as the 
cost, the fact that sections of the act would have to be changed 
or that crown corporations have not been consulted.  Yet they 
know there are access-to-information changes in the works. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We could simply look at the whole picture, but I am convinced 
that we must support Bill C-216 before us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is also surprising about the Access to Information Act, to 
broaden the debate a bit, is that it is actually difficult to 
obtain information. 
The purpose of Bill C-216 is to increase the number of crown 
corporations in respect of which a request for information may 
be made.  The fact remains that eventually the legislation will 
have to be amended, because information is very difficult to 
obtain. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The workings of justice in Canada are a little strange: one is 
innocent until proven guilty.  Under the Access to Information 
Act, corporations interpret the act and rely on a particular 
section of it not to provide the information requested. 
Therefore, to prove a point, one must turn to the courts.  The 
effect of this is to slow down the access-to-information process, 
meaning that the ordinary citizen who requests information 
stands a good chance of spending many years and incredible 
amounts of money to obtain a snippet of information. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At some point, the House is going to have to take a proper look 
at this, with a view to amending the Access to Information Act 
and making it complete. 
Naturally, with the globalization of markets, we must admittedly 
be careful, but Bill C-216 must under no circumstances jeopardize 
crown corporations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, what Bill C-216 is proposing is that Canadian taxpayers' 
money not be jeopardized.  There must therefore be an audit 
system for going after information.  We must ensure that the 
auditor can go after information without harming the 
competitiveness and profitability of corporations.  So much the 
better if they are profitable, we all agree.  However, let us 
hope for a little more leeway to go after information and pass 
it on to people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the House, members' expenses are a matter of public record. 
We pay attention to how we spend, because we know that the 
information in our budgets can be made public. 
You tend to be a little more careful. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This reaction is natural. A crown corporation which is not 
currently subject to the act might change the way it operates if 
it is included in the act. The $1,000 which was suggested does 
not mean you cannot get your money back. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was mayor in a municipality, we were bound by the Access to 
Information Act and we complied with it. The act might be 
expensive for crown corporations, but private corporations also 
have publishing expenses related to their annual financial 
statements, shareholders meetings, and so on. There is no reason 
to get excited about that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, the Progressive Conservative Party will support 
Bill C-216. But again, we must go further. The context has 
changed a lot since the act was first introduced. 
Again, globalization should prompt Parliament to consider 
amendments to certain sections to better protect crown 
corporations, of course, but also the population as a whole. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B> Pursuant to the order made 
earlier this day, the House is deemed to have divided on the

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lynn Myers (Waterloo—Wellington, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
it appears that there is a growing movement both nationally and 
internationally to have jails and/or correctional facilities 
privatized.  We see this happening more and more. 
I note, for example, that New Brunswick, Ontario and Nova Scotia 
are experimenting with jails planned, constructed and operated by 
private interests.  Meanwhile I also note that the United States, 
Britain, Australia and New Zealand have more than 130 proposed or 
completed correctional facilities with varying degrees of private 
involvement.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some advocates who favour privatization argue that privatization 
can result in significant cost savings, fewer problems with 
inmates and better rehabilitation and education programs. 
Opponents, on the other hand, contend that privatization benefits a 
handful of large companies at the expense of long term public 
safety.  They argue that the private sector has an incentive to 
keep prisons full to gain maximum profit, reducing the incentive 
to reform offenders, seek alternatives to jail or support crime 
prevention programs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There have been some studies done in this area and it is 
interesting to note that some evaluations indicate that private 
prisons can yield savings of between 5% and 30% largely through 
smaller payroll costs.  However, other studies, including a 1996 
report by the United States general accounting office, found 
conflicting evidence on what to expect from privatization in the 
way of costs and quality of service. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All this means that privatization is a contentious issue.  It 
clearly needs to be weighed out carefully before proceeding.  The 
pros and cons must be carefully considered prior to any move to 
privatize prisons and/or correctional facilities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My question to the solicitor general is quite simple.  Is 
privatization worth trying or are prisons best left in the hands 
of the public sector? 
<P><A NAME="LINK237"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Nick Discepola (Parliamentary Secretary to Solicitor 
General of Canada, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I congratulate the 
member for Waterloo—Wellington.  I have been parliamentary 
secretary for a little over two years and I have never had to 
replace the minister in the late show as often as I have in the 
past session.  Both times have been because of the member's 
interest and I know he is very tenacious and I compliment him on 
this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member has made a very clear case and a lot of the concerns 
he has expressed I share and I know the minister shares.  I want 
to reassure the member for Waterloo—Wellington that the ministry 
of the solicitor general is in no way considering privatizing 
correctional services.  We have to date almost 12% of certain 
aspects of corrections being privatized.  I do not think the hon. 
member would argue that maybe laundry facilities or fire 
protection equipment, services of that nature, might be 
privatized. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The examples he has cited, especially in the United States, of 
privatizing certain facilities have certainly not demonstrated 
that they are successful in actually reducing costs.  I agree 
with him that we have to be very prudent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is one other point that has not been addressed. I would be 
very concerned if we are going to move and transfer the power to 
actually punish citizens in the hands of the private sector. That 
to me is a very serious concern, more than the actual cost 
factor. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to reassure the hon. member that there is no interest on 
behalf of the solicitor general to privatize correctional 
services facilities. If we were to do such a thing, I am sure 
there would be a full debate and an inquiry into the pros and 
cons of it.  That would have to be done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B>  The motion to adjourn 
the House is now deemed to have been adopted.  Accordingly, this 
House stands adjourned until tomorrow at 2 p.m., pursuant to 
Standing Order 24(1). 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(The House adjourned at 7.12 p.m.)
