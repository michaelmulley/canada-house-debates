regional economic development agency, on a highly successful 
youth internship program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Designed to promote the employment of recent college and

community economic development, market research and the 
application of new business technologies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Industry Canada through FedNor has invested nearly $1.5 million 
this year in northern Ontario youth internships.  In fact, an 
investment of over $69,000 in internship funding was announced in 
my riding just last week. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The best news of all is that FedNor's funding was stabilized in 
the 1998 federal budget, meaning young northern Ontarians will 
benefit from this internship program for years to come.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Myron Thompson (Wild Rose, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
everyone here in the House of Commons will be receiving a letter 
from Keith Addy who is with us today in the gallery. Keith was a 
security guard from Ottawa who was in a coma after a hit and run 
by young offenders.  The accident left him unable to fulfil his 
dreams of becoming a police officer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope that you all will take time to respond to this young man. 
I think he deserves more than just a form letter from the 
government benches. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The following are some excerpts from his letter:  “I have 
become, due to the intentional actions of a group of young 
offenders in July 1996, a victim.  I did not choose this 
notoriety, it was thrust upon me that morning and has changed my 
life forever. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>“Will incidents like mine be properly dealt with by the law?  I 
think not, so long as the government fails to punish young people 
in a meaningful way for their crimes.  All we victims ask for is 
justice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>“Our Minister of Justice and the rest of the federal government 
need to hear that the public is calling out for the Young 
Offenders Act to be abolished.  The present amendments made to 
the YOA are by no means sufficient and the time to act is long 
overdue”.

They emerge from the program with a better understanding of the

are made more productive.  Participants win because they acquire

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Elsie Wayne (Saint John, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to once again address this government's lack of compassion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Early this morning, merchant navy veterans began to arrive on 
the Hill and two of them are up here in the gallery today.  They 
arrived to protest the absence of the minister's promised 
legislation.  This legislation was to make these veterans equal 
with all veterans in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the minister stopped this morning to speak to the veterans, 
he was asked about compensation.  His reply was “We cannot turn 
back the clock”.  Thank God these brave soldiers did not turn 
back in World War II. Instead, they fought for our freedom and 
were never given any meaningful recognition for their role. These 
men and women may perish on the steps of Parliament Hill but the 
freedom they gave to us will never die. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is my hope that the government will show some compassion soon 
and not turn its back on these vets as it did on the innocent 
victims of hepatitis C.

</H3><P align=left>

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Guimond 
(Beauport—Montmorency—Côte-de-Beaupré—île-d'Orléans, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
I am pleased to point out to you that my riding will now have a 
new name, one which will task your memory, but which better 
reflects the nature of the riding.  That name is 
Beauport—Montmorency—Côte-de-Beaupré—île-d'Orléans. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will explain the characteristics of this designation: 
Beauport refers to the city in the centre of the riding; 
Montmorency refers to the majestic Montmorency Falls, which I 
would remind you are higher than Niagara Falls; the name Beaupré 
refers to the magnificent landscapes along that part of the 
shores of the St Lawrence, and reminds us of the part it played 
in the first colonization by the French in America; finally, Île 
d'Orléans, immortalized by our famous poet Félix Leclerc, is 
where the highest concentration of 17th century houses and the 
best strawberries in America can be found. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>From now on, whenever the name of my riding is heard in the 
House of Commons, I know that I shall be the envy of my 
distinguished colleagues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I invite all members to come and see for themselves how true my 
claims for the riding are.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Angela Vautour (Beauséjour—Petitcodiac, NDP):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, women across this country have been waiting 14 years for 
government to recognize pay equity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Federal employees have been waiting far too long.  It is 
unacceptable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me tell the House about one of these employees.  For 25 
years Marie Ann Wry from Sackville in my riding was a loyal 
federal employee working at the Dorchester Penitentiary.  She 
strongly believed in pay equity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1992, concerned about the Conservative stalling tactics to 
implement pay equity, she wrote to the leader of the opposition, 
now our Prime Minister.  The leader of the opposition replied 
that a Liberal government would try to promote greater equality 
in the public service and Canadian society in general. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That letter was really important to Ms. Wry.  She held on to 
this letter until her death last January.  Until her last day she 
was hoping the Liberals would honour pay equity.  It was in vain.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. George Proud (Hillsborough, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is 
my pleasure today to bring to the attention of this House the 
outstanding bravery of two members of the Canadian forces.  On 
November 12, 1996 an individual on a Danish trawler near 
Resolution Island lay critically ill.  To save his life two 
search and rescue technicians from Greenwood made a dangerous and 
unprecedented night parachute jump into freezing arctic waters. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They could easily have said no but Master Corporal Keith 
Mitchell and Master Corporal Brian Pierce made the daring 
decision to jump when bad weather forced the original rescue team 
to land their helicopter. They battled three-metre waves and high 
winds that carried them away from the vessel.  Struggling to stay 
afloat, the two men fought off the beginnings of hypothermia 
until a Zodiac picked them up. After the harrowing experience 
they stabilized the critically ill man's condition, saving his 
life. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For their efforts each were awarded the Cross of Valour, 
Canada's highest decoration for bravery in peacetime.  These two 
people represent the type of men and women who serve the Canadian 
forces and face adversity with courage.  Congratulations to them 
both.

the presentation of 311 films from 53 countries over 10 days.  I 
am most proud of the fact that 26 Canadian feature films and 42

</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to extend my congratulations to Mr. Piers Handling, 
festival director, who was bestowed the insignia of Chevalier des

September 15.  Through the hard work of individuals such as Mr. 
Handling, the film festival has become a truly impressive 
showcase of talent to the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadian film making has always provided a lens through which to 
gain insight into our unique Canadian culture.  The Toronto

us with a forum to display our outstanding facilities, talented 
industry workers and extremely knowledgeable audience.  I am 
delighted to rise today—

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):</B>  Mr.

from peaceful protesters, it was from armed bodyguards 
surrounding dictator Suharto of Indonesia.

for carrying signs.  Five of them became so violent they 
actually had to be arrested themselves.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Preston Manning:</B>  Five were arrested, Mr. Speaker. 
The rest were not and none of them were pepper sprayed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Surely it is the responsibility of the Prime Minister to stand 
up for human rights, at least at home, and not to fluff the 
pillow for some foreign dictator. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What Canadians do not understand is why the Prime Minister went 
to such extraordinary lengths for a foreign dictator who is 
reviled in his own country, even suppressing the rights of 
Canadians in order to protect him simply from embarrassment.

the President of the United States, the Prime Minister of 
Australia, the Prime Minister of Malaysia, the Prime Minister of 
Japan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We had a system to make sure that they could come to the APEC

Suharto and the attack on the Canadian students.

it has asked two members of my staff to appear.  They have

the process of renewing and strengthening the health protection

out the principles we want Canadians to consider.  There are 
public hearings being held now across the country.  Winnipeg 
tomorrow.  Halifax earlier this month. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are identifying a need for leading edge science in the health 
protection branch.  We want to make the process is more open so 
that whether it is drug approvals or veterinary products 
Canadians will understand the process by which we consider, weigh 
risks and give approval or denial.  We also appointed an arm's 
length science advisory board.

</I></B></P><P align=left>To date, 11,000 sheep have been killed in Quebec to prevent 
scrapie.  According to our information, the minister is

yesterday and again today the Prime Minister said students with

</I></B></P><P align=left>My question is for the solicitor general, and he should be able

students denied even after the federal court indicated funding 
would be essential to assist the students in presenting their 
case? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How can they tell their story, or is this something else the 
solicitor general just will not have? 
<P><A NAME="LINK117"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Andy Scott (Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, quite the contrary.  Because the public complaints 
commission represents the interests of Canadians, that was the 
reason we did not want to offer support to hire lawyers.  We do 
not want this to become a court.  We do not wish this to take on 
an adversarial nature. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have been assured by the public complaints commission that 
these processes are done informally.  It is not intended to be 
adversarial.  The students will have their opportunity to appear 
before the agency that has been struck in their interest.

the early retirement package that we offered last June to 
fishermen in Atlantic Canada.  We are well aware that we had to 
make very, very difficult decisions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have come with what I think is a fair and balanced package. 
We have respected in our decisions the standard age of 55, 
which has always been the standard age we have used for early

today and yesterday, the actions of the U.S. governors are both 
wrong and irresponsible.  As a result, the Government of Canada, 
at all levels, has been active and aggressive in trying to 
convince the federal government in the United States to intervene 
and stop this unilateral action. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our patience is not unlimited.  That is why we will not be shy

</I></B></P><P align=left>The government's reluctance to make this type of ministerial 
statement in the House shows contempt for this place and it is 
something we have seen in the past.

when most caucuses were sitting and members of parliament were 
unable to attend.

is also the House that occupies the most parliamentary space

</I></B></P><P align=left>We are members of parliament who are answerable to the public, 
which does not always differentiate between the actions of the 
ministry, the departmental officials or the membership of the 
House of Commons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister became involved in a very public dispute with a 
senior official in his department.  That senior official was 
subsequently removed from the responsibility of this 
parliamentary project, which has been the subject of considerable 
debate, considerable criticism and rumour. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are large chunks of the renovation which were in the

of the Canadian NATO Parliamentary Association which represented 
Canada at the joint committee meetings of the North Atlantic 
Assembly of the NATO Parliamentary Association. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The North Atlantic Assembly held its first defence and security,

</I></B></P><P align=left>As vice-chair of this committee it is a real honour and 
pleasure for me to present these reports.  It is my last official 
act, as I will have to resign as vice-chair of the NATO 
committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think it is important to note that members of all parties who 
serve on the NATO committee have done their part to assist the 
Minister of Foreign Affairs and the Prime Minister in passing the 
anti-personnel land mine proposal into law and getting countries 
to sign on.  We almost got the United States to agree. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is my pleasure to present this report and my official duty to 
do so.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Joe Comuzzi (Thunder Bay—Superior North, Lib.):</B>  Mr.

May 18, 1998. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We all realize the importance of our relationship with the 
United States.  I am particularly proud to report that we have 
four ongoing committees that are working on issues which affect 
both countries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The most important issue that we have included in the report is 
one that is bothering all Canadians, and that is with respect to 
the United States immigration law, particularly section 110, 
which would create havoc on all persons travelling to the United 
States. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The importance of the issue is simply that the immigration law 
in the United States was supposed to take effect on September 30, 
1998.  However, I can report that it will not take effect on 
September 30. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is presently before the conciliation committee in the 
Congress of the United States.  They will be resolving the issue 
in the very near future.  I am pretty sure that after that has 
been resolved the issue which we fear on our border crossing 
points will be resolved in favour of the Canadians who travel to 
the United States on a daily basis. 
That is one of the real achievements of the Canada-United States 
Interparliamentary Group.  We have several others on which I will 
report at a later date.

a very important impact on Canadian society.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will now speak to my two amendments.  Getting these amendments 
into the legislation was not easy as I had to convince the 
officials of the competition bureau and the justice department 
that amendments could be created to address the concerns I had. I 
had the encouragement of the industry minister throughout. When 
it came to committee my amendments and the amendments of the 
member for Ottawa Centre passed unanimously. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first amendment to Bill C-20 changed the definition of 
business in the Competition Act to include the raising of funds 
for charitable or other non-profit businesses.  This is a huge 
leap forward in addressing the terrible problem all across the 
country where various organizations are preying on Canadians, 
chiefly senior Canadians, by making all kinds of promises to 
raise money for charitable purposes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Everyone has a horror story with respect to charitable and 
non-profit organizations and sometimes organizations that are 
neither.  They get on the telephone or send out direct mail 
solicitations and ask for money in return for promises they 
cannot keep and sometimes promises they know are not truthful. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will give just one example of the type of telemarketing pitch 
that seniors are being subjected to.  I will condense the script 
from a telemarketer in Toronto called Univision Marketing Group. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The person calling whose name is whatever says “I am calling 
for the Children's Emergency Foundation.  I will only keep you 
for a short minute or two.  By the way, do you have children or 
grandchildren or your own?  Well, our foundation was started by a 
group of Canadian mothers who wanted to do something about the 
state of child poverty and hunger right here in our own country 
and our province”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The caller continues  “We think as Canadians we have a 
responsibility to look after our children, so we started 
supporting child feeding programs in Ontario and across Canada. 
These take place in schools at breakfast or lunch, in community 
centres and in housing projects where some 5,000 are already 
being provided with hot nutritious meals each day”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We wonder whether that is so, but this is the real catch.  “In 
the light of the shocking facts of child poverty right here at 
home, would you pledge a one time gift of $75 to feed 75 Canadian 
school children?” 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is the essence of what my amendment addressed:  when 
organizations promise that 100%, 80% or whatever of the money a 
person donates to a worthy cause actually gets to that cause, 
while it was never intended to and will never get to that cause. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I could only trace the Children's Emergency Foundation to an 
apartment building.  It is a charity, however.  As a result of 
this amendment a complaint to the competition bureau will enable 
it to undertake an investigation.  If the investigation of this 
type of claim shows there has been a wilful misrepresentation, 
the organization or individual responsible for the 
misrepresentation will be subject to the penalties of the 
Competition Act.  As an indictable offence that would involve 
five years in jail and an unlimited maximum fine.  Bill C-20 also 
provides for summary conviction that could lead to a fine of some 
$200,000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the first time non-profit and charitable fundraising comes 
under legislation that provides for real penalty where there is a 
deliberate attempt to get money from the public through false 
representation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is amazing to think that non-profit organizations and 
charities have never been subject to the Competition Act but it 
is true. 
If we split hairs it is possible to say that the Competition Act 
could have been applied to charities and non-profit organizations 
but it never has been.  As a result of this amendment I suggest 
that it will.

<A HREF="#LINKT19"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us not make any mistake.  I am not only talking about 
charities and non-profit organizations.  There are many 
organizations out there which are neither and are raising money 
by pitching all kinds of things to the Canadian public. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will cite an example.  The International Fund for Animal 
Welfare is an organization based offshore.  I cannot trace it as 
a non-profit organization in Canada but it has an address in 
Ottawa.  This organization specializes in misrepresenting an 
animal rights situation somewhere in the country, for example in 
our north with respect to the seal hunt. The scheme is to put out 
all this information saying that there are people out there 
beating and killing seal pups and to send out beautiful 
literature showing bleeding white coats.  The reality is that it 
is against the law to kill white coats.  We do not do that here 
in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, they have no compunction.  They are known worldwide. 
They do the same thing when it comes to elephants in Africa and 
their ivory.  They have all kinds of other causes.  All we know 
about them is that they get about $36 million U.S. in revenues 
from around the world by falsely raising these issues and then 
conducting a mail out fundraising campaign showing animals 
suffering and asking for donations.  Their slogan is something 
like “Remember, 80 cents on the $1 of whatever you send in” 
will go toward saving the dog or the cat or whatever is in their 
literature. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I suggest that my first amendment will address wilful 
misrepresentation of facts in order to fundraise.  We must 
remember that the operative word is wilful.  Accidental is one 
thing but wilful is another.  It does not matter whether it is a 
bona fide organization in Canada; it still applies. Even if an 
individual who misrepresents in order to raise funds from the 
public will be caught by the Competition Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The amendment will also address partly the terrible problem that 
has been in the news lately which has led to comments from the 
solicitor general where we know there are certain charitable 
organizations in the country that have become fronts for 
terrorist activities abroad.  We do know that this is a growing 
problem and has been a problem for some time. Charitable 
organizations or non-profit organizations raise funds for one 
purpose in Canada and they turn out to be financing conflicts in 
other parts of the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>General legislation is needed to address that problem but at the 
very least if organizations pitch one thing and then finances 
something else abroad like terrorism they would come under the 
Competition Act and would be subject to prosecution.  If is a 
partial first step. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I cannot stress enough that this is the first tool for the 
government and the taxpayer to protect the consumer from people 
who would misrepresent the way the money they are raising will be 
spent abroad. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second amendment deals with using foreign direct marketers 
and telemarketers to market into Canada.  What the amendment 
states is that the act will include permitting a false 
representations to be made.  It addresses a problem whereby 
hundreds of charities and other non-profit organizations in 
Canada use foreign for profit marketers abroad, usually in the 
United States, to do telemarketing or direct marketing in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will give a little example.  I have two fundraising letters in 
my hand.  The first one is from the Ontario Society for the 
Prevention of Cruelty to Animals and the second one is from 
OXFAM.  If we examine these letters we see that they are printed 
on exactly the same paper even though they are very different 
organizations, have the same type face and the same ink.  We also 
see that the bulk mailing number on both envelopes is 05110874. 
In other words, they have the same account with Canada Post.

<A HREF="#LINKT20"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is really happening is that the account is with a for 
profit marketer that is doing this service for them.  The reason 
we have to make sure that the Competition Act catches 
organizations that use offshore direct marketers to fundraise in 
Canada is to make them responsible when these offshore 
fundraising organizations misrepresent into Canada.  This again 
is an enormous step. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will give an example of the problem.  As is often with these 
organizations in Canada, they do a deal with a direct marketer in 
the United States for a profit.  The idea is that the for profit 
company, in exchange for using the name of the organization, 
fundraises in Canada at no expense to the organization until it 
has created a donor list that is so large that a profit is 
created and all the expenses are met of the for profit 
fundraiser.  Then the balance goes back to the charity or 
non-profit organization. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My first amendment will catch organizations that are doing 
fundraising by using telemarketers and direct mail services and 
are saying that the money is going to charity when in fact the 
deal is that 100% of the donated money for which they are getting 
tax receipts is going to the for profit organization in the 
United States.  None goes to charity until the for profit direct 
marketer in the United States finally meets its expenses.  Then a 
bit of money goes to charity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is another abuse that exists in the charitable sector which 
will be addressed by the first amendment and by the second 
amendment where the for profit marketers in the United States 
misrepresent in Canada, when they overstate how much money is 
going to charity and when they overstate the facts in any way. 
Again the operative word is wilful.  Where an organization allows 
this to be done in its name wilfully in the United States, the 
Competition Act penalties will apply. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not want to be too long because I know the hon. member for 
Ottawa Centre wishes to speak.  However, just to give an idea of 
the dimensions of the problem, I have here a list of 
organizations in Canada which are using a for profit direct 
marketer in the United States, which means they are getting 
telemarketing services and direct mail from the United States: 
$1000+ Lifetime Members of a TV Ministry representing 12,000 
people, the Agnes McPhail Foundation, AIDS Committee of Toronto, 
the Alberta Lung Association, the Alzheimer's Society of Ontario, 
Amnesty International, the Animal Alliance of Canada, Arctic 
Society of Canada, Arthritis Society, Asthma Society of Canada, 
B'Nai B'rith, the Barbra Schlifer Clinic, BC Association for 
Community Living and the BC Lung Association. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must remember that they are giving to for profit 
telemarketers and direct marketers in the United States the 
privilege and the opportunity to earn money selling the 
fundraising into Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The list continues: Big Sisters of Ontario, the Canadian 
Abortion Rights Action League, Canadian Association for the Deaf, 
Canadian Blind Sports Association, Canadian Centre for Victims of 
Torture, and Canadian Christian Heritage Donors involving 53,000 
people.  I am sure they would like to know the for profit 
marketer in the United States that has their names has to give 
them literature which at least is honest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will continue:  the Canadian Civil Liberties Association, 
Canadian Corporate Donors, Canadian Diabetes Association, 
Canadian Environmental Defence Fund, Canadian Federation of 
Humane Societies, Canadian Hearing Foundation, Canadian 
Hemophelia Society, Canadian Hunger Foundation, Canadian Liver 
Foundation, Canadian Paralympic Committee, Canadian Paraplegic 
Association, Canadian Parks and Wilderness Society, Canadian 
Peace Alliance, Canadian Wildlife Federation and Canadian Mental 
Health Association.  Why in heck can they not do their own 
fundraising, for heaven's sake? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The list continues:  Candlelighters Canada, Care Canada, Channel 
17 Public Broadcasting, Child Find, CNIB, Council of Canadians, 
Covenant House, Crohn's and Colitis Foundation of Canada, CUSO, 
Cystic Fibrosis, David Suzuki Foundation, Developing Countries 
Farm Radio Network, Doctors Without Borders, Earthroots, 
Elizabeth Fry Society, Energy Probe and Epilepsy Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It does go on and on.  There is nothing wrong with using these 
organizations but it is useful for members of the public to know 
that when they get this mail in their mailboxes it is coming from 
a for profit direct marketer in the United States. 
We can go on.  Friends of Canadian Broadcasting. One would think 
they would be able to do it on their own. Greenpeace Canada, 
Heart and Stroke Foundation Ontario, Help the Aged,

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mac Harb (Ottawa Centre, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise 
to speak briefly on Bill C-20.  In particular I would like to 
speak on a whistleblowing amendment which the committee was 
dealing with. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before I do that I want to pay tribute to my colleague from 
Nickel Belt who has been working with me on this issue for quite 
some time.  If not for his excellent work on this issue in the 
very early stages, I do not think we would have been able to see 
this amendment before the House as part of Bill C-20, legislation 
which will hopefully sail through the House of Commons early this 
afternoon. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to thank him because I know his constituents will be as 
happy as my constituents and consumers all across the country 
when they see that the government has taken action on important 
issues dealing with consumer rights.  It deals also with the 
question of the ability of the consumer or a member of a 
corporation or an organization to speak out when they see 
something wrong taking place in their place of work or within 
their organizations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The amendment deals with everything under the Competition Act. 
Any organization already covered by the Competition Bureau or by 
a federal statute, this amendment deals with them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motivation behind it really has to deal with the question of 
gasoline prices, the oil industry across the country as well as 
with people who either work or have anything to do with those 
types of industries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It has three components to it.  It is a whistleblowing 
amendment.  In other words, an employee or a retailer can speak 
out when he sees something wrong. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the past when we had a consumer, a worker or a retailer who 
wanted to speak out they went before the Competition Bureau, 
which remained confidential up to a point. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1550"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT22"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>At some point in the process that confidentiality cannot be 
maintained because they will have to bring the name of the 
individual forward before the court. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This legislation makes it imperative that the identity of the 
individual who brings forward information to the Competition 
Bureau remains confidential. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other element of the proposal deals with prohibition.  In 
the past many retailers or employees of companies feared 
reprisal. They were afraid that if they were to speak out and if 
their employer found out these individuals would take action 
against them and would at some point let them go. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This amendment prohibits employers or contractors from 
dismissing or retaliating against someone who speaks out if that 
person is under the belief that something wrong or something 
illegal has taken place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a third component to this proposal which deals with 
offence and punishment.  This amendment would make it a criminal 
offence for an employer or a contractor to take action against an 
employee because this employee or retailer has spoken out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What this government is doing is sending a very strong message 
across the country to those who are thinking about playing around 
with the consumer and also to those who know of someone who is 
doing something illegal.  This government is telling those who 
are trying to do something wrong that it is a criminal offence 
and the government will take action against them. This government 
is telling consumers and retailers who might be speaking out that 
it will defend their right to speak out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a great day for our democracy because now, for once and 
for all, we can say we have another loophole that we have closed. 
In the past we had many people who phoned our offices and told us 
they could not speak out because of fear. This amendment deals 
with this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the same time this amendment sends an unequivocal signal 
from coast to coast to say that we want to see fairness in the 
marketplace, we want to see transparency in the marketplace and 
we want to see consumers protected in the marketplace. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This amendment would not have seen the light of day if not for 
the assistance of my colleague from Nickel Belt as well as the 
parliamentary secretary, the staff members of the department who 
have co-operated at every level and the people in the Competition 
Bureau who came forward and responded to questions that were 
posed to them by members of the committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to say how delighted I was to have been able to join the 
industry committee which has adopted this amendment unanimously. 
I thank every member, including the chair, for a job very well 
done.  It crossed all the boundary lines of both sides of the 
House and every one of my colleagues has supported it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To that extent I want to say it is excellent news and I want to 
tell my colleague from Nickel Belt congratulations, felicitations 
and good luck.  It is my hope that this bill will become law very 
quickly, go to the Senate and receive royal assent so we can get 
on with the business of this House to deal with other issues.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rahim Jaffer (Edmonton—Strathcona, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I am pleased to rise again on Bill C-20, an act to amend 
the Competition Act and to make consequential and related 
amendments to other acts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My predecessor and colleague from Kelowna has given the bill 
substantial consideration and has deemed the legislation to be 
worthy of the support of members of this House.  As the bill has 
been on the table since 1996, I look forward to being a part of 
facilitating its long overdue passage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Given the bill's broad support within this House and among the 
members of the business community, I do not consider it necessary 
to use my full allotted speaking time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The most important element of this legislation deals with 
telemarketing.  It is the protection of consumers against 
telemarketing deception that has captured my interest in this 
legislation. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1555"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT23"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As telemarketing fraud is so often directed at seniors and other 
vulnerable members of society, it is imperative that the 
government act to provide the legal framework for dealing with 
fraudulent telemarketers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill provides very clear guidelines for professional 
telemarketing conduct.  First, telemarketers must identify who 
they are representing.  Second, they must disclose the price of 
the services or products they are selling.  Third, they must tell 
why they are calling.  Without these provisions a telemarketer is 
given complete license to mislead the consumer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By providing these guidelines legitimate telemarketers can be 
given some protection against those deceptive telemarketers whose 
conduct has brought their industry into disrepute.  The 
telemarketing business in Canada is a billion dollar industry. 
Without adequate protection against fraud this industry will not 
continue to grow.  Legitimate telemarketers will not continue to 
operate in an environment ruled by outlaws and frauds. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While I support the initiative to create a civil and criminal 
law framework for telemarketers, I am very dubious about the 
Competition Act.  The Competition Act rests on the assumption 
that the government can meddle and regulate its way into a free 
market. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In his recently published book entitled </I>The Myths of 
Antitrust<I> author Armentano wrote that trades of private 
property are either voluntary or they are not. One cannot 
legislate the free market or create competition.  To have a free 
market, the government must leave the markets alone. To have the 
state make markets free is again a contradiction of terms. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Leaving the markets alone does not mean that the government 
should ignore its duty to create laws that protect against fraud, 
for instance as Bill C-20 does with regard to telemarketing.  It 
does not mean that the government should not work to build a 
criminal and civil law framework that protects private property 
and to ensure the integrity and sanctity of contracts.  That is 
exactly the role that government should play in a free economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Only if the government entrenches property rights in the 
constitution will Canada's business environment strive.  Only 
when the cost of the regulatory burden is lifted from business 
will new players be able to enter the market, creating more 
competition.  Only when the banking industry is deregulated will 
new and innovative companies be able to find the financing and 
the challenge those companies with substantial market share. 
Only when the tax burden is reduced will companies think of 
innovating and expanding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are some of the very fundamental problems that must be 
addressed if Canada is going to foster a competitive marketplace. 
These problems should be addressed before the government creates 
more cumbersome and costly regulations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am reminded of the Nobel prize winning economist Dr. Friedman 
who wrote that a monopoly can seldom be established within a 
country without overt and covert government assistance in the 
form or a tariff or some other device. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This government is a disease on the economy masquerading as its 
own cure.  It is the cause of uncompetitive markets, not the 
solution. For instance, the government has created an environment 
in Canada that has encouraged the creation of a banking 
oligarchy. Instead of deregulating the banking industry to allow 
for competition, it meddles further into the banking industry 
with the Competition Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When Canadian small businesses cannot get adequate funding for 
new innovations that will foster competition the government 
justifies the need to create another government program called 
the Small Business Loans Act.  We can see how one government 
intervention leads to many more until we are so far removed from 
the free market that we cannot begin to understand the potential 
for market based solution to public policy problems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the government ran a house cleaning service it would bill us 
for air fresheners when all it needed to do was take out the 
trash.  If our house was cold the government would subsidize the 
costs for new sweaters when all it needed to do was close the 
door and shut out the draft. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The funny thing is the minister actually expects a pat on the 
back every time he sprays around a little air freshener or buys a 
few new sweaters.  I will start patting the minister on the back 
when he starts taking out the trash and closing the doors.  I 
will start patting him on the back when he starts understanding 
the fundamentals of a strong economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we examine it carefully, the mandate of the Competition Act 
is a little strange.  The entire purpose of being in business is 
to drive your competitors out of business.  Every entrepreneur 
wants to capture more and more of the market share by providing a 
better product at a better price than his competition.  This 
according to the Competition Act is illegal.  It is called 
anti-competitive pricing and dumping. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1600"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT24"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Entrepreneurs eager to obey the minister should not try to outdo 
their competitors by providing consumers a better price.  They 
should keep their prices and services at the same levels as their 
competitors.  Sorry, that too is against the rules.  It is called 
collusion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Entrepreneurs should raise their prices far above their 
competitors so that they are not guilty of anti-competitive 
pricing or collusion.  Wrong again.  It is called price gouging. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our competition laws are an unenforceable mess of 
contradictions.  I think if the members of this House give these 
laws some honest consideration, they too will come to this 
conclusion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform Party believes that the creation of wealth and 
productive jobs for Canadians is best achieved through the 
operations of a responsible, broadly-based, free enterprise 
system in which private property, freedom of contract and the 
operation of a free market are encouraged and respected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Economic competition and the resulting prosperity will come only 
as a result of a deregulated market and cannot be achieved by 
government intervention. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the critic for industry, I will be working with the private 
sector to identify those obstacles to business being successful 
and will not let this government continue to get the fundamentals 
wrong with impugnity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister will tell us that he is just trying to protect 
Canadian consumers.  This is simply not true.  The minister 
refused to remove the 6% tariff on imported automobiles and parts 
despite the unfair burden this places on Canadian families. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He has helped to create a regulatory burden in Canada that costs 
the equivalent of 12% of our GDP.  That is money that comes 
directly out of the pockets of average Canadians in the form of 
higher prices for goods and services.  The minister is an old 
friend of the Canadian consumer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also like to touch briefly on the amendments to merger 
regulations.  Again, while I question the legitimacy of the 
Competition Act as it currently stands, I do support this bill 
insofar as it simplifies the process by which uncomplicated 
mergers can be processed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This aspect of Bill C-20 makes a bad piece of legislation better 
and it therefore has my qualified support.  In fact, Bill C-20 
achieves its goal of working to modernize the Competition Act.  I 
think this should be the starting point for reforming the act 
rather than an end point. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to conclude my remarks by reminding this House that 
there are real people outside these walls who are affected by 
what we do.  There are consequences, seen and unseen, that these 
people will have to contend with if we do not engage in thorough 
and thoughtful debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is the standard of living of Canadians that I will keep in 
mind throughout my term as opposition critic for industry.  I 
will never remain silent while this government uses the pay 
cheques of Canadians to play politics.  I will never remain 
silent while this government solely creates an environment in 
Canada that is stifling and suffocating for small and large 
businesses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-20 makes some very important amendments to the 
Competition Act and, while I have some very serious concerns with 
the act itself, the amendments put forth in this legislation 
deserve our support. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>]

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Antoine Dubé (Lévis-et-Chutes-de-la-Chaudière, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
as the Bloc Quebecois representative on the Standing Committee 
on Industry, I am pleased to take part in the debate on third 
reading of Bill C-20. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The position I present today has been drawn up in conjunction 
with the hon. member for Mercier, who also sits on that 
committee.  As many are aware, she has analyzed the matter in 
great depth and looked at every aspect of this bill, which as a 
number of hon. members have admitted, is a highly complex one 
and not very accessible to the average citizen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us recall that the purpose of Bill C-20 is to amend the 
Competition Act and to make consequential amendments to other 
acts, yet all those who have spoken on it have focussed on 
deceptive telemarketing.  Why?  Because Bill C-20 contains a 
number of technical proposals which would not particularly 
fascinate the general public, with the exception of the ones on 
fraudulent telemarketing, because telemarketing is a sign of our 
times and a timely topic.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are becoming aware of the increasing frequency of fraud in 
this area, not only in Canada, but pretty well everywhere else 
in the world.  Now that there is cut-rate long-distance calling, 
telemarketing can be done across borders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the Liberal government, this bill offers an opportunity to 
pull a fast one, to cover up one more incidence of interference 
in provincial jurisdictions, those of Quebec in particular.  We 
have our own Civil Code and the Government of Quebec has already 
put into place a number of legislative and regulatory means, the 
Office de la protection du consommateur in particular, to 
protect the consumer from this type of abuse. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Voting against this bill puts us at risk of being seen as 
opponents of any regulation of fraudulent telemarketing, 
something that already affects thousands of people who are not 
well-off, the elderly in particular. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Voting for Bill C-20 means that we are making radical changes to 
the Competition Act, and in our opinion the consumer will suffer 
as a result. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe a number of MPs have fallen into this trap, with the 
possible exception of the NDP members.  For that I congratulate 
them.  They looked at the interests of consumers in establishing 
their position.  I thank them for supporting most of the 
amendments we have proposed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To avoid having to make an impossible choice, the Bloc Quebecois 
proposed amendments such that any progress in the control and 
criminalization of deceptive telemarketing would not be to the 
detriment of other aspects of competition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As usual, the Liberal government has declined to support them, 
probably so that its representatives would not look like they 
were remiss.  I again pay tribute to the support of NDP members. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will quickly review the various motions.  Yes, we are in 
favour of a legislative framework for telemarketing activities 
so that the reputation of this kind of commercial activity does 
not suffer because of a few dishonest individuals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To that end, we think that Bill C-20 should revert to section 52 
of the present Competition Act. 
Although at first glance the amendments contained in Bill C-20 
appear minor, closer examination reveals that they represent a 
major change in the scope of the Competition Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The criminal provisions in section 52 would now apply only to 
representations that were false or misleading in a material 
respect—in this regard, I would point out that there has been no 
legal definition of what is meant by a material respect—, but 
which will now have to be proven to have been made knowingly or 
recklessly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is such a provision evidence of any real desire to have this 
legislation protect a swindled consumer?  It means that the 
requirements for establishing guilt are no longer the same. 
How are we going to tell the elderly that, even if they continue 
to be badly served by this law, there is ultimately nothing we 
will be able to do, because it will often be impossible to prove 
that the false and misleading representations were made 
knowingly and recklessly?  Will a lie detector be used to 
determine whether individuals' intentions were bad or whether 
they were perfectly aware of the consequences? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In a telemarketing operation, for instance, the bosses may know, 
but do the employees?  These are sometimes large outfits.  At 
this level, the case law on similar provisions in other 
legislation shows that it is very difficult to prove.

<A HREF="#LINKT26"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>When it is impossible to prove the intent to mislead, the person 
who intended to mislead may not be cleared, but they are not 
charged and there is no follow-up.  This is a serious and 
significant problem.  Legislation has to be good.  We know it 
has to be fair and equitable, but it must also be enforceable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We think this law will be hard to enforce, since it involves 
intent.  It is paradoxical.  The focus on intent is a bit of a 
snow job, since in practice it is just about impossible to prove 
somebody's bad intentions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-20 permits judicial authorization for unapproved 
interceptions of private communications in the course of an 
investigation in cases of conspiracy, bid-rigging and deceptive 
telemarketing.  This opens the door a little more to electronic 
bugging.  The issue here again is intent.  When it is thought 
that an individual is guilty, more sophisticated bugging is 
carried out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is some contradiction in the fact that the bill permits 
the competition bureau to have this powerful investigative tool 
while it decriminalizes many of the offences under the act, in 
order, it appears, to lighten the system.  They want to 
decriminalize these offences so they can impose fines, which are 
not specified in the bill but will no doubt be spelled out in 
the regulations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I note that the new commissioner—since the director of the 
competition bureau will now be called a commissioner—can, on 
his own, determine whether an individual must appear in court 
and set a 48 hour time frame.  Within this period, businesses 
can reach an agreement with him.  This is another aspect we 
cannot accept: the considerable powers given the new 
commissioner. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also wanted to include the Internet in the provisions of the 
law to avoid its becoming quickly outdated.  We were told that 
the Internet is less interactive and therefore people contacted 
can easily cut short communications. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is, however, one thing I do not understand.  Does false 
and misleading information that causes an individual to buy a 
product become excusable because it is transmitted on the 
Internet? 
Unfortunately, by rejecting the inclusion of the Internet in the 
scope of Bill C-20, the Liberals are preventing this bill from 
being enforceable or effective. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I must, however, state that I did note some degree of 
receptivity on the part of the parliamentary secretary at the 
report stage with respect to our amendments.  I hope he was 
sincere about the possibility of bringing in corrections with 
future legislation, and I believe he was. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When one thinks that the standing committee spent half its time 
last year focussing on the Year 2000 bug, it is difficult to 
grasp that no thought has been given to the Internet, which is 
going to be more and more a part of everyone's daily life. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member for Portneuf, a specialist in computers and all 
telecommunications matters, has just been telling me that, 
according to his information, 30% of Quebec families, and 
probably of Canadian families as well, are already connected to 
the Internet.  This is already a reality. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some people may think the Internet is a complicated affair that 
requires costly computers and gadgets, but my colleague also 
told me that a person can use a little box that costs about $400 
to hook up to a phone line, and then access the Internet through 
the television set.  That is the way of the future.  I know that 
the millennium bug is close at hand, but I think that all the 
problems associated with the Internet should have been 
addressed.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We wanted to balance the power Bill C-20 gives to the director of 
the competition bureau. In the bill as it stands, only the 
future commissioner may ask the tribunal whether someone engaged 
or is engaging in reviewable conduct.  That is a lot of power 
for one person.  In the past, people could file complaints and 
the final decision was left to the tribunal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now, more power is being given to the director of the 
competition bureau, who will now have the title of commissioner, 
and he, and he alone, will decide whether or not it will go to 
the tribunal.  We think that this is leaving a great deal of 
power in the hands of one non-elected individual. 
We are not questioning his competence—that is not the issue—but we 
feel this leaves a lot of power in the hands of one person. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I now know why the Liberal government wanted to take this route. 
It wanted, of course, to protect its own interests, which is 
fine, but it also wanted to acquire greater powers, as I 
explained, over Quebec in particular, which, as people know, has 
a civil code, unlike the other provinces in Canada, and an 
agency to protect consumers with respect to such things as 
telemarketing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Like members of the New Democratic Party, we think that the 
reason the government and Liberal members are introducing this 
bill has very little to do with their concerns about consumers. 
We think that competition should be at the heart of this bill, 
and we do not think that it is.  That is why members of the Bloc 
Quebecois will be voting against the bill. 
It needs a lot of improvement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are also unhappy that all the amendments we proposed were 
rejected.  The Liberal member who just spoke, and his colleague 
as well, was pleased that, after trying for months, apparently, 
he managed to convince the Liberal majority to pass his 
amendment about whistleblowers.  We supported it too, but we 
see, and this is sometimes a bit discouraging, that the 
government is very reticent, even intolerant.  It almost never 
passes amendments from the opposition parties, not just from the 
Bloc Quebecois, purely so that it can give the impression that 
it has anticipated everything, that it has analyzed all aspects 
of a bill and its consequences.  But we do not think this to be 
the case, quite the contrary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is odd.  The Liberals in opposition swore they would throw 
out the free trade agreement, because it was worthless.  We know 
what happened.  The free trade agreement was kept.  The same 
thing happened with the elimination of the GST.  In the words of 
the Prime Minister—Quebeckers will not have any trouble 
understanding—he talked of scrapping the GST.  However, nothing 
happened. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I recall as well that the Liberals said they would not be going 
after the disadvantaged.  They blamed the Conservatives for 
doing just that. I recall a letter from the Prime Minister, when 
he was the leader of the opposition, which expressed his horror 
at the treatment by the former Conservative minister, Mr. 
Valcourt, of the unemployed with cuts to unemployment insurance. 
However, we saw what they did later on.  They made more cuts; 
they went even further. 
They paid the price, in the Maritimes, for example, as we know. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today, however, the Liberal Party has left these concerns far 
behind. It too used a miracle marketing approach to permit 
certain businesses to profit at consumers' expense.  However, 
the Liberal government can prove that it honoured its promises 
knowingly and without concern for their consequences. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is why the members of the Bloc Quebecois will oppose this 
bill, whose objective was laudable, nonetheless.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Chris Axworthy (Saskatoon—Rosetown—Biggar, NDP):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, Bill C-20 can easily be divided into two parts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first part deals with telemarketing fraud and the 
significant consequences which have befallen many Canadian 
consumers at the hands of those who would defraud them of 
significant sums of money through the telephone.  Like all other 
members of this House, New Democrats fully support the thrust of 
the telemarketing fraud provisions.  There are things we would do 
differently and I will raise them in a minute.  As my colleague 
from the Bloc Quebecois has indicated, mostly it has to do with 
enforcement and the seriousness with which we take the 
enforcement of these crimes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second part of Bill C-20 is much more troublesome. It deals 
with basic aspects of competition, with offences committed by 
businesses to further their economic aims.  This includes the 
various misleading, fraudulent and deceptive practices they 
pursue as well as some matters dealing with mergers.  It is that 
part which falls short of what Canadians need. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will talk briefly about the telemarketing fraud provisions. We 
have all had an opportunity to speak on this question in the 
past. I am sure we have all heard from constituents who have been 
cheated out of considerable numbers of dollars by these fraud 
artists. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can think of one couple in particular who responded to the 
heavy duty pressure from a telemarketing operation.  That couple 
handed over some $10,000 or $12,000 in response to this pressure. 
These senior citizens could ill afford $500 let alone $12,000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We might ask how could that ever take place. As we know, the 
telemarketing fraud operators prey on the most vulnerable members 
of society.  They make extravagant claims which we might not 
accept but which many others do. Those operators have made a lot 
of money in the process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We all know the plight of many who have been bilked for 
thousands of dollars and the apparent ease with which these fraud 
artists continue their work over and over again. They work for 
different companies under different names but use the same 
offices with the same telephone equipment.  They have basically 
thumbed their noses at the law and at Canadians over a very long 
period of time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Project Phonebusters is a relatively small operation headed by 
Barry Elliot, an OPP officer.  It has essentially the sole 
responsibility of chasing after these guys across the whole of 
Canada.  This small unit is not funded well enough of course.  It 
does not have enough people to pursue these claims in a timely 
way. Consequently the situation in Canada is we have not been 
enforcing our laws seriously enough.  Had we been more serious 
enforcers, we would have saved many Canadians many thousands of 
dollars. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is incumbent upon the solicitor general as the minister 
responsible for the RCMP to take a leadership role in fighting 
this fraud at the national level and to ensure that there are 
more RCMP officers engaged in this activity.  Project 
Phonebusters and Barry Elliot need more help to do an even better 
job. They have done quite a remarkable job with very limited 
resources. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is an obligation on the part of the Government of Canada 
following the provisions in Bill C-20 which deal with 
telemarketing fraud to actually put some resources where its 
mouth is.  The government should not just pass legislation in the 
hope that something will improve.  It should rigorously and 
completely enforce the legislation and commit more resources to 
it.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also want to commend my colleague for 
Lévis-et-Chutes-de-la-Chaudière for proposing to the government 
some significant changes which would have also protected many, 
many Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know about the issue dealing with the Internet. We know that 
this is just the beginning of an incredibly important market for 
commercial transactions.  Many, many people have already begun to 
do business on the Internet, whether it is the buying of stocks 
and bonds, holidays, or other goods and services. We have all 
probably used the Internet for these purposes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Technological advances will ensure that the Internet is more 
secure and safe and that we can use our credit cards on the 
Internet without fear of incurring bills that we were not 
intending to incur.  Once all of that technology is in place, and 
it is just around the corner, we will see a huge burgeoning of 
trade on the Internet. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Lévis-et-Chutes-de-la-Chaudière who was trying to 
move the government to take this matter seriously made some very 
good points in proposing that the Internet be added to this 
section.  The argument was that it did not quite fit within 
telemarketing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It does not fit perfectly but it does not fit badly either. We 
have a new form of marketing which is based on technology.  It is 
not all that different from telemarketing. There is the one 
element that a person is not on the line forcing someone to make 
a decision but the mechanism of the Internet also makes it very, 
very attractive and persuasive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would have hoped that the government would have taken note of 
these suggestions.  I know the parliamentary secretary is very 
diligent in these matters.  I hope we can do more than hope that 
the parliamentary secretary will help us, that we will see some 
movement to deal with some legislative action after proper study 
on the question of the Internet.  He is nodding his head so I am 
sure that is what will happen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government is making a fundamental mistake regarding the 
competition provision. It has simply not regarded the importance 
of having a fair and fully competitive market so that not only 
consumers are protected but legitimate, honest businessmen and 
businesswomen are protected too.  That part I cannot accept.  It 
is not because of what is in it; it is mostly because of what is 
not in it.  It should have been made tougher, not weaker.  We 
will therefore be voting against this bill although we are very, 
very supportive of the telemarketing fraud provisions. 
<P><A NAME="LINK186"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Jones (Markham, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is my 
pleasure to speak on a bill that is important to the success of 
business competition in Canada, a bill that introduces amendments 
that will modernize regulations for Canadian business 
environments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Progressive Conservative Party is generally pleased with 
Bill C-20 and its intentions.  Specifically, the time has come to 
aggressively respond to the ever growing problem of telemarketing 
fraud. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In recent years total telemarketing sales in the United States 
and Canada have exceeded $500 billion per year.  While most 
telemarketing activities are legitimate, unfortunately some are 
not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is those initiatives I am concerned about.  The report of the 
Canada-U.S. Working Group on Telemarketing Fraud highlights 
that telemarketing has become one of the most pervasive and 
problematic forms of white collar crime in Canada and the United 
States. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It has been estimated that telefraud cost Canadians in excess of 
$60 million in 1995. 
This figure ballooned to over $75 million in 1996.  Worst of all, 
in many cases these frauds are committed against the elderly and 
those who least can afford the losses.

<A HREF="#LINKT30"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is estimated that this form of crime accounts for as much as 
10% of the total volume of telemarketing.  In Canada that would 
mean $400 million annually.  Studies show that those targeted are 
the vulnerable and the lonely in society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately that equates to millions of dollars from the 
pockets of many of our seniors, the very same seniors who are 
experiencing lower and lower GIC or guaranteed income supplement 
payments and old age security benefits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We believe that the new crime offence of deceptive telemarketing 
is a proper response to this activity.  The acts of these scam 
artists are hurting the legitimate telemarketing industry that 
created employment for thousands of Canadians.  Today we begin 
fighting back.  Five years in prison and fines at the discretion 
of the courts should be enough of a deterrent to these would-be 
fraudsters. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we know the promotion of competitive markets is of 
fundamental importance to today's economy.  Competition 
stimulates innovation and growth in jobs, provides businesses and 
consumers with competitive prices and product choices, and 
increases the average standard of living in society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Without a modern competition law Canadian businesses may 
encounter anti-competitive barriers to their entry or expansion 
in their markets.  They may find it difficult to source input at 
competitive prices or they may encounter other refrains in their 
ability to remain competitive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-20 proposes amendments to the Competition Act, an act 
that strives to guide businesses in a fair and equitable way.  It 
is time to bring this act up to date with contemporary business 
practices.  Canada needs a legal framework which supports up to 
date competitive business practices.  This framework is an 
essential contribution to sustaining the competitive strength of 
the private sector. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-20 was reviewed exhaustively by the Standing Committee on 
Industry.  As a result of these hearings my party believes that 
we have an acceptable response to many of the concerns of 
companies operating within the Canadian marketplace. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Notably we are pleased with the intent of the bill in the area 
of misleading advertising.  Bill C-20 represents the beginning of 
an important principle as it applies to misleading advertising. 
Specifically with this legislation the Competition Act will be 
stressing the importance of compliance over punishment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government said the criminal sanctions were an incomplete 
response to false advertising.  On this point we agree with the 
government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The drawback includes the stigma attached to the criminal 
process; the inability to stop misleading advertising quickly; 
and the cost, time and resources needed for a successful 
prosecution.  The Retail Council of Canada believes the 
availability of a civil offence will result in fairer and more 
effective enforcement and will recognize the true nature of many 
of the offences which are not done with any criminal intent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Because of this move Bill C-20 should be able to achieve its 
goal of a quicker and more efficient process leading to 
compliance.  We in the Conservative Party believe that the time 
test and volume test provisions of the bill are a fair response 
to the issues of regular price claims.  Retailers will no longer 
be able to make claims about the regular price of a product 
unless that price was charged on a substantial volume of sales 
over a substantial period of time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians have shown a preference to sales and sale priced 
items.  The bill aims to clarify what is a sales item and how a 
sales price is established.  Claims about regular prices and 
related savings can be powerful marketing tools.  However, both 
retailers and consumer groups say that the current law is unclear 
on what constitutes a regular price. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My party will be supporting the bill but that is not to say we 
are completely satisfied with all its provisions.  The business 
of mergers was not satisfactorily dealt with in the bill.  The 
threshold for mergers was not raised to $500 million from the 
existing $400 million as has been requested by several witnesses. 
Simple inflation would have dictated that this was a reasonable 
request.  It also would have brought the act in line with the 
Investment Canada Act which contemplates an annual increase to 
reflect inflation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have spoken to several interest parties and groups that have 
expressed their concern about the bill.  They and the PC Party 
see the need to update the bill to contemporary practices. 
We acknowledge that there are several discrepancies.

<A HREF="#LINKT31"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Businesses call for change that will bring the act more into 
line with current market practices.  They also want the intention 
of parliament to be clear.  They stress that greater clarity 
regarding the intent of the law is needed by both retailers and 
consumers, their customers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The definition of telemarketing should be clearer.  What exactly 
does telemarketing constitute?  Bill C-20 tells us that 
telemarketing is the practice of using interactive telephone 
communications for the purpose of promoting directly or 
indirectly the supply or use of a product and for the purpose of 
promoting directly or indirectly any business interest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Retail Council of Canada would like to see a clearer 
definition of what constitutes telemarketing.  The Canadian 
Chamber of Commerce also wants a clearer description of the term 
interactive.  So too was the recommendation from the Canadian Bar 
Association.  That means putting a clear definition in the 
legislation. Unfortunately this was not changed in the committee 
process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Retail Council of Canada also points out that the wiretap 
provisions have had relatively little public discussion and were 
not part of the report of the consultation panel.  The issue of 
wiretapping should be of great concern to all Canadians. There is 
some uncertainty as to how this might be applied. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Competition Bureau tells us that it intends to seek 
permission to wiretap only in cases of egregious behaviour. 
However, this is a way to capture this focus in the law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My party would liked to have seen this provision opened up to 
more public input.  The legislation needs to include just how and 
what are misleading claims when it comes to telemarketing. It is 
simple for the government to say that telemarketers cannot make 
any false or misleading claims that would influence a customer to 
buy a product.  However, stringent guidelines should be set to 
stop this activity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We would like to see a more detailed plan on how the government 
plans to coordinate efforts with the United States on 
telemarketing fraud.  Lack of coordination only puts a damper on 
effective cross-border enforcement.  Co-operation and strategy, 
education and prevention need to be looked at.  The PC Party 
would encourage the government not to jeopardize our relationship 
with our largest trading partner on this issue.  Let us give this 
legislation all the teeth possible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If Canadian operations are crossing borders into the pockets of 
United States citizens illegally, we must put a stop to it.  Bill 
C-20 is a good first step but is not all encompassing on this 
issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Evidence shows that telemarketing fraud is a serious economic 
crime problem.  Immediate and effective steps need to be taken. 
This means aggressively stopping those operators who insist on 
choosing targets that are out of province or in another country 
simply because they know police authorities have difficulty 
dealing with victims in other jurisdictions.  Lack of 
coordination is an obstacle to effective cross-border 
enforcement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Through education, prevention and a strong strategy, notorious 
operators can be shut down.  As long as the government seeks to 
achieve this the PC Party will back it up. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not agree that the Internet should have been included in 
the bill because proper consultation was not done with all 
interested parties. I know that the industry minister is well 
aware of the high tech industry and the fast movement of the 
Internet.  I think over the next year or so we will be looking at 
incorporating Internet into the Competition Act.  However this 
was not appropriate without consultation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In spite of its shortcomings, the PC Party will be voting in 
favour of Bill C-20.

(judicial review), be read the second time and referred to a 
committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said:  Mr. Speaker, I begin today by expressing my delight in 
being back in the House of Commons after the summer recess. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The summer provided me some chance to review what issues my 
constituents are most concerned about.  One of the things they 
speak about is the economy.  Today they are concerned about the 
falling dollar and the problem of future economic prospects. 
They see Canada for sale at fire sale prices and they are worried 
that draconian measures might have to be taken. They are 
concerned they will be paying out of their own pockets for this 
downturn in the economy.

<A HREF="#LINKT35"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>They know that a large part of this crisis is due to a 
government that spent months sitting on its hands while the 
loonie was falling.  It just did not quite know what to do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We all know that the Liberals are really not good financial 
managers and that the international community has rendered its 
judgment on that point, a very negative judgment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The economy is foremost in the minds of my constituents in New 
Westminster—Coquitlam—Burnaby and I am certain that it is 
foremost in the minds of every Canadian.  Almost in the same 
breath those who have spoken with me mentioned law and order and 
security as a very close second.  They wonder if they are safe on 
the streets.  Can they leave a window open all night long?  Will 
their children be safe to and from school.  My constituents are 
very passionate on these issues.  They are passionate because 
they realize that no family, no one is immune from crime in 
Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my part of the country there is a divide between those who 
live from the streets and those who are trying to clean up the 
streets. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some in this House may have read in the newspapers last week of 
the idea in Vancouver of having what you call in the vernacular 
shooting galleries, legal hangouts to do drugs.  Certainly we can 
do so much better than this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a proposal to open up a building where heroin addicts 
and others can congregate to get a fix.  The proposal is to give 
them clean needles and in essence monitor that they do not 
overdose on drugs.  It would not surprise me if the addict there 
will soon be provided with the drug itself from the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Proponents say this is going to clean up the streets and make 
the streets safer.  I know that the member for Vancouver East is 
a proponent of this idea and has contemplated coming forward with 
a bill on this very subject.  It will be a sad day if any level 
of government would ever give in to funding such a program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are the types of issues my constituents are talking about. 
They are worried.  They want to be protected and they will be 
confident if criminals are off the street and they will have a 
better sense of safety.  They will feel less worried knowing that 
violent criminals are actually behind bars where they belong. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of course maintaining correctional centres is not inexpensive. 
The cost per criminal sometimes seems very enormous for 
continuous custody, especially very secure custody.  But is it 
not also the best insurance that money can buy?  Ask someone from 
St. Catharines, Ontario if having Paul Bernardo or Karla Homolka 
locked away makes them feel more at ease. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reason I am speaking here today has to do with fixing a 
problem, a problem that has plagued our nation since 1976 when 
Warren Allmand, then solicitor general, introduced a law that 
gave a glimmer of hope to the worst criminals sentenced to life 
in prison. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Allmand wanted criminals to have a chance at serving a 
lesser sentence if they could convince people they were suitable, 
so called, to return to society.  Mr. Allmand never really liked 
the term life in prison, and capital punishment was not an 
option.  He felt that was barbaric.  Certainly he was focused on 
the offender rather than the balance of justice and victim 
rights. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>After 15 years this Liberal government believes that a criminal 
should be allowed to seek the option of applying to a court for 
permission to be heard before a parole board.  It supports the 
criminal agenda to walk, and who can blame them?  I would not 
want to be locked up.  Nobody would. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These criminals committed crimes, very serious crimes, and 
therefore they should be prepared to do the time, the whole time, 
25 years before being allowed to apply for parole. That was the 
minimum exchange and the bargain that was made with this country 
for cancelling capital punishment from the law books. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today when I finish my speech this House is going to hear the 
Liberal perhaps getting up and saying the chance for a Clifford 
Olson or a Paul Bernardo getting paroled is so slim that the 
Canadian public has nothing to worry about.  Do we really think 
that Canadians want to gamble with those types of stakes 
especially when we see the record of those who are in charge of 
the system?  I think not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-258 would simply repeal the faint hope clause; very 
simple and straightforward.  It is not necessary for the proper 
administration of justice.  It has no place in criminal law.  It 
undermines the system. However, repeal would come with a twist. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In past debates on this very issue Liberal members in this House 
have cited that if the clause were repealed it would immediately 
create constitutional challenges.  In other words, criminals who 
were sentenced after the Criminal Code was changed to include 
faint hope would not be affected by a repeal of the clause in 
this bill.

<A HREF="#LINKT36"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was an issue of retroactivity. I want to unequivocally state 
that while I would prefer to see the act changed to include 
violent criminals like Clifford Olson and so on, I see that maybe 
there are problems regarding constitutionality. Perhaps if we 
were to expand the debate, we could get into the flaws of 
Canada's constitution.  This is not the place or the time for 
that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The debate surrounding the issue has surfaced a great deal, 
particularly since Reformers came to Ottawa in 1993. We raised 
the issue for one simple reason.  It is an issue that Canadians 
care about deeply. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a country we want to feel safe.  We want the reassurance that 
violent criminals, those who have committed murder are kept 
behind bars, are sent to prison for life.  We want to feel that 
the rights of victims supersede the rights of criminals.  The 
last point is important because Liberals are ignoring it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Warren Allmand said in the House: “If the person is really 
reformed and no longer a danger to the public, that person after 
15 years can be put back on the street to earn his or her living, 
to support his or her family, to pay taxes rather than being paid 
for by the state while in prison while the family is being 
supported by welfare.  I am talking about a person who is no 
longer a danger to the public, who is no longer a risk and who is 
deemed to be rehabilitated by the parole board”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Warren Allmand, like many of his misguided colleagues in this 
House during that parliament, put the rights of criminals ahead 
of victims. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to read a quote from Sharon Rosenfeldt whose son was 
savagely murdered by Clifford Olson.  Ms. Rosenfeldt spoke these 
words during the last parliament debate before the Standing 
Committee on Justice: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I learned that Olson had indeed made the application, I was 
stunned.  Suddenly many images flashed through my mind.  I felt 
shock but I shouldn't feel shock. I felt angry but I shouldn't 
feel angry.  I felt hurt but I shouldn't be hurting. I felt 
betrayed and I felt panic.  I couldn't breathe and I couldn't 
stay still.  I kept pacing from room to room.  I wanted to cry, I 
wanted to scream and I wanted to run. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why do we have to go through this again?  I felt weak and 
vulnerable.  I could not lose my dignity again.  I went into the 
family room and took my son's picture off the cabinet.  I sat 
down and stared lovingly at him, outlining his face with my 
hands.  He looked so perfect. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>You see, I always have to reconstruct his face in my mind 
because a hammer was used on him.  He was beaten beyond 
recognition.  I cradled his picture next to my heart and once 
again made the same promises I had 15 years earlier.  I got on my 
knees and I asked God to give me the strength to keep my dignity. 
This is very important to me because after Clifford Olson took 
my child's life, he also took my dignity for a while. I will not 
let Olson and the system do that again. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like my colleagues opposite just for a minute to put 
themselves into the situation of that victim or another.  I would 
be interested to know how many Liberal members would preach the 
same message regarding the faint hope clause if someone close to 
them was murdered and then allowed the chance to be released 
early. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is easy to talk the talk.  Liberals preach that we should 
really give murderers another chance.  Liberals say they served 
some time, therefore if they are reformed then let them have 
another crack at open society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would they really feel comfortable having the murderer walk the 
streets, the same murderer who took the life of a loved one? 
Would they maybe change their minds? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reason I introduced this bill and the reason that I will 
continue to fight for the repeal of the faint hope clause has 
everything to do with standing up for victims like Sharon 
Rosenfeldt. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These victims deserve the right to have a voice.  They deserve 
the right to be shown the utmost respect.  However, the way the 
bleeding hearts have crafted our judicial system, it seems to 
give most of the rights to the criminal.  That is the impression 
the Canadian public has. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals will say victims are given many rights such as 
victim impact statements and so on.  The truth is that if they 
cared so much about victims, people such as Sharon Rosenfeldt and 
the thousands of others who find themselves in similar situations 
would not be so disgusted with the justice system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-258 unfortunately would do little to stop Clifford Olson 
from his opportunity for a hearing.  It would, however, stop such 
travesties of justice in the future.  It would change the meaning 
of a life sentence.  It would allow victims some peace of mind. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Clifford Olson will again be allowed the right to be heard 
before a court some day.  Every time this happens, victims will 
be made to endure agony.  There are many like him all because of 
a small clause in the Criminal Code, section 745, all because 
bleeding heart Liberals think the rights of the criminal 
supersede others. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As legislators we are bound by so many things.  Reformers are 
doing whatever we can to change the system to make it fairer, to 
be more responsive to the Canadian agenda, more transparent.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will fight for what is right, even if it is one small step at 
a time.  That is the purpose of this small bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When a judge sentences a criminal to life in prison it should be 
understood that they will serve 25 years before eligibility for 
parole.  I shudder when I think that someone like Olson, who 
brutally murdered innocent people, children, would be given a 
chance at all for parole, but that is the law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The section I am trying to repeal provides a glimmer of hope to 
someone who does not deserve one.  I understand it is not a 
guarantee that a criminal will be released, but that glimmer of 
hope is enough to send a shiver down my spine. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members of this House should imagine only for a moment what it 
must be like for a victim knowing that the murderer of their son 
or daughter will have a chance to walk free. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I say to my Liberal friends, bandage up your bleeding hearts 
just for once and take a stand on behalf of victims of this 
country.  I do not believe that any member wants the most violent 
criminals of this world to be walking the streets.  That is not 
the issue.  Therefore, there is no reason to want to keep the 
faint hope clause in the Criminal Code.  I ask, for once do what 
is right and get rid of section 745.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Eleni Bakopanos (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Justice and Attorney General of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, Bill 
C-258 proposes to delete section 745.6 of the Criminal Code, 
which provides for judicial review of the parole ineligibility 
period in respect of persons convicted of murder or high 
treason. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government believes that section 745.6 ought to continue to 
be applied in exceptional and deserving cases.   For this 
reason, the bill being proposed by the hon. member of the 
opposition clearly runs counter to federal government policy, 
and we are not, therefore, in favour of it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the hon. members are aware, section 745.6 was passed in 1976, 
at the time the death penalty was abolished in Canada.  At that 
time, this House believed that section 745.6 was necessary in 
order to provide hope of rehabilitation to those convicted of 
murder and to protect prison guards.  Adoption of this clause 
was also a recognition of the fact that, in certain cases, 
incarceration in excess of 15 years was not in the public 
interest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe that the reasons justifying addition of this section 
to the Criminal Code in 1976 remain valid today.  Section 745.6 
of the Criminal Code allows persons convicted of murder to apply 
for a judicial review of the number of years to be served before 
eligibility for parole, after they have served 15 years of their 
sentence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the case of first degree murder or treason, the time to be 
served before eligibility for parole is set by law at 25 years. 
In the case of second degree murder, the number of years of 
imprisonment without eligibility for parole is 10 years, unless 
the judge at trial extends it to 25.  The offender may not apply 
for judicial review of the number of years of imprisonment 
without eligibility for parole until he has served 15 years of 
his sentence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The offender has to convince a jury of 12 ordinary citizens that 
the number of years should be reduced.  After the jury has 
examined the evidence presented by the applicant and the crown 
attorney, including any victim statements, it decides whether it 
is appropriate to reduce the number of years of imprisonment 
without eligibility for parole. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the jury does decide to reduce it, the offender has the right 
to submit an application to the National Parole Board on expiry 
of the period as reduced by the jury under section 745.  The 
parole board then looks at his file and grants parole when it 
sees fit to do so. 
In order to reach its decision, the National Parole Board must 
determine whether paroling the offender would constitute an 
undue threat to public safety. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I must stress one point that is essential to an understanding of 
this matter, but may not be readily understood by the public. 
The life sentence imposed upon a person convicted of murder or 
high treason weighs upon this individual for the rest of his 
life.

<A HREF="#LINKT38"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Thus, when an offender is released, his sentence still applies, 
and he may be reincarcerated at any time if he violates the 
conditions set by the parole board. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is not an easy way to get out of jail, as the opposition 
would have Canadians believe.  Section 745.6 establishes an 
extremely rigorous procedure, and those who apply are very 
rarely successful.  The fact is that the vast majority of those 
eligible to apply for a judicial review never do so.  They 
simply decide to forgo the opportunity of their own accord, 
perhaps because they know that their efforts would be to no 
avail. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We all know that there is a great deal of public concern about 
section 745.6.  Many have asked for the repeal of this section 
out of concern for public safety.  Others have cited the 
revictimization of the victim's family by the review hearing held 
15 years down the road at a time when the terrible wounds 
inflicted by the crime may have just started to heal.  Others 
focus on the appropriate minimum period of incarceration for the 
worst offence in our Criminal Code. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This government shares the concerns of Canadians.  That is why 
the government amended section 745.6 in the last Parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As many members of the House will know, Bill C-45 brought three 
key changes to section 745.6.  The first eliminated judicial 
review for all multiple murders committed in the future whether 
the murders are committed at the same time or not.  This would 
include serial murders.  The proposed amendment is consistent 
with the notion long found in the Criminal Code which states that 
a repetition of the offence should be treated more harshly by the 
law than the single offence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second created a screening mechanism whereby a judge of the 
superior court could conduct a paper review of the application to 
determine if there is a reasonable chance of success before the 
application is allowed to proceed to a full hearing before a 
jury. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The third provided that the parole ineligibility period may only 
be reduced by unanimous vote of the community jury, whereas 
previously only two-thirds of the jury were required.  As a 
result of this provision an application for a reduction in the 
parole ineligibility period will be denied whenever the jury 
cannot reach a unanimous conclusion to reduce the period. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Section 745.6 was intended to be applied only in exceptional and 
deserving cases where the offender has really been able to turn 
his or her life around.  Our government's amendment to this 
section has strengthened this and has gone a considerable 
distance in preventing non-meritorious cases from coming forward. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With the changes we have made, our government has attempted to 
reach out to the families of victims.  In this mandate the 
government is also looking at what more can be done for victims 
and their families to acknowledge the pain they feel.  Improving 
the criminal justice system to respond to victims' concerns is 
one of the top priorities for the Minister of Justice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Following the receipt and review of the report of the Standing 
Committee on Justice and Human Rights in the fall of 1998, the 
Minister of Justice intends to move ahead with appropriate 
legislation and non-legislative initiatives to improve the 
situation of the crime victim. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In April 1998 the minister tabled in this House a letter which 
she sent to the chair of the Standing Committee on Justice and 
Human Rights expressing her interest in its review of the 
victim's role in the criminal justice system.  In the letter she 
noted particular issues which she anticipated would be raised in 
the committee proceedings, including the adequacy of existing 
provisions to facilitate the participation of victims and 
witnesses in the criminal justice system, the need to explore 
reforms to the victim impact statement provisions, enhancements 
to the Criminal Code's victim fine surcharge provision and the 
need to accommodate the interests of victims in the youth justice 
system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister also noted that she was considering various models 
for the establishment of an offence for victims of crime within 
the Department of Justice which would, among other things, ensure 
that the victim's perspective is considered in the development of 
all criminal law policy and legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a lot more we can do for victims and their families 
than just focus simplistically and single-mindedly on the repeal 
of section 745.6, as the official opposition has in the past few 
months in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These amendments came into force on January 9, 1997. 
At present officials from the Department of Justice are 
monitoring their impact on this section to see if they are 
achieving their aim.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Yes, I do have blood in my veins, as the official opposition 
would like us to believe.  Yes, we are bleeding heart Liberals. 
But if that means that we are compassionate and that we care 
about every Canadian in the country, yes, that is what it means. 
Compassion is part of what this government is all about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am proud to be a bleeding heart Liberal if that is the 
definition that the official opposition would like us to believe. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government believes, as do many Canadians, that even those 
found guilty of very serious criminal acts should be able to 
acknowledge their crimes and rehabilitate themselves.  We feel 
that it is important that our justice system have a mechanism 
allowing people, in exceptional cases, an opportunity to rebuild 
their lives. 
<P><A NAME="LINK198"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier—Montcalm, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
echoing the government member somewhat, we in the Bloc Quebecois 
also believe that this bill is not votable.  If it were, we 
would vote against it, because I believe that there are some 
very important principles involved, ones which the Reform Party 
appears to have ignored. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It must not be lost sight of that the objective of this bill is 
the deletion of sections of the Criminal Code which allow a 
judicial review of the parole ineligibility period with respect 
to certain life sentences. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Certainly, on first examination, the Reform Party approach seems 
to have some merit, but once again—and this is not the first time 
I have said this—we must look at the Canadian justice system in 
its entirety, and not just approach it piecemeal, trying to 
solve certain problems one at a time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe the entire Canadian system is a bit like a giant 
jigsaw puzzle. 
If one piece is taken away, there is a whole section that cannot 
be put together, and this is a very dangerous thing.  In the 
case before us now, what the Reform bill would have us remove is 
a vital piece of the justice system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Much has been said on this.  I had a written text, but I do not 
think I shall follow it, because the basic problem is readily 
understood.  Where the justice system is concerned, we must not 
go overboard.  The justice system must not be examined in the 
light of some cases that make front page headlines.  This is not 
the way the problem can be solved. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the present time, the Criminal Code contains a series of 
sections on parole mechanisms, starting with 745.6. 
It is not true, as I have heard said on this side of the House, 
that it is so easy for a criminal to obtain parole.  We must 
start with the basic premise that the parole system has one very 
clear objective, and that is rehabilitation.  If there is no 
agreement on that principle from the start, it is obvious that 
what will follow will be fruitless dialogue and that we will 
never be able to reach an agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Quebec, for the past 30 years at least, we have had a clear 
idea where both young and adult offenders are concerned that 
there must be a rehabilitation component to the parole process. 
This is extremely important. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Rehabilitation is not automatic, obviously.  Before a case is 
examined in order to see whether a person who has committed a 
serious crime and been given a life sentence can obtain any type 
of parole, within the system we have at the present time, it is 
certain that an analysis has been carried out. 
We have to be sure that the offender's behaviour will not pose a 
threat to society.  It is not true that just anyone is released. 
A case is examined and an extremely important review procedure 
takes place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This procedure can be found in section 745.6, which was debated 
in the House in 1996 with Bill C-45, as I am sure members recall. 
At the time, the government proposed limiting accessibility to 
the review procedure through a series of legislative amendments. 
I remember this very clearly because I thought back then that 
the government was going too far. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1815"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT40"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even today, I think that the government went too far, but it is 
now part of the system.  We must live with it and make the best 
of it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we examine the issue from a public safety standpoint, the 
higher the bar is placed for a criminal seeking release, the 
greater the guarantee of public safety, of course.  Even before 
the government's amendments, the safeguards for society were 
adequate, but the government added additional obstacles for 
these offenders and the result is that today we are fine with 
the amendments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even with the government's amendments to Bill C-45, the Reform 
Party is proposing the repeal pure and simple of the review 
process. 
When we look at the legislation that the government opposite is 
producing, inspired by Reform Party ideas, we can see 
similarities between the two parties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>From a justice and legislative point of view, there are 
similarities with respect to severity and repression. We will 
see this again in the very near future, when the government 
introduces a young offenders bill.  I am sure that the 
government will crack down and that Reform Party members will 
say the government is not going far enough.  But this is not how 
Quebec has looked at things for at least 30 years, as I have 
already mentioned. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To come back to the review procedure which is the focus of the 
bill, section 745.6 cannot be viewed as an escape clause for 
offenders trying to shorten their sentence.  I think that the 
review procedure provided for in section 745.6 is complex and 
elaborate. 
We must avoid the conclusion that criminals purging life 
sentences have too easy access to early parole because of 
section 745.6 of the Criminal Code. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A clear understanding of the application for review procedure 
necessitates reference to section 745.6 and sections 745.61 to 
745.64, which describe how the review procedure works.  On 
reading these new sections, we see that the review is not a 
matter of chance.  It is far from being a lottery for inmates. 
If they are lucky, they get paroled, if they are not, their 
applications get turned down.  The review is rigorous and has 
two stages.  First, there is the initial examination mechanism 
and then the admissibility of the application is considered. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I listened earlier to the parliamentary secretary as she clearly 
summarized the review application procedure. 
I will focus on one point only, which is that the application, 
once accepted, is put to a jury, and, here again, it is no 
cakewalk for the inmate.  He must convince the jury of the 
validity of his application for release.  This is no easy 
matter.  The procedure is highly complex.  I am not saying it is 
too complex for the criminal.  I am saying there is no need to 
alert public opinion over such matters. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our system has been improved over the years.  There are of 
course cases like Olson's, which a Reform member mentioned 
earlier.  Everyone agrees that such cases could no longer occur 
under the current legislation.  There was indeed a loophole in 
the Criminal Code, but we tried to plug it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although I may once again appear to be defending the government, 
my purpose is in fact to see that justice prevails. 
This is a matter of fairness.  Even in cases involving 
criminals, I think the legislation must be fair.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will sum up very briefly why the Bloc Quebecois is opposed to 
this bill.  First, we oppose it because it goes against the 
sentencing guidelines of public safety and rehabilitation. 
Second, the bill is based on the misconception that early 
release is impossible, even if rehabilitation has truly taken 
place.  Third, the review procedure provided for in the bill is 
too complex and elaborate to think that offenders serving life 
sentences can abuse it.  Finally, the opportunity to declare an 
offender dangerous under section 752 of the Criminal Code 
reduces the possibility of repeat offences. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact is that I have not had the time to elaborate on the 
subject but, once again, there are provisions for declaring 
someone a dangerous offender and this entire review procedure is 
impossible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the reasons I have mentioned, I think that Canada's parole 
system does not jeopardize public safety.

<P><A NAME="LINK199"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough, PC):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to rise in the House to speak in 
support of Bill C-258 as moved by the hon. member for New 
Westminster—Coquitlam—Burnaby. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill is consistent with Progressive Conservative policy to 
repeal section 745 of the Criminal Code, better known as the 
faint hope clause.  It is also consistent with a motion that I 
tabled in the House last year similarly calling for the repeal of 
section 745. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is sadly ironic today that the Liberals are defending the 
faint hope clause since yesterday we heard their defences of Bill 
C-68, which should be henceforth known as the false hope clause. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals have truly shown themselves as more than happy to 
give faint hope to convicted killers such as Clifford Olson, as 
previously mentioned, while giving false hope to Canadians 
worried about crime committed with firearms. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although the amendments proposed in the bill by the hon. member 
would not apply retroactively, it would at least ensure that 
murderers are fully held accountable for the crimes that they 
commit.  Accountability is a very important principle in our 
justice system and one which many feel has been neglected of 
late.  From the Prime Minister's recent performance in the House, 
it would seem that accountability is also being neglected in the 
Chamber. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>An injection of accountability into our justice system is 
something most Canadians would surely welcome.  This would be 
taken into account with other principles of rehabilitation, as 
has been mentioned by friend from the Bloc; general and specific 
deterrents; other sentencing principles; and principles of 
justice and fairness. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In early 1997 the Liberal government of the day amended the 
Criminal Code to restrict the provisions for judicial review. 
Three fundamental changes were enacted at that time.  First, 
offenders who committed multiple murders would no longer have the 
right to apply for section 745.6 under the Criminal Code. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, applicants, including those serving time for murder at 
the time of the amendments coming into force, would no longer 
have the automatic right to a section 745 hearing, going instead 
to a superior court judge to decide whether the applicant could 
then show a reasonable prospect for success before the 
application moved any further. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The third amendment to that section would require that a jury 
reach unanimous consent to order a release instead of the 
previous threshold of only a two-thirds majority. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While those amendments were certainly well intentioned, they 
contained a number of flaws.  The new provisions implied that a 
single murder should be considerably less serious than multiple 
murders.  Since multiple murderers convicted after January 1997 
would be ineligible to apply for judicial review under section 
745 at the time, it brings into question the overall fairness 
when one considers it from the victim's point of view. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As they would later do with the hepatitis C victims, the 
Liberals apparently drew an artificial line in the sand with 
respect to multiple murders as opposed to single premeditated 
murders.  I would suggest that all premeditated murders should be 
treated equally under this provision.  Does it not degrade the 
memory of the murder victims and the suffering that was inflicted 
upon them and their families to draw this sort of distinction? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My second criticism of those amendments was that the 
government's much touted amendments of section 745 amounted to no 
real changes with respect to the way judicial review hearing 
processes were conducted.

<A HREF="#LINKT42"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am sure all members will agree the process is extremely 
important in that the hearings for early parole eligibility 
remain with the very limited information about the crime 
committed by the offender.  To seriously restrict information 
with respect to the crime committed during these hearings is akin 
to restricting information with respect to the crime itself 
during the original trial and sentencing proceedings. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberal amendments also created another level of 
bureaucracy, that is the government's decision to replace the 
criminal's absolute right to a hearing with an absolute right to 
apply for a hearing which might also lead to further appeals 
within the system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the arguments the Minister of Justice, the solicitor 
general and their respective departments advanced at this time 
against the over reliance on incarceration is therefore lost. The 
Liberals make this contention while they create another level of 
bureaucracy to facilitate the release of convicted killers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a sad and telling statement on the priorities of the 
government.  It provides different ways for murderers to get out 
of jail while victims of crime still to this date have no voice, 
no advocate within the criminal justice system at this level. The 
Minister of Justice and the solicitor general can only scratch 
their heads and wonder why Canadians continue to have a cynical 
and distrustful view of our justice system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Section 745, regardless of the Liberal government's amendment a 
year and a half ago, continues to force families of victims to 
relive the murders and to relive them at the cost of the 
taxpayer.  Some would say that the lack of a death penalty is the 
hallmark of a civilized society, but there are certainly many 
Canadians who would suggest it is certainly uncivilized to force 
the families of murder victims to once again go through this type 
of judicial revisiting of the offence itself.  We certainly 
witnessed that just over a year ago with Mr. Olson's hearing in 
British Columbia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps the families of murder victims should launch a legal 
challenge under the Charter of Rights and Freedoms on the basis 
that a section 745 Criminal Code hearing violates their section 7 
charter rights that everyone including these victims have a right 
to life, liberty and the security of persons and a right not to 
be deprived thereof except in accordance with the principles of 
fundamental justice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is a section 745 hearing in accordance with the principles of 
fundamental justice?  I doubt it.  I challenge any hon. member in 
the House who supports section 745 to rationally assert that this 
is fundamentally just. I fear that it might come to that and that 
the victims of crime and their families will have to go to court 
to get a judicial opinion with respect to this piece of 
legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform Party has often made its views very clear in the 
House about judicial activism.  I suggest there is a graver 
danger at work, that is legislative pacifism where society's most 
vulnerable individuals, victims and in many cases children, have 
no other public forum to have their views addressed by the 
courts.  What are we doing in the House if we are not doing 
everything to protect those persons? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore I would suggest that section 745 needs to be repealed, 
and the sooner the better.  We in the House need to reflect upon 
the wishes of those individuals who are unable to speak for 
themselves.  This is why I put forward the premise and the 
suggestion that the government should be establishing an 
independent ombudsman for victims which would also be in 
accordance with the government's repeated position that it wants 
to do more for victims.  This would be consistent with that wish. 
Victims would be given a greater voice within the justice system. 
They would be given an independent person, a place of appeal, for 
information, a place where they could go to have their voices 
heard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I urge all hon. members of the House, especially the government 
members who spoke so passionately in favour of victims rights, to 
justify their support for Bill C-68, to join with opposition 
members in supporting the bill.  As such, at this time I move for 
unanimous consent to make this bill deemed a votable item. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  The hon. member for 
Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough has asked for the unanimous 
consent of the House to make this bill votable.  Is there 
unanimous consent? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Agreed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  No. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  Four 
members would like to speak to the bill before the mover gets the 
last five minutes to wrap up.  If hon. members would keep that in 
mind, we will see if we can get everybody worked in given that we 
have 15 minutes to go.

effect pronounced itself on the matter but regrettably when the 
bill was referred to committee the Liberal dominated committee 
effectively killed the bill.  Subsequent to that Bill C-45 was 
brought forward. As I have said on many occasions, Bill C-45 
simply does not go far enough.  Short of a complete repeal of 
section 745, I do not believe Canadians would be satisfied. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are dealing here with the penalty for first degree murder, 
the most serious and offensive crime in the Criminal Code of 
Canada.  We are not dealing with a crime of passion. We are not 
dealing with manslaughter.  We are dealing in some cases with 
second degree murder.  For the most part we are dealing with 
those individuals who have the wherewithal to plan the murder of 
another human being in a very deliberate way.  These are people 
who have in some cases murdered a single individual and in other 
cases more, like Clifford Olson who murdered 11 innocent 
children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This evening we are discussing what the appropriate penalty 
should be for that crime.  Surely to give to certain people who 
commit that type of crime the right for their parole 
ineligibility be reduced to 15 years is nothing short of 
unconscionable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is clear where Canadians stand on what the punishment ought 
to be for first degree murder.  Poll after poll over the years 
has indicated that Canadians support capital punishment. This 
House voted against the reinstatement of capital punishment a 
number of years ago. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Short of that the Canadian public would like to see a just 
criminal justice system that would entail a severe penalty for 
first degree murder.  Most Canadians thought that the penalty for 
first degree murder was a minimum of 25 years in prison. Until 
recently when the media would report a conviction they would say 
that the individual would be serving a minimum of 25 years.  That 
was not the case. As my hon. friend pointed out, in 1976 the 
so-called faint hope clause was inserted into the Criminal Code. 
It took 15 years before Canadians came to realize that the faint 
hope clause was in effect the sure bet clause because the success 
rate was around 80%.  So 80% of those who applied to have their 
parole ineligibility reduced had their parole ineligibility 
reduced.  That is simply not acceptable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I estimate that 95% to 98% of Canadians would like to see the 
repeal of section 745 to render the criminal justice system a 
just system.  Right now Canadians are cynical about the criminal 
justice system.  There is considerable disrespect not only 
because of the inclusion of section 745 in the code but other 
problems with the Young Offenders Act, concurrent sentencing, 
parole and probation provisions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians want to see a criminal justice that is just, that puts 
public safety and the rights of victims in front of the rights of 
accused persons and criminals, including those serving time for 
murder. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Regrettably Bill C-258 will not be voted on because of the 
private members' process that we have in existence today.  That 
is another debate. 
It is unfortunate because it seems to me that the whole process 
is somewhat meaningless unless matters such as this are brought 
to a vote in the House so all members of parliament can exercise 
their democratic duty and pronounce themselves on behalf of their 
constituents. This bill could, if voted on, be made retroactive 
if parliament were to decide to use the notwithstanding clause.

views of my constituents and the overwhelming majority of 
Canadians.  I am pleased that we are once again debating this

I too support the bill proposed by the hon. member for New 
Westminster—Coquitlam—Burnaby, Bill C-258.  I will keep my 
comments rather brief and to the point through a personal story. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If there is every a place that you do not want to meet somebody 
it is at a hearing involving a section 745 case. Unfortunately 
that is where I met one of my constituents for the first time, 
Mr. Ray King.  Mr. King is the father of one of Olson's victims. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. King came to me prior to that case and shared with me the 
years of anguish he went through personally as a result of the 
incident that unfortunately happened to his son. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is what this is about.  We have heard in the House today 
philosophical difference.  There certainly is a very big 
philosophical difference. This philosophical difference has a 
dramatic impact on individual lives,  Mr. King's life being a 
clear example of that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will read into the record a few of the comments made 
by Mr. King and the anguish that he shared personally and 
publicly in this process he had to go through: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The nightmares that had been absent in my life for several 
years returned (after going through this process). 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We get a life sentence too. And it doesn't end after 15 years or 
20 years.  Having those victim impact statements read aloud in 
the presence of this person was the ultimate obscenity. 
Throughout it all, the grin never left his face. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I found it impossible to make any sense of the fact that this 
person, who had taken away our right to see our children grow up 
to adulthood, should demand and be afforded concessions. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is the heart rending situation in this section 745 case and 
this bill.  It is not understandable why this bill is not votable 
today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The parliamentary secretary mentioned the changes the government 
has made.  I think she said it goes against government policy, 
therefore it is not in favour of it.  It is simply bad policy. 
It is bad legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to ask ourselves on this side and individuals across 
Canada have to ask themselves is this government willing to 
accept bad policy and bad law which negatively affects 
individuals across this country.  We must conclude by the actions 
and the statements made here today by members on the government 
side that it is the case.  That is a sad commentary on the state 
of this government and its response to the criminal justice 
system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. King's comments are comments I will never forget.  I was an 
18 year old in Coquitlam where Olson was when his reign of terror 
was going on. I have mentioned that in the House before and I 
mention it again because I know personally the fear that gripped 
the community.  I also many years later was in the unfortunate 
circumstance of having to hear Mr. King's tragedy and the loss 
that changed his life forever. It is not fair to put individuals, 
not one individual Canadian, through that experience. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If this government had the initiative to remove section 745 not 
one Canadian would have to go through what Mr. King went through. 
That is the tragedy we are talking about.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lynn Myers (Waterloo—Wellington, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
as the former chairman of the Waterloo regional police I have a 
very keen and strong interest in this area of the Criminal Code. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-258 proposes the repeal of section 745.6 of the Criminal 
Code, a provision which provides for judicial review of the 
parole ineligibility period for persons convicted of murder and 
high treason. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to re-emphasize the position of the government. We 
believe that section 745.6 should be retained for exceptional and 
deserving cases and as such Bill C-258 is in direct conflict with 
government policy and therefore certainly I do not and the 
government does not support it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Section 745.6 was enacted in 1976 when the death penalty was 
abolished in Canada.  That section was necessary as a source of 
hope for the rehabilitation of convicted murderers and as a 
protection for prison guards. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe the reasons that justified its addition to the 
Criminal Code then are still valid today.  An offender must 
satisfy a jury of 12 citizens drawn from the community that the 
parole ineligibility period should be reduced. At that hearing 
after evidence called by the applicant and by the crown including 
any information the victims of the crime may wish to bring to the 
attention of the jury it is the jury which decides whether to 
reduce that parole ineligibility period. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to emphasize a point that is crucial to an accurate 
understanding of the issue.  However, it is not always understood 
by others and perhaps some in the public that the life sentence 
imposed on a person convicted of murder or high treason continues 
literally for the offender's entire life. Accordingly in those 
cases where such an offender is released on parole the offender 
continues to be subject to the sentence and can be reincarcerated 
at any time should he or she breach a condition of release 
imposed by the parole board. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Section 745.6 sets out an extremely rigorous procedure.  If we 
look at the facts the vast majority of those eligible to apply 
simply never do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a great deal of public concern about section 745.6.  I 
share that and the residents of Waterloo-Wellington and all 
Canadians share that.  The government certainly shares that 
concern as well and that is why the government amended section 
745.6 in the last parliament.  We recognized the concerns that 
were raised and we moved to deal with them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As many members of the House will know, Bill C-45 brought three 
key changes to section 745.6.  The first eliminated judicial 
review for all multiple murders committed in the future whether 
the murders are committed at the same time or not.  This would 
include serial murders.  The proposed amendment is consistent 
with the notion long found in the Criminal Code that the 
repetition of the offence should be treated more harshly by the 
law in a single offence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second created a screening mechanism whereby a judge of a 
superior court would conduct a paper review of the application to 
determine if there is reasonable chance of success before the 
application is allowed to proceed to a full hearing before a 
jury. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The third provided that the parole ineligibility period may only 
be reduced by a unanimous vote of the community jury, whereas 
previously only two-thirds of the jury were required.  As a 
result of this provision an application for reduction of the 
parole ineligibility period will be denied whenever the jury 
cannot reach a unanimous conclusion to reduce the period. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a lot more we as a government are doing for victims and 
their families.  It is much more than simply focusing in on 
single minded or simplistic views such as the repeal of section 
745.6.  The government believes, as many Canadians and certainly 
residents in my area do, that people who are guilty of a terrible 
act should be given a chance to come to terms with their crime 
and rehabilitate themselves.  In the government's view it is 
important that our justice system include a mechanism which gives 
some people a chance in exceptional circumstances to turn around 
their lives.

only to stand in his place and request unanimous consent for the 
time to be extended. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Forseth:</B>  Mr. Speaker, we have to go back in time 
and remember that section 745 of the Criminal Code was slipped in 
but the effects of it, the consequences were not really 
appreciated at the time by the public.  It took quite a while 
before these early untimely parole eligibility processes began to 
kick in.  The press began to respond to the emerging public 
concern if not disgust, leading eventually to outrage when for 
example Clifford Olson laughed at parliament, Canadians and every 
misguided politician who supported the twisted logic of this 
section. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Section 745 has to go.  It serves no positive benefit for the 
administration of justice.  I have been on the line supervising 
parolees.  I have heard all the games.  It has no place in 
Canadian criminal law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This section has been a focal point, a lightning rod, an example 
of something that brings the justice system and parliament into 
disrepute.  Reformers will not rest until section 745 is gone. 
That is the people's agenda, the agenda from coast to coast. 
Thousands of names have been tendered in petitions here in this 
parliament on the subject. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have had protest rallies on Parliament Hill and across the 
country on it.  What does it take to get it done?  Once it was 
mistakenly put in place it has been so long and so hard for 
Canadians to get government to correct the wrong done to the 
country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here again we have the topic before parliament and the Liberal 
members through their control of the system for private members' 
bills would not let a vote occur on my bill.  However, it is 
still a national issue that will not go away. I brought my bill 
forward again to bring it up. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House Standing Committee on Justice and Human Rights needs 
to deal with this topic as it considers victims of crime in its 
deliberations. Therefore, I propose a carefully worded motion to 
remind the government of its duty to Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, I ask that you canvass for unanimous consent that 
Bill C-258, an act to amend the Criminal Code (judicial review) 
be not read a second time but that the order be discharged, the

address this issue.  As was noticed earlier on it is something 
that is very near and dear to my heart.  I carry a certain 
passion for it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I should first clarify my position on this.  As the member of 
parliament for Simcoe—Grey and dealing with a private members' 
bill I am a very significant proponent for repealing section 745. 
I do so for a couple of reasons.  Those two reasons are justice 
and victims rights. I encourage the members of this House to give 
consideration to the elimination of section 745 for those two 
reasons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will not repeat what some of my colleagues have commented on 
with respect to justice and the amount of time served for first 
degree murder.  In a just society, I believe there should not be 
an opportunity to have a reduction in sentence when in fact a 
premeditated murder has taken place. Perhaps even more important 
are the victims that are left behind to deal with this over and 
over again. I would like to provide a short example. I think it 
might impact on some of the hon. members of this House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I too have a constituent in my riding that has had to experience 
the loss of a loved one. In turn the murderer had the opportunity 
to go through the section 745 process.  It was not the spouse 
that had to relive that tragedy, that travesty which took place, 
but the children.  She had a very easy explanation to understand 
and certainly it is why I am a proponent to have this section 
eliminated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The children dealt with it as children some 17 or 18 years ago. 
They were able to put it behind them and get on with their lives. 
She was able to address it accordingly and raise her children in 
a very good way. Some 15 years later, the children were forced to 
deal with it again but this time as adults.  That had a very 
negative consequence on their lives.  It has had a dramatic 
effect on that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe if we are to give true consideration, if we are truly 
to be supportive of victims rights, then we have no option but to 
eliminate section 745. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On behalf of the constituents of Simcoe—Grey, I voice my 
comments here on this private members' bill and wholeheartedly 
endorse the removal and elimination of section 745.

tax.  This clearly sets this government in opposition to the 
interests of aboriginal peoples.

I am pleased on behalf of the Minister of Indian Affairs and 
Northern Development to respond to the hon. member for Halifax 
West concerning Canada's fiduciary responsibility toward its 
aboriginal people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government takes very seriously its fiduciary

context, there is much uncertainty within fiduciary law on what 
the specific duties or obligations of the federal government are 
because of this relationship.

specific obligations in this complex area, beginning as far back 
as the Calder case.  Mr. Calder was one of the elders of the 
Nisga'a clan with whom we have just signed a very historical 
agreement.  The Sparrow case is another one reaching the Supreme 
Court of Canada, and most recently the well known Delgamuukw case 
in which the supreme court outlined a broad context by which the 
federal government must interpret the specifics in each 
arrangement with its first peoples. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has studied these decisions carefully to ensure 
that Canada's actions conform to the principles articulated by 
these esteemed courts.  Among these principles is Canada's 
fiduciary responsibility to ensure that surrenders of reserve 
lands reflect the intentions of the first nations for whom the 
reserve has been set aside. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The courts are one process chosen by aboriginal people to 
resolve outstanding grievances, as they should from time to time. 
In some instances the Government of Canada has intervened in 
courts cases to which aboriginal people are also parties.  Crown 
intervention decisions like other positions in court are taken 
carefully, considering the implications for aboriginal people as 
well as for government policy.

of Health back in June relating to the health protection branch 
of government.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are a number of disturbing things happening, but what I am 
questioning is the safety and integrity of the health protection 
branch.  I think it is putting many Canadians at risk. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not think we have to look any further than the relationship 
that now exists between private industry, perhaps the 
multinational drug companies, and the health protection branch. 
There is lots of evidence out there to suggest that they are 
using a great deal of power and influence to push through the 
approval of certain drugs in Canada.  In fact, if the testimony 
of some of the scientists who work for the Government of Canada 
at the health protection branch proves to be as accurate as 
reported, we are in a great deal of difficulty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Just about every newspaper in Canada has had articles about the 
various drugs that have been pushed through the system.  That is 
wrong.  It endangers every Canadian. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have been talking about the hepatitis C victims and what 
happened following some of the misadventures of the Department of 
Health and its inability track what was happening. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As an example, the health protection branch would notify the Red 
Cross a year in advance as to when it was going to conduct a 
review of its operations.  That fact was brought out in the 
Krever inquiry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is something wrong when the chief inspector tells someone 
that he is going to inspect their operation.  What will the 
person do?  He will clean up his act.  That is exactly what 
happened in the case of the Red Cross. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Fundamentally, the problem is that the department does not have 
the resources to do its job.  We are relying on the private 
sector to do the job for us as Canadians.  We are relying on the 
private sector to tell us whether or not a drug is good or bad. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The relationship that presently exists between the Government of 
Canada and the scientific community is an uneasy relationship 
that puts every Canadian at risk. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are putting drugs on the market that have not gone through 
the proper channels of inspection.  Clinical trials, for example, 
are threatening the health of every single Canadian. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What I am asking the minister to do is to please take a serious 
look at the health protection branch.  At the end of the day, we 
have to depend on the Minister of Health and the Government of 
Canada to protect all Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are asking the Minister of Health to get a hold on his 
department and to do what is right so that at the end of the day 
all Canadians will be protected.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Elinor Caplan (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Health, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to respond to the 
member for New Brunswick Southwest, although I believe the 
question he asked of the minister some time ago was with respect 
to the bureau of veterinary drugs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, if his question is about the HPB, the health protection 
branch, I want to assure him that this minister and this 
government take the health of Canadians very seriously.  We 
understand the very important role that is played by the health 
protection branch. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister today in the House spoke about a task which has 
been undertaken that will look at the role of the HPB into the 
future.  We have begun a countrywide consultation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There has already been a meeting in Halifax.  There will be 
meetings right across this country.  I would encourage the member 
opposite to participate in those discussions.  The role of the 
health protection branch, whether in veterinary drugs, pesticide 
management, approval of new drugs, medical devices and so forth, 
touches the lives of Canadians every day.  It also has a very 
important role to play in the area of not only protection but 
promotion.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are all equally concerned about ensuring that Canada is as 
prepared as it can be and that we have the very best science. 
That is the reason the minister brought together leading 
Canadians with a science focus.  The science advisory committee 
is overseeing the review. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are very serious about ensuring that the health of Canadians 
is protected at all times and that the role of the federal 
government and Health Canada under HPB is appropriate to meet the 
needs of Canadians today and into the new millennium. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  The motion to 
adjourn the House is now deemed to have been adopted. 
Accordingly, this House stands adjourned until tomorrow at 
2 p.m., pursuant to order made Friday, June 12, 1998. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(The House adjourned at 7.06 p.m.)
