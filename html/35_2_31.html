	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
we are putting forward today a set of measures that marks 
significant progress toward the replacement of the GST. We are 
announcing the signing of a memoranda of understanding between 
the federal government and the governments of Nova Scotia, New 
Brunswick and Newfoundland and Labrador. This is the first step 
toward an integrated federal-provincial sales tax.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The province of Quebec is concluding the harmonization process 
this year. We are committed to working with the remaining 
provinces to the same end and are confident that, over time, Canada 
will indeed develop a single sales tax system. In addition, we are 
tabling a notice of ways and means motion proposing over 100 
measures to streamline and simplify the operation of Canada's 
sales tax system. These measures  are an essential part of the new 
architecture of a much improved sales tax system.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Taken together, we believe the component of this package 
constitutes a major advance in responsible sales tax reform. We 
believe that consumers, taxpayers and business, particularly small 
business, will benefit. True, this is not perfection, but perfection is 
not possible in the real world where tax policy has to apply. It is, 
however, real improvement.
<P>
<B>(1005)</B>
<P>
	Let me address at the outset the question not of responsible tax 
policy but a broader question, that of responsible government. In 
the red book we wrote: ``A Liberal government will replace the 
GST with a system that generates equivalent revenues, is fairer to 
consumers and to small business, minimizes disruptions to small 
business and promotes federal-provincial fiscal co-operation and 
harmonization''. We believe that today's plan begins that process.
<P>
	We know that many Canadians believed we would be able to do 
more than we are announcing today. Indeed, we had hoped we 
would be able to do more. However, there is something Canadians 
deserve above all else and that is government that is responsible in 
its management of the economy and honest in what it does. Let me 
be direct with the House and with Canadians.
<P>
	During the election campaign we were right to criticize the GST. 
It created overlap and duplication among governments. It was 
costing small business time, energy and money; the price paid for 
having to keep two sets of books, to track two sets of transactions 
and to deal with two tax collectors. We were right to say that all 
that was wrong. It still is. However, we were mistaken to have 
believed that once it was anchored in place a completely different 
alternative would be within reach, responsibly. It has not been.
<P>
	The honest truth is that for two and a half years we looked at 
virtually every conceivable alternative. Some were not possible or 
desirable because of their economic impact, others because of the 
nature of our federation. What we have arrived at is not the best 
alternative conceivable; it is the best alternative possible and it is in 
keeping with our red book commitment.
<P>
	We could have dressed up our announcement today. We could 
have pretended it is more than it is. Today's  announcement begins 
the process of replacing the GST, it does not complete it. We could 
have cynically claimed this announcement was the panacea, that as 
of today the GST was dead, buried and scrapped. We know not 
being able to say this today means many Canadians will be 
disappointed. We understand that disappointment. We share it. We 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1804"> 1804 </A></B>
<P>
want Canadians to understand fully the efforts we have made going 
back more than two years in order to avoid that disappointment.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The finance committee of the House looked at this issue, 
beginning immediately after the election. It heard nearly 500 
witnesses and received more than 700 briefs-from consumers, 
from experts, from business. The committee looked at 20 
alternatives and it found all of them wanting.
<P>
	It concluded, as have we, that the best route to replace the GST 
was a simplified, integrated federal-provincial value-added tax. 
Concurrent with the work of that committee and thereafter, the 
government has worked without rest on this file.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	As a government we evaluated every proposal brought to our 
attention, every option open to us. We considered other types of 
taxes. We looked at different combinations of taxes. We looked at 
options apart from taxation. We looked at everything. Some 
options might have made cynical, short term political sense, but 
none made good policy sense.
<P>
	Let me explain by beginning with some basics. An inescapable 
fact is the GST brings in almost $18 billion a year, 13 per cent of 
the federal government's revenue. In the red book we made it very 
clear we could not give up $18 billion in revenue, nor could we cut 
spending by that amount to compensate for the loss that would be 
entailed, for the purpose of spending cuts must first be to bring the 
deficit down.
<P>
	Therefore from the beginning our focus was on finding 
alternatives to the GST, either alternative sources of revenue or 
building on taxes that already existed. We looked at 20 options. 
Among them were a payroll tax, a wealth transfer tax, a national 
retail sales tax and a wholesale tax. None of them worked.
<P>
<B>(1010)</B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Let us look at three examples: we considered the business 
transfer tax or BTT. The BTT has been proposed before but is has 
never been tried anywhere in the world. The uncertainty for 
business and the cost of implementing a totally new system is not a 
risk that can be taken lightly.
<P>
	We looked at a personal expenditure tax, where tax is paid on the 
difference between an individual's total income and his or her total 
savings for the year.  However, there are serious disadvantages with 
this option. It would be very intrusive. It would be much more 
complex for taxpayers-in terms of record-keeping and 
compliance.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	We looked at what is called a turnover or a transaction tax, in 
which tax is charged at each and every stage in the production and 
distribution process through a lower levy on a firm's sales. Unlike 
the GST, their are no rebates. The problem is the same as with a 
retail sales tax. Large manufacturing companies can get around the 
tax by making products in house, and small companies cannot.
<P>
	In the export sector Canadian business would be dealt a blow. 
Why? At each stage of the production and the distribution process 
Canadian components would be taxed and the tax would be 
embedded in the price of our exports. Who would benefit from 
that? Foreign competitors, not Canadian producers.
<P>
	These are but a few of the alternatives we looked at and 
concluded that none was satisfactory. Either they came nowhere 
near raising the revenue we need or they failed to meet one or more 
of the tests of responsible taxation of fairness, simplicity and 
economic efficiency.
<P>
	Finally, we looked at making up the revenue that would be lost 
by replacing the GST through increasing other taxes that already 
exist. We looked at an across the board approach. We looked at 
more targeted approaches. We looked at increasing corporate 
income taxes and excise taxes. It was clear that no matter what we 
did under any conceivable scenario, unduly large increases in 
personal income taxes would be required, and that was simply 
unacceptable.
<P>
	That briefly summarizes what was a very lengthy search for a 
system and a solution completely different from the GST. The 
results of our search were not what we had hoped but they did make 
very clear the direction we should take.
<P>
	While we concluded there was no alternative today to a value 
added tax, we also concluded there is an alternative to the GST 
such as it now is, and that is a much better value added tax that is 
harmonized.
<P>
	Governments need the revenue the current tax system brings in, 
but Canadians do not need the headaches the current tax system 
causes. The goal we have arrived at is a simplified integrated 
federal-provincial value added tax. The process we have embarked 
on is to put the framework in place now so that provinces can join 
in when their own individual priorities make that possible; that is, 
when they are ready.
<P>
	With today's announcement we are now on the way to having a 
single federal-provincial sales tax in four provinces. Other prov-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1805"> 1805 </A></B>
<P>
inces are waiting to see how the new system works before they join 
in. In the end we are  confident Canada will eventually have a 
single sales tax system.
<P>
	We will continue to work with individual provinces as their 
circumstances permit. In the meantime unanimity need not and 
should not stand in the way. Let me describe the improvements we 
believe will flow from the approach being put forward today.
<P>
	First, an integrated federal-provincial value added tax reduces 
the burden on business, particularly on small business, created by 
the current system. It means there would be no longer separate 
federal or provincial sales taxes of different types operating on 
different bases with all the complexity and the inefficiency that 
entails.
<P>
<B>(1015 )</B>
<P>
	Canada is the only developed economy in the world that tolerates 
two completely different sales taxes operating at the same cash 
register. No one else puts up with it and it is very clear why. 
Patchwork sales tax systems are second rate systems particularly in 
an economy that is increasingly integrated globally and 
domestically.
<P>
	Under an integrated approach this will change. There will be one 
sales tax, not two. There will be one tax base, not two. There will 
be one tax rate in a province, not two. There will be one sales tax 
administration, not two. What does this mean? It means life will be 
simpler.
<P>
	Take for example the case of a store that sells washing machines. 
Today the retailer has the burden of dealing with two entirely 
different sales tax systems. The store must first total up any sales 
that are made to exempt purchases. It has to keep a separate record 
system to prove that such sales are legitimately exempt from 
provincial sales tax.
<P>
	Then at the end of each month that store must calculate the 
amount of provincial sales tax collected and remit it to the 
provincial government. At the end of each quarter along with the 
provincial sales tax calculation the retailer must also calculate the 
amount of federal sales tax collected, deduct the amount of tax paid 
on all of those purchases and remit the difference to the federal 
government. Not only that, but throughout the year the retailer 
must deal with two separate bureaucracies if he or she has any sales 
tax questions and faces the possibility at any time of having to deal 
with two separate sales tax auditors.
<P>
	No wonder that small businesses in particular are demanding 
that governments do something to address their sales tax 
compliance burden. The fact is we are now doing something. All 
this will change under the new system. It will be better for 
consumers. It will mean a reduced paper burden for small business, 
less time and money tied up unproductively, one tax form, one 
process, one system.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The Canadian Institute of Chartered Accountants has estimated 
that a harmonized national sales tax system could save Canadian 
businesses as much as $700 million per year. And because there 
will only be one tax collector, that same analysis suggests that the 
provinces could save an additional $100 million annually on their 
administration once such a system is fully in place.
<P>
	Canadians want an end to overlap and duplication between 
governments. On sales tax, this integrated system would end it 
once and for all.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Furthermore a harmonized value added tax will be economically 
more efficient. Not only will businesses save money and time but 
their products should become more competitive.
<P>
	At present businesses throughout Canada pay provincial sales 
tax on a broad range of things they themselves buy to make 
products or to keep their businesses running. This increases their 
costs and in turn leads to higher prices for their goods. As a result 
Canadian goods competing with imports at home or exports abroad 
have provincial sales tax embedded in their price. In fact because 
the tax becomes embedded in the production and distribution 
chain, the prices of our goods are often inflated not by one but by 
many layers of provincial retail sales tax.
<P>
	Under this proposal that competitive disadvantage would end. 
For instance exports are the engine of our economy. As a result of 
this reform Canadian business will be even more successful in 
markets abroad. This in turn means jobs for Canadians at home. 
Consumers should also see benefits under the new system.
<P>
	Let me address directly the contention that a harmonized value 
added tax shifts the tax burden from business to consumers. Let me 
also address the contention that consumers will lose because a 
broader range of goods and particular services is taxed under this 
approach. These arguments are simply wrong.
<P>
	The fact is that today as mentioned businesses are taxed by the 
provinces on all the items they must buy in order to make their 
products, deliver their services and keep their businesses going. 
Anyone who believes that business does not pass on these 
provincial sales taxes to the consumer is simply naive. If business 
pays a tax up front, it is consumers who pay for it in the end. The 
tax is embedded in the price. This is true for all products and 
services produced in Canada, whether or not they are taxed at the 
final point of sale.
<P>
<B>(1020)</B>
<P>
	For example, some may believe that they do not pay tax on a 
haircut when there is none directly charged to them by the barber or 
the hairdresser. That is not the case. The price does include tax: the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1806"> 1806 </A></B>
<P>
tax the barber or the  hairdresser pays on their supplies fromtheir scissors to their salon equipment to the shampoo. Whenthey decide what price to charge, they pass these costs on totheir clients.
<P>
	Under an integrated value added tax system, this changes 
completely. Provincial retail sales taxes will no longer be paid by 
businesses during the production and distribution process. 
Therefore, for goods and services not previously taxed, prices will 
go up by less than the full extent of the provincial tax because the 
embedded taxes will be removed. For those products and services 
that are presently taxed, their prices should fall. This would be the 
case even if the overall tax rate did not come down. Why? Again, it 
is because the embedded tax will disappear, lowering prices.
<P>
	Furthermore, there is another advantage to broadening the base. 
When we do not tax services, we distort the economy. We are 
imposing a burden on some businesses but not on others. A broader 
tax base spreads the burden fairly to all sectors and to all 
consumers. For instance, of significance in the light of today's 
announcement, for the harmonizing provinces in Atlantic Canada 
the broader base is one of the factors that allows for a sharp decline 
in the overall sales tax rate.
<P>
	Finally, one of the most frustrating aspects of the GST is the fact 
that without carrying around a calculator, consumers often do not 
know what things are going to cost until they get to the checkout 
counter. Every time a Canadian buys a candy bar or a pair of socks, 
GST is not on the sticker or the tag but is added as a rude 
awakening at the cash register.
<P>
	Therefore, the agreements that will be arrived at pursuant to the 
memorandums of understanding we are announcing today will put 
an end to that practice. In the three Atlantic provinces that are 
harmonizing, beginning April 1, 1997 the price will include the tax. 
The price people see will be the price people pay. However, the new 
tax will also be transparent. Vendors will be able to show the tax on 
their bills and we will be consulting with businesses on how best to 
do this.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Today's announcement entails major structural change. It 
represents an important overhaul of the sales tax system. This 
government has consistently acted on the principle that people and 
governments need to be able to plan and adjust to structural change, 
and where required, we have been prepared to provide help to those 
who face adjustment costs up front.
<P>
	For example, payments were made to provinces to address 
revenue losses they incurred under the major tax reform in 1972. 
And adjustment assistance was provided in each and every one of 
our budgets. For example, last year we provided resources to 
facilitate the adjustment flowing from elimination of subsidies 
under the Western Grain Transportation Act to the western 
provinces, as we  did with the Atlantic freight subsidies to Quebec 
and the Atlantic provinces.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Today we are following the same precedents. An adjustment 
framework will be put in place to share the costs with those 
provinces which would experience revenue losses from 
harmonization in excess of 5 per cent of their current sales tax 
revenue.
<P>
	In addition to the three provinces previously mentioned, this 
would include Prince Edward Island, Manitoba and Saskatchewan. 
On the other hand, the revenues of British Columbia, Alberta and 
Ontario would not be reduced sufficiently to trigger compensation 
under the formula, nor Quebec's for the same reason, either today 
or in 1990, the time it signed the MOU on harmonization with the 
federal government.
<P>
<B>(1025 )</B>
<P>
	Under the set formula the federal government will provide 100 
per cent of the balance of revenue losses in years one and two, 50 
per cent in year three and 25 per cent in year four. The formula has 
been applied consistently to each province that has decided to 
harmonize and it will remain open to the other provinces for the 
foreseeable future.
<P>
	Given the benefits that will flow from harmonization, we believe 
the total cost to the federal government, about $960 million for the 
three participating provinces spread over four years, is a 
responsible and reasonable investment. The federal and provincial 
governments will be sharing about equally in the adjustment costs 
over this period. The assistance will end after year four by which 
time the provinces will have had adequate time to adjust. I must 
emphasize this adjustment assistance will not jeopardize our deficit 
targets. They are secure.
<P>
	The measures being announced today include a package of over 
100 changes designed to streamline and simplify the operation of 
Canada's value added tax system. These improvements result from 
extensive consultations over the past two years with businesses, 
particularly small businesses, consumer associations and other 
groups.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Some of these are technical and sector-specific. Many will have 
a positive impact on those they affect.
<P>
	For example, as part of our commitment to assist charities and 
non-profit organizations, new rules will be put in place. As a result, 
about 10,000 charities will no longer be required to register for and 
administer the GST.
<P>
	The provision that remove the tax from medical devices used by 
persons with disabilities will be broadened, and clarified. More 
equipment and supplies for Canada's farmers will be made 
tax-free. The rules for employee benefits are being simplified-an 
area 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1807"> 1807 </A></B>
<P>
of the  sales tax that has been the focus of small business anger 
from day one.
<P>
	In addition, we will be streamlining accounting, interest, 
penalty, administration and enforcement provisions across all 
federal tax laws, something that will go a long way to simplify the 
system for small business.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	These are significant changes that will be of immediate 
importance to those concerned. However, there is one thing that is 
not being changed. The credit provided to low income Canadians 
and the rebates provided to municipalities, universities, schools, 
hospitals, qualifying charities and non-profit organizations remain 
intact.
<P>
	The provinces joining us today clearly recognize the gains that 
flow from this reform. The fact is that in a region where the need to 
secure economic growth is as acute as anywhere, tax 
rationalization and simplification is probably one of the most 
beneficial job creation initiatives that could be undertaken.
<P>
	The benefit of acting in concert so that reform in each province 
is reinforced by parallel change in the other maximizes the 
improvement for Atlantic enterprise and consumers. The benefit of 
a more efficient Atlantic economy means companies and workers 
will be able to compete more successfully in world markets.
<P>
	The benefits of less overlap and duplication mean reduced 
administrative costs for governments and small business. For 
example, small business with less than $30,000 of taxable sales 
will no longer have to register for either federal or provincial sales 
tax.
<P>
	There are benefits that will result from a lower sales tax rate. 
When this reform is fully implemented, the official tax rate will be 
3 per cent lower in Nova Scotia and New Brunswick and 4 per cent 
lower in Newfoundland and Labrador.
<P>
<B>(1030)</B>
<P>
	Indeed, the real tax reduction will be even greater because the 
new system will eliminate tax on tax. The effective rate reduction 
will then, in fact, be almost 4 per cent in Nova Scotia and New 
Brunswick and almost 5 per cent in Newfoundland and Labrador.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The announcements today are not the end of the process. They 
are a stage. As part of moving towards an integrated 
federal-provincial value-added tax, discussions with the three 
provinces will now take place to turn the memoranda of 
understanding announced today into final detailed agreements to 
take effect on April 1 of next year.
<P>
	At the same time, with Quebec's harmonization process 
proceeding, we are very much open to continued discussions with 
the remaining governements to move foward towards integration 
on the basis that has now been established.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	In summary, while the strategy we are proposing is not the best 
solution in an ideal world, we believe it is the best solution in the 
real world. The alternative would have been to have embraced 
some option that would have been superficially attractive, but in 
the end would have been more complex for Canadians, would have 
reduced the capacity of government to provide needed services and 
would have thrown the clean-up of the nation's finances severely 
off track. This we were not prepared to do.
<P>
	We are not pretending that our proposals are more than they are. 
They will have to stand on their own merits. We are not making 
changes for change's sake. We are making changes that make 
sense. That is what we were elected to do. We were elected to 
govern, to make responsible choices and that is what we are doing 
today.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I must first of all deplore the way the Minister of Finance 
tabled documents this morning, an hour and a half before his 
presentation in the House, without our hearing from him in the past 
three days about his intentions regarding the GST. If this is not a 
way to circumvent democratic principles, I wonder what it is, 
especially when such an important issue is at stake.
<P>
	What strikes me about the finance minister's speech is that we 
could have taken his old speeches from 1990, for example-the old 
speeches made by members of the Liberal Party of Canada-and 
turned them completely around to arrive at this morning's speech. 
A few years ago, the Minister of Finance was saying the exact 
opposite of what he said in his speech this morning.
<P>
	All those who expected the GST to disappear, to be scrapped-as 
many in Canada and Quebec did and as many Liberal members had 
been promising for three or four years-will be sorely 
disappointed. The GST is staying; it is not being scrapped but 
replaced by another kind of GST. This is in total contradiction with 
the many oral and written promises made by members of the 
Liberal Party of Canada.
<P>
	Allow me to quote just a few of them. On March 11, 1996-not 
so long ago-the <I>Globe and Mail</I> reprinted this quote by the 
Deputy Prime Minister:
<P>
<B>(1035)</B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	``I have already said personally and very directly that if the GST 
is not abolished I will resign''.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
That is what the Deputy Prime Minister herself said on October 18, 
1993.
<P>
	My second quote, which dates back to the 1993 election 
campaign, comes from the Prime Minister:
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1808"> 1808 </A></B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	``We will scrap the GST''.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	To scrap means to eliminate; therefore the GST was to be 
eliminated, not replaced by another kind of GST to give the 
appearance of keeping an election promise.
<P>
	I could give you any number of quotes but I will make do with a 
last one. On May 2, 1994-not so long ago-the Prime Minister 
said this: ``We hate this tax and we will make it disappear''. The 
GST is staying; the only disappearance is in the price of the 
product.
<P>
	The finance minister's new measure is hiding two important 
things. First of all, some of the figures in the finance minister's 
speech this morning are hidden; one figure is real, however: the 
cost of harmonization with the maritime provinces. It is the cost of 
buying an election promise that was not kept.
<P>
	The Minister of Finance has paid off the maritimes so that they 
would help him keep an election promise through shameless 
window dressing, as we saw this morning. A total cost of $1 billion 
has not been denied so far. One billion dollars is what Quebecers 
and Canadians from the other provinces will have to pay for an 
election promise that was not kept by the Minister of Finance and 
the Prime Minister. One billion dollars is what this measure is 
really costing us.
<P>
	But there is more. It will cost more than the $1 billion they said it 
will cost us in the next four years. I do not know if the Minister of 
Finance and his Liberal colleagues have realized this-there are 
many things they fail to realize-but reducing consumption taxes 
from 19 to 15 per cent will force all Quebecers and all Canadians 
from the other provinces to pay more in equalization to the 
maritime provinces in the future. Did he realize this? No, or if he 
did, he is hiding this additional cost from the people.
<P>
	Are these increased equalization costs, which all taxpayers in 
Quebec and Canada must pay in addition to the $1 billion the 
Minister of Finance promised the governments of the maritime 
provinces in the short term, acceptable? Are they acceptable, when 
we compare this harmonization process, this buy-off of the 
maritime provinces, to Quebec's treatment in recent years?
<P>
	Everyone here knows that Quebec's sales tax has been 
harmonized with the federal sales tax. Quebec is administering this 
federal tax. Quebec has been a good boy, a good corporate citizen 
in not demanding any compensation for this harmonization.
<P>
	Why is Quebec's effort in that area not recognized now? Why is 
the federal government now dipping in the pockets of Quebecers 
and Canadians to give $1 billion in compensation to the 
governments of the maritime provinces, but not to the Quebec 
government? We were good boys and good girls in harmonizing 
our tax with the  federal sales tax and not asking for any 
compensation so far. Is that what they call managing the Canadian 
federation? There is something wrong here.
<P>
	The new GST is a sneaky tax. It is sneaky because it is hidden in 
the price of goods and services. I listened to the Minister of 
Finance who said earlier that, in 1994 and even in 1995 and after, 
representations had been made to the finance committee by many 
people who told committee members that they were irritated and 
upset as consumers to see the GST added to their purchases.
<P>
	Others warned them against changing four quarters for a buck 
and hiding taxes.
<P>
	Let me read what the Liberal majority wrote in 1994 in its report. 
They said: ``It would just not be appropriate to hide from 
Canadians how much they pay in taxes to their government, and 
creating a hidden tax would affect their ability to force the 
government to account for how these taxes are collected and, to a 
lesser extent, for the use made of public funds''.
<P>
<B>(1040)</B>
<P>
	That is the kind of representations that were made to the finance 
committee. Most witnesses told us: ``First, abolish the GST, and if 
it absolutely has to be replaced by something else, make sure it not 
hidden from the public. Let it also be obvious that the federal 
government is unable to manage public finance properly, which 
explains why it has to keep dipping deeper and deeper in the 
pockets of taxpayers in Quebec and Canada''. That is what people 
were telling us. ``Show us the true face of public finance''.
<P>
	Instead, the Minister of Finance is proposing a hidden tax. Worse 
yet, in 1989, in its minority report on the GST, the Liberal minority, 
which was the official opposition then, wrote that, if the GST were 
hidden in the sales price, it would make it that much easier for the 
government to raise it later.
<P>
	This is what the Liberals held as true in 1989, but now that they 
are in power, the tax is not supposed to go up? We will have a 
hidden tax and it will not go up, contrary to what the Liberals held 
as true in 1989. It is a disgrace to change one's mind so radically 
and suddenly, at the expense of Canadians.
<P>
	Even back when they were in better frame of mind and did not 
have an election promise made by he Prime Minister to keep, 
Liberals were not the only ones to say that the GST should not be 
hidden. In 1994, a survey conducted among its members by the 
Canadian Chamber of Commerce showed that 70 per cent of 
Canadian businesses were opposed to a hidden tax. That is 70 per 
cent. If that is not a majority, I wonder what is.
<P>
	Recently, in February 1996, the Canadian Chamber of 
Commerce conducted the same survey again, just to realize not 
only that its members' opposition was holding strong, but also that 
the percentage of those opposed to  hiding the tax in the sales price 
had 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1809"> 1809 </A></B>
<P>
risen from 70 per cent to 76 per cent. Could the message be any 
clearer? I do not think so. This is hypocrisy on the part of a 
government that is not able to call things by their rightful name and 
to show the Canadian reality as it is.
<P>
	There is a lot of hope in that document. It refers to an agreement 
reached between the federal government and the three maritime 
provinces, which account for roughly 15 per cent of the Canadian 
population, and points out that the idea is to apply these precepts to 
all provinces. I have some news for the Minister of Finance. A vast 
majority of Canadians are opposed to the minister's project to 
establish a single 15 per cent tax to be managed by the Canada 
revenue commission, which would bump the provinces. This would 
mean that, in Ontario for example, the tax burden would increase, 
while in Alberta the commodity tax would go up from 7 per cent to 
15 per cent. Canadians unanimously believe that the Minister of 
Finance is mistaken if he thinks that other provinces will go along 
with his project.
<P>
	This unanimity exists particularly in Quebec where, for several 
years now, Quebecers have been working hard to harmonize the 
two tax bases and to manage them. Indeed, Quebec looks after the 
collection and the administration of the GST on behalf of the 
federal government. So, we worked very hard to achieve 
harmonization at no additional costs.
<P>
	The minister was too quick to dismiss the case of Quebec by 
saying, in his document <I>Towards Replacing the Goods and Services 
Tax</I>, that: ``Since the harmonization process with the province of 
Quebec will be completed this year, the government will now work 
with the other provinces to extend the system to the whole 
country''. The minister was too quick to dismiss the case of 
Quebec, because it is one thing to harmonize tax bases, as Quebec 
is doing, with the project being about 95 per cent completed, but it 
is quite another to endorse the minister's project to impose a single 
15 per cent tax, while the GST and the TVQ together amount to 14 
per cent. This project would result in a one per cent tax increase 
and would push Quebec aside by giving the Canada revenue 
commission the mandate to administer the new 15 per cent GST. 
Indeed, there is a difference between the current harmonization 
process and the finance minister's project.
<P>
<B>(1045)</B>
<P>
	Given Quebec's history of struggles to achieve autonomy in the 
field of taxation, particularly since the sixties with Jean Lesage, I 
can assure you that it will never agree to such a taxation system.
<P>
	Far from promoting tax harmonization, this project could well 
undermine efforts made in Quebec over a period of several years to 
achieve that result. Let us not forget that this harmonization project 
was implemented with the agreement of both parties and with a lot 
of goodwill. Today, the Minister of Finance is trying to fulfil  an 
election commitment-but fails to do so because he does not 
abolish the GST. He comes barging in and says: ``We will replace 
all that; we will ensure that, from now on, the federal government 
will be the one to manage this tax''.
<P>
	As a Quebecer, I would tell myself that it is not really worth 
co-operating with the federal government, since we are not paid to 
do that, nor are we compensated like the maritime provinces, who 
were paid off. Next time, we will say no and there will be no 
harmonization process. Quebec will say no. We will not get into a 
system whereby Quebec will lose its authority to set its own tax 
rate. Worse still, the federal government will raise the tax rate by 
one percentage point while the premier of Quebec has been doing 
everything he can, since he came into office, to avoid increasing 
Quebec's sales tax by one point, and even by half a point.
<P>
	We cut where we can. We put a lot into streamlining and 
consultation, and we should let the federal government interfere 
and increase the sales tax by one percentage point? No way. 
Quebec will say no. We should lose the capability to fix our own 
rate? Quebec will say no. We should allow a federal agency to 
come in and make decisions on behalf of the Government of 
Quebec? There is no way Quebec will agree to that. You can expect 
tension between the federal government and Quebec to build up, 
when things were going so well as regards the consumption tax.
<P>
	Why are they acting this way? Merely to get votes and to look as 
if they are fulfilling their promise, an election commitment the 
Prime Minister himself-and we have it on tape, as I said 
yesterday-is unable to keep.
<P>
	With an election coming up, it is sad to see how the government 
is describing this election measure, because that is what it truly is, 
and the whole situation. The government is trying to deceive the 
population by saying that the GST has been eliminated-poof, as 
my hon. colleague from Rimouski-Témiscouata would put 
it-when in fact it is making a big deal out of a minor agreement 
reached with three maritime provinces and takes this opportunity to 
say: ``As you can see, we can keep our promises''. The fact is that 
they have done nothing to keep their promise. The GST is still here, 
there is still some friction between the federal government, Ontario 
and Alberta, and the expected friction with the Quebec government 
bodes no good.
<P>
	We find this measure unfortunate. We also disapprove of the way 
the Minister of Finance and the Liberal government have dealt with 
this issue.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
completely unwilling to concede that paying $1 billion to 
harmonize the GST in Atlantic Canada is what was promised 
during the last election campaign. Even the finance minister's 
weak mea culpa, his tacit admission  that although the Liberals 
were not fulfilling their promise, they were taking a step toward it, 
is 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1810"> 1810 </A></B>
<P>
inadequate. What they promised was that they would scrap the 
GST, they would kill it, they would abolish it. That is whatthey said.
<P>
<B>(1050 )</B>
<P>
	The finance minister went to some lengths to read from the red 
book. I am going to do some reading of my own right now. 
Although what he read from the red book was accurate, I point out 
that 80,000 copies came out one month before the election. What 
was said on national television, what was said for five years leading 
up to the election and what was said on doorsteps across the 
country by Liberal members was completely different.
<P>
	I remind my hon. friends across the way what was said. Here is a 
quote from the Edmonton <I>Journal</I> dated March 1990: ``The Liberal 
Party would scrap the GST, the current human resources 
development minister pledged in a nationally televised debate on 
Monday with finance minister Michael Wilson. The goods and 
services tax is a regressive tax, he said. It has to be scrapped and we 
will scrap it''.
<P>
	Listen to this statement from the Montreal <I>Gazette</I> in 1990: ``I 
would abolish the GST''. That is what the current finance minister 
said, as quoted in the newspaper.
<P>
	Listen to this statement by the Prime Minister. He said: ``I want 
the tax dead''. That is a quote in the Montreal <I>Gazette</I> in 1990.
<P>
	I have another one from 1990. ``The Liberals will scrap the 
goods and services tax if they win the next general election,'' the 
current Prime Minister says. ``I am opposed to the GST. I have 
always been opposed to it and I will be opposed to it always''.
<P>
	The finance minister can quote from the red book, which was 
hidden during the election campaign, but the fact of the matter is 
that he, the Prime Minister and certainly the Deputy Prime 
Minister made all kinds of commitments that the GST would be 
gone.
<P>
	I have a couple more quotes from the Prime Minister and the 
Deputy Prime Minister. In 1991 the Prime Minister said: ``I say we 
will replace the tax. That is a commitment you will judge me by''. 
It is still not replaced.
<P>
	I now point to the big promise of October 18, 1993: ``If the GST 
is not abolished under a Liberal government I will resign''. That 
was stated by the Deputy Prime Minister appearing on a CBC TV 
electronic town hall meeting one week before the election 
campaign.
<P>
	The Deputy Prime Minister is still with us. Unbelievably she sits 
glued to her chair in question period day after day when the 
government is questioned about why it is that she has not fulfilled 
her promise to resign. She can turn around and throw darts at 
members like the member for York South-Weston or the member  
for Broadview-Greenwood who had the nerve to stand up and 
support their constituents. However, she sits glued to her chair 
hoping against hope that somehow her constituents will forget that 
solemn promise. I can guarantee this House that they will not.
<P>
	Members across the way do not have to accept my word for this. 
They can accept the words of their own members. I am not talking 
just about the members who were thrown out of their caucus or the 
member who quit on the basis of his own principles. I am talking 
about other members as well. The member from Mississauga has 
talked repeatedly about how the government has failed to fulfil its 
commitment on the GST. The member for Ontario has also been 
quoted in the media about the government's failure to fulfil its 
commitment to scrap, abolish and kill the GST. I am not the one 
who making these arguments. Members across the way have made 
these arguments very well.
<P>
	It speaks volumes when members believe so strongly that a 
commitment was made to scrap the GST that they are willing to put 
their jobs on the line. That is exactly what happened when the 
member for York South-Weston very courageously stood and 
voted against the budget. He saw that the commitment to scrap the 
GST which had been promised the previous summer was not in the 
budget. He stood up for his constituents and what happened? He 
was thrown out of caucus. He was mocked by the Deputy Prime 
Minister and by the people who used to be his friends. I cannot 
believe that. He stood up for his constituents. He stood up for 
Canadians around the country who believe that the government 
promised to scrap the GST. We applaud him for that. That says 
something about how widely that promise was made and how many 
members made it.
<P>
<B>(1055)</B>
<P>
	Those promises were made all across the country. I am happy to 
see that the member for York South-Weston stood up for his 
constituents even if he was ultimately punished by a meanspirited 
government that simply will not tolerate any semblance of 
democracy in this place.
<P>
	Yesterday in question period the Prime Minister talked about the 
British parliamentary model. He said that according to British 
parliamentary tradition the Liberals had to throw the member out. 
That is ridiculous and the Prime Minister knows it. Over the past 20 
years members, the British Parliament has defeated 65 money bills 
and other specific pieces of legislation. In the Canadian system 
such actions would have brought down the government.
<P>
	If government members in our system vote against the 
government, they will be out on their ears. They will be kicked off 
their committees. They will be punished, which is ridiculous.
<P>
	If we cannot have democracy in the House of Commons we 
cannot have democracy anywhere in the  country. If we are not 
allowed to express ourselves freely here, where can we express 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1811"> 1811 </A></B>
<P>
ourselves freely? Where is the mouthpiece of the people? Can the 
people not be represented in this place?
<P>
	Why does the Prime Minister bring down the iron fist of 
discipline time after time when he has a chance to let people speak 
freely and express the wishes of their constituents? He is the most 
dictatorial Prime Minister we have seen in this country, bar none. I 
believe that to be a fact and I challenge hon. members across the 
way to stand and debate that point because it is a fact.
<P>
	Canadians will not soon forget what the Prime Minister and the 
Deputy Prime Minister by her silence did to the members across 
the way. I expect other hon. members to stand and defend those 
members who allowed them to benefit from the promises they 
made during the campaign. The government was elected on the 
promise to scrap the GST. Now only two members are paying the 
price for the government's failure to fulfil that commitment. That 
is simply wrong. They are the scapegoats.
<P>
	Let us set aside the fact that harmonization, or this very tepid 
step toward harmonization, was a breaking of a Liberal promise. 
Let us speak of the agreement itself. The provinces did not ask for 
harmonization. That is a fact. The federal government in an effort 
to save face approached the provinces. It was rejected by the 
provinces because it could not make harmonization work in a way 
that made sense to the provinces.
<P>
	What did the government do? It decided to sweeten the pot. It 
decided it would kick in $1 billion so three provinces, possibly 
four, would sign on. Is that fair? What does it mean? It means that 
people in my riding, the farmer in Bow Island, Alberta, the 
fisherman in Campbell River, British Columbia, and the line 
worker in Windsor, Ontario will have to dig into their pockets, 
come up with some more tax money for the government so it can 
give it to people in Atlantic Canada.
<P>
	What ever happened to equal treatment? I see the hon. member 
from Toronto talking. People in Toronto will have to come up with 
more money to support people in Atlantic Canada, $1 billion more. 
How fair is that?
<P>
	One of the problems we have in this country is that this 
government has gone to such great lengths to treat people 
differently. Our party believes in equal treatment. We believe all 
Canadians should be treated equally. We believe all provinces 
should be treated equally. This government has bent over 
backwards to ensure it hands out privileges to certain groups, 
certain areas of the country and certain people. It has done it time 
and time again.
<P>
<B>(1100 )</B>
<P>
	I talked in the House last week about the fact that the 
government handed over $105,000 to the Canadian Bankers 
Association. That is absolutely ridiculous. It is  another example of 
how the government treats certain groups differently and specially.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Peters:</B> That is not true.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Solberg:</B> The Secretary of State for Financial Institutions is 
pointing at me, saying that it is not true. I invite him to ask the 
human resources development minister because it was through his 
department that the bankers association, after the banks made 
profits of $5.1 billion dollars, received $105,000 for training. How 
does the hon. member respond to that? I invite him to check his 
facts and he will find out it is true.
<P>
	What happened in the Constitution? The government said we 
should treat certain areas differently. It said it believes in distinct 
society. It is in favour of granting special status to certain people. 
We see over and over again how it treats people through its 
multiculturalism policy; again, special treatment. We simply 
cannot accept that.
<P>
	With regard to matters of taxation the same principle must apply. 
People must be treated equally. We cannot have seven provinces 
supporting three, or six provinces supporting four, whatever it 
comes down to. It is absolutely ridiculous.
<P>
	We have no problem with equalization payments. If provinces 
want to get on board and support other provinces because they got 
the short end of the stick over a period of time because of 
mismanagement by the government, let us support them through 
equalization.
<P>
	Do we always have to come up with ever new programs for a few 
provinces to support the many and at the expense of some people to 
support other people? That is fundamentally wrong. Not to mention 
we already have a debt of $580 billion. The Liberals may argue 
they will not tax people more, they will just borrow it. We already 
have a debt of $580 billion, so I suggest it is not a very good option. 
We have to get this mess under control.
<P>
	I will talk for a moment about some of the particulars of this 
agreement. The government is to kick over a billion dollars. 
However, it is not said how it will come up with the money for the 
other provinces if it does propose to treat all provinces equally.
<P>
	The province of Ontario would require between $2 billion and $3 
billion in order to get the same sort of deal as the Atlantic 
provinces. Where is the money to come from? Will we ask people 
in Atlantic Canada to come up with that money? What about the 
money for Saskatchewan and Manitoba? What about the money for 
British Columbia? I suggest that will not be an issue because all of 
those provinces have said it is a non-starter, it will not even happen 
because the federal government will not come up with the money. 
Besides, they do not like the overall deal.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1812"> 1812 </A></B>
<P>
	The premier of Saskatchewan has pointed out that federal 
government typically invites you in with a carrot. It gives money 
at the beginning and then it abandons you and leaves you high 
and dry. If people deny that, I invite them to look at the mess our 
health care system is in today. The federal government started out 
by funding it at 50 per cent and it is now down to 22 per cent. 
There is a long legacy from successive Conservative and Liberal 
governments where they get us on board with taxpayer money and 
then leave us high and dry.
<P>
	It was the finance minister who, when running for the leadership 
of the Liberal Party, said harmonization means forever. He said that 
once taxes were harmonized it would be very difficult to get rid of 
the GST again. What is he saying to people? Is he saying we should 
give up on the idea of having lower taxes? Should we give up on 
getting rid of the most hated tax in Canadian history? Is he saying 
we must permanently weld into place the most hated tax in 
Canadian history? By signing these agreements, that is exactly 
what has happened.
<P>
	There is another way we can lower taxes. In Ontario, Manitoba 
and Alberta today there are debates about lower taxes.
<P>
<B>(1105)</B>
<P>
	We can have lower taxes but the only way of doing it is to 
balance the budget, and the government cannot get that through its 
thick head. It goes on and on about how we should streamline and 
change the administration of the GST.
<P>
	I say get rid of the GST. The best way and the only way to do that 
is to balance the budget, eliminate it over a period of time, give 
Canadians the tax break they so richly deserve instead of going 
back to them over and over again to gouge more money from them.
<P>
	The hon. member across the way looks perplexed. Gouge? What 
can that mean? What does he mean by gouge? Since the hon. 
members across the way came to power they have taken $8.8 
billion from Canadians. That is unbelievable. That is $650 per 
taxpayer.
<P>
	The hon. members across the way are wondering how could that 
happen. All those tax measures, all those revenue measures, all 
those tax increases were hidden. That is precisely what the 
government is proposing to do with the GST in Atlantic Canada. It 
is proposing to hid it so it can push through even more tax 
increases.
<P>
	Look at all the revenue measures that have gone through the last 
couple of years, all hidden. All the excise tax increases, all hidden. 
It is simply trying to come up with creative new ways to tax people 
more, and if they doubt that I invite people to simply look at the 
record of the government. It is despicable. It is simply following 
along the same lines as the Conservatives.
<P>
	Between 1993 and 1998 revenues for this government will go up 
$25 billion, the same amount as the deficit  will decrease. In other 
words, it is exacting all of the decrease in the deficit out of the 
pockets of taxpayers, and that is unbelievable.
<P>
	To the member across the way, check your figures. It is a fact and 
the hon. member knows it. He sits on the finance committee and he 
knows that to be a fact. We do not want different taxes, we want 
lower taxes, and Canadians deserve lower taxes.
<P>
	The provinces have lead the way. It is possible with a bit of 
resolve and a bit of will. If they set their priorities they can balance 
the budget. Setting priorities is something this government has not 
done. So far it has managed to preserve spending for special 
interest. It has preserved spending for its friends in big business. As 
I pointed out to the hon. member, it does not mind giving $105,000 
to the Canadian Bankers Association.
<P>
	The hon. member knows we had representations from big 
business across the country, saying not to subsidize businesses 
anymore. What does the government do? It continues to subsidize 
businesses year after year while cutting health care by $3.2 billion, 
by cutting higher education by $1.2 billion. It is going after the 
wrong things. We could have a balanced budget if it got its 
priorities straight and did not bury its head in the sand and deny 
there is a problem. There is a very serious problem.
<P>
	I am not the only one concerned about this harmonization deal, 
nor is it only members of my party. I want to talk about what some 
of the interest groups are saying, those the minister invited to come 
forward so he could lobby them to come on side. So far they have 
not come on side.
<P>
	Catherine Swift, president of the Canadian Federation of 
Independent Business, said Ontario has to be brought on board to 
make harmonization worthwhile. The province, with 40 per cent of 
the national economy, says Ottawa's plan would cost residents $2 
billion annually and has refused to co-operate in harmonization. 
Catherine Swift said: ``If Ontario does not go and we end up with a 
half-hearted harmonization for the next 10 years that is pretty 
problematic''.
<P>
	The Canadian Chamber of Commerce is a big booster of 
harmonization, but even it has reservations. Sharon Glover, the 
group's senior vice-president of government relations, said she is 
concerned the finance minister will require the GST to be folded 
into the price tag on goods: ``Hidden taxes are too easy to raise and 
they promote distrust among consumers''. Frankly, I think 
consumers have a right to be a little distrustful of the government.
<P>
	There have been reports that the GST and the new national sales 
tax would be included in prices but broken down separately on cash 
register receipts. Of course that was confirmed by the minister this 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1813"> 1813 </A></B>
<P>
morning. The point is even the groups the hon. members from 
across the way  say are supportive of this harmonization agreement 
are not, and there are the facts to prove it.
<P>
<B>(1110 )</B>
<P>
	Canadians want a country in which MPs are free to come to the 
House of Commons to represent their constituents. That is basic. It 
is not being unreasonable. Canadians deserve to be represented by 
their members of Parliament. What the government did in throwing 
out the member for York South-Weston and in essentially forcing 
out the member for Broadview-Greenwood because he was too 
principled to sit among the rabble across the way was 
reprehensible. The government has trampled on democracy.
<P>
	I cannot believe the Prime Minister invoked the name of the 
British Parliament the other day. Edmund Burke and John Locke 
would be spinning in their graves if they heard those comments 
coming from the Prime Minister in trying to defend his heavy 
handedness.
<P>
	Canadians across the country want a government which keeps its 
promises. Canadians want a government which, when it says it will 
scrap the GST, will do it. They expect the Liberal members of 
Parliament to actually follow through and do that. They must be 
sorrily disappointed. They must be very cynical about what has 
happened across the way.
<P>
	The finance minister's implied apology at the beginning of his 
speech today suggests they are feeling the pressure. Perhaps there 
is a little tweak of conscience across the way. That is good. It is 
nice to see that finally their conscience is catching up with them.
<P>
	What Canadians want are not different taxes; they want lower 
taxes. Canadians from coast to coast have suffered under 
successive Liberal and Conservative regimes which have raised 
taxes and failed to deal with the debt problem. Every time they 
raise money, they immediately spend it. That is absolutely 
unacceptable. Canadians deserve a tax break. The only way that 
can happen is if the budget is balanced, but the government refuses 
to announce a date by which it will balance the budget.
<P>
	The government is hiding the GST in the new deal. It will 
continue to tax Canadians to death by stealth, as it has done so 
often since coming to power. There have been 22 tax measures and 
revenue measures since it has come to power, taking $8.8 billion 
out of the economy. That represents $650 per taxpayer. That is 
ridiculous. No wonder we have not had an improvement in our 
lifestyle, our disposable income since 1980.
<P>
	Canadians want to save enough for their future. Canadians want 
to save enough so they can send their children off to university. 
They want to have money they can retire on. They want to have 
money they can start businesses with. However, when the 
government talks only about changing taxes instead of lowering 
taxes, none of that can happen.
<P>
	I urge the government to forget this bogus harmonization idea 
and fulfill its promise by eliminating the deficit and moving 
immediately to start the process of eliminating the GST.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Riis:</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. I realize the 
official parties have been recognized in their response to the 
minister. I wonder, as a spokesperson for a group of independents, 
if I might have a few minutes to make a few comments on this 
important issue. I seek the unanimous consent of the House to do 
so.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Is there unanimous consent to allow the 
member to speak?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> No.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> I will ask the question again and I ask 
members saying no to say it clearly and not whisper it into their 
benches, hoping I will not hear it.
<P>
	Is there unanimous consent to allow the member to speak?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> No.
<P>

	<B>Mr. Michel Daviault (Ahuntsic, BQ)</B> moved:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That this House recognize, on the occasion of the 81st anniversary of the 
Armenian genocide that took place on April 24, 1915, the week of April 20 to 27 
of each year as the week to commemorate man's inhumanity to man.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	He said: Mr. Speaker, it is with great pleasure that I move a 
motion requesting that the Canadian government finally recognize 
the Armenian genocide by designating a week to commemorate the 
crimes against humanity committed in the past, a commemoration 
that will help us prevent the same thing from happening again in 
the future.
<P>
	I want to point out that the timing of this motion has a symbolic 
value. On April 15, Jewish communities throughout the world and 
people of all denominations gathered to commemorate the six 
million victims of the killing frenzy of the Nazi regime during 
World War II.
<P>
	Tomorrow, the Armenian community will be commemorating 
the genocide that started on April 24, 1915 in the Ottoman Empire, 
a genocide that left more than 1.5 million victims. I take this 
opportunity to pay tribute to the Armenian community in Montreal 
and elsewhere in this country, and point out its contribution to our 
collective life.
<P>
	The resolve with which the Armenian people is conserving its 
culture, its refusal to forget about the past, and its untiring efforts to 
gain international recognition for the Armenian genocide deserve 
everybody's admiration. The designation of a commemorative 
week would allow citizens of this country to show their respect for 
people who suffered extermination or fell victim to crimes against 
mankind, in particular the Armenian and the Jewish communities.
<P>
	This is not the first time we speak in this House of crimes against 
mankind or that we deplore past genocides. On April 3 of last year, 
the hon. member for  Don Valley North put forward a motion 
similar to the one I am moving today. At the time, the Bloc 
amended the motion, with its mover's assent, to specifically refer 
to the Armenian genocide. Unfortunately, the hon. member for 
Halifax, the then Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of 
Citizenship and Immigration, opposed the motion under the pretext 
that we should not designate any precise period to commemorate 
genocides because we think of them every day.
<P>
<B>(1120)</B>
<P>
	The hon. member spoke fine words but failed to act upon them. 
She contradicted herself when she said first, and I quote: ``I believe 
genocide is so horrible that the memory of past genocides will 
always be with us'', but said to conclude and I quote again: ``I must 
say that I would be concerned if we were to designate a particular 
period of time for commemorating genocide''.
<P>
	Faced with such opposition by an hon. member associated with 
the executive body, the mover withdrew his request for the 
unanimous consent of the House for a recorded division on the 
motion and thus allowed the government to avoid voting on the 
question.
<P>
	The attitude of the parliamentary secretary may have been due to 
her ignorance of the terrible lessons of the past, or perhaps it 
reflected the lack of political fortitude of this government and its 
lack of determination to defend human rights internationally.
<P>
	That is why my colleagues and I-and, I hope, the government 
and other opposition members will join us-will remind the people 
of the odious crimes of the past. In memory of that past, we will ask 
the government to adopt from now on a firm position on the respect 
of human rights in the world, starting with the recognition of the 
Armenian genocide.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	I demand that the government stop selling out Canadian 
traditions in favour of human rights and to show its true 
determination by the formal recognition of the Armenian genocide 
that happened in 1915.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Most people have already heard about the holocaust, the 
genocide of Jewish people by the Nazis. Our parents lived through 
the second world war know and have told us about it. Recently, the 
younger generation had to opportunity to see the movie 
``Schindler's List'', but how many people are aware of the 
genocide which took place during the first world war?
<P>
	Actually, very few people know that a million and a half 
Armenians were killed and that hundreds of thousands of others 
were deported in 1915 and after, under order of the Ottoman 
Empire that ruled Turkey at the time.
<P>
	The fact that the allied governments and the League of Nations 
neglected to publicly recognize this genocide  and to take sanctions 
against those responsible for it mat well have had crucial 
consequences afterwards. Indeed, on the eve of the second world 
war, 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1815"> 1815 </A></B>
<P>
Adolf Hitler said to his SS: ``Who remembers the Armenian 
genocide today?'' Personally, I refuse to prove Hitler right.
<P>
	The official opposition recognizes the Armenian genocide and 
wants to help make it known in this House, to our viewers, to the 
population at large. But first, let us give a brief historical outline.
<P>
	The Ottoman Empire was established in the 14th century, after 
Constantinople fell to the Turks. At one point, this empire covered 
most of the Middle East and of North Africa. Many Christians lived 
in this empire, in particular Greeks and Armenians.
<P>
	The Armeninans lived in Anatolia, the eastern part of modern 
Turkey. These Christians came under Turkish authority, but they 
were tolerated because they acted as a link in the trade with the 
Western world. During the first world war, the government of the 
Ottoman Empire, fighting against Russia to the east and a 
Franco-British army to the west, came to consider its Christian 
subjects as traitors and suspected them of collaborating with the 
Allies because of their religion. Then came a series of humiliations, 
followed by arrests, torture and, finally, executions and massive 
deportations.
<P>
	In addition to the massacres perpetrated by the soldiers or the 
civilian population, the massive deportations were secretly aimed 
at exterminating the Armenians. A large number of Armenians died 
of hunger, thirst and exhaustion caused by a forced exodus in 
atrocious conditions. Nowadays, this would be called ethnic 
cleansing.
<P>
	A note from the allied forces dated July 17, 1920, and kept in the 
French national archives described the Armenian genocide in the 
following terms, and I quote: ``The Armenians were massacred in 
conditions of incredible barbarity. During the war, the Ottoman 
government's actions in terms of massacres, deportations and 
mistreatment to prisoners went far beyond anything it had ever 
done in these areas. It is estimated that, since 1914, the Ottoman 
government has massacred, under the untenable pretence of a 
presumed revolt, 800,000 Armenian men, women and children, and 
deported more than 200,000 Greeks and 200,000 Armenians. The 
Turkish government has not only failed to protect its subjects of 
non-Turkish origin against looting, violence and murder, but a 
large body of evidence indicates that it also took a hand in 
organizing and carrying out the most ferocious attacks against 
communities which it was its duty to protect''.
<P>
<B>(1125)</B>
<P>
	Unfortunately, the Allies did not follow up on the massacres. 
They spent more time dividing up the former Ottoman possessions 
in the Middle East, Syria, Iraq and  Palestine, than condemning 
what has come to be known as the first genocide of the 20th 
century.
<P>
	It was not until 1948 that a definition and a formal prohibition of 
genocide were enshrined in international law. In the Convention on 
the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide adopted 
that year, genocide is defined as any of the following acts 
committed with intent to destroy in whole or in part a national, 
ethnic, racial or religious group as such: killing members of the 
group; causing serious bodily or mental harm to members of the 
group; deliberately inflicting on the group conditions of life 
calculated to bring about its physical destruction in whole or in 
part; imposing measures intended to prevent births within the 
group; and forcibly transferring children of the group to another 
group.
<P>
	I remind this House that Canada signed that convention. That is 
why I do not understand our government's persistent refusal to 
officially recognize the Armenian genocide. I deplore and condemn 
that attitude because denying the genocide is playing into the hands 
of those who committed it and who want their acts to be forgotten, 
which is the same thing as condoning their actions.
<P>
	Since the Armenian genocide, in 1915, the inertia and the 
passivity of the international community have caused other people 
to suffer large scale massacres. Beside the Jewish people, whom I 
mentioned earlier, we could mention the war in Biafra, Nigeria, 
from 1967 to 1970, where a whole civilian population was 
deliberately starved in front of helpless young French doctors who 
were later to create the organization Médecins sans frontières.
<P>
	In 1978, in Cambodia, the Khmers Rouges deported all political 
opponents into the countryside and into the fields. One million and 
a half of these deportees never came back and, a few years later, 
giant mass graves were discovered. Since then, the Cambodian 
government has built a museum gathering together the evidence of 
this genocide so that the victims will never be forgotten.
<P>
	This sort of slaughter is still going on, brought to us live on 
television for our passive consumption. We watched powerless as 
the tragedy unfolded in Rwanda and the ethnic cleansing took place 
in Bosnia. I call upon each member sitting in this House to ask 
themselves how many other similar massacres we are going to 
allow. What is our responsibility as elected representatives to 
prevent other tragedies and suffering?
<P>
	Since my arrival in this House, I have on many occasions 
criticized the government for its failure to do anything to recognize 
the Armenian genocide. But recently, I was shocked and outraged 
to learn that, in addition to doing nothing in this regard, the 
government has actually exerted pressure on the City of Montreal 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1816"> 1816 </A></B>
<P>
to halt the construction of a monument to the memory of  peoples 
martyred in modern times, particularly the Armenians.
<P>
	According to representatives of the Armenian national 
committee, the mayor of Montreal admitted that the Minister for 
International Cooperation, and member for 
Papineau-Saint-Michel, had intervened to stop the plan to build a 
monument commemorating the Armenian genocide. Despite the 
minister's denials, the mayor of Montreal stood by what he said. 
The mayor of Montreal has always stood by what he says.
<P>
	Already in 1990, the Turkish ambassador wrote to Mayor Doré 
requesting that another monument not refer to the Armenian 
genocide. These dubious actions make us wonder if the present 
Canadian government has an official policy of putting a price tag 
on its principles. They are a reminder of other events in which the 
Canadian government intervened in an equally deplorable manner.
<P>
	In 1988, under another government, a senior official of the 
Department of External Affairs wrote to the Ottawa school board to 
object to the mention of the Armenian genocide in school 
textbooks. This official then explained to the media that the 
Canadian government had taken the action so as not to jeopardize 
millions of dollars in commercial contracts with Turkey.
<P>
	When a Canadian monument to human rights was erected in 
1991, undue pressure was apparently brought to bear by foreign 
governments, leading to the suppression of two plaques referring to 
the Armenian genocide and the massacre in Tiananmen Square.
<P>
	In fact, since coming to power, this government, like the one 
before it, has adopted the despicable habit of subordinating the 
respect of human rights to political and economic interests. Over 
the years, Canada has acquired an excellent reputation the world 
over, not just for its respect of human rights within its own borders, 
but also for its involvement internationally in the promotion of 
human rights and the values of tolerance and peace, ideals held by 
all citizens of this country whatever their political stripe. 
Unfortunately, the recent events in Somalia have tarnished our 
reputation.
<P>
<B>(1130)</B>
<P>
	Our government too has recently changed its foreign policy. In 
the future, in order to ensure the media success of the Prime 
Minister's tours abroad, any public challenge of these countries' 
human rights record must be avoided.
<P>
	The episode of an embarrassed Prime Minister, as 13 year old 
Craig Kielburger travelled to India to denounce forced child labour 
in his presence, is most revealing. I remember also the red carpet 
and honour guard treatment for Rumanian dictator Ceausescu 
under the Conservative government, which wanted to sell him a 
nuclear reactor. A few months later, after Ceausescu's overthrow 
and execution, the Prime Minister of the day  rejoiced at the fall of 
this blood-thirsty tyrant. In the case of Turkey, sales of both a 
nuclear reactor and weapons are involved. There is spinelessness, 
whether Conservatives or Liberals are in power.
<P>
	This type of behaviour, in which injustices are denounced only 
when it is worthwhile for publicity or political gain, is contrary to 
traditional Canadian values. Canadians want this government to 
have principles and to stand up for them at all times. That does not 
mean that all trade with certain countries must be cut off if we do 
not approve of their human rights record, but we must make it very 
clear to them that trading with them does not indicate approval, that 
it will not stop us from criticizing them if they commit 
reprehensible acts.
<P>
	Canadians do not expect complacency from their government; 
they expect it to denounce injustices throughout the world. I will 
offer a few examples of flagrant human rights violations which our 
government prefers to ignore.
<P>
	After the Gulf War against Iraq, Canada took part in operation 
``Provide Comfort'', aimed at protecting the Kurd populations in 
northern Iraq against bloody attacks by Sadam Hussein's 
government forces. On the other side of the border at the same 
time, only a few kilometres away, the Turkish government was 
arresting and executing hundreds of Kurds rebelling against its 
authority. But, because the government of Turkey is our ally, we 
closed our eyes. How could there be good Kurds who merited our 
protection, and bad Kurds whose fate we did not care about?
<P>
	During Team Canada's trip to China, and when Chinese officials 
visited our country, the government remained totally silent in the 
face of the repression against pro-democracy Chinese since the 
Tiananmen square massacre. Nor has a word been said about the 
methodical process of assimilating the Tibetan people. Recently, 
the hon. members for Longueuil and Notre-Dame-de-Grâce have 
spoken out against the torture and summary executions in East 
Timor, which is under military occupation by Indonesia.
<P>
	Finally, the hundreds of casualties in recent months in Burundi, 
victims of the clashes between Hutu and Tutsi, make us fear a 
repeat of the genocide that occurred in neighbouring Rwanda. 
Although the term ``genocide'' frightens the Canadian government 
so, it did use it in reference to Rwanda. Will it allow another 
tragedy to happen when there is still time for something to be 
done?
<P>
	In order to show our respect for all the victims of the past and to 
reaffirm our determination to use all our energy to prevent new 
massacres, I ask the government to officially recognize the 
Armenian genocide as a historical fact.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1817"> 1817 </A></B>
<P>
	Canada is far from being a leader on this issue. Actually, it is 
behind the times, because many foreign governments and 
parliaments have already recognized and condemned the 
Armenian genocide.
<P>
	The Permanent People's Tribunal declared, on April 16, 1984: 
``The Armenian genocide is an imprescriptible crime against 
humanity and an international crime for which the Turkish state 
must take responsibility''.
<P>
	On August 20, 1985, the United Nations Commission on Human 
Rights recognized the Armenian massacre by the Ottoman Empire 
as one of the genocides of the 20th century.
<P>
	The parliament of the Argentina and the national assembly of 
Uruguay also recognized it. On June 18, 1987, the European 
Parliament recognized the historical fact of the Armenian genocide 
and added that the refusal of the Turkish state to recognize the 
genocide was an obstacle to Turkey's joining the European 
Community.
<P>
	On April 22, 1994, the Douma, or Russian parliament, 
recognized the Armenian genocide and severely condemned its 
authors. On April 27, 1994, the Israeli government officially 
condemned the Armenian genocide despite the fact that Turkey is 
Israel's ally in the region. The secretary of state for foreign affairs 
declared:
<P>
<B>(1135)</B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
``We will reject any attempt to erase its record even for some 
political advantage.''
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	This was an act of courage on the part of the Israeli government.
<P>
	In May of last year, Bob Dole, the leader of the Republican 
majority in the Senate of the United States and a Republican 
candidate in the presidential elections condemned Turkey for 
persisting in its refusal to recognize the Armenian genocide. He 
declared:
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
``I recently with many of my colleagues called on the president, 
Mr. Clinton, to reaffirm the Armenian genocide as a crime against 
humanity as he did many times in the 1992 presidential 
campaign.''
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Finally, I want to point out that, as early as 1980, the Quebec 
national assembly and the Ontario legislature, which together 
represent 60 per cent of the Canadian population, both officially 
recognized the Armenian genocide and asked the Parliament of
<P>
Canada to also do so on behalf of all Canadians. I hope that this 
clear message will finally be heard by the federal government.
<P>
	In 1994, when he was premier, the ally of the federal government 
and leader of the Liberal Party of Quebec,  Mr. Daniel Johnson, 
stated: ``The anniversary of the Armenian genocide reminds us of 
one of the most tragic moments in the history of our century and 
moves us to express our deep sympathy for this people''. We are 
not going to water down the proposal by trying to replace the term 
genocide.
<P>
	The German government, which long ago acknowledged its 
moral responsibility in the Jewish genocide by the Nazi regime and 
has offered reparation, must be given credit. The German Criminal 
Code even provides for sanctions against people who try to deny 
this historical fact. More recently, the Russian government 
courageously acknowledged its responsibility in the execution in 
1940 of 4,500 Polish officers in the Katyn forest. Turkey has 
historical responsibilities and must bear them.
<P>
	On several different occasions, a number of members of this 
House have spoken about the Armenian genocide. It is now time to 
act. I ask all members to convince their colleagues to vote in favour 
of this motion and to take advantage of the 81st anniversary of the 
Armenian genocide to take a courageous stand on behalf of our 
fellow men and women who face difficult circumstances in 
countries where democracy has not yet prevailed.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> I would inform the House that because of 
the ministerial statement, Government Orders will be extended by 
72 minutes.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Sarkis Assadourian (Don Valley North, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I have followed very carefully the comments made by the 
hon. member for Ahuntsic. I want to take this opportunity to thank 
him for his presentation but also I want to remind him that the way 
he went about doing this was quite upsetting to me. However, that 
is said and done, it has passed and I want to go forward to the 
future.
<P>
	The hon. member made a comment in his statement that the 
mayor of Montreal promised to erect a statue to commemorate the 
genocide of the Armenians in 1915. Then he went on to blame the 
federal government for intervening in this matter.
<P>
	I want the record to show clearly that neither federal government 
in any way, shape or form nor the Department of Foreign Affairs 
were involved in the promise made by the mayor of Montreal. I 
want him to correct that statement please because that is not the 
case. The Government of Canada does not get involved in the 
erection or the removal of monuments.
<P>
	I was previously involved with the Vietnamese monument here 
in the city of Ottawa. The Government of Canada took the same 
position when the Vietnam monument was erected. That is the 
same position the government has taken in the case of the 
monument in Montreal which was promised, reneged on and not 
delivered by the mayor of Montreal.
<P>

<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Daviault:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the member for his 
comments. I want to point out that <I>The Gazette</I> reported comments 
attributed to members of the national Armenian committee 
concerning the monument to be erected in Montreal to 
commemorate the genocide. The comments of the mayor of 
Montreal were also reported, and the mayor did not deny them. But 
these comments were denied-
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Bakopanos:</B> The mayor's comments or the minister's 
comments?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Daviault:</B> The mayor's comments were denied by the 
minister. No, the mayor did not confirm the minister's comments.
<P>
<B>(1140)</B>
<P>
	The Minister of International Cooperation and of the mayor of 
Montreal disagree on what happened. When I asked a question in 
this House, the member for Saint-Léonard told me that the minister 
had only restated the way the Canadian government dealt was 
handling this issue. It is already quite something to repeat that the 
Government of Canada prefers not to use the word genocide, that it 
wants to use the words atrocities and tragedy, but not the word 
genocide. This word was used for the genocide in Rwanda, but the 
government still does not want to use it concerning Armenia.
<P>
	Today, you will have a chance to vote on the motion, on the term 
genocide. If you want to take on the unenviable task of changing 
the motion by deleting the term genocide, you will be showing your 
true colours. Then, Armenians and Canadians will know where you 
stand on this issue.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Eleni Bakopanos (Saint-Denis, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I want 
to congratulate the opposition member on introducing this motion 
in the House. I would point out, as did my colleague, that it was the 
member for Don Valley North who initially introduced this motion 
in the House of Commons.
<P>
	Secondly, I would perhaps echo my colleague's question and 
comments. It is all very well to read the comments by the mayor of 
Montreal in the papers, but there is no evidence. I would like the 
hon. opposition member to provide written or verbal proof that the 
minister or a representative of the Canadian government said we 
were opposed to a monument being erected.
<P>
	There is no proof, it was only the mayor's word. It is the mayor 
of Montreal, Mr. Bourque, who is responsible for this matter. He 
must assume his responsibilities and keep his word to the 
Armenian community and to others, because the monument is not 
just for the Armenian genocide, but for all crimes against 
humanity. We were 100 per cent in favour of the idea, and there is 
no evidence to the contrary. I would prefer people did not  invent 
stories and did not attribute remarks to someone, if they are not 
what the person said in this House.
<P>
	I would also like to ask the opposition member what led him to 
raise this motion in the House at this specific point in time.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Daviault:</B> Mr. Speaker, as far as the first part, with respect 
to the monument, is concerned, the Government of Canada has no 
business getting involved in this matter. I recalled the remarks 
attributed to the mayor of Montreal. I recalled the denials by the 
minister and I recalled the fact that the mayor of Montreal did not 
confirm the minister's denials. Enough has been said about this 
responsibility.
<P>
	I agree with you that the monument must be erected and that it is 
the responsibility of the mayor of Montreal. However, when the 
example of inaction on the matter of the Armenian genocide comes 
from as high up as our government-either Conservative or 
Liberal-which refuses to recognize the genocide, we can hardly 
criticize others for lack of courage when we ourselves lack such 
courage.
<P>
	Last year, the member for Don Valley North acted very 
positively in making his proposal. However, as I said in my speech, 
he had asked for unanimous consent for a vote and this was denied 
by a parliamentary secretary. As parliamentarians, we know what 
this means. It means that the motion is dead.
<P>
<B>(1145)</B>
<P>
	This year, using an opposition day, one of our exceedingly rare 
opposition days where a vote may be taken, we are forcing a vote 
on this issue and on the method, because today or tomorrow there 
will be 3,000 or 4,000 Armenians on the Hill, who will judge our 
actions as parliamentarians today. Let us act courageously.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Hedy Fry (Secretary of State (Multiculturalism) (Status 
of Women), Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise today to thank the member 
for Ahuntsic for tabling this motion in the House.
<P>
	The points raised by the motion deal with universal rights, 
equality, and the fight for freedom the underprivileged peoples of 
the world have been waging since the dawn of civilization.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	I support the principles in the hon. member's motion. In fact I 
applaud them. It is for this reason that I would like to propose an 
amendment to the motion. I move:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That the motion be amended (1) by deleting the word ``genocide'' and 
substituting therefor the words ``tragedy which claimed some 1.5 million 
lives'', and (2) by inserting immediately after ``1915'' the words ``and in 
recognition of other crimes against humanity''; and (3) by deleting all of the 
words after the words ``as the week'' and by substituting the words ``of 
remembrance of the inhumanity of people toward one another''.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1819"> 1819 </A></B>
<P>
	I would like to see the scope of the motion broadened to cover 
all peoples who have suffered in their quest for justice and 
freedom.
<P>
	Therefore I would like to see us acknowledge a tragic systemic 
massacre and degradation of the Armenian people which began in 
1915 under the Ottoman empire and recognize the day April 24 as a 
day to mourn for those who suffered. Yet on April 15 we also mark 
the holocaust as a day to remember with sorrow the slaughter of 
millions of Jews and on April 27 we celebrate the death of 
apartheid, the triumph of freedom over the decades of legislated 
racism, bigotry and murder of black South Africans.
<P>
	This amendment seeks to remember all of these peoples and 
more. It proposes to set a week to mourn man's inhumanity to man, 
all the women who for millennia have been raped in the name of 
power, all the children who have been orphaned in the struggle for 
freedom, all those who have been humiliated, degraded, 
imprisoned, killed because of their religion, the colour of their skin 
or their sexual orientation.
<P>
	To narrow this motion to recognize the plight of one people is 
laudable in its intent but it misses the opportunity to make a 
statement on behalf of those who do not have a special day of 
remembrance but who have suffered similar injustices over the 
history of humankind.
<P>
	The shameful history of man's inhumanity has never been 
selective, nor has brutality ever been focused in one place, one 
community or one people. The tragedies such as we mourn on April 
15, 24 and 27 may have been brought on by discrimination, bigotry 
and the misuse of power but it has not been limited to a particular 
race, religion or ethnic group. The brutal murder and incarceration 
of women, men and children simply because they wished to 
worship their own god or walk side by side in equality and justice 
with other members of the human race in kinship and respect is a 
tragedy the entire human family must bear with shame.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The motion moved by the honourable member for Ahuntsic 
reflects the fundamental values of the people of Canada. As a 
people we have opened our arms and our country to victims of pain, 
tyranny and injustice.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	We are recognized the world over as a people who not only 
believe in peace, justice and respect but we practise it. We have 
legislated it. Our multiculturalism policy has ensured that all of the 
diverse people who make up our nation must live in respect of each 
other's culture, religion, race or ethnicity. We seek not to assimilate 
others but to allow for the ultimate freedom of the individual to 
pursue what makes him or her unique and special.
<P>
	We believe that all Canadians can be one people united under 
one flag and one nation and yet celebrate and respect the diversity 
of our geography and our people. Multiculturalism is part of 
making sure we are sensitive to the pain of those Canadians who 
may at one time have been victimized by the inhumanity of war or 
by bigotry and oppression. Multiculturalism promotes healing and 
fosters a cohesion of people.
<P>
<B>(1150)</B>
<P>
	By and large we are a country of immigrants and refugees within 
an aboriginal country. We have come together from each corner of 
the world to build a society, recognized not for a particular 
language or a specific skin colour but by the values that bind us 
together, values of justice, equality, respect and peaceful resolution 
to conflict.
<P>
	We are a unique nation. We are the global nation and we wear the 
title with pride. We stand as a role model to the world of a nation 
where all people can find peace, order and good government, can 
co-exist in harmony with intercultural understanding and sharing, 
with respect for differences.
<P>
	Here in Canada this motion will strengthen the way we hope to 
build a nation. It will send a message to other nations and people 
who struggle under the yoke of oppression that in Canada there is a 
policy of respect, that here they can be free to worship their god 
and walk down the street equal to other Canadians, equal under the 
eyes of the law, free from fear of discrimination as enshrined in our 
Constitution, free to dress in the manner of their choice, free to 
participate in the benefits of this society fully, and to accept and 
fulfil the responsibilities of a Canadian citizen in equality.
<P>
	If we are to change our world, if we are to hope that one day 
humankind can live together in peace and respect, we must always 
be mindful of the cruelty of tyranny, of the massacres of peoples, of 
the incarceration, degradation and inhumanity that man has 
wrought on each other in the name of power, intolerance and 
religion.
<P>
	This motion would enshrine the week of April 20 to April 27 as a 
week to remember, to mourn and to celebrate the martyrs who have 
gone before in history, like the Armenians we remember today, so 
that the pursuit of freedom and justice will remain clear in our 
hearts and in our legislation, so that we may remain on guard 
wherever human rights are in jeopardy, as we have done whenever 
we have traded. We have taken the opportunity to speak to leaders 
of regimes that do not hold the same human rights values which we 
hold dear. We have a reputation as peacekeepers around the world.
<P>
	We will learn from the lessons of the past. It is fitting this motion 
is placed before the House of Commons of the Canadian 
Parliament. As Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali said to 
our Prime Minister at the United  Nations 50th anniversary, the 
world has always looked to Canada with hope, as a people who 
have lived together in diversity with respect, as a people who have 
sought peaceful resolution to conflict.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1820"> 1820 </A></B>
<P>
	Let us not disappoint them. Let us remain true to the mandate of 
our unique policy of multiculturalism which seeks to strengthen a 
cohesive, respectful, inclusive and democratic society and a shared 
sense of identity reflective of the diversity of Canadian people.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The amendment is being studied and it 
has not been ruled as being receivable. As soon as possible, the 
Chair will make a ruling on that matter.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Réal Ménard (Hochelaga-Maisonneuve, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I want to thank our colleague for the sensitivity she has 
always displayed concerning the issues of racism and social justice. 
However, I want to make sure I understand the true meaning of the 
message she has delivered this morning.
<P>
	She shares the concerns of members as a whole regarding the use 
of violence which has become too widespread throughout this 
century. I want to make sure that she believes, as I do, that 
violence, whatever its form, is unacceptable.
<P>
	However, there is in Canadian policy a certain amount of 
inconsistency I have trouble understanding; my colleague will 
perhaps take the time to clarify this for me. The Canadian 
government has committed $500,000 to set up a human rights 
tribunal to investigate war crimes and wrongdoings in the former 
Yugoslavia. This international tribunal will be made up of nine 
judges, including one Canadian.
<P>
	We followed very closely the statements made by the Canadian 
government on Rwanda. In both cases, the Canadian government 
had no qualms about talking of genocide. The reason being that, 
when it comes to words, there is a scale of sorts to describe things.
<P>
<B>(1155)</B>
<P>
	My colleague will agree that genocide is violence at its worst. 
Why is it that the Canadian government does not hesitate to talk 
about genocide regarding events in Rwanda? Why is it that it has 
no qualms about freeing $500,000 in the case of the former 
Yugoslavia? Why is it reluctant to describe for what they were the 
events which occurred in Armenia in 1915 and had the hallmark of 
a genocide, and to call a spade a spade?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Ms. Fry:</B> Mr. Speaker, the hon. member has said very clearly 
that Canada has given aid and brought its own particular principles 
to areas like Rwanda, Bosnia and other parts of the world where 
there has been inhumanity to man.
<P>
	We are supportive of the hon. member's motion. We are just 
changing the words to express the tragedy of the 1.5 million people 
who were killed. We are also widening the scope of the motion to 
make the week one of remembrance for all people, such as April 15 
to commemorate the holocaust and April 27 for the death of 
apartheid. We are just trying to widen the scope of the motion so 
that it will be a commemorative week for all people who have 
suffered over the years.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Silye (Calgary Centre, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, why in her 
amendment to the main motion does the hon. member recommend 
the deletion of the word genocide?
<P>
	<B>Ms. Fry:</B> Mr. Speaker, we are recommending substituting for the 
word ``genocide'' the words ``tragedy which claimed some 1.5 
million lives''. Genocide is a specific term. We do not feel we can 
use that term at this time. We are mentioning the deaths of 1.5 
million people. We are supporting the motion, but we are 
broadening the scope of it.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bob Mills (Red Deer, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, what we have 
heard is part of the problem we have in the House where there is a 
play on words and we do not say what we mean. On a number of 
occasions I have had cause to lament that sort of thing and be upset 
by it. Obviously, we are all opposed to genocide and the planned 
killing of people by their own governments or by other 
governments. We must make a clear statement to all humanity.
<P>
	It is with pleasure that I speak to the motion which condemns 
genocide as an instrument of national policy. While there are few 
problems with the wording of the proposed amendment, I am going 
to suggest at least one subamendment at the end of my 
presentation.
<P>
	As the foreign affairs critic for the Reform Party, I am pleased to 
say that I will be supporting the motion with the amendments. It is 
important that we clearly let the world know what we think of these 
acts.
<P>
	When we received the motion yesterday, it was difficult to 
decide how to approach it. In many respects it is a motherhood 
issue. We are all opposed to genocide. This morning I intend to try 
and develop my and my party's approach to the subject and try to 
put a little more humanity and understanding into it.
<P>
	Genocide strikes at the very root of humanity. It is the sort of 
thing that causes us to shudder no matter where in the world it takes 
place. When a government or a group attempts to obliterate a 
people through violent means to achieve their own selfish political 
goals, all humanity is diminished and suffers because of it.
<P>
<B>(1200 )</B>
<P>
	Those who have committed genocide often attempt to blame the 
victims or deny reality, but the truth must be remembered. To 
honour the memory of the victims we must remind our children of 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1821"> 1821 </A></B>
<P>
what happened. We must  not let these memories die. Hopefully 
they will prevent future atrocities.
<P>
	It is a cliche, but a true one when we say those who do not learn 
from history are doomed to repeat it. This truth has haunted us in 
the House of Commons over the past couple of years as we have 
watched in horror as hundreds of thousands of people, if not 
millions, have been slaughtered in places like Rwanda and the 
former Yugoslavia.
<P>
	The saddest thing about these recent genocides is that historians 
100 years from now will probably see them as only two of a long 
series of genocides stretching throughout the century. The ultimate 
horror is that there have been so many mass slaughters this century 
it is tough to keep track of them. The future does not bode well for 
stopping them, even though we say this must be the last.
<P>
	There is the Armenian genocide that this motion speaks to. We 
have the Jewish Holocaust. We have Stalin's purges. We have the 
Chinese situation in Nanking. We have mass murder in East Timor, 
the disappearance in Central and South America of many people, 
tribal slaughter in Burundi, government sponsored famine in 
Ethiopia, and the list goes on and on. As I said at the beginning, it 
touches all of us as human beings living on this planet.
<P>
	Each one of these represents a human disaster of epic 
proportions, but all have been reduced to historical footnotes 
because there are so many. That is why I believe the House should 
vote in favour of the motion, which serves to remind us and helps 
us to keep a vigilance; a vigilance that we cannot forget history.
<P>
	The motion does not cost anything, but it is a powerful show that 
the House is not indifferent to genocide. It shows that members in 
this place prefer to speak out rather than perpetually sit in an 
uncomfortable silence waiting for the next disaster.
<P>
	A few members today have presentations which will deal 
specifically with the genocide of the Armenians during the early 
years of this century. I would like to support those members but I 
must tell them I do not know a lot about Armenian history and I 
will leave it to my colleagues to talk about it in their presentations. 
I will deal with several other issues that relate to genocide with 
which I am more familiar.
<P>
	Obviously we could go back to World War II and the Jewish 
Holocaust. It is amazing that some people deny this happened. 
Obviously it did happen. It should have been a valuable lesson in 
history, but unfortunately it was not. The Jews in Europe had 
suffered for centuries from prejudices and intolerance, but the rise 
of Hitler brought the hatred of Jews to a whole new level.
<P>
	Under the Nazis the Jews became the scapegoat for all the ills of 
society. Hatred became a unifying force and the Jews were 
systematically dehumanised by Nazi  propaganda to such a degree 
that their mass murder went from being an outrageous idea to the 
final solution to Germany's problems.
<P>
	The use of propaganda and the media to dehumanise and 
discredit people who were subsequently massacred is unfortunately 
a tradition that has stood the test of time. Therefore this is the first 
lesson we must learn. We might call it the CNN factor. The use of 
television, the use of communication today is an important part of 
ploys used by many terrorist groups. Last week we had an example 
of that. We must be conscious of it. We must remember the media 
can be used to promote hate and that it must be monitored in 
Canada and throughout the world.
<P>
<B>(1205 )</B>
<P>
	We must have set standards in the international community so 
that we see both sides of the story, not simply the side the CNN 
reporter wants us to see. We must not let the media be manipulated 
by various powers. I am sure some terrorist groups have a training 
program which involves the use of the media. We must be 
conscious of that and vigilant that we get both sides.
<P>
	Another lesson we learned from the Jewish Holocaust is the 
indifference of the international community. As Europe's Jews 
desperately tried to escape they found many countries would not 
accept them. Not only that, the international community appeased 
Germany and continually caved in to its increasingly outrageous 
policies. This gave the perception of silent approval of Germany's 
actions, a perception that proved fatal to over six million Jews.
<P>
	Clearly the international community can never again sit by in 
stunned silence while such outrages occur. We must be vigilant, 
speak out and take firm action when the need arises.
<P>
	I will now talk about a couple of recent examples of genocide. I 
will start with the former Yugoslavia and then I will talk a bit about 
Rwanda and conclude with an overall approach to genocide itself.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> I wonder if the hon. member would 
permit a very brief interruption. The member has indicated he 
wishes to make a subamendment. It would probably be of 
assistance if he knew what the Chair has ruled on the previous 
amendment. With his permission I would like to give that ruling 
now.
<P>
	The amendment proposed by the secretary of state is an 
acceptable amendment. Accordingly, when the member for Red 
Deer wishes to make a subamendment he may wish to keep in mind 
the amendment was accepted by the Chair.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mills (Red Deer):</B> Mr. Speaker, that does clarify what I will 
be doing at the end of my presentation.
<P>
	I will use a couple of examples. I will use recent ones familiar to 
the House. Those still speak to the motion of the Armenian 
question.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1822"> 1822 </A></B>
<P>
	When we look at the former Yugoslavia, I know members do 
not need a history lesson on some of the problems. However, there 
are a few facts we need to outline as to exactly what happened.
<P>
	It is fair to say, hopefully in an unbiased evaluation of the 
situation, that there is no side right or wrong. There are lots of 
wrongs but it is a matter of not being able to pick the good guy 
from the bad guy. That is a big problem in today's post-cold war 
situation in which we find ourselves.
<P>
	It is often easier for people of the world community to sit idle 
while these wrongs are occurring. I have mentioned that the media 
plays a major role in promoting and sometimes in formulating 
ideas within our community which are incorrect.
<P>
	We must also recognize in the former Yugoslavia that this is a 
civil war. It is not like the gulf war. Civil wars are different from 
where we have an aggressor attacking another country. In looking 
at the facts we must always recognize that. We must look at the 
external forces which come into play when such acts of genocide 
occur. We must also always understand history and look back 
however far we have to to understand the nature of the problem.
<P>
	If we look at the former Yugoslavian problem we need to go back 
at least 1300 years and even back to Greek and Roman times.
<P>
<B>(1210 )</B>
<P>
	We can go through the 6th century and the Slavic tribes as they 
worked through that area. We can look at the effect of Rome and 
Constantinople, the Catholic and Orthodox church in the 10th 
century. We can go through the Islamic expansion of the 14th 
century. Very clearly we start to see the effects of not only the 
people but of external forces coming into play.
<P>
	We have to also recognize the way governments rule. The 
Muslim rule of the 15th century was pretty grim stuff. The Turkish 
empire and the way it handled things was a pretty rugged way of 
running a government by our standards.
<P>
	As we move to more modern times we see the influence of the 
Treaty of Berlin of 1878. We look at the alliances that occurred up 
to the end of the first world war. Then we look at what happened 
during the mid-war period and then on to the second world war and 
the alliances there. In Hitler's alliances with Croatia, 400,000 
Serbians living in Croatia were massacred because of outside 
forces. They were massacred for all kinds of reasons.
<P>
	Then we come to Tito's time. Tito ruled Yugoslavia with an iron 
hand from 1945 until 1980 when he died. There are six republics 
and we must understand the history of those republics and why they 
lived in so-called peace.
<P>
	From there in 1991 when the Croats and Slovenians declared 
independence, I guess not unlike Quebec's declaring independence 
from Canada, we can see the terrific pull that would have on the 
people of that country.
<P>
	The point is that no matter what history tells us and no matter 
what politics tells us, genocide is not acceptable under any 
conditions. Countries and the peoples of the world must find a way 
to deal with their problems, but not to those kinds of extremes. That 
has to come loud and clear from countries like ours. It has to come 
loud and clear from the UN. The UN desperately needs to be 
modernized and become efficient so it can respond to these issues.
<P>
	If there is one thing we can blame ourselves and the world 
community for it is the inability, the lack of desire, or whatever the 
reason, to modernize a 50-year old organization that can today not 
deal with its problems because it is top heavy, bureaucratic, under 
funded, inefficient, and so on. We must deal with that problem. 
That is our problem. It will lead to future genocide in other 
countries if we do not have a UN that can respond effectively, 
efficiently and quickly. We are all concerned and desire that. We 
have to have a plan. We have to do something about it. We as 
parliamentarians must demand that we take that leadership role as 
Canadians.
<P>
	I move on to Rwanda. I know members across have heard my 
speech on Rwanda before. I do not intend to repeat all of that but I 
do think it demonstrates something that was very graphic to 
everyone. The genocide that occurred in Rwanda was unbelievable. 
It is certainly in all of our minds. We saw it because of CNN.
<P>
	In 1985 I was on an Air France 747 with 20 people. We landed in 
Kigali, the capital of Rwanda. My wife and I got off the plane. The 
rest said ``good luck''. I did not really know what they were talking 
about, but it seemed like we had landed in the jungle, and the plane 
left. Then we had armed guards around us and we went through the 
immigration procedure and had all of our medical certificates and 
documents in order.
<P>
<B>(1215 )</B>
<P>
	As we moved away from the airport we moved into gorgeous 
countryside that is very similar to what we might see in Belgium.
<P>
	As I only have two minutes left I would like to move a 
subamendment. I move:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That the amendment be amended by inserting after the word ``tragedy'' the 
following: ``of genocide.''</BLOCKQUOTE>
	It would then read the ``tragedy of genocide.''
<P>
	As we went through that countryside we saw the markets. We 
spent close to a month in that country. We were out in the villages, 
we were travelling with a local Rwandan gentleman who 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1823"> 1823 </A></B>
<P>
introduced us to his parents and his relatives. In the markets we saw 
the salt and the  utensils. We saw the barter system. Some people 
walked 20 and 30 miles to get to the market.
<P>
	We went to the tea plantations developed by China. We saw the 
hotels and some of the infrastructure that the Belgians and the 
French had built. As we got more and more involved in that country 
we saw some warnings. The NGOs told us there was unrest. The 
church said there was unrest. The French troops said there was 
unrest. The United Nations said there was unrest.
<P>
	I cannot help now thinking, was that what it was like in the 
period from 1930 when the people knew that something was wrong 
in Germany?
<P>
	Obviously genocide is something about which we must all 
speak. It must be done through the UN, through this Parliament. It 
is a motherhood topic for all of us.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Ringuette-Maltais):</B> The Chair 
would like to advise that the subamendment submitted by the hon. 
member for Red Deer is receivable and accepted.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Daviault (Ahuntsic, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I would 
like to congratulate the member for his subamendment and his 
vigilance.
<P>
	As I expected, the government changed the word ``genocide'' to 
the word `tragedy''. It is not acceptable to us. It is not acceptable to 
the purpose of the motion.
<P>
	I thank the hon. member but I noticed he was perhaps missing a 
couple of minutes. Maybe he could expand on his speech and talk 
to us a bit more about human rights.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mills (Red Deer):</B> Madam Speaker, I had planned to close 
with the questions that I believe we as part of the international 
community must ask, particularly as they relate to Rwanda and the 
former Yugoslavia. I am sure many years ago they could have 
applied to Germany or Armenia.
<P>
	How much intervention would it take to stop what happened? 
That question has to be asked. In the case of Rwanda, very little. In 
the former Yugoslavia, probably a lot more. We are probably 
seeing that now with IFOR.
<P>
<B>(1220 )</B>
<P>
	Second, who should have been responsible? Who is responsible? 
Are we all responsible? I put forward that we are all responsible for 
this, that this issue goes far beyond partisan politics, and we are 
responsible as the world community.
<P>
	Third, will this happen again? Unfortunately I think the answer 
is yes. We must deal with this problem. I have suggested the UN is 
certainly an avenue.
<P>
	How much external pressure causes this sort of thing to happen? 
What if there had not been so much external pressure on these 
countries? I am most familiar with Rwanda. If there had not been 
the colonial influence of the Belgians and the French, then what? 
Maybe this is going back to something we cannot have any control  
over, but we must ask these questions and we must find answers to 
them for the future. We must look at our history, our past, to 
understand the future. That is so critical in this whole thing.
<P>
	I thank the member for the opportunity to complete my remarks.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Philippe Paré (Louis-Hébert, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I am 
glad I have the opportunity to participate in this debate on 
genocides, not only the Armenian one, but all those that took place 
in other countries and are still happening today.
<P>
	I was listening when the previous member said we should all be 
concerned. I think he is perfectly right. This is a question of human 
rights and everybody should be concerned.
<P>
	As critic for the Bloc Quebecois, I was particularly pleased to 
hear that the Leader of the Opposition chose to give the first speech 
on that motion. I feel it is important for a party leader to state his 
position and give his point of view on such an important issue.
<P>
	Last week, I participated with colleagues of all parties in a 
conference on official development assistance. Some 
representatives of non-governmental organizations said they were 
still hoping, after two and a half years of Liberal presence in the 
House, after two and a half years of Liberal government, for the 
first speech of the Prime Minister of Canada on the human rights 
issue. But the Prime Minister will not deliver any speech on human 
rights. He indicated that very clearly during the first tour of Team 
Canada in Asia.
<P>
	At that time, the Prime Minister said: ``I could give a 
headline-making speech on that issue, but I prefer to open markets 
and promote trade. The walls will eventually come down''. The 
problem is he did not say when. Will it take 50 years for the walls 
to come down?
<P>
	These words show clearly that this government does not consider 
human rights to be an important issue. However, if we want to deal 
with poverty in the world, we must consider sustainable 
development. And the notion of sustainable development 
encompasses greater issues like democratic development, the 
participation of populations in their own development, and human 
rights. We will get nowhere if we think we can help developing 
countries without taking into consideration sustainable 
development, human rights, democratic development and the 
importance that should be given to these concepts.
<P>
<B>(1225)</B>
<P>
	I am convinced that the tragedy suffered by Jews during the 
second world war has already been mentioned this morning. I am 
quite sure that Cambodia was also mentioned because hundreds of 
thousands, maybe millions, of Cambodians were killed by the 
Khmers Rouges.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1824"> 1824 </A></B>
<P>
	Maybe we did not talk enough about the Sudan, this forgotten 
African country which, for the last ten years, has suffered a savage 
war pitting the north against the south. So far, more than one 
million people have been eliminated. Yet, nobody talked about the 
Sudan.
<P>
	Of course we talked about the former Yugoslavia and the ethnic 
cleansing there. The hon. member who spoke before me talked 
about Rwanda and the massacres that took place in that country. 
Unfortunately, history repeats itself and we do not learn for past 
errors.
<P>
	After the last war, the heads of states assembled in San Francisco 
to create the United Nations said: ``No more wars''. I am sure they 
were sincere. However, war continues to be a dreadful scourge.
<P>
	There is a question related to genocides and human rights which, 
I think, is too easily ignored. It is the whole question of impunity. 
Why do we have genocides decade after decade? I think one of the 
reasons is that the international community has not found an 
effective way of dealing with people responsible for genocides.
<P>
	During the last three or four years we have seen the same thing 
happen in Haiti. We know that 3,000 or 4,000 people were killed. 
Yet, what happened to General Cédras? He got a pocketful of 
money and was told to go. The same happened with Duvalier, the 
previous dictator. For years, dictators inflicted torture on the 
Haitian people. But when the dictator is finally forced out of power, 
he does not suffer any consequences.
<P>
	In the former Yugoslavia, we see people responsible for ethnic 
cleansing parading in front of television cameras, and the 
international community seems unable to do anything.
<P>
	The saddest part of all is that it never stops. There are other hot 
spots and, regrettably, Canada maintains relations with countries 
where torture is allowed and practised. We think of China where 
human rights are systematically violated and freedom of speech is 
denied: political dissidents are muzzled, human rights advocates 
are attacked, and so on.
<P>
	We think of Nigeria where dissidents are eliminated. But we 
have to point something out here. Because Nigeria is not a very 
powerful nation, Canada might try to take economic sanctions 
against it. Will we do the same thing against China? Will we do the 
same thing against Indonesia? And against Vietnam? We practice 
double talk, and pay lip service to human rights.
<P>
	I received recently from the international co-operation minister a 
paper about the way CIDA intends to promote human rights. It 
says: ``Strengthening the civilian population's role and capacities 
in order to increase its participation in decision making. 
Reinforcing democratic institutions. Increasing the qualifications 
of public officials. Enhancing the capacities of organizations whose 
functions are to defend and promote human rights. Encouraging 
leaders to respect human rights more, to  govern democratically 
and to manage public affairs efficiently''.
<P>
	While speeches are being made, while fine statements are 
issued, the Canadian government, in its foreign policy, is going 
after one thing only: trade relations. Trade is more important than 
anything else.
<P>
	I want to bring up once again the sad case of Tran Trieu Quan, 
one of my constituents, who was actively involved in the main 
thrust of Canada's foreign policy. He tried to do business with 
Vietnam, and has been in prison for two years now. The Canadian 
government says it is unable to do anything. The Canadian 
government uses development assistance programs not to promote 
and defend human rights and to promote economic development, 
but to promote trade relations. So it is providing about $60 million 
over a few years in assistance to countries such as Vietnam, not to 
protect human rights, but in the hope that, in doing so, it will open 
doors to trade, while it could and should use development 
assistance budgets to promote and defend human rights all over the 
world.
<P>
<B>(1230)</B>
<P>
	It is extremely disappointing that in its foreign policy Canada 
has so easily given up on what made its glory. What has made the 
glory of Canada? Development assistance programs, peace 
missions and human rights defence. The government has simply 
given up.

	<B>Mr. Sarkis Assadourian (Don Valley North, Lib.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, earlier today the hon. member for Ahuntsic referred to a 
monument in Montreal as one the federal government intervened in 
and did not approve of.
<P>
	Maybe the member now has a chance to correct the situation and 
tell us if the premier of Quebec, the former leader of his party, will 
erect the monument and make sure of the right way of doing it to 
his colleague, the mayor of Montreal. Would he make that 
undertaking to the House today?
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paré:</B> Madam Speaker, it is funny to witness the 
consummate skills developed by the hon. members opposite. They 
have developed a kind of automatic reflex so that every time they 
are faced with a sensitive issue, on which their government refuses 
to take position, they ask why the Quebec government is not doing 
something.
<P>
	Are we not here in the House of Commons? Why should Quebec 
always take the lead? Is this House, this government, not able to 
show the way once in a while? But no, the same old reflex always 
takes over and they turn their attention to the Quebec government.
<P>
	In their eyes, the Quebec government's lack of involvement in a 
sensitive matter justifies their own government's inaction. This is a 
disgrace.

<P>
	<B>Mr. Assadourian:</B> Madam Speaker, I would like to give the hon. 
member a chance to correct the situation and put his money where 
his mouth is. I regret to say that on that side of the House talk is 
cheap.
<P>
	A few years ago the province of Quebec passed a resolution 
about genocide, condemning it. The premier of Quebec a few 
months ago was to erect the monument in Quebec City or 
Montreal, wherever it may be in the province of Quebec. They can 
have more more than one, not just in Montreal.
<P>
	Why does he not undertake to the House that he will be speaking 
to the premier of Quebec to make sure he erects the monument, on 
behalf of all Quebecers, in the province of Quebec so we can all 
take example from it? Maybe afterward we can put a monument in 
Ottawa for all Canadians.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paré:</B> Madam Speaker, after listening to the hon. member 
for Don Valley North, I assume he is about to move to Quebec so he 
can get elected and exert some influence on the Quebec 
government. That may be his only way to get involved.
<P>
	The Quebec government has already passed a resolution like the 
one we are trying to have passed in this House. The Quebec 
government has no lesson to receive, especially from the Liberal 
Party. What we are trying to find out today is if the Liberal Party, 
the Liberal government will agree to recognize history and to make 
a commitment without always trying to dodge the issue and have 
someone else become involved in its place. The ball is now in their 
court and I hope they will vote in favor of the motion.
<P>
<B>(1235)</B>
<P>
	I hope they will vote to recognize the Armenian tragedy.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Eleni Bakopanos (Saint-Denis, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, it 
almost brings tears to my eyes when I see how members of the 
opposition now defend the rights of an ethnic community in 
Quebec. It almost brings tears to my eyes because, in the recent 
referendum campaign, some of the leaders whom they support said 
that the referendum was lost because of ethnic groups and rich 
people in the province of Quebec.
<P>
	To this day, the former leader of the official opposition, Mr. 
Bouchard, has not disavowed that statement. I find it strange that 
opposition members have now become the great protectors of the 
Armenian community.
<P>
	If there is living proof here of a member of the Armenian 
community who looks after his community, it is definitely the hon. 
member for Don Valley North, who also tabled a resolution in this 
House to continue to protect the interests of that people.
<P>
	This government is the one protecting such interests. Moreover, 
it is strange that a party whose mandate it is to destroy our country 
would try to teach us lessons in human rights.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Madeleine Dalphond-Guiral (Laval Centre, BQ):</B> 
Madam Speaker, April 24 of this year will mark the 81st 
anniversary of the Armenian genocide that took place in 1915 
during the First World War. And what a sad anniversary it will be. 
This first genocide of the 20th century, which would unfortunately 
be followed by many others, is still today not recognized by the 
Canadian government. I rise, therefore, in support of this motion to 
recognize the week of April 20 to 27 as the week to commemorate 
man's inhumanity to man.
<P>
	I would also like to take this opportunity to pay homage to and to 
offer my profound sympathy to the Armenian people, especially 
the 1,540 families of the Armenian community in Laval, who 
found a welcome in Quebec, where they take part in and contribute 
to the development of Quebec society.
<P>
	The genocide of the Armenian people by the Turkish 
government began on April 24, 1915. That fateful day marked the 
beginning of this episode in history that ended with over a million 
people dead and thousands of others deported. It was the first of a 
series of genocides against peoples, for a people claiming the right 
to exist runs the risk of being massacred. As proof, we have the 
Holocaust during World War II, the recent massacres in Rwanda 
and Burundi, and obviously the situation in Bosnia, all examples 
showing the risk that those daring to claim status as a people still 
run in the 20th century.
<P>
	All these events are a reminder to us that governments all too 
often use force and violence to repress causes that they do not agree 
with.
<P>
	As I mentioned earlier, the genocide of the Armenian people 
culminated in the death of 1.5 million people and the deportation of 
over 500,000 others. Not only did the Turkish government almost 
totally take over Armenia's territory, but it also did not hesitate to 
destroy a number of religious and educational establishments. The 
very structures of the Armenian community were therefore 
destroyed. The rights of Armenians were completely denied, with 
the goal of eliminating a people that were considered hostile to 
Turkey.
<P>
	Memory is often dulled with the passage of time, but democracy 
must never allow the truth to be denied. This first genocide of the 
20th century was and still is a crime against humanity and 
civilization. Furthermore, in resolution No. 2391 adopted on 
November 26, 1968, the United Nations declared that genocide was 
a crime against humanity, and that there is no term of limitation for 
this crime, regardless of the time or place it was committed.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1826"> 1826 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1240)</B>
<P>
	At that time, of course, there was no UN, and so no country 
dared clearly denounce the Armenian genocide, no state demanded 
that Turkey own up to these odious actions.
<P>
	Today, within a Parliament that is internationally known for its 
respect of democracy and is quick to proclaim itself a defender of 
human rights, we have the opportunity to adopt a motion 
acknowledging the Armenian genocide and to call to mind other 
genocides throughout history. It is the duty of the international 
community and of Parliament to clearly condemn such actions, so 
as to put an end to violence between peoples.
<P>
	The international community unanimously denounced the Nazi 
regime of Adolf Hitler, in the aftermath of the Holocaust. The 
Nuremberg international war crimes tribunal passed judgment on 
those responsible for crimes against humanity and civilization.
<P>
	The Armenian genocide, however, remains unpunished, yet it is 
an undeniable historical fact. Some states, moreover, have 
acknowledged this genocide. For instance, on April 10 1980, the 
Quebec National Assembly unanimously adopted a resolution 
condemning the Armenian genocide. The legislative assembly of 
Ontario did the same, also in 1980.
<P>
	In the 16 years since 1980, close to two thirds of the Canadian 
population have clearly come to recognize the genocide against the 
Armenian people. What we are asking of the Government of 
Canada is that the truth be acknowledged today, no matter how 
cruel a truth it is.
<P>
	In its condemnation of the Armenian genocide in a resolution 
adopted in 1987, the European Parliament stated that ``the present 
Turkish government's refusal to acknowledge the genocide, along 
with other more recent violations of international law by this 
country, constitute impassable obstacles to any examination of the 
future membership of Turkey in the European community''.
<P>
	How can something that seems so clear to the European 
community not be equally clear to the Canadian government? What 
is this government waiting for, before it acknowledges and 
condemns the historical fact of the Armenian genocide?
<P>
	Today we are marking the 81st anniversary of that genocide. The 
passage of time is a poor excuse for refusing to take a stand and to 
condemn these actions. On the contrary; the acknowledgement of 
the genocide by the states of the international community offers 
proof that such actions are unacceptable and that no future 
genocides will occur without an outcry. Canada sees itself as a 
defender of democracy and human rights. It must condemn this 
genocide as it condemned the Holocaust.
<P>
	Finally, I must point out that on November 2, 1948, Canada 
signed the International convention on the  prevention and 
punishment of the crime of genocide, and this has been in effect 
since December 2, 1950. There is no statute of limitation for the 
crime of genocide, and it is not yet too late for the Canadian 
government to join with the other states that have denounced the 
Armenian genocide and to show consistency with its past positions, 
respecting this international convention of which it is a signatory.
<P>
	The promotion and protection of universally recognized human 
rights must be our principal motivation in the debate on this 
motion. Economic interests must not be allowed to dictate our 
actions when the respect of basic human rights is concerned. By 
passing this motion, the House will be showing its unwavering 
support of the respect of individual and collective rights.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Maurice Bernier (Mégantic-Compton-Stanstead, 
BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I would like to make a comment further to 
the remarks made by my colleague, but, particularly, I would like 
to ask her a question. I am going to speak in a few minutes on the 
same subject and I will have an opportunity to explain my 
viewpoint.
<P>
	I do in fact believe that the official opposition is playing its role 
properly in submitting to the House this type of motion, which, and 
I will explain this point further in a few minutes, affords us a look 
at the rather questionable side of government management in terms 
of its attitude toward international trade.
<P>
<B>(1245)</B>
<P>
	It is on this remark that I would like my colleague to expound her 
viewpoint. Now that international trade and international 
agreements have come into their own, should we promote trade to 
the detriment of human rights? I know her point of view, but I 
would like her to elaborate a bit on it.
<P>
	If this is not the case, how do we reconcile international trade 
and human rights?
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Dalphond-Guiral:</B> Madam Speaker, I thank my colleague 
for his question. It is a whole societal issue the member for 
Mégantic-Compton-Stanstead is raising. How do we choose 
between the economy, which is vital to our societies, and human 
rights, which every individual is entitled to enjoy.
<P>
	The choice requires consideration. There is one basic point: 
when a human being is not respected he loses his humanity bit by 
bit. It is true that work is important. It is true that people have to 
eat. It is true that people should have whatever they need. It is true 
among our societies and it is true in developing countries where 
human rights must fight an uphill battle.
<P>
	The question has to be asked: Which is more important? Is it 
more important to retain what sets human beings apart-their pride 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1827"> 1827 </A></B>
<P>
and their role in  society-or to destroy it little by little by giving 
them consumer goods and nothing more?
<P>
	I know it is not easy. I know it is easier in opposition to criticize, 
but I also know that difficult problems require shared solutions. I 
therefore ask the Canadian government to lend an attentive ear, 
open to suggestions from this side of the House. Just because it 
comes from here does not mean it is useless or empty.
<P>
	I think this is the discussion before us at the start of the third 
millennium and I sincerely believe Canada will have to be a leader 
in the area of human rights.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Sarkis Assadourian (Don Valley North, Lib.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, it is my great pleasure to join in the debate on this very 
important subject. I would like to again thank the hon. member for 
Ahuntsic for bringing this issue forward and to thank my 
colleagues on this side of the House who participated in the 
discussions. They will be participating again this afternoon.
<P>
	On March 20 I informed the House that I intended to present 
again the motion which I presented last year. The letter was dated 
March 20, 1996 but I have not received an official reply on the 
wording of the resolution.
<P>
	However, last year when I presented my motion, I consulted 
many members of Parliament, including the hon. member who 
presented the motion today. I was hoping that I would receive the 
same courtesy, that he would consult me and the communities 
involved so that we could have a non-partisan motion which could 
be supported by all parties. I am very disappointed that the hon. 
member played a cheap trick at the last moment at nine o'clock on 
Sunday night when he announced his intention to put this motion.
<P>
	Had I been informed a week earlier we would have participated 
and made a truly respectable motion of which everyone in Canada 
could be proud.
<P>
<B>(1250 )</B>
<P>
	I hope the House will do it again next year. All three parties can 
come together because this is a non-partisan issue. This is not an 
issue for the Bloc Quebecois, Reform, NDP or the Liberals. This is 
an issue that affects each and every human being in this land. I 
would venture to say it involves every human being on this globe.
<P>
	I wish to take a moment to read a letter from the Prime Minister 
addressed to the Canadian-Armenian community last weekend. It 
states:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>I am honoured to extend my greetings and sincere best wishes to the members 
of Canada's Armenian community as they mark the 81st anniversary of the 
Armenian tragedy in 1915.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The government and the people of Canada deplore the death of a great 
number of Armenians as a result of the war which brought about an end to the 
Ottoman Empire, and we extend our sympathy to the Armenian community.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Canada has been immeasurably enriched by many displaced Armenians who 
came to our shores, and by the contribution their descendants have made since. 
It is my profound hope that the memories of the past will serve to remind us all 
of the importance of tolerance and respect for diversity, and the historic 
attachment of these principles that has made Canada a beacon of hope for people 
the world over.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Please accept my best wishes on this solemn occasion.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	I would also like to share with the House part of the message sent 
by Senator Dole, the U.S. presidential candidate in the upcoming 
November election. The message is dated April 22 and reads as 
follows:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Though April 24 is the day singled out to mark this tragedy, during the 
Genocide of 1915 some 1.5 million Armenians were subjected to a systematic 
extermination through a policy of deportation, torture, starvation and massacre. 
I join with the Armenian-American community in mourning the dead and 
recalling the suffering and sacrifice of the victims.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	This issue is extremely important, especially to Canadians of 
Armenian origin. After all, they were one of the minorities that 
suffered in 1915 along with Kurds, Arabs, Greeks, Cypriots and 
many nationalities that were subjects of the Ottoman Empire at the 
time.
<P>
	Since then, as the expression goes, crime not condemned is 
crime encouraged. Since then many crimes took place starting with 
the holocaust, Cyprus, Burundi, Cambodia, South Africa, Rwanda. 
It is important that we designate a week to commemorate all these 
crimes against humanity.
<P>
	I am sure that each and every member of this House shares this 
concern. The question is how to do it so that it best for everybody. 
That is where the opposition lacks. As I said earlier, that was not a 
very nice thing to do because they made it as a partisan issue rather 
than a humanitarian, human rights issue.
<P>
	What should be done? Individual members of Parliament could 
write letters to the Turkish government's representative here in 
Ottawa or they could ask Turkey to recognize the genocide, over 
and above what other countries will be doing hopefully in the next 
few years, and saying that crimes of genocide do not pay. Turkey 
has to admit its mistakes, like Germany has done, and start 
negotiations with the republic of Armenia to solve this problem. If 
there is restitution to be paid, I am sure it will have to pay so it can 
address the issue that will help us to overcome the difficulties we 
are facing today.
<P>
	Speaking of Nazi crimes at Nuremberg, American Judge Robert 
Jackson said: ``These crimes'', referring to the holocaust, ``are 
unacceptable''. One of the reasons why he said they were 
unacceptable was not because of the number of victims but rather 
people came together to plot the extermination of a nation.
<P>
	That is exactly what happened in 1915. The cabinet made a 
decision to slaughter each and every Armenian living in that 
Ottoman Empire. The pretext was the first  world war. What a 
fantastic excuse. Everybody had an excuse during the war to kill 
and eliminate any minority. Armenian subjects were drafted into 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1828"> 1828 </A></B>
<P>
the army. They were sent forward to fight the allies and they were 
shot in the back.
<P>
<B>(1255)</B>
<P>
	On the other hand Armenians joined the allied forces. They were 
called little allies. They hoped that when they did their job with the 
allies to defeat the central powers, which they had, Armenia would 
become an independent country. Fortunately Armenia became 
independent in 1918 but Armenian independence was short lived 
because of international politics.
<P>
	At that time the western powers played politics with the 
fundamental issue of human rights. I come back again to my 
friends in opposition, do not play politics with these kinds of 
issues. It backfires on everybody and hurts everybody.
<P>
	I will be sharing my time with my colleague from Saint-Denis. 
In conclusion, I want to repeat what I said last time when I 
presented motion 282. When speaking of my visit to Der-zor I said 
the following:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Even today when one who goes there and puts his hand in the sand, one has to 
go down only six inches to pick up bones and the remains of human beings. The 
river running through Der-zor is a very historical scene to Canadians of 
Armenian origin and many other Armenians throughout the world because we 
saw pictures of bodies in that river in the same way we saw pictures of bodies 
floating last year in Rwanda. I saw that river, I walked in that river and I 
remember the past, 1915.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	I conclude my comments with the these words. Unless we learn 
from the past we are condemned to repeat it. I hope we are united in 
this House to condemn the past so we do not repeat the slaughter, 
discrimination and genocide.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Daviault (Ahuntsic, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I will 
leave aside any partisan consideration and remind the House of the 
good work done in the past by the member on behalf of his 
community; I would like to ask him a very simple question.
<P>
	I know that, irrespective of our own position, we have to toe the 
party line; however, he has always been a fervent advocate for his 
community.
<P>
	He mentioned on several occasions in his speech that 
stakeholders in other countries and other members have used the 
word genocide. The motion brought forward this morning 
specifically mentioned the word genocide to describe the 1915 
events. The government's amendment talks about tragedy, whereas 
the sub-amendment proposed by the Reform Party re-introduce the 
word genocide.
<P>
	I humbly ask the member whether the word genocide should be 
used in connection with the tragic events which occurred in 1915?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Assadourian:</B> Madam Speaker, as I mentioned in my 
speech, it would have been preferable if the hon. member had 
phoned me. I was not happy with the involvement on this issue 
especially.
<P>
	If he have phoned me we could have formulated a policy or draft 
that is acceptable to everyone. I regret he did not do that. That is 
why we are in the situation we are in now, not because of 
government policy but because of the way the Bloc Quebecois 
played the game and presented this motion. It would have been 
fantastic if the Bloc Quebecois members, the Reform Party 
members and us got together. That is something that would have 
been acceptable to everybody. That is what we want to do. That is 
what I did last year. That is what I intend to do with my motion this 
year. But I regret to say that was not the case.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Eleni Bakopanos (Saint-Denis, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
would like to start by congratulating the representatives of the 
Armenian community and all the Armenian Canadians with whom 
I have had the pleasure to work for years and whom I am pleased to 
represent today in the House of Commons, at least in part.
<P>
<B>(1300)</B>
<P>
	I would also like to congratulate my colleague for Don Valley 
North, who is a member of this community and of the Liberal 
government, for his continuous and exceptional work on this issue. 
Like him, I deplore the fact that a Bloc member has played on the 
feelings of a community by announcing the tabling of this motion 
before it was brought forward in the House.
<P>
	The 20th century has seen two world wars and numerous 
historical conflicts. In spite of this, crimes against humanity are not 
a thing of the past but continue to be daily occurrences in too many 
countries, countries which routinely practice torture, slavery, and 
the massive deportation of their civilian population. Everyday, we 
are witnessing the persecution of minorities on the basis of their 
opinion, race or religion.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	To this day, these unacceptable acts of inhumanity continue 
despite the fact that the Geneva convention condemns such actions. 
Even though the international community has admitted that these 
acts should not be practised, we are still a long way from achieving 
this goal.
<P>
	The Nuremberg war crimes tribunal for the first time tried those 
guilty of committing crimes against humanity. These crimes were 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1829"> 1829 </A></B>
<P>
defined in article 6 of the London charter and included murder, 
extermination, enslavement, deportation and other inhumane acts  
committed against any civilian population before or during the war, 
or persecution on political, racial and religious grounds.
<P>
	While not all the criminals have been tried, the international 
community recognizes the holocaust and commemorates it every 
year so that everyone around the world will remember this tragedy 
to ensure that it will never occur again. Regardless of this, we still 
live in a world where ethnic cleansing is practised, the most recent 
example being the horrors that were committed in the former 
Yugoslavia.
<P>
	Can we continue to be an active member of the international 
community and allow these atrocities to continue? I think not. 
However, we must first be able to internationally acknowledge that 
atrocities against humanity are unacceptable.
<P>
	The Armenian genocide which took place during the first world 
war is perhaps the most vivid example of genocide as an instrument 
of national policy by the Ottoman Turks. What makes the 
Armenian genocide such a particular example is that unlike the 
genocide of the Jewish people which took place during the second 
world war, the international community did not try the war 
criminals or even formally acknowledge that this massacre took 
place.
<P>
	Why, people may ask, is it so important to recognize an event 
that occurred over 80 years ago? We must always remember that 
those who disregard history are condemned to repeat it. Just think 
if the international community had reacted to this as it should have 
at the time. Would the atrocities of the second world war ever have 
taken place? Perhaps not.
<P>
	There is nothing we can do to bring back these victims or to 
change the past, but there is a need to designate a week of the year, 
as my colleague from Don Valley proposed last April, as a week of 
remembrance of the inhumanity of people toward one another to 
ensure that future generations do not forget these tragic events and 
more important, do not repeat them.
<P>
	While the European community and several other countries such 
as Italy, France, Israel and most recently Russia have passed 
parliamentary decrees formally recognizing this event, the 
international community as a whole has not taken the steps 
necessary to condemn these horrible acts of inhumanity.
<P>
	I repeat, our government has recognized this tragic incident that 
saw 1.5 million people brutally executed by the Ottoman Turks 
who sought to ethnically cleanse their land of foreigners. We 
understand the suffering that this brought and the need for the 
Armenian community to have this tragedy recognized by all 
members of the international community. That is why we are 
supporting a week to commemorate crimes against humanity.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	As representatives of a country recognized for its support of 
human rights, we know that Canadians condemn the practice of 
genocide and the use of violence as an instrument of power. Failure 
to acknowledge that such actions took place would amount to 
supporting their use as an instrument of national policy.
<P>
	The sad reality is that news reports are still dominated by the 
horrors resulting from a lack of respect for human rights.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	While these atrocities are some examples of crimes committed 
against humanity, there are unfortunately many others, both past 
and present. Some are well known; others, such as the Asia Minor 
catastrophe of 1922, are not so well known.
<P>
<B>(1305)</B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	At the end of the first world war, close to two million Greeks 
were living in a region of Asia Minor on the west coast of modern 
Turkey. Greeks had been living in that region for over 3,000 years. 
In 1922, these people, like the Armenians and other Turkish 
minorities, were the victims of the first ethnic cleansing operation 
of the 20th century.
<P>
	During that tragic summer, 600,000 Greeks from Asia Minor 
were killed by the forces of Mustafa Kemal, the father of modern 
Turkey. One and a half million people were also forced to leave 
their ancestral homes and ended up in Greece as refugees. These 
operations were neither sporadic nor spontaneous, but rather in line 
with the new Turkish state's cold and calculated ethnic cleansing 
policy. During this series of well-organized massacres, the 
government also burned down churches, schools, even cities and 
towns with Greek ties.
<P>
	Although foreign diplomats and correspondents, as well as 
thousands of people from all kinds of backgrounds, witnessed these 
atrocities, the international community did nothing to condemn 
them.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Although the United States, Britain, France and Italy had ships 
and troops stationed on the coast of Asia Minor, they refused to 
intervene. The failure of these countries to condemn the actions of 
the Turkish government at that time encouraged other states to 
practise genocide as a government policy.
<P>
	Unchecked aggression only leads to further acts of barbarism 
and genocide. In the last four years alone we have witnessed the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1830"> 1830 </A></B>
<P>
cataclysm that has befallen the former Yugoslavia. All the warring 
factions are guilty of mass killings, ethnic cleansing and cultural 
genocide in varying degrees. The war crimes tribunal of which 
Canada is a representative as one of the judges is presently 
examining  the evidence before it. It will no doubt bring out the sad 
and tragic reality of what took place in the former Yugoslavia.
<P>
	The cycle of violence has not stopped. We only need to look to 
the mass murders that have taken place in Somalia, Rwanda and 
Cambodia to confirm that fact. In all these examples the killing, 
destruction and forcible movement of populations have been acts 
of deliberate policy and not random excesses of rebels or 
uncontrolled government forces. Many governments have shut 
their eyes and not acknowledged that these atrocities took place.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	By recognizing these historic events as crimes against humanity, 
we affirm that such crimes, both past and present, cannot be 
tolerated. As members of Parliament, we must urge the 
international community to redouble its efforts to prevent crimes 
against humanity.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Canada will continue to take a leadership role on the world stage 
to promote peace among the members of the international 
community. We have no lessons to be learned from the official 
opposition. As we all know, its mandate is to break up this country 
which is so respected on an international level. Our reputation for 
the respect and promotion of human rights precedes us and can no 
doubt help us to achieve this goal.
<P>
	What I am about to say may be taken as partisan but we have no 
lessons to be learned from the opposition. As my colleague from 
Don Valley said, talk is cheap. The opposition can present a 
motion, it can say anything it wants, but its words do not have the 
same consequences.
<P>
	A government like ours which has shown it is a responsible 
government at all levels acts responsibly. There are legal and 
international consequences for words as well as for actions. We 
have no lessons to learn from the hon. members on the other side of 
the House. During the recent referendum in Quebec we know what 
high regard they had for the ethnic communities there. I have lived 
in Quebec, I was raised in Quebec, I have spent many years 
fighting many of the words of discrimination and racism that exist 
in that society. We have no lessons to be learned.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Boudria:</B> Madam Speaker, if you were to seek it, I believe 
you would find unanimous consent that the votes which had 
previously been deferred to 5.30 p.m. today be further deferred 
until the end of Government Orders.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Ringuette-Maltais):</B> Is there 
unanimous consent?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
<B>(1310)</B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Osvaldo Nunez (Bourassa, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I listened 
with great interest to the speech of the hon. member for 
Saint-Denis. I must tell her that the Government of Quebec fully 
respect the rights of minorities. Quebec is a very open society. I can 
testify to that, as a non-francophone member who was elected by a 
majority of French speaking constituents and by members of ethnic 
communities.
<P>
	The hon. member calls the Armenian genocide a tragic incident. 
It is much more than a tragic incident. It is the extermination of one 
and a half million Armenians. It is the deportation of half a million 
people. It is the destruction of numerous churches and monasteries. 
It is the dispersal of Armenians all over the world.
<P>
	I am surprised that the Government of Canada stubbornly 
refuses to recognize this genocide which has been recognized by 
other nations, including Latin American countries such as Uruguay 
and Argentina. Monuments were erected in Columbia, etc. It is 
unacceptable on the part of a government promoting democracy 
and human rights throughout the world to hold such contradictory 
views. Indeed, when trade comes into play, it takes precedence over 
human rights.
<P>
	How can the hon. member justify the Canadian government's 
stubborn refusal to recognize this genocide for what it is?
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Bakopanos:</B> Madam Speaker, let me read again, for the 
benefit of the opposition member, the amendment that we tabled in 
this House regarding the motion before us. It says: ``the Armenian 
tragedy which claimed some 1.5 million lives''. There was never 
any question of not recognizing this massacre. This government 
never said that it did not recognize this tragedy.
<P>
	As to whether the province of Quebec lives in democracy, I 
remind the opposition member that Canada is known as the most 
democratic, tolerant and open country in the world.
<P>
	If we currently have in the House of Commons the opposition 
that we know, it is because we recognize and accept our 
differences. We are known as a government that fights for human 
rights everywhere in the world. Our government has always tried to 
protect those in the world who could not protect themselves. Again, 
we always recognized that 1.5 million Armenians lost their lives.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Sarkis Assadourian (Don Valley North, Lib.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I was very pleased with the speech by the hon. member for 
Saint-Denis. Many Canadians of Armenian origin live in the 
Saint-Denis riding.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1831"> 1831 </A></B>
<P>
	In 1939 when Adolf Hitler was invading Europe and 
slaughtering the Jews country by country, someone asked him how 
future generations would react to the holocaust, the massacre and 
genocide that he had committed. His reply was: ``After all, who 
remembers the Armenian atrocities, the Armenian genocide?''
<P>
	If the world were to condemn the Armenian genocide would the 
hon. member agree with me that it would have prevented the 
invasion by Turkish forces in northern Cyprus some 67 years 
afterward?
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Bakopanos:</B> Madam Speaker, as I said in my speech, we 
must never forget history. If we forget history and we do not 
acknowledge the atrocities of the past, we are condemned to repeat 
them. Yes, I do believe that what happened in Cyprus may not have 
happened if there had been acknowledgement of this tragedy that 
occurred.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Maurice Bernier (Mégantic-Compton-Stanstead, 
BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I am very pleased to take part in this debate 
on the opposition motion put forward by my hon. colleague from 
Ahuntsic.
<P>
<B>(1315)</B>
<P>
	Today's motion is exactly the same as the motion the hon. 
member for Don Valley North moved in 1994. I was somewhat 
surprised to hear our colleague from Don Valley North and the hon. 
member for Saint-Denis accuse the opposition of narrow 
partisanship because we put this motion before the House today.
<P>
	As I said earlier, the text of the resolution moved by the Bloc 
member for Ahuntsic is, for the most part, the same as the motion 
the hon. member for Don Valley North put forward last year. 
Following pressure exerted by his own party, the motion was not 
voted on in the House. It was announced that the motion could not 
be voted on in 1994.
<P>
	The official opposition wanted to revisit this issue in the House 
because of its significance, and also because of the lack of attention 
the government pays to human rights when it deals with 
international trade. As the official opposition critic on human 
rights, I wanted to take part in this debate precisely to address this 
issue.
<P>
	Of course, we have to go beyond narrow partisanship-and I 
mention it mostly for our Liberal colleagues-and decry these 
actions which are still occurring too often nowadays, actions aimed 
at completely wiping out a people. That is why I am a bit surprised 
by the reaction of the hon. member for Don Valley North. It seems 
to me that no one can deny the serious harm done to certain 
peoples, among others the Armenian people. Therefore, we have to 
denounce such actions without any reservation and with no 
hesitation whatsoever so that, hopefully, they do not reoccur.
<P>
	As an example of partisanship, let me remind the House of the 
amendment moved by the Secretary of State responsible for 
Multiculturalism and the Status of Women, to replace the word 
``genocide'' by ``tragedy''. As we have noticed in the speeches 
made by the Liberal members and as we will see, I guess, 
throughout the day, where Armenia is concerned, Liberal members 
prefer to talk about a tragedy instead of a genocide.
<P>
	I do not think these two words are interchangeable. The 
newspaper I was reading this morning, and almost all the daily 
papers in Quebec, reported many car accidents, as they do 
unfortunately every day or at least every week. I read this morning 
in the paper about an automobile accident that happened in the 
region next to mine, the Montérégie, where three young people 
died. The report spoke of a tragedy for the families, relatives and 
friends.
<P>
	Last week, on April 18, we were reminded the world over of the 
Oklahoma City tragedy where almost 200 persons died last year in 
an explosion due to a truly insane action. This was called a tragedy.
<P>
<B>(1320)</B>
<P>
	In spite of their seriousness or their enormity, can events like 
automobile accidents and the terrible Oklahoma City bombing 
really be compared with not only the intent but also the actions 
taken to eliminate a people, a whole community? Is it really 
possible?
<P>
	According to the <I>Larousse</I> Dictionary, a tragedy can mean two 
things. I think words must have a meaning. It is said that the 
legislator never talks for the sake of talking. Thus, since the 
Secretary of State responsible for Multiculturalism and the Status 
of Women moved in this House on behalf of the government an 
amendment to replace the term ``genocide'' by the term ``tragedy'', 
there must be a reason. This was not done merely to stretch out the 
opposition's motion. There was an intention.
<P>
	What exactly does ``tragedy'' mean? What is the meaning of 
``tragedy'' in the <I>Larousse</I> dictionary? The meaning given in the 
<I>Petit Robert</I> is almost the same. In the literary sense it means a 
play, the subject of which is generally drawn from legend or 
history, which takes well known figures and has them act out 
events designed to evoke fear or pity-
<P>
	Is that the intention of the government, which is accusing the 
official opposition of partisan politics, of wanting to raise this 
question without giving the government sufficient warning, 
according to the member for Don Valley North?
<P>
	I think that by using the word ``tragedy'', they are specifically 
seeking to mask the real situation, whereas ``genocide'' refers to 
the extermination of a people. It is not the same thing. I repeat, the 
words must have a meaning.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1832"> 1832 </A></B>
<P>
	In his motion, which he repeated this morning, the member for 
Don Valley North used the term or expression ``crime against 
humanity''. A crime against humanity is always a tragedy, but it 
is different. It is different when that term, which is similar to 
genocide, is used, it is different than the use of the term 
``tragedy'', which, in its literary sense, refers to theatre intended 
to move audiences, but which also refers to an unfortunate event 
or events.
<P>
	We have to know why. All we can do is interpret-I do not know 
if I can speak about interpretation-conclude that the intention of 
the government is to qualify, to reduce the scope of what happened 
to the Armenians early in this century.
<P>
	Can one compare-I return to my example-the extermination 
of a million and a half people, the deportation of 500,000 others, 
the fact that in Armenia over 2,000 churches and 200 convents 
were destroyed, that people were targeted specifically because of 
their race or religious beliefs, is this House, the Parliament of 
Canada, which is a world leader in respecting human rights and 
democracy, being asked simply to consider these events a tragedy? 
This makes no sense.
<P>
	We have a duty, and I must conclude that the government's 
intention in introducing this amendment is to water down the 
interpretation of history as it relates to the Armenian genocide, and 
also to other similar situations.
<P>
<B>(1325)</B>
<P>
	My colleagues raised the problem, and we will have to come 
back to it during the day, of how the Canadian government had no 
problem talking about the genocide in Rwanda and how it is so 
difficult to recognize the genocide of the Armenians.
<P>
	The member's motion also raises the matter of the government's 
attitude, which will be the focus of my remarks: the government's 
attitude toward human rights, which are a bargaining point, if I can 
put it that way, in trade matters between Canada and other 
countries.
<P>
	As my colleague for Ahuntsic pointed out, the fact that the 
Government of Canada has been negotiating various levels of trade 
with the Government of Turkey for a number of years already, 
including the potential sale of a Candu reactor, there may in fact be 
a certain amount of interest in pushing the Armenian issue under 
the carpet. I hope I am wrong in making this suggestion.
<P>
	After this government's election, we concluded from a number 
of decisions made that trade was more important than human 
rights. I would remind this House about the trip by Team Canada, 
in fact the two trips by Team Canada, especially to Asia where the 
Prime Minister stressed the enormous advantages offered by 
Canada and worked to improve trade with Asian countries.
<P>
	Everyone in Canada-the official opposition along with the rest 
of the parties-is agreed on the importance of improving our 
record in terms of developing the economy. Everyone agrees that 
Canada should be competitive, that our products should be 
promoted-but at any price? Should we do so at the expense of our 
most basic principles, particularly in the area of human rights? The 
answer, obviously, is no, and this is the answer the official 
opposition wants to hear from the government. We want a categoric 
and strong no, not only in this House, but outside it as well.
<P>
	When government officials, with the Prime Minister at the helm, 
travel the world, they should carry a clear message. Yes, Canada is 
open to international trade, yes, Canada wants to reduce, indeed 
eliminate as much as possible barriers to international trade. 
However, at the same time, the Prime Minister, the Minister of 
Foreign Affairs and all government members have the 
responsibility and the duty to make it clear that human rights are 
not negotiable.
<P>
	In conclusion, I want to remind my colleagues in this House, in 
particular government members, that a 13-year old boy, the young 
Kielburger, from the Toronto area, had to confront the Prime 
Minister on this issue for it to be given attention all of a sudden.
<P>
<B>(1330)</B>
<P>
	This young boy had to denounce child labour, especially in Asian 
countries, in order for the government to, all of a sudden, pay 
attention to the issue of human rights.
<P>
	I know my time is up. However, I want to say in conclusion that 
as parliamentarians, we do not have the right to use terms such as 
tragedy to minimize the importance of events that occurred 
throughout the world, especially in Armenia. When we talk about 
genocide, genocide it is. When we talk about child labour, that is 
what me must call it. Words must have a meaning. This is what I 
want and this is what the official opposition wants by having this 
motion passed.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Sarkis Assadourian (Don Valley North, Lib.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, for the third time in the last two hours I am asking an hon. 
member from the Bloc Quebecois to put his money where his 
mouth is. Would he undertake to the House to go to his caucus, pass 
a resolution and ask the premier of Quebec, the former leader of the 
Bloc Quebecois, to erect a monument in Montreal or in Quebec 
City to commemorate the genocide of the Armenians in 1915, yes 
or no?
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bernier (Mégantic-Compton-Stanstead):</B> Madam 
Speaker, to start with, I will remind the member for Don Valley 
North that Quebec recognized the Armenian genocide in 1980, that 
my colleague for Ahuntsic met, I believe, the expectations of the 
member for Don Valley North since the municipal government in 
Montreal,  headed by its mayor, had planned to erect a monument 
to commemorate the Armenian genocide, but that, during the 
election campaign, yielding to pressures from the Minister of 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1833"> 1833 </A></B>
<P>
International Trade, the City of Montreal changed its mind. The 
mayor of Montreal has yet to deny that his project was put on the 
back burner following pressures from a member of the 
government.
<P>
	If I understand what the member for Don Valley North said, and 
if he is talking on behalf of his caucus and his government, I am 
convinced that the City of Montreal-and I do not see why the 
Quebec government would object to being associated with this 
initiative-would be quite willing to commemorate the Armenian 
genocide, and to remind our fellow citizens and the world at large 
of it by erecting a monument. I cannot see any inconsistency in 
what we are saying, since we are in favour of recognizing it. Not 
only are we in favour of doing it, but we do recognize the Armenian 
genocide. For our part, we do not want to reduce these unfortunate 
events to one human tragedy among many others, rather we want to 
stress that it is unacceptable for any government to intentionally 
and systematically try to eliminate a whole people.
<P>
	In his speech, not in his questions, the member for Don Valley 
North mentioned the holocaust on several occasions. The word 
holocaust is associated with the extermination of Jews during the 
second world war. We are talking about the extermination of a 
people. The official opposition is not being inconsistent, we 
recognize the Armenian genocide, this is the subject of the motion. 
We condemn this kind of crime against humanity and, of course, I 
believe the official opposition, and the Quebec government, would 
not object in any way to this being commemorated in a special way 
by erecting a monument.
<P>
<B>(1335)</B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Assadourian:</B> Madam Speaking, I asked a simple question. 
I did not want to be lectured. Would the member agree to put a 
monument in Quebec City, yes or no? All he has to say is yes, he 
agrees or no, he does not agree. That is all I want. I do not want to 
be lectured.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bernier (Mégantic-Compton-Stanstead):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I do not know if the hon. member for Don Valley North is 
looking for financing but, if he is, we would like to join him in 
asking the government to proceed.
<P>
	I just mentioned that if there were inconsistencies among 
parliamentarians, they were on the other side, which tries to reduce 
the importance of these events by referring to them as a tragedy, 
when we are talking about the extermination of a people.
<P>
	This is my answer, and if that does not suit the hon. member he 
could repeat his question.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Philippe Paré (Louis-Hébert, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
would like to make a brief comment and compare what the 
president of Amnesty International said to what the Prime Minister 
said. I will then ask my colleague for some comments.
<P>
	During a recent visit to Ottawa, Pierre Sané, president of 
Amnesty International, said: ``The battle for human rights has to be 
global, otherwise it will be lost even before it starts''.
<P>
	During his first trip to Asia, the Prime Minister said: ``I could 
give a headline-making speech on that issue, but I prefer to open 
markets and promote trade. The walls will eventually come down''.
<P>
	Given what the Prime Minister said, could my colleague tell us 
when these walls will come down? Is it in two years or two hundred 
years?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bernier (Mégantic-Compton-Stanstead):</B> Madam 
Speaker, the question of my colleague from Louis-Hébert is very 
relevant. As a matter of fact, I pointed out at the beginning of my 
speech the kind of political jockeying the government is doing by 
putting on the table-and the reference to the Prime Minister's 
words is totally eloquent-human rights and international trade. 
That is not only unacceptable, and the term is not too strong, but 
totally repugnant.
<P>
	Like my colleague from Louis-Hébert just did, I would remind 
the House that despite all the things we can blame on the previous 
government, the Conservative government of Mr. Mulroney, 
parliamentarians of this House and observers of the political scene 
in general will recognize that Mr. Mulroney did not miss an 
opportunity to denounce the way various communities throughout 
the world were treated and to promote human rights. I remind the 
House that it was a Conservative government, therefore 
theoretically more right wing, if you will.
<P>
	We now see a government calling itself liberal in terms of its 
political allegiance, but in reality, its decisions are even more 
typical of the extreme right. When my colleague from 
Louis-Hébert reminded us of the Prime Minister's words, as I was 
saying earlier, that is the message people throughout the world 
remember in terms of Canada's political stand as regards human 
rights.
<P>
	If that message is heard around the world, it will surely be heard 
and understood by many people and groups here in Canada, a 
situation that threatens the future of our rights and freedoms if we 
are not careful.
<P>
	Not only it is justified, but the official opposition would be 
derelict in its duty if it failed to raise this kind of debate in the 
House. That is why we have tabled this motion today. We want all 
members of this House who speak up in support of human rights to 
have the opportunity to ask the government, by voting on this 
motion, to be consistent and to promote these rights at the 
international level.

<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Peterson (Willowdale, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, I am 
pleased to speak on this motion and I commend the Bloc member 
for Ahuntsic who brought forward the motion to recognize the 
Armenian genocide of 1915.
<P>
	I put on record that our party supports the motion that the House 
recognize, on the occasion of the 81st anniversary of the Armenian 
tragedy which claimed some 1.5 million lives on April 24, 1915, 
and in recognition of other crimes against humanity, the week of 
April 20 to 27 of each year as the week of remembrance of the 
inhumanity of people toward one another.
<P>
	On Sunday I had the honour to participate in a ceremony at the 
Armenian community centre in Toronto. For two and a half hours 
we remembered the genocide of 1915. What impressed me most 
about the ceremony was that so many young people, through song, 
attendance, speeches and leadership, remembered what took place 
81 years ago. It had become part of their lives and part of their 
culture that the genocide must never be forgotten.
<P>
	This is not the first time I have participated in this type of 
ceremony. I have been privileged for a number of years as a 
member of Parliament to have met with my friends at the Armenian 
community centre.
<P>
	When I was first introduced to the issue by the member for Don 
Valley North it was unknown to me. At that time he was the 
executive director of the community centre. He and other members 
of the community, including Aris Barbikian who has come from 
Toronto to be with us in the House today, talked to me about that 
incredible tragedy in which 1.5 million Armenians were 
indiscriminately wiped out simply because they were Armenians. 
This tragedy has been part the psyche of Armenians everywhere in 
the world.
<P>
	After 81 years, we ask, why could people not forget? The answer 
is very simple. The Turkish government has never recognized its 
responsibility in this act of genocide. How can the survivors of that 
tragedy or the families or  friends of survivors accept this historical 
canard where it has never been recognized by the perpetrators? 
Even the holocaust of the second world war has been recognized 
for what it was.
<P>
<B>(1345 )</B>
<P>
	When we as individuals can accept and deal head on with the 
truth as opposed to putting our heads in the sand, then we can cope 
with whatever the world has thrown or may throw at us in the 
future. However it is denial which is an insult to those who were 
wiped out 81 years ago.
<P>
	I am not particularly proud of the rest of the world. We have been 
slow in coming to grips with recognizing what actually took place. 
The historical record is clear. There is no room for ambiguity or 
ambivalence. That tragedy did take place. That genocide is a fact of 
history. Whatever we say about it cannot change that 
incontrovertible fact.
<P>
	Why are we so reluctant to join with our brothers and sisters in 
the Armenian community in recognizing what is a plain and simple 
truth? Perhaps it is part of that world of realpolitik or doublespeak. 
Maybe we have other reasons which we do not want to talk about. I 
find it offensive.
<P>
	As a member of Parliament I have spoken publicly calling for 
recognition of the Armenian genocide. It may not be in the cards 
today or in the exact words that we would like to see. However, I 
will be supporting the motion as amended by our party which puts 
in stark outline the fact that so many people were murdered and 
that it was a tragedy of enormous proportion. There is still 
suffering by those who remember. Perhaps one day we will find a 
way in the House to recognize, as a few other nations already have, 
the fact that the 1915 murder of 1.5 million Armenians was in fact 
the first genocide of the 20th century.
<P>
	Why is it important that we dwell on an event which took place 
81 years ago? I recall the words of Hitler who, when he was 
embarking on his crusade to wipe out Jewry in the world, said: 
``Who is to stop me? Who remembers the Armenian genocide?'' 
That is one reason we must remember. If we cannot look history 
straight in the eye, if we cannot learn from the tragedies which took 
place, how apt are we to stand idly by and ignore other acts of 
genocide which are taking place?
<P>
	We have seen the tragedy in Bosnia where people were wiped out 
simply because they belonged to a particular race or religion. We 
have seen the killing fields. We have seen wars throughout the 
entire world based on the fact that people because they were of a 
particular nationality, religion or race were considered to be 
inferior and our enemy. That is so against what every member in 
the House from every party stands for.

<B>(1350 )</B>
<P>
	Not only in Canada do we have a human rights code but we also 
have a charter of rights that deals with discrimination based on 
race, colour, religion, creed, sex and age and is totally beyond the 
purview of any legislature and cannot be countered. We have 
spoken about the types of human rights we seek to respect within 
our own nation. We are the signatories to numerous documents and 
treaties which impose this obligation to recognize rights 
internationally.
<P>
	Looking at the situation in Turkey today, we see a war led by the 
PKK, the Kurdish workers party, to try to create a separate state. 
What we have seen in terms of repression by the Turkish 
government has been extreme. It is also a matter of record that 
there have been many violations of human rights in Turkey.
<P>
	Canada has condemned these violations quite properly, as it is 
our obligation to do as a member of the world community. We have 
called for a political solution rather than a military solution to the 
separatist issue. We hope that by working with our allies and the 
Turkish officials we are going to be able to achieve some progress 
in this regard.
<P>
	My mind goes back to a couple of days ago at the wonderful 
ceremony of remembrance, the 81st anniversary of the Armenian 
genocide. I was joined at the commemorative service by the 
member for Don Valley North, the member for Scarborough and 
Senator Haidasz. All of us were impressed by the intensity of 
feeling we experienced during that ceremony.
<P>
	I mentioned earlier the fact that so many young people had made 
the non-recognition of the genocide a part of their ethos, a part of 
their mission. These young people are not going to be content until 
the record is set straight. These people are not seeking reparations 
or international trials. All they want is a recognition of what their 
people went through, a recognition that this tragedy took place and 
that the rest of the world is prepared to join with them in solidarity 
in recognizing those who died, those who survived and their 
families.
<P>
	The motion we see before us as amended by our party is a step in 
the right direction. It may not be all that we seek but it does not 
mean that we will give up our efforts to seek more. I commend the 
member for Don Valley North for the efforts he has made and all 
members of the House who support this motion.
<P>
<B>(1355 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ian McClelland (Edmonton Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I take the comments of the member for Willowdale at face 
value and acknowledge the fact that his comments were heartfelt 
and genuine as all of the comments in the House have been.
<P>
	However, there does seem to be some inconsistency here. The 
Bloc, and prior to that, the Parti Quebecois, has been diligent in 
facing this issue and trying to bring some recognition to the 
Armenian genocide since at least 1980. The Government of Quebec 
and the Government of Ontario both in the early eighties 
unanimously presented resolutions to that effect. Yet, when the 
issue comes to the federal government it seems to be watered 
down. Such is the case again today with the removal of the word 
genocide by the Liberal amendment. I understand that is to make it 
palatable today particularly to Turkey with whom we have good 
and mutually beneficial relations.
<P>
	Could the member for Willowdale expand on the fact that we 
have to rob Peter to pay Paul?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Peterson:</B> Mr. Speaker, I cannot respond in a way that is 
satisfactory to the member or perhaps to any member in this House 
including myself.
<P>
	I believe we should take the steps, hopefully in time, to call a 
spade a spade and a genocide a genocide. Unfortunately 
governments often move more slowly than we would like, more 
slowly than reason or feelings would dictate. We cannot always 
achieve everything we want exactly when we want. I suppose this 
has been one of the great revelations to me having spent several 
years in this House. Not only was Rome not built in a day, it was 
not repaired in a day.
<P>
	We will measure our progress in this area in terms of steps rather 
than quantum leaps. It may not be as satisfactory. There may not be 
explanations which are totally acceptable and square with what we 
know to be the historic reality. Nevertheless, considering our 
international obligations, considering our allies, considering 
international pressures that are brought to bear-
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> Colleagues, it being 2 p.m., we will proceed to

	<B>Mr. Leonard Hopkins (Renfrew-Nipissing-Pembroke,

Canada must never lose sight of the fact that in the years leading up 
to 1867 the Fathers of Confederation laid the foundation for our 
Canada with the full intent that the country was to be indivisible 
and indissoluble. There has never been any change in that intent 
nor in that purpose. Neither in the Constitution of Canada nor in 
law is there any provision for the separation or splitting away of a 
province or territory.

	<B>Mr. John Cummins (Delta, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, there is a legal 
requirement that the sewage treatment facility being constructed by 
the Tswwassen Indian Band be subject to an environmental 
assessment pursuant to the Canadian Environmental Assessment 
Act.
<P>
	The government has refused to confirm such an assessment. This 
plant is being built on vitally sensitive intertidal salt water marsh. 
The marsh has been internationally recognized as an extremely 
sensitive habitat for juvenile salmon, migratory wildlife and the 
great blue heron, a species unique to this ecosystem.
<P>
	In spite of enormous pressure from the public, the province of 
British Columbia and the municipality of Delta, these ministers of 
the government are apparently denying the people of the country 
access to their own environmental laws.
<P>
	I beg the House to join in my demand that the Government of 
Canada immediately confirm that it has commenced and 
environmental assessment of this sewage project pursuant to the 
Canadian Environmental Assessment Act. There must be one law 
in this land and it must apply to each of us.

Salon de l'invention et de l'innovation, to be held shortly in Black 
Lake. This is a fair where inventors display for the general public 
the new products they have invented.
<P>
	This fair, which is very interesting for business people and the 
general public, is a good opportunity to develop new businesses 
and create jobs.
<P>
	I want to emphasize the excellent work of those who have 
organized this event: Benoît Côté, Éric Labonté, Mario Bergeron, 
Sonia Delisle et Marcel St-Laurent. I also want to congratulate all

	<B>Hon. Audrey McLaughlin (Yukon, NDP):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
proposed plans to privatize training under changes to the 
Unemployment Insurance Act and to implement a voucher system 
have devastating consequences not only for recipients but for 
educational institutions and for long term educational planning.
<P>
	This proposal is based on two very dubious assumptions: that 
every region has a mix of private and public training facilities, and 
that all applicants can on their own easily access training options.
<P>
	In many rural and northern areas this is simply not the case. For 
example, the Yukon College under this scheme would lose $2 
million to $3 million a year in stable and assured funding, funding 
which allows the college to plan ahead for both UI recipients and 
the general public. Under the government proposal both groups 
will be the losers.
<P>
	I urge the minister to review this ill advised change, which 
clearly undermines training in the north and in rural areas.

<P>
	St. Andrews, Montaclam, Tache, Morris, St. Clements and North 
Norfolk have declared themselves to be in a state of emergency, 
and many more communities are on flood alert as the water 
continues to rise. The flooding has caused a great deal of damage 
already and is expected to continue for several more days until the 
rivers crest.
<P>
	The good news is that thanks to the foresight of a number of 
public officials and the hard work of thousands of volunteers the 
damage has been kept to a minimum. Whole communities began 
preparing sandbags early prompted by the advice of the Emergency 
Preparedness Organization.
<P>
	In my riding city councillor John Angus ran sandbagging 
workshops and trained volunteers so that when the high water 
arrived we were able to respond immediately. City and provincial 
officials made sure the necessary supplies were available.
<P>
	Volunteers from St. Norbert, Dakota and Fort Richmond 
Collegiates and the St. Norbert Foundation spent countless hours

recently I have had several complaints from my constituents in 
London-Middlesex about gasoline prices.
<P>
	Many Canadians are very upset at what they perceive to be an 
orchestrated effort by gasoline companies to charge exorbitant 
amounts for gasoline at the pumps.
<P>
	Canadian consumers feel they are being unfairly gouged by 
gasoline companies which routinely raise prices as weekends 
begin, especially long weekends. They feel these companies are 
displaying incredible arrogance and that they are both taking 
advantage of consumers and ignoring any attempt by governments 
in Canada to help resolve this concern. It is time for the gasoline 
companies of Canada to become better corporate citizens and to 
treat Canadian consumers more fairly.

27,995 clubs in 154 countries around the globe. In Canada we have 
29,183 members in 650 clubs. This year's Rotary international 
president, Herb Brown, has chosen as his theme: ``act with 
integrity, serve with love and work for peace''. In serving with 
love, Rotary has raised over $400 million toward the polio plus 
project, a project dedicated to the elimination of polio from the 
face of the earth.
<P>
	Visiting today are 18 Rotarians from my home club in Barrie

	<B>Mr. Charles Hubbard (Miramichi, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, a major 
problem in the country today is the concentration of economic 
power in the boardrooms of major corporations whose sole 
business is to maximize profits.
<P>
	We are lobbied today by banks, an industry that has made 
billions in profits while using automation to lay off thousands of 
employees to now enter the field of auto leasing.
<P>
	It is important for our local car dealers that major banks not be 
permitted to enter the leasing markets. They believe it would be a 
conflict of interest, as banks are their major source of financing. 
They are concerned that they will jeopardize their chances of 
obtaining financing from the banks if they are forced to compete 
with the banks in the same market.
<P>
	We cannot afford to have the banks take more jobs away from 
hardworking Canadians. I ask all members to support car dealers in 
their opposition to banks' entering the field of leasing.

Mr. Speaker, tomorrow is the 81st anniversary of the Armenian 
genocide. This sad occasion commemorates the tragic end of more 
than one and a half million Armenians. The massacres of the 
Armenian people by the Ottoman government of Turkey, which 
lasted from 1915 to 1923, were the first genocide of the 20th 
century. It is important to condemn these atrocities and to increase 
public awareness of genocides committed throughout the world.
<P>
	Any country that uses genocide and violence as an instrument of 
policy is guilty of a crime against humanity, a crime that will 
remain forever etched in the memory of those who suffered and 
that history can never forget.

	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> Mr.

had reached an agreement on the harmonization of the GST with 
the provincial sales tax.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, Hear.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gauthier:</B> Mr. Speaker, you will have noted that the Liberal 
members and ministers applauded the fact that the GST remains, 
but will be hidden in the future.
<P>
	Will the Minister of Finance acknowledge that, in his admission 
to journalists this morning of having been wrong in thinking he 
could replace the GST with another tax, he was confirming that the 
GST will stay, but will be hidden in the future?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, 
what we announced this morning was a major reform in the 
Atlantic provinces. Now we really do have a tax that will eliminate 
overlap and duplication, and I am sure the member opposite will 
agree. The tax will be harmonized, as it is in Quebec.
<P>
	As most consumers, small and medium businesses and retailers 
have asked, the tax will be visible in the purchase of a dress, for 
example, but it will be transparent at the same time, because the tax 
itself will appear on the bill.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, everyone, including his Liberal colleagues, will have seen 
that the minister is in no rush to comment on his own remarks to 
the effect that the GST will indeed remain in place.
<P>
	Will the Minister of Finance confirm that the $1 billion or nearly 
that in compensation paid to the Maritime provinces to encourage 
them to go along with his system will mean that the rest of Canada 
will be paying about $1 billion of their taxes in compensation to the 
Maritimes for a sales tax they will no longer be paying because the 
provinces agreed to the minister's deal?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.): </B>Not at all, Mr. 
Speaker. What we did was arrange a formula to compensate 
provinces wishing to harmonize their sales tax but facing a loss in 
revenues, that is, the four Atlantic provinces. The offer was made 
to Saskatchewan and Manitoba as well. Other provinces, like 
Quebec in 1990, suffered no loss. This is true as well for Ontario, 
Alberta and British Columbia.
<P>
	It is in fact a well established practice in Canada, when a region 
undergoes a major restructuring or faces some hardship, as in the 
case of the payments to western farmers in the 1990s, for the 
federal government to provide assistance, because Canada is built 
on the principle of regions helping each other. This is in fact what 
we have done here.
<P>
<B>(1420)</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, this is not economic compensation for a problem created 
by the federal government; it is political compensation.
<P>
	It is very easy to understand. If consumers in the Maritimes are 
asked to pay less sales tax in order to participate in the minister's 
proposal, and the federal  government pays out $1 billion in 
compensation for this tax Maritimers will no longer have to pay, 
this is tantamount to saying to the people in the other provinces:

``Pay up $1 billion now, so the people in the Maritimes can pay less 
sales tax''. This is what everybody understood.
<P>
	Will the Minister of Finance confirm that the government's 
propensity to centralize everything including the collection and 
management of the GST and sales tax will cost Quebecers some 
$250 million?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.): </B>Not at all, Mr. 
Speaker. First, costs are being shared between the federal 
government and the governments of Nova Scotia, New Brunswick 
and Newfoundland. In other words, the costs are shared more or 
less equally for four years. The adjustment payments will stop at 
the end of the four years.
<P>
	Clearly there is a structural change. We are sharing the costs of 
these changes, because all of Canada will benefit when we create 
more jobs in the Maritimes, which will certainly be the outcome.
<P>
	Second, the idea of centralization is perfectly ridiculous. The 
federal and provincial governments are joining together to reduce 
the burden on the taxpayers in these provinces and to reduce 
administrative costs.
<P>
	Representatives of Canada's accountants' association have said 
this streamlining will save taxpayers $100 million. They have said 
that Canadian firms could save as much as $700 million, if we 
could do the same thing. This is a lot of money, and I think it is 
worth it.
<P>
	Now, with the basic point the member is making is that taxpayers 
in the other provinces should not help in the case of structural 
change, for example, he is in fact denying the principle of 
equalization payments, which benefit Quebec enormously.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot, BQ): </B>Mr. 
Speaker, if the Minister of Finance has any reason to excuse 
himself to the people of Canada, on behalf of his party, it will be for 
having made political hay by promising abolition of the GST and 
then not making good on the promise. That is what he ought to do.
<P>
	This morning, the government decided to disguise the sales tax 
by hiding it in the price of goods and services. Yet, while in 
opposition, the Liberals stated in the dissenting report of 1989 that 
``if the GST is camouflaged in the price, it will be far easier for the 
government to raise it later on''.
<P>
	My question is for the Minister of Finance. Does the minister 
acknowledge that, through his operation this morning, all that he 
has done to make people think that he was eliminating the GST was 
to hide it in the price of goods and services.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, it 
is obvious that the hon. member does not  understand the plan. It is 
perfectly visible. The tax will be on the bill when the purchaser's 
bill is rung up. It is visible. There is no intention whatsoever of 
hiding anything at all. I trust that the hon. member now 
understands.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, on the bill or not, the Prime Minister's commitment, the 
Minister of Finance's commitment, their party's commitment, was 
to abolish the GST. The Deputy Prime Minister even laid her seat 
on the line, as did some other Liberals at election time or shortly 
thereafter.
<P>
	Will the minister admit that what he is proposing at last to the 
people of Quebec and of Canada is what he condemned loudly not 
so very long ago, disguising the GST in the price, where it will be 
far easier for the government to raise it from time to time without 
the public's noticing?
<P>
<B>(1425)</B>
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, 
first of all, the tax will not be disguised, it will show on the bill. 
Second, in the negotiations with the Atlantic provinces, agreement 
was reached on a mechanism for changing the tax, if a change in 
the tax was wanted. This means that it will be even harder to raise 
it. It will require a consensus among the provinces.
<P>
	I have one other point to make. The hon. member believes that, 
instead of an integrated federal-provincial tax, instead of 
implementing in the Maritimes a tax system similar to what there is 
in Quebec, he is saying there should be a totally different tax, that 
Quebec should be pushed aside.
<P>
	I can tell you that, at the meeting of finance ministers, Quebec 
asked us to really respect their desire to have a tax that can be 
harmonized with the Quebec sales tax in order to have a uniform 
tax, for that will be to Quebec's benefit. The hon. member ought to 
ask his head office if that is what is wanted.

	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, on page 92 of the Liberal red book the Liberals promised 
``more free votes will be allowed in the House of Commons''.
<P>
	This promise is made in a paragraph which also promises MPs a 
greater role in drafting legislation through House of Commons' 
committees. It is obviously talking about a free vote on government 
legislation, not private members' bills.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1841"> 1841 </A></B>
<P>
	There have been some free votes on private members' bills in 
this Parliament and previous Parliaments, but this Prime Minister 
has steadfastly refused to allow even one free vote on any 
government legislation.
<P>
	When will the Prime Minister live up to his red book promise 
and allow free votes on government legislation?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I would like to know how many free votes the members of 
the Reform Party have had lately.
<P>
	When some members of the Reform Party expressed 
disagreement about some of that party's policies which were 
completely unacceptable, they were humiliated in their caucus by 
the rest of the caucus because they were more moderate and made 
more sense.
<P>
	We have had more free votes in this House than ever before. 
However, when it is a question of confidence in the government, 
when one has no confidence in the government, then just like the 
Reform Party, one is in the opposition.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, there is a disgusting pattern emerging in this type of 
answer.
<P>
	First we have campaign promises: scrap the GST, free votes in 
the House of Commons. Then we have the red book interpretation, 
modification, qualification. Then we have the government's action 
which is something else again. We end up having a simple, clear 
promise broken and public trust in the government broken. There is 
no integrity here.
<P>
	Is it now the government's position not to allow free votes on 
government legislation?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I would like to talk about the member keeping his word. 
The leader of the third party said in 1990 that he called for the 
election of Reform Party candidates who would rip out the GST. 
That was in 1990.
<P>
	In 1991, the leader said that the GST could not be repealed 
immediately because it would increase the deficit. I am only in 
1991. Now I have to move to 1992.
<P>
	The Reform changed its position yet again, saying that it would 
reduce the GST in stages after, only after, the budget was balanced.
<P>
<B>(1430)</B>
<P>
	I compliment him for his great statement: ``We commend the 
government on its attempt to harmonize the tax with the 
provinces''.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the question is on free votes. No amount of going around 
the mulberry bush, no amount of false bravado from the members, 
will avoid the fact that the question is on free votes in this 
Parliament.
<P>
	The Prime Minister is showing the same contempt for question 
period that he has shown for democratic representation in 
disciplining the member for York South-Weston.
<P>
	Liberal spin doctors said that the member for York 
South-Weston had to be disciplined because he voted against the 
government, not because he voted against the GST. They implied 
that if the member had simply voted against the new GST 
legislation the punishment would not have been necessary.
<P>
	Let me put this theory to a little test. Will the Prime Minister 
allow his MPs a free vote on the GST legislation that the finance 
minister introduced this morning?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, we have many bills in this House-
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Yes or no, yes or no, yes or no.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> The right hon. Prime Minister.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chrétien (Saint-Maurice):</B> Mr. Speaker, we have seen the 
Reform day care program.
<P>
	We had many votes in this House where sometimes members did 
not vote with the government. There were many votes. I did not ask 
them to move to the other side.
<P>
	I had some discipline. It happened to the former Reform whip 
who is sitting there, or he was yesterday, who has been changed 
because he disagreed. We have discipline in the party.
<P>
	When there is a vote in the House of Commons and the question 
is: ``Do you have confidence in this government?'' and if you have 
no confidence in the government, that means that you are no longer 
a member of that party.
<P>
	It has been a British tradition for 400 years. I have to tell the 
member of the third party that a vote of non-confidence in the 
government leads to what happened.
<P>
	I have no lessons in democracy to learn from the Reform Party. 
Yesterday the leader of a party was recognized by the Speaker to 
ask one question and the Reform Party wanted him to shut up. That 
is the type of democracy they are preaching.

	<B>Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the Minister of Human Resources Development.
<P>
	On Saturday, more than 5,000 people from Quebec and New 
Brunswick, including Acadia, rallied in Rivière-du-Loup as 117 
churches in eastern Quebec rang their bells to protest the proposed 
unemployment insurance reform. The archbishop of the Rimouski  
diocese himself recently took a stand against the plans concerning 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1842"> 1842 </A></B>
<P>
seasonal workers, which he described as a serious threat to the very 
survival of the regions.
<P>
	In light of the massive opposition to the unemployment 
insurance reform and, particularly in the regions, to those rules that 
severely penalize seasonal workers, does the minister not agree that 
the best thing to do would be to withdraw this bill and draft a new 
one in partnership with those concerned, providing for a true 
reform of the unemployment insurance system?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of Human Resources 
Development, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, for two years now, we have 
been trying to overhaul the unemployment insurance program, or 
employment insurance program, as it is now called. During these 
two years, hundreds of groups, organizations, companies and 
individual citizens were consulted and, since December, when the 
bill was introduced in this House, presentations have been made 
and briefs submitted by all kinds of people from every region.
<P>
<B>(1435)</B>
<P>
	Some people were worried and they expressed their concerns to 
us. Over the course of a few weeks, the committee to which this bill 
had been referred heard a number of witnesses, who, again, 
expressed their views, concerns and worries.
<P>
	Meanwhile, government members were diligently looking at 
ways to resolve grievances and claims that were recognized as 
legitimate. Out of this committee study came amendments that will 
cost the employment insurance program some $365 million.
<P>
	These amendments will address the issue of benefits paid on the 
basis of the number of weeks worked and, in part at least, the 
problem with the intensity rule, by excluding households making 
less than $26,000 a year, as well as, to some extent, the issue of the 
dividing factor used in calculating the benefits to be paid to 
recipients.
<P>
	That said, I must admit that we did not achieve perfection. And 
whatever was achieved, we achieved without any help from the 
opposition.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
opposition was consistently shoved aside, and this point will be 
made over the next few days. What is important to remember is 
that, regarding the number of hours worked, the researchers who 
advised the minister-if only he had followed their advice-said: 
It is a leap in the dark. There are huge problems and, in what he just 
said, the minister only addressed a reduction in cuts.
<P>
	My question to the minister is the following: Does he not realize 
that because he has not heard what all sides had to say and 
consolidated all the information, hundreds of thousands of 
families, in fact millions of people, will be hit very hard by his 
reform in years to come? Does he  realize that this reform could 
even have serious social impacts?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of Human Resources 
Development, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, we have done our very best to 
listen to everyone who had anything substantial to say. The 
problem in this whole process, as those who attended committee 
meetings and followed our hearings soon realized, is how widely 
divergent the views held by the various witnesses were.
<P>
	As far as those responsible for creating jobs in this country are 
concerned, namely small and medium size businesses, the original 
act, let alone the amendments, went much too far and was way too 
flexible. For the Canadian Labour Congress on the other hand, we 
were much too strict and demanding.
<P>
	In a situation like this one, the role of government is to try to 
strike the happy medium and find solutions which, as far as 
possible, meet the chief requirement, which is, in this case, to help 
those in need.
<P>
	I would like to stress the fact that, if there were problems in 
committee, if some suggestions were overlooked, it is because we 
did not manage to address every representation that was made. But 
for the most part-
<P>

embarrassment. It is no wonder that the member for 
Broadview-Greenwood decided to take the high dive from the 
Liberal caucus.
<P>
	Not only does this agreement take $1 billion from the many to 
give to a few Liberal politicians-and I notice that Brian Tobin is 
here to get his hands on the spoils today-it obviously breaks the 
Liberal promise to scrap, kill and abolish the GST.
<P>
	Why is the government laughing in the face of voters by failing 
to fulfil its promise to scrap the GST?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
dealt with that part of the member's question in my remarks this 
morning. I said that we were right to criticize the GST. The timing 
was wrong, it caused duplication and tremendous costs were 
imposed on business.
<P>
<B>(1440)</B>
<P>
	I also said in my speech this morning that we were mistaken in 
believing we could bring in a new tax immediately that would not 
cause a distortion to the  economy. In fact we went through two and 
one-half years of very hard work. The House of Commons finance 
committee heard over 500 witnesses and considered 700 briefs. We 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1843"> 1843 </A></B>
<P>
looked at a series of over 20 alternatives before coming down with 
this which is by far the best public policy.
<P>
	The hon. member can continue along this vein as long as he 
wants but what is painfully evident is the lack of substance in the 
Reform Party's questions. The issue is that the Reform Party has 
stated that it supports harmonization. Does the Reform Party want 
to deal with the substance of the issue or in fact deal with what 
Canadians want?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
member knows that the Liberals ran on the promise to scrap the 
GST. That is the only reason many of them are here today. Not only 
that, they fought the Mulroney-Wilson plan to hide the GST. They 
called it a job killer. Now the revenue minister is saying it is a job 
creator. They laughed at the Tory attempt to harmonize the GST. 
The member for York South-Weston was right: power does 
change people.
<P>
	If the GST was bad then, why is it not bad now? Are the Liberals 
saying that Brian Mulroney was right?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
when the Reform Party said that it supported harmonization in its 
response to the finance minister, were Reformers saying that Brian 
Mulroney was right?
<P>
	The fact is that at the time the Tories did it we talked about it. We 
were in the middle of a depression. They brought in a tax that was 
not harmonized and no sufficient attempt was made to do so.
<P>
	We have brought in fundamental tax reform in Atlantic Canada, 
something that is going to give Atlantic Canadians a far greater 
chance to export and to create jobs. We have set in place a process 
that is going to allow other provinces to come in. We are in the 
process of changing the nature of fiscal federalism for the benefit 
of this country. The Reform Party ought to deal with the substance 
of it.

	<B>Mr. Yvan Bernier (Gaspé, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, a clear consensus 
emerged, during parliamentary consultations, against the fee 
structure proposed by the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans for 
coast guard services. All those concerned find it irresponsible on 
the minister's part to impose these fees without conducting 
complete and serious studies on their impact on the marine 
industry.
<P>
	Can the minister tell us if he intends to go along with the 
consensus of those who are asking for a moratorium on the marine 
service fees until complete and independent economic impact 
studies have been carried out?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Fred Mifflin (Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, as the hon. member knows, the imposition of the 
marine services fee stems from the 1995 budget approved by 
Parliament based on the principle of user pay.
<P>
	The idea of how the fee could be implemented was put forward 
by the Marine Advisory Board. There were 800 people or 
thereabouts involved in the consultations which involved ports 
officials and every major industry in the seagoing industry.
<P>
	The hon. member joined his colleagues from Parliament on the 
fisheries committee to hear the views of many witnesses. The hon. 
member is right; the committee made recommendations but the 
consensus was not that there be a moratorium. The committee did 
express some reservations with respect to the impact studies. I have 
to tell the House that I will respect its opinions. The impact studies 
will be carried out after the services fee is implemented at the 
lowest possible level of collection of $20 million a year before we 
get to the higher levels.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Yvan Bernier (Gaspé, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I will try again. 
Does the minister agree that, far from helping the economy, his 
draft regulations will result in marine traffic going to American 
ports, which means jobs moving to the United States and an 
increase in the number of the unemployed in eastern Canadian 
ports, particularly those along the St. Lawrence River?

<P>
	<B>Hon. Fred Mifflin (Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, the hon. member is coming up with some far-fetched 
unsubstantiated ideas.
<P>
	The hon. member knows because he has heard it often in 
committee and this House that the cost overall at the $20 million 
level is going to represent one-sixtieth of one per cent of the value 
of the goods itself. It is going to represent less than 10 per cent of 
what it costs the coast guard to maintain these services. It is going 
to cost less than three per cent of the overall value of the business 
of doing shipments in the ports of Canada. I think that is fair and 
equitable.

system. We think Mrs. Lynch is in conflict of interest since she is 
also the one who hears the grievances filed by police officers.
<P>
	Now that the government has had 24 hours to check things out, I 
would like to repeat the question I put to the  Prime Minister. Can 
the Prime Minister explain why the RCMP granted Mrs. Lynch a 
one year contract worth $176,000 to review the current grievance 
system, when her duties require her to remain absolutely neutral 
toward both parties?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Nick Discepola (Parliamentary Secretary to Solicitor

grievance settlement process is one of Mrs. Lynch's initiatives. It is 
part of the consultations between senior management and 
employees of the RCMP.
<P>
	I can tell the House that the RCMP agrees that these 
consultations and this new approach are better suited to the needs 
of the RCMP.

the parliamentary secretary for his answer, but I have a 
supplementary question.
<P>
	Besides an ethics problem, we are faced here with a process 
problem, since the call for tender contained specific requirements 
tailor made for Mrs. Lynch. Would the parliamentary secretary not 
agree that the contract was awarded following a rigged advanced 
contract award notice, as the hon. member for

<P>

the calculation is made province by province depending on the

in New Brunswick would save between $225 and $250 per  year.

Similar numbers could be given for the provinces of Nova Scotia

	In addition, consumers will benefit enormously because they 
will no longer have the cascading effect of embedded taxes built in 
which are the real hidden taxes consumers will no longer have to 
pay because business will be getting the input credits. In fact, 
consumers will be the great beneficiaries of all of this.
<P>

per tonne of fish landed. In Norway it is $85 per tonne of fish 
landed. In Canada it is $455 per tonne of fish landed. In spite of this 
massive expenditure, DFO has been unable either to predict or 
prevent the fisheries crises on both coasts.
<P>
	As the fisheries minister is demanding a 50 per cent reduction in 
the B.C. salmon fleet, is he going to cut his bureaucracy by 50 per 
cent as well?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Fred Mifflin (Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I want to tell the hon. member that in view of 
Reform's position on the GST and what is taking place with that, I 
am delighted that Reform is interested in having the government 
cut down its operations.,
<P>
	In the last year the Department of Fisheries and Oceans has 
undergone quite a cut through program review. While we have not 
reached 50 per cent, the department I represent is cutting by over 
40 per cent. That is not a bad perspective from where I sit.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mike Scott (Skeena, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the minister talks 
about cuts. The government has cut the salmon hatcheries in 
British Columbia in the face of a crisis.
<P>
	The minister's new licensing policy has nothing whatsoever to 
do with conservation. It does not put the fish first and it certainly 
does not put B.C.'s coastal communities first. Over all, fish 
harvesting capacity will remain the same, just concentrated in 
fewer hands.
<P>
	Will the minister guarantee when his new licensing policy fails 
to reduce the total fish harvest in B.C. and after he has sacrificed 
the futures of fishermen in B.C. coastal communities, that he and 
his government will accept responsibility for that?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Fred Mifflin (Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, when the member talks about coastal communities 
and economic viability and capacity  reduction, he knows very well 
he is talking about an industry that is in very poor shape. There are 
fishermen over the last few years who have lost much money. This 
year over 50 per cent are expected to lose money. The industry 
itself is expected to lose around $10 million. He is talking about an 
industry that is in trouble.
<P>
<B>(1455)</B>
<P>
	I have to tell the member that the plan which is represented by 
the Pacific salmon revitalization program stemmed from a 
committee report of stakeholders of the commercial fisheries, the 
aboriginal fisheries, the recreational fisheries, the coastal 
communities and the province of British Columbia. They made 27 
recommendations and we moved on them.
<P>
	The member asked me if I was going to be responsible for the 
plan. I will take responsibility for this plan. Will Reformers take 
responsibility for the fact that they have no plan?

	<B>Mr. Pierre de Savoye (Portneuf, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, yesterday 
the Minister of Industry admitted in this House that with respect to 
direct to home satellite services, and I quote: ``There might be a 
potential problem for consumers-consumers must examine their 
options very carefully before they buy''. But under the legislation, 
the Minister of Industry has responsibility for technological 
development, as well as protecting the consumer public.
<P>
	Since the minister does not intend to follow up on the 
recommendation made to him by my colleague from 
Rimouski-Témiscouata that there be an information campaign on 
the real risks of buying a satellite dish and a decoder, does the 
minister intend to follow up on the suggestion from Quebec's 
culture minister, Mrs. Beaudoin, that direct to home satellite 
businesses be encouraged to rent their equipment rather than sell it, 
in order to protect the consumer?
<P>
	<B>Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry, Minister for the 
Atlantic Canada Opportunities Agency, Minister of Western 
Economic Diversification and Minister responsible for the 
Federal Office of Regional Development-Quebec, Lib.): </B>Mr. 
Speaker, as the hon. member very well knows, technology is 
changing rapidly in the broadcasting sector. It is always possible 
that technological changes will mean that equipment bought by 
consumers is rendered unusable.
<P>
	The most important thing for the consumer is to take the time to 
do a bit of research before buying. But they know very well, and I 
believe Mrs. Beaudoin knows it too, that regulating retail sales to 
consumers comes under provincial jurisdiction.

	One of his biggest worries was whether he would need a blood

new survey indicates that only 7 per cent of Canadians would 
accept a transfusion if they had a choice. The confidence in our 
blood system is slipping away from us.

of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I begin by expressing the hope that 
the hon. member's father recovers quickly from surgery. I know I 
speak for all of my colleagues in saying that.
<P>
	Let us focus on confidence in Canada's blood system. The very 
reason the Minister of Health appointed the Krever inquiry, the 
very reason this government extended its term and increased its 
budget and the reason this government brought evidence before the 
inquiry was to ensure that a thorough and complete evaluation of 
the blood system would be carried out so that we would have the 
benefit of Mr. Justice Krever's recommendations to get the system 
right.
<P>
	It is true to say that justice lawyers are in federal court for a 
hearing on May 22 in relation to procedural matters. We are there 
not to interfere with Mr. Justice Krever's work, not to delay it or to 
complicate it, we are there on specific questions of procedural 
fairness that are important points of principle.
<P>
	We have asked the court to expedite the hearing. We hope it will 
be over quickly. We want the report completed. We look forward to 
the findings, whether they be findings of fault or otherwise. We 
want to get the blood system back where it should be and the 
confidence of Canadians restored.

	The House resumed of the motion, the amendment, and the 
amendment to the amendment.
<P>
<B>(1505 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ian McClelland (Edmonton Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, for the benefit of those at home who have not been 
following this debate, once in a while there is a debate that speaks 
to the very heart of what Parliament is all about and what the world 
parliament should all be about and how we relate one to another.
<P>
	The Bloc put forward a motion today that would call on the 
Government of Canada to use the word genocide in condemnation 
of what transpired primarily in the years around 1915 by the Turks, 
addressed primarily to the Armenians.
<P>
	The motion was amended by the Liberals to take the word 
genocide out. Liberals opposite would concur with the notion that 
genocide did take place but for political reasons cannot use the 
word genocide. Our position was to insert the word genocide in a 
subamendment so as to be true to the meaning the Bloc originally 
put forward.
<P>
	This is a particularly important debate. While the events took 
place many years ago and half way around the world, they affect 
each and every one of us every day.
<P>
	A couple of years ago I was at a dinner party. A person there, 
now in his sixties, a great raconteur, was regaling us with stories of 
his youth. He name is Jack Cohen. He was telling us of the time 
when he was in an orphanage in Montreal. When he was four years 
old he and his twin brother saw this great man come into the 
orphanage to pick out a child. They knew, just like a bunch of 
puppies I guess, they had to get up and catch the attention of the 
person coming into the orphanage if they were to get a home.
<P>
	He and his brother were a little older than some of the other 
children in the orphanage. When this man came in each of them 
grabbed Jack Cohen's father by the leg and would not let go.
<P>
	We were laughing about the word picture of these two little boys 
holding on to this man who had been sent to Montreal from 
Edmonton get a little girl, as it turns out. They would not let go. 
When he came home he was telling how his mother found she had 
twin boys rather than a little girl.
<P>
	It was one of those stories that we laugh at but inside in our 
hearts we are kind of crying at the tragedy that caused this to take 
place. It is funny because of the ability of Jack as a storyteller to 
make what is really a tragic story palatable and something that we 
could understand.
<P>
	Jack and his brother were not alone. There were thousands and 
thousands of children just like him who were survivors of the death 
camps. Every relative Jack and his twin brother had was 
exterminated. Because they were twins they were put into a special 
compound and for one reason or another they managed to survive. 
What does this have to do with the debate at hand? How do we get 
to that?
<P>
<B>(1510)</B>
<P>
	We get to it because of the notion of denial. This is the elemental 
concern behind the government's position and why the government 
is in great difficulty voting for this motion when it incorporates the 
word genocide. Even though the Governments of Quebec and 
Ontario in 1980 passed unanimous motions stating the Turkish 
government should be made to recognize what had gone on, when 
we as a government aid and abet a denial we are participating in the 
cover-up.
<P>
	I know Canadians do not want to be part of it. I am sure the vast 
majority of Turks today would not want to be part of a cover-up. 
The only way we can possibly learn from history is to recognize it 
and go on from there.
<P>
	For people watching not all that familiar about the events that 
took place, let me go back through a bit of history. This really did 
not start in 1915. It started even before the late 1800s. The Chinese 
built a great wall to protect themselves from the Ottoman hordes, 
as they are described. The Armenians had been occupying that part 
of the world for 3000 years. The Turks came into that part of the 
world and began moving them out. It really started to take 
definition in the late 1800s.
<P>
	In 1915 all men between 16 and 60 were drafted into the army. 
There being two sides to every story, and there always is a shade of 
grey, it is important to understand that the Turks' position is that 
the Armenians joined the Russians and were fighting with the 
Russians against the Turks. That is why the genocide took place. 
That is why they were moved out and moved offshore.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1848"> 1848 </A></B>
<P>
	There is a good deal of dispute about the exact numbers. 
However, does it matter if it was 1.5 million, 1 million or 800,000? 
If it was one it was one too many. Genocide, as defined by <I>The 
Concise Oxford Dictionary</I> is the mass extermination of human 
beings, especially of a particular race or nation. Any mass 
slaughter is by definition genocide. One cannot whitewash 
genocide. We cannot use words to make it sound better. Genocide 
is genocide.
<P>
	The ground zero of the genocide that took place against the 
Armenians in Turkey is when, on April 24, 1915, the interior 
minister of Turkey said in 50 years the only Armenians will be in 
museums.
<P>
	Today all that remains in Turkey of the Armenians, who were the 
people who were there first, are between 30,000 and 50,000, most 
in Istanbul. Today the situation in Turkey for the Armenians left is 
such that when their churches, schools and cultural institutions 
need repair the Armenians must apply to the interior ministry of 
Turkey to have them repaired.
<P>
<B>(1515 )</B>
<P>
	What is the link between my story of Jack Cohen and the 
situation that exists today? It is this. Hitler, when asked before the 
holocaust what would mankind say in light of what he was doing, 
responded: ``Who remembers the Armenians?'' The genocide 
against the Armenians was the foundation of other genocides to 
come. It was the foundation for the mass extermination of the Jews 
of Europe.
<P>
	What is so chilling, so frightening, so repulsive about what is 
going on in our world today and how does it link to the genocide 
perpetrated against the Armenians? In my view the link is denial.
<P>
	Who will speak for all of the dead? Who will speak for those 
who will die in future genocides if we do not recognize and honour 
those who died before us? In my view it is the denial of what took 
place that is the most reprehensible aspect of what is before us 
today. We know we cannot change history. We know we cannot 
reverse the hands of time. We know that what happened, happened. 
We know that Canada has a relationship with Turkey today. We 
know and understand that the vast majority of people in Turkey had 
nothing to do with what happened in 1915 and would be just as 
repulsed today as we are.
<P>
	Basically people are good, but genocide goes on day after day all 
around the world. We do not seem to learn from our mistakes. 
Perhaps that is because in one way or another we try to pretend that 
it does not exist because it is just too hard to bear.
<P>
	That is what is going on in Canada and around the world with the 
holocaust denial. That is why it is so important that light is brought 
to this situation so that those who went before us are not forgotten.
<P>
	In Canada, even as we speak, people deny the holocaust. They 
say it was impossible. How could mankind be so cruel? How could 
a cultured and enlightened people perpetrate such a horror against 
mankind, such a horror against the Jews and others, but specifically 
against the Jews? How could the people of a whole nation turn their 
eyes or not see it?
<P>
	Perhaps there is a germ of a reason for that in what is happening 
today. Perhaps we do not believe what we do not want to believe. 
Let me give an example of what is going on today in holocaust 
denial and link it to the events which took place in 1915 in Turkey.
<P>
	The people at the Ecole polytechnique in Montreal and the 
University of Montreal will shortly hear a speaker. There will be at 
Ecole polytechnique a conference sponsored by 15 Muslim 
organizations. The person speaking is a revisionist historian and 
anti-Semite, Roger Garaudy. This person is coming to these two 
institutions. He has a right in a free society to express his views.
<P>
<B>(1520 )</B>
<P>
	The problem is that when someone in a free society is able to 
expound his revisionist theories which are generally known to be 
untrue and does so as an academic, that person puts a cloak of 
respectability on history which was not there before.
<P>
	We live in a free society and people have the right to say what 
they will, provided they are not spreading hate propaganda. The 
fact is these revisionists, these people who are rewriting history, 
must be challenged and challenged at every opportunity. If we do 
not, we run a risk. What will certainly happen is that we will repeat 
the mistakes we made in the past.
<P>
	I would like to conclude my comments with this thought: 
Anything that diminishes any one of us as a human being hurts and 
diminishes all of us. We are all human beings. Regardless of our 
gender, skin colour, sexual orientation we are all human beings. We 
are all children of the same God. When any one of us is diminished 
we are all diminished.
<P>
	It is desperately important that every time violations of human 
rights occur, for example, the revisionists who deny history, who 
try to change history and cloak what actually happened with some 
sort of respectability, or the apologists for something that is beyond 
apology, then others must stand up and tell the truth of what 
happened. We cannot pretend it did not happen. It is important for 
our grandchildren that we are aware of the foundation and where 
we came from.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Sarkis Assadourian (Don Valley North, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I appreciate the comments made by the hon. member from 
the Reform Party.
<P>
	Why does the hon. member think that the Turkish government 
today, 81 years after the fact of the genocide,  still denies the crime 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1849"> 1849 </A></B>
<P>
that its ancestors committed in 1915? Why does Turkey not follow 
the example set by Germany to accept the responsibility and 
address the issue? No matter what kind of resolutions we pass in 
this House or any Parliament in this country, the responsibility 
remains: The Turkish government has to accept responsibility.
<P>
	Why does Turkey up until now, 81 years after the fact, still 
refuse to accept responsibility for 1915?
<P>
	<B>Mr. McClelland:</B> Mr. Speaker, that question speaks to the nub of 
what is going on here today. It also speaks to the difficult position 
the government is in.
<P>
	I am quite certain that the vast majority of members opposite 
would like to support a resolution which includes the word 
genocide, but do not because of geopolitics or whatever.
<P>
	As I understand it, the Government of Turkey would go a long 
way to address the problems concerning this by recognizing what 
has taken place. Turkey applied three years ago for admission into 
the European community and was refused admission because it has 
not recognized its complicity in the events of the genocide of 1915.
<P>
<B>(1525 )</B>
<P>
	That was a condition of entry into the European community and 
Turkey will not do it. It will not because it feels that they were 
wartime casualties and that no deliberate mass slaughter took 
place. Turkey says that the Armenians who died had aligned 
themselves with Russia, were enemies of Turkey and that the 
relocation of Armenians who perished, because the relocation took 
place in the winter, had been collaborators in the Russian army. 
There is also concern that by admitting guilt or by admitting 
complicity the Turks would be leaving themselves open to 
judgments or to claims against them.
<P>
	I believe the very best thing the Government of Turkey can do at 
this time is to say: ``We were wrong. We would never do that again. 
It is a blight on our history. We recognize it as being wrong''. That 
is exactly what the German government has done.
<P>
	I attended a wedding on the weekend. The minister said there are 
nine words which should never be forgotten in making a marriage 
work and last. At least six of those words could be used in our 
relations with other countries and six of those words could be used 
by the Government of Turkey in addressing the Armenians. Those 
nine words were: ``I am sorry. Please forgive me. I love you''. I 
suspect, as the minister said in conducting the marriage service, 
that if the Government of Turkey were to say to the Armenian 
community: ``I am sorry. Please forgive what has happened and let 
us live together in peace,'' it would be the beginning of a first step 
to a new future.

<P>
	<B>Mr. Maurice Bernier (Mégantic-Compton-Stanstead, 
BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, you are indicating that I have one minute left to 
ask a question or make a brief comment. I will comment the 
question and then go back to my colleague for Edmonton 
Southwest regarding the member for Don Valley North. I find it 
odd that he should put such a question to our Reform colleague; he 
should have put it to the government since the government, through 
the Secretary of State for Multiculturalism, moved an amendment 
to the motion we brought forward, with a view to considering not 
so much the genocide of Armenians as the tragedy it represents.
<P>
	The problem today is on the government side. We agree with the 
member for Don Valley North that pressure should be brought to 
bear on the Turkish government to get it to recognize the genocide 
of Armenians and take measures to right, if possible, the wrongs 
done to this community.
<P>
	As far as my colleague for Edmonton Southwest is concerned, I 
want first to congratulate him on his speech. Liberal members like 
to depict Reform members as right-wing. My colleague, who also 
sits on the human rights committee, has taken a perfectly correct 
position and shown how important human rights are for him and 
how important it is not to make any compromise in this respect.
<P>
	My question goes along the same lines. I would like my 
colleague to tell us what his position and his party's position are 
with regard to human rights and international trade.
<P>
<B>(1530)</B>
<P>
	How far should Canada go in making concessions? Should it 
make any at all? For my part, I believe it should make none, but in 
his opinion, how far should the government go in making 
concessions regarding human rights and international trade?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. McClelland:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague for the kind 
words.
<P>
	The only way we can possibly affect the way a particular country 
might work within its own borders as far as human rights are 
concerned is if we have a dialogue. There are situations in which if 
all countries work in unison we may be able to force an issue as far 
as human rights are concerned. We have far more to gain by 
ensuring that we can work with a country to somehow imbue that 
country with our notion of what is correct and right as far as human 
rights are concerned.
<P>
	When the situation is one where a ruler or a regime goes beyond 
what is right, then the only way Canada can show it will not 
participate or will not countenance a particular situation is to cut 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1850"> 1850 </A></B>
<P>
off trade and dissociate itself  from that. As long as there is the 
possibility of improving the relationship with a particular country 
then I think we have the right and the responsibility to trade and 
work with it while constantly trying to improve its human rights 
record. If it cannot and will not be done, then we have a moral 
responsibility to have nothing to do with that country.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Francis G. LeBlanc (Parliamentary Secretary to 
Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, we have before 
us today an important motion calling for the commemoration of the 
tragic events of April 1915 in Armenia. The motion asks the House 
to recognize the week of April 20 to 27 of each year as the week to 
commemorate man's inhumanity to man.
<P>
	The proposed motion refers to the concept of genocide, a 
concept relatively recent as to form and content. In fact it was 
defined and codified only in 1948, when the convention on the 
prevention and punishment of the crime of genocide was adopted.
<P>
	We do acknowledge that the Armenian community was 
victimized and that Armenian people were killed in 1915, but we 
must remain cautious in defining those events with a concept that 
was coined and codified only years later.
<P>
	Also, the Turkish government of today is not the Ottoman 
empire of yesterday, which was responsible for the killings. The 
word ``genocide'' entails specific obligations, as stated in the 
provisions of the international convention.
<P>
	The question is, if this House were to acknowledge that the 
concept applies to the events of 1915, could that bring about an 
obligation to some form of compensation for historical prejudice? I 
applaud today's motion because it forces all Canadians to reflect 
upon history.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	It is difficult to imagine anything positive resulting from the 
horrific events that marked the first half of this century. The 
tremendous loss of millions of innocent victims such as the 
Armenians in April 1915 continues to haunt us today. Perhaps 
however the victims of these calamities did not suffer and die in 
vain. From their courage and our collective shame has emerged a 
strong legacy, the recognition of human rights as a duty of all 
states.
<P>
	Grounded in the universal declaration of human rights adopted 
by the United Nations in 1948, this legacy has led to an impressive 
collection of human rights instruments. These documents set out 
the rights of the individual and equally important, the 
corresponding duties of states to respect, protect and promote those 
rights.
<P>
<B>(1535)</B>
<P>
	Why should Canadians care about human rights in far off places? 
Human rights violations affect us all. They undermine our basic 
humanity and prevent us as a global society from progressing. 
Equally important, when these abuses reach widespread and 
systemic levels, our own security is threatened. The Minister of 
Foreign Affairs said it best during his recent statement to the 
United Nations Commission on Human Rights:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>If we turn away from the desolation and dismay of human suffering, if we fail 
to stop hatred from flowing through the channels of our new electronic 
networks, if we do not care about the present or future of vulnerable children, if 
we do not stand up to the despots and bullies, if we do not counter the capricious 
and arbitrary actions of authoritarian governments with no legitimacy beyond 
weaponry and terror, then we will face the harsh consequences down the road.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	It is therefore very much in the interests of Canadians to work to 
prevent human rights abuses throughout the world so as to avoid 
the kinds of tragic events we have heard described in the House. If 
we compare the protection of human rights today with the situation 
of 80 years ago when the Armenian massacre occurred, we see 
tremendous progress.
<P>
	Drawing inspiration from the universal declaration, numerous 
international treaties and principles have been adopted. The two 
international covenants represent the most important of these, but 
the many other instruments address specific fundamental human 
rights concerns, everything from genocide and torture to the rights 
of women, children and the disabled.
<P>
	These instruments have broadened the scope of human rights and 
have enhanced protection for all of us. The task of defining and 
codifying human rights is largely complete although important 
areas remain to be addressed, such as human rights defenders and 
the rights of indigenous people.
<P>
	We must recognize that the framework of human rights 
instruments is not in itself sufficient to protect us from the scourge 
of human rights abuses. We need only look at the events in the 
former Yugoslavia and Rwanda among others to acknowledge that 
humanity still has failed to rid itself of acts of barbarism and 
hatred. The Canadian government is firmly committed to finding 
lasting solutions to these problems.
<P>
	As a recognized leader in the human rights field internationally, 
Canada has worked to develop the institutions and machinery to 
ensure that human rights recognized on paper are respected in 
reality. In organizations such as the United Nations, the 
Commonwealth, la Francophonie, the Organization of American 
States and the Organization for Security and Co-operation in 
Europe, Canada has and continues to play an active role in 
advancing the human rights agenda.
<P>
	One of the most important developments in recent years is the 
creation of the office of the United Nations  High Commissioner 
for Human Rights. Responsible for the co-ordination of all human 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1851"> 1851 </A></B>
<P>
rights activities within the UN system, the high commissioner is 
poised to play an influential role in strengthening protection of 
human rights.
<P>
	Although severely underfunded, the creation of the post has 
already had a salutary effect. In the aftermath of the Rwanda crisis, 
the high commissioner was able to mobilize a team of human rights 
monitors and establish them on the ground. Despite some initial 
problems, the human rights mission has helped to improve the 
situation for Rwandans, both in the country and in the refugee 
camps. Canada played an important role in the establishment of 
this mission.
<P>
	Recently the Minister of Foreign Affairs announced a further 
contribution of $500,000 to support the human rights field 
operations in Rwanda. A separate grant of $300,000 was also 
announced by the minister for a similar program in the former 
Yugoslavia. These operations of the high commissioner are critical 
for they represent the first forays into the areas of early warning 
conflict prevention and post-conflict peacekeeping.
<P>
	The ability of the United Nations and specifically the high 
commissioner for human rights to place observers and monitors on 
the ground should go a long way toward identifying the root causes 
of gross violations of human rights and to play a role in finding 
solutions to these problems.
<P>
<B>(1540 )</B>
<P>
	These monitoring operations can and should play the role of the 
eyes of the international community, alerting the world to potential 
disasters in the making. In so doing they can hopefully provide 
sufficient time to allow the United Nations or other bodies to 
prevent or minimize human rights abuses.
<P>
	A key element of the field operations is human rights education 
and training of the military, police and other important actors. 
Breaking down the culture of violence is fundamental to finding 
lasting solutions. Through education and training, the UN is 
seeking to create an ingrained respect for the rule of law among 
those in places of authority. The goal is laudable but it is 
impossible to achieve in the world's troubled areas unless the 
international community devotes greater resources to the UN's 
human rights program.
<P>
	Canada is doing its part even as we work to put our own financial 
house in order. The challenge for Canada is to maintain its 
commitment and convince other states of the critical importance of 
supporting the UN high commissioner.
<P>
	Monitoring and training are but one part of the efforts to prevent 
gross violations of human rights. A second important factor is for 
the international community to send a clear signal to the 
perpetrators of human rights abuses that their transgressions will 
no longer be  tolerated. The tribunals established to deal with war 
criminals in the former Yugoslavia and in Rwanda are an important 
start. Already a number of persons have been charged and 
prosecutions are expected to commence in the near future.
<P>
	As critical as these tribunals are, they remain ad hoc bodies 
established to deal with the circumstances arising from two tragic 
events. Will the necessary political will exist to establish similar 
bodies should these types of events happen elsewhere?
<P>
	To avoid the problem of attempting to develop solutions in the 
immediate aftermath of an incident, the world community today is 
considering the establishment of a permanent international 
criminal court to deal with war criminals. Negotiations on the court 
have commenced under UN auspices. While the negotiations are 
difficult, Canada, which is playing an active role, is hopeful that a 
positive outcome can be achieved. Once established, the court will 
stand as a monument to the international community's resolve to 
fight barbarism and to punish those who would shock the 
conscience of the world.
<P>
	As regards Armenia, Canada is a friend of Armenia. Although 
this country is only four years old, Canada has been working to 
help Armenia deal with the problems of nation building and to 
resolve the difficulties which that country and that society have had 
to deal with in the early stages of its nationhood.
<P>
	For example, Canada has supported Armenia in dealing with the 
ravages of an earthquake in the Leninakan region in 1988 and has 
been contributing to finding a solution to the debilitating war in the 
Nagorno-Karabakh which has extracted a terrible toll on the people 
of the region and has aggravated the difficulties of building that 
nation in that region.
<P>
	I have spoken at length on human rights. I cannot overemphasize 
their importance in preventing the kinds of situations we are 
discussing today: the massacres, ethnic cleansing and other 
egregious acts such as the Armenian tragedy of 1915, that have 
occurred in the past and which we have again recently witnessed, 
all started with isolated violations of human rights.
<P>
	Would the situations in Rwanda and the former Yugoslavia have 
occurred as they did if international human rights institutions had 
been in place to alert and the international community ready and 
willing to act effectively to protect the victims of the initial human 
rights violations? We may never know, but the chances are that 
some lives and some communities could have been spared the 
suffering they endured. We owe it to them, to past victims of 
widespread transgressions and to ourselves to do what we can to 
ensure that these atrocities do not happen again.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1852"> 1852 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1545)</B>
<P>
	Through its continued active participation in the UN and other 
international bodies, and through our support for human rights 
institutions such as the office of the UN high commissioner for 
human rights, Canada can make a difference.
<P>
	I salute the Bloc Quebecois motion. At the same time, to fully 
give justice to all those, first among them the Armenians who by 
birth or ancestry have been victimized by the inhumanity of war 
and oppression, I call on the House to join with the government in 
supporting an amendment which will proclaim the week of April 
20 to 27 each year as the week to remember the inhumanity of 
people toward one another.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Maurice Bernier (Mégantic-Compton-Stanstead, 
BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I listened carefully to the remarks made by my 
colleague from Cape Breton Highlands-Canso. He referred to all 
the decisions made by Canada to participate in peacekeeping 
missions. He ended his speech by reminding us of Canada's great 
friendship with Armenia, but his last words reflected his 
government's tendency to play down the importance of the 1915 
events and to dodge the real issue, namely the 1915 genocide of the 
Armenian people.
<P>
	Since my colleague has established a link with the first world 
war, as though it were the only motive for trying to exterminate a 
whole people, I would like him to elaborate on this.
<P>
	My question concerns international trade. I would like our 
colleague to tell us to what extent Canada, or its government, must 
overlook human rights in order to maintain trade relations with any 
country that abuses human rights?
<P>
	<B>Mr. LeBlanc (Cape Breton Highlands-Canso):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
I thank the Bloc member for his question. Canada does not deny 
what occurred in 1915. However, the term ``genocide'' is very 
specific in international law and was defined only later. It became 
part of the international corpus of human right legislation only 
later, and the Government of Canada feels that this is not the term 
to use to describe tragedies, massacres or events which occurred 
earlier in history.
<P>
	It goes without saying that we live in an imperfect world and, 
throughout history, many events showed man's inhumanity to man. 
Canada is at the forefront of nations to create a structure which, in 
the future, will limit if not eliminate such events. We want to create 
a sense of respect for human rights, whether in the former 
Yugoslavia, in Rwanda or elsewhere, to make sure that we 
remember the lessons of history and do not repeat them.
<P>
<B>(1550)</B>
<P>
	This is what the policy of the Canadian government aims to do. 
We want to ensure that, without necessarily always looking back, 
we move forward by creating a sense of respect for human rights. 
We must work at the international level to create structures that 
will allow us to anticipate problems. We must prevent massacres 
which, unfortunately, continue to occur in certain parts of the 
world. Over time, by working together as members of the 
international community, we hope to gradually eliminate such 
tragedies.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Sarkis Assadourian (Don Valley North, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I fully express support on this motion of course. Will the 
Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Foreign Affairs agree 
with me that because of the geographic location of Turkey and 
Armenia, adjacent to one another, practically neighbours, it would 
be better for Turkey to address this issue once and for all and have a 
good friendly relationship with Armenia for the future? This is a 
stumbling block for developing a good relationship in the region.
<P>
	Would the parliamentary secretary agree with me that if Turkey 
accepts responsibility it would enhance the relationship between 
Armenia and Turkey so they can go forward building the Armenian 
republic again?
<P>
	<B>Mr. LeBlanc (Cape Breton Highlands-Canso):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
it is not a question I can answer on behalf of Turkey. I certainly 
hope the Government of Turkey would be willing to do whatever 
necessary to improve relations with its neighbours, including 
Armenia, and would work in their bilateral relations.
<P>
	Armenia is now a nation state, like Turkey. I hope they would 
work collectively in the organizations of which they are both 
members, notably the Organization for Security and Co-operation 
in Europe, other organizations in Europe as well a the United 
Nations, to enable their societies to develop progressively together, 
notwithstanding the tragedies that have occurred in the past.
<P>
	Naturally Canada would support that and would want to 
encourage both sides to improve their relations and to do whatever 
is necessary to get over this historical conflict between the two 
peoples.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am deeply touched by the motion put forward by the 
hon. member for Ahuntsic, who has been very active over the years 
within the Armenian community.
<P>
	When we talk about the concept of crimes against humanity, it is 
crucial to remember the profound significance of what they 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1853"> 1853 </A></B>
<P>
represent. However, to define  these actions does not explain this 
kind of almost inhumane behaviour.
<P>
	I would like to quote the definition given by the Liberal member 
for Don Valley North, Sarkis Assadourian, last April when he 
moved a motion similar to the one now before the House. ``The 
first time this term was used was in the London Charter of 1945, 
the structure and basis for prosecution of major war crimes before 
the international tribunal at Nuremberg. Crime against humanity 
presents a distinct category of international crimes. Article 6(c) of 
the charter defines crimes against humanity as murder, 
extermination, enslavement, deportation and other inhumane acts 
committed against any civilian population before or during the 
war; or persecution on political, racial or religious grounds in 
execution of all in connection with any crime within the 
jurisdiction of the tribunal whether or not in violation of the 
domestic laws of the country where the crime was perpetrated.''
<P>
<B>(1555)</B>
<P>
	So as to not downplay the cruelty of actions taken against 
civilians, it is essential to remember, at least during the 
commemorative week, that behind these words are people, friends 
and faces.
<P>
	On April 16, 1984, the People's Tribunal concluded that the 
Armenian genocide occurred in 1915 and 1916. The UN, however, 
still does not recognize this well known fact because, according to 
a former Quebec justice minister, Herbert Marx, and I quote from 
the May 23, 1984 issue of<I> Le Devoir</I>: ``-because of the 
interventions of the Turkish government within the UN itself, the 
Armenian genocide is not yet officially recognized''. And yet we 
know that nearly 1.5 million Armenians were exterminated.
<P>
	The conspiracy of silence cannot go on, and these actions, as in 
the case of the Jewish people, must be recognized historically.
<P>
	Still today, in 1996, over 120 peoples are victims of armed 
oppression and all kinds of violence from ideological adversaries 
in religious, racial or political conflicts. The use of military or 
armed means to resolve human conflicts must be banned from the 
behaviour of all peoples on this earth.
<P>
	Canada must, through its democratic practices, continue to set an 
example and tirelessly condemn any resolution of conflict other 
than by peaceful, civilized and democratic means. These civilized 
means are part of the basic arsenal of peoples who respect human 
rights. Canada must take a stand and promote the resolution of 
human conflict by willpower, rather than by armed power.
<P>
	By remaining silent or declining to recognize even a simple 
week commemorating crimes of genocide, particularly those 
committed against the Armenian  people in 1915, Canada is 
encouraging the incomprehensible policy of letting time erode 
memory.
<P>
	This simple recognition is in no way comparable to the 
seriousness of these reprehensible actions, but for Canadians it 
represents an assurance that their country will never support 
peoples who use these vile means as national policy, whoever they 
may be.
<P>
	This symbolic gesture is significant for the entire international 
community and shows once again that Canada is among the great 
defenders of human rights. This symbolic gesture does not, 
however, have the same force of impact as a foreign policy that 
would, at all times, place human interests above trade interests. In 
fact, it is our foreign policy that leads us to think that the 
government will not support our motion; the proof is the 
amendment introduced for the same reasons that moved them to 
halt construction of a monument commemorating the genocide in 
Montreal this year. These reasons have to do with trade and can be 
found in the report of the joint committee reviewing Canadian 
foreign policy: non-interference and indifference. This report is 
quite revealing, with Canada systematically ignoring the 
importance of universal values of democracy and human rights.
<P>
	The government's recent dealings with its trade partners makes 
me fear the worst. Far worse than the rejection of our motion, I fear 
the rejection of human rights in the name of business. What are we 
to think when Craig Kielburger, a young Canadian defending the 
rights of children in India, calls our Prime Minister to reason?
<P>
<B>(1600)</B>
<P>
	What are we to make of the Prime Minister's silence regarding 
the war in Chechnya, which is cruelly affecting civilians, during 
the G-7 summit on nuclear and security matters held in Russia, 
when well-known organisations for the defence of human freedoms 
such as Doctors Without Borders were doing nothing less than 
calling this conflict ``the worst war in the world''.
<P>
	Such oversights, such silence are easier, and create no 
obligation. In a devious way they are promoting the violent 
resolution of human conflicts and oblivion. I hope I am wrong 
regarding the government's intentions, and that reason will allow 
us to have a collective memory so that we will never forget all these 
atrocities.
<P>
	To this effect, we, in the Bloc Quebecois, urge the present 
government to set aside one week commemorating man's 
inhumanity to man, on the occasion of the 81st anniversary of the 
Armenian genocide. Only then will we be able to truly say that 
Canada is a true champion of human rights.
<P>
	We remember the genocide of Armenians and we want 
everybody in Canada to remember it forever. This is the reason 
why we 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1854"> 1854 </A></B>
<P>
brought this motion forward. This is a  matter of respect for and 
friendship with the Armenian people and its history.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Sarkis Assadourian (Don Valley North, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it is a pleasure to see the Leader of the Opposition 
grandstanding on this very important human rights issue.
<P>
	I asked on three previous occasions if members of the Bloc 
Quebecois would undertake to write to their former leader, the 
premier of Quebec, Lucien Bouchard, and ask him to replace the 
monument which was reneged on by the mayor of Montreal after it 
was promised to the Armenian people and after he received their 
votes.
<P>
	Would he write a letter to the premier of Quebec, since he is so 
anxious to help build bridges between the Parti Quebecois, the Bloc 
Quebecois and minorities, ethnics and those who have the money? 
Would he undertake in this House on behalf of his party to ask the 
premier of Quebec to build a monument in Quebec City or 
Montreal in memory of the 1.5 million Armenians who died in the 
first genocide of this century?
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gauthier:</B> Mr. Speaker, the kind of debate we are having 
today should not give rise to acrimonious exchanges between the 
member and ourselves. All I want to say is this: How can they take 
advantage of such a debate to try to make the premier of Quebec 
bear the federal government's responsibility which it shares with 
the city of Montreal?
<P>
	The member should take advantage of this debate to remind his 
party that the motion brought forward by the Bloc Quebecois is a 
tribute to the Armenian people and bears witness to our respect and 
friendship, as I said earlier. This motion must not be amended. It 
must not be weakened.
<P>
	He who is of Armenian origin should convince his party that we 
cannot accept a diluted and watered down motion. We would like to 
have his support and the support of the government to pass this 
resolution as it stands, without being afraid of bearing witness to 
the Armenian genocide, not the Armenian tragedy.
<P>
	When you know the rules of the House, you are fully aware that 
soon we will be asked to vote on a sub-amendment moved by the 
Reform Party referring to the tragedy of the Armenian genocide, 
and we know that the government will vote against it. We are 
expecting it.
<P>
<B>(1605)</B>
<P>
	We are also aware that we will be asked to vote on a motion 
brought forward by the government, which mentions the Armenian 
tragedy instead of the Armenian genocide. There is a slight 
difference. We would like for everyone, including the member, to 
make sure the motion brought forward by the member for Ahuntsic 
is not weakened. For us it is absolutely essential that the  House 
clearly pay tribute and homage to the Armenian people, 
recognizing that Armenians were indeed the victims of a genocide.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Réal Ménard (Hochelaga-Maisonneuve, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, today, by tabling a motion urging us as parliamentarians 
to recognize the Armenian genocide regardless of partisan 
considerations, the official opposition wants to show clearly that it 
remembers and hopes to help increase public awareness of what is 
probably the greatest tragedy, the most unacceptable, the most 
intolerable, the most shameful thing that can happen in the life of a 
society. Genocide must be condemned as a totally unacceptable 
instrument of national policy.
<P>
	This is an extremely sad day in Canadian politics because we 
now know that there are hypocritical members in this Parliament. 
There are people who talk from both sides of their mouths. This is 
extremely sad, because we as parliamentarians had a rare 
opportunity to join together in reminding ourselves that violence 
has played too large a role in this century.
<P>
	The history of the Armenian people is that of a persistent, 
continuous determination to survive and assert themselves. 
Historic Armenia, the great Armenia, which stretched from the 
Black Sea to Mesopotamia, covered an area of 300,000 square 
kilometres.
<P>
	Armenia was independent until 1045, until the Middle Ages. 
Historiographers agree that what kept Armenia independent and 
united until the Middle Ages was its religion, its language and its 
settlement of ancestral lands. It is in the 19th century that the 
Armenians' world came crashing down.
<P>
	According to historians, three successive governments are to 
blame for the scattering and genocide of the Armenian community.
<P>
	Like the Armenian people, we remember the government of 
Hamid II. We also remember that, at the turn of the century, there 
was a hope for the future because of a democratic government, an 
apparently liberal government advocating greater freedom of 
speech, a government that could have been more sensitive to the 
Armenian community. However, the new Turkish government did 
not turn out that way. After the Republic of Armenia was 
proclaimed, one might have expected things to change, but they did 
not, which brings us to the events of 1915-17, when 1.5 million 
people died in the Armenian genocide.
<P>
	Let us stop for a moment to try to understand what could be 
happening in this Parliament today. We have a member who, since 
he was democratically elected by the people of Ahuntsic, has been 
an extraordinary ally of the Armenian community. We have, in the 
person of the hon. member for Ahuntsic, someone who has made us 
sensitive to what has been the very first genocide of the 20th 
century. Without any partisanship, this member is  calling on us, as 
parliamentarians, to remember. Why? Because by remembering, 
we avoid making the same mistakes over and over. I am convinced 
that all our fellow parliamentarians who will participate in this 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1855"> 1855 </A></B>
<P>
debate today will remember and want to remember, without 
acrimony or hostility, so that history does not repeat itself.
<P>
<B>(1610)</B>
<P>
	Why did this government not hesitate for a moment to release 
$500,000 to help set up a war crimes tribunal in the former 
Yugoslavia? This tribunal will not only try to understand what 
happened, but also to identify and take action against those 
responsible. I clearly recall sitting in this House as the 
parliamentary secretary to the Minister of Immigration made her 
speech, in which she indicated that this tribunal would have nine 
members, including a Canadian lawyer, and the word ``genocide'' 
was used without hesitation.
<P>
	The same with the recent events in Rwanda, although we were 
not afraid to take a lucid look at the situation in that particular case. 
We were not afraid to call things by their rightful name, seeing that, 
as parliamentarians, we believe in the power of words. Anyone 
who believes in the power of words is able to use the appropriate 
word. In this case, the word to use in our speeches-and we should 
say it loud and clear in a unanimous voice-is not tragedy, 
desolation, exaction or wrongdoing, it is genocide.
<P>
	Why is this government afraid, insecure all of sudden and 
carrying partisanship to the point of acting like a tartuffe and an 
hypocrite, by making all kinds of amendments to dilute a motion 
that would have made us grow in stature as parliamentarians. I will 
tell you why. And I do not think it takes a Ph.D. in political science 
to figure out what the members opposite are up to.
<P>
	We all know that Turkey is a middle power in the Middle East. 
We also know that Turkey plays a lead role, it is a key player within 
NATO. This government refuses to seize the opportunity to take its 
responsibilities and to truly promote human rights by calling a 
spade a spade.
<P>
	Do you think Armenians are proud of the Canadian government 
today? Do you think anyone working for non-profit organizations, 
in the international co-operation sector, or for any of the major 
international organizations responsible for the protection of human 
rights is proud of the hypocritical attitude of this government? No.
<P>
	A few days ago, I had the pleasure of attending the UN 
conference on human rights, in Geneva. The speeches made on that 
occasion by the Canadian delegation stressed how supportive and 
involved Canada was regarding any international mission that 
concerns human rights. Where is the consistency between being 
involved in any number of UN initiatives to promote human rights 
and being about to vote like this government?
<P>
	Some might say that, when it comes to history, all sorts of 
interpretations can be made. I will conclude by reminding you of 
something very important. In April 1984, the Permanent People's 
Tribunal was asked to answer the three following questions: Was 
the Armenian people a victim of deportation and massacre during 
the First World War? Second question: Do these events constitute a 
genocide? Third question: What were the consequences, both for 
the international community and for the parties involved?
<P>
<B>(1615)</B>
<P>
	The answer is as follows, and I conclude with that: The 
Permanent People's Tribunal, whose members could all have sat on 
the International court of justice, concluded that: ``Armenian 
populations were and are a people whose basic, individual and 
collective rights should or must be respected, in accordance with 
international law. The extermination of Armenian populations 
through deportation and massacre is an imprescriptible crime of 
genocide-genocide, Mr. Speaker-within the meaning of the 
convention of December 9, 1948''.
<P>
	The international law has spoken and the official opposition has 
taken its responsibilities. It is up to this government to show the 
integrity and the courage expected of it.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Maurice Bernier (Mégantic-Compton-Stanstead, 
BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I much appreciated, of course, the remarks of 
my colleague from Hochelaga-Maisonneuve. I commend him on 
so aptly reminding us of the importance of designating correctly by 
the term ``genocide'' what the Liberal government considers as a 
tragedy experienced by the Armenian people in 1915 and 1916.
<P>
	I would like to recall what I said this morning and I will put a 
question to my colleague along the lines-
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ménard:</B> And friend.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bernier (Mégantic-Compton-Stanstead): </B>And friend, 
notwithstanding, as he reminds me.
<P>
	I was saying this morning that there was an urgent need, with 
respect to Canada's role internationally, its role in the defence of 
rights and freedoms, not only to have consistent discourse, but not 
to leave room for any interpretation that would tend, in the view of 
humanity and of other countries, to diminish the importance 
Canada accords to human rights.
<P>
	When one looks at the amendment presented by the Liberal 
government to this opposition motion, one might well ask some 
serious questions. As my colleague has just mentioned, this is a 
way to play down the seriousness of a completely reprehensible act 
and almost to invite a certain tolerance of this type of event.
<P>
	If we want human rights to be respected internationally, we must 
send a clear message, because any departure from this line of 
conduct will certainly  have repercussions at home. As I have said, 
if Canada shows a form of tolerance for what should be 
condemned, sooner or later we will find ourselves in a similar 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1856"> 1856 </A></B>
<P>
situation. The danger is there. If we are less vigilant at home, it is 
our fellow citizens who will suffer.
<P>
	I am going to put my question to my colleague, because I know 
that many people would like to hear him again. It concerns human 
rights and international trade. I ask the question very seriously. I 
would like my colleague to tell us what he himself thinks of this: To 
what extent can a government make compromises, dishonest 
compromises, in order to establish or maintain trade relations with 
a country to the detriment of human rights?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ménard:</B> Mr. Speaker, you are surely as fond as I of the hon. 
member for Mégantic-Compton-Stanstead, and his questions, 
each one more brilliant than the last. Without a doubt the answer is 
one you would give yourself, Mr. Speaker, that there must be 
assurance that, in any circumstances, profit motives such as 
international trade must not take precedence over any 
permissiveness in the area of human rights violations. I believe that 
there has been sufficient unanimity today in this House for me to 
state that we recognize that international trade is a very important 
dimension of international life. We recognize that the history of 
Canada has been built on trade, but this must never lead us to 
neglect the vital importance of promoting human rights, as the 
Liberals have since they formed the government in October 1993.
<P>
<B>(1620)</B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bill Graham (Rosedale, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased 
to share my time with the member for Scarborough-Rouge River.
<P>
	We must see the debate we are having today in its historical 
context. I am supporting this motion and I am supporting the 
amendment proposed by the parliamentary secretary.
<P>
	The amendment seeks to place this human tragedy within its 
historical context and at the same time to place it in the context of 
what we as Canadians must do to recognize the historical reality of 
what has happened in this world in light of today's interdependent 
world in which we live and what we must do as active politicians 
both nationally and internationally to ensure these events do not 
occur again.
<P>
	That is the purpose of the government's motion. That is the 
purpose of the debate. I congratulate the Bloc Quebecois on 
bringing forward this motion because I think it is important.
<P>
	However, it is unfortunate the member for 
Hochelaga-Maisonneuve has suggested the government in 
proposing this amendment is trying to mix up this issue with 
commercial relations and other interests with  Turkey. That is not 
the purpose of this amendment, as I read it. Before I consider this 
issue I will provide some general observations on this matter.
<P>
	This was an enormous human tragedy. It fits within the context 
of other great tragedies, of killings of populations. There were 
those in Germany, Cambodia, Rwanda. Unfortunately the list in 
this century is all too long. For that reason it is important to have 
this recognition. A question we all must ask in the complicated 
world in which we live, a question posed in the New Testament, is 
who is my neighbour?
<P>
	The neighbour of yesterday were Armenians and the neighbour 
of a nearer yesterday was the Jewish population of Europe. The 
neighbours of a recent time were those in Cambodia. The 
neighbours of a more recent time were those in Rwanda and in 
Bosnia.
<P>
	If we lose sight of our common humanity we lose sight of what 
we are here to do as politicians. In so doing, we must not lose sight 
that we operate within a historical continuum, a historical 
framework and an institutional framework. It behoves us as 
members of Parliament to ensure it operates in this modern world. 
That is the reason I support the amendment.
<P>
	We need international institutions. We need a United Nations 
system, which the parliamentary secretary spoke of. I am proud to 
support the government, which has been actively pursuing a United 
Nations system which will ensure this does not happen again. Our 
troops are in Bosnia in support of the reason the government 
believes genocide should not be allowed to occur.
<P>
	It is not right for the Bloc Quebecois to say the government does 
not wish to address the issue of genocide. We are committing the 
resources of Canada, much to the criticism of the Reform Party, to 
ensure the stability of places in the world, to ensure this type of 
event cannot occur again. We have committed troops to Haiti to 
ensure this will not happen again. These are concrete measures 
which address this problem and which we must deal with. That is 
one aspect of the problem.
<P>
	Another is the aspect of an institutional framework of world 
government. We lack a legal system which would enable us to say 
that such and such a group is guilty of genocide and the ability to 
punish and deal with it. We are reaching toward that. It is still in an 
embryonic position.
<P>
<B>(1625)</B>
<P>
	This issue was debated at Nuremberg. When I taught public 
international law I taught the Nuremberg trials as establishing 
principles of international law. One must recognize those 
principles were forged at the end of the second world war by the 
victorious parties and imposed on the losing party in the conflict 
and as a result lack that universality which has subsequently 
developed since the second world war. We in Canada have played 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1857"> 1857 </A></B>
<P>
our part in  developing those principles which we can now look to 
for protecting human rights.
<P>
	My colleague, Professor Humphreys at McGill University, was 
one of the drafters of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. 
Thousands of Canadians have by their actions, in military actions 
such as IFOR and other military actions I spoke of earlier and in 
less dramatic situations, working at the United Nations, working in 
international commissions, sought to develop rules of law which 
will enable us to deal with the issue before us today.
<P>
	We must develop that issue. We must develop an international 
criminal court. I wish the Bloc Quebecois would address that issue. 
What lesson can we take from Armenia? The lesson that we must 
take is that we need international institutions, legal institutions 
which can deal with these issues.
<P>
	These are the things which modern Armenians and modern 
Turks and modern Canadians will thank us for, not seeking to 
condemn and turn a question of language into something which 
looks like a form of a political manoeuvre when what we all are 
trying to do is address an issue which is of real distinct importance 
to every member of the House, which is how to craft modern 
institutions which respond to the needs of a modern world and can 
assure that this type of event can never happen again.
<P>
	I hope the criminal court which has been established in respect 
of Bosnia and which a learned judge from my province has joined 
as a prosecutor will contribute toward that process. I hope we might 
in the House one day debate the possibility of having similar laws 
as they have in the United States where civil actions may be 
brought in the courts of the United States based on human rights 
violations elsewhere.
<P>
	We have much work to do as parliamentarians. We should attend 
to that work. The parliamentary secretary said in all frankness to 
the question asked of him about Turkey that he could not answer 
what Turkey would say on the issue of genocide. That is for Turkey 
to answer.
<P>
	We can answer for ourselves about what we believe in terms of 
the institutional framework of the world in which we operate and 
what we can do as politicians to ensure terrible tragedies of this 
nature do not occur.
<P>
	That will be the greatest contribution we can make to our fellow 
Armenian citizens and those Armenians living in Armenia today. 
That is the greatest means whereby we can show our respect for the 
meaning of this resolution, by not seeking to argue about the 
terminology of it, recognizing it as a fact and turning our attention 
to ensuring this can never happen again, or at least if it does happen 
that there is a world order in place which will enable us as 
Canadians to participate in that and prevent it.
<P>
	There is a complicated subject to raise, but something I think is 
worth saying in the House. Every issue of this nature has a 
resonance within ourselves. We are not perfect in this country. We 
have had our problems, human rights problems. We have evolved 
and will continue to evolve in respect of it. We have developed a 
country with a charter of rights which guarantees individual rights. 
That is an extremely important part of our tradition and our 
contribution to the international framework of which I spoke.
<P>
	We have developed federal institutions which respond to the 
needs of collectivities in different parts of the country which have 
control over those events which are close to them and at the same 
time a federal government which assures the charter and general 
rules and principles may be applied equally and fairly across this 
land.
<P>
	I look at that and at what we have crafted over the years. Our 
federal institutions are among the best guarantees Canadians have 
that this type of event could never occur here. Remember, this 
occurred in a unitary state that lacked the checks and balances of 
many jurisdictions which could deal with this type of issue.
<P>
<B>(1630)</B>
<P>
	Therefore, I suggest to members of the Bloc Quebecois that 
when they bring forward a motion like this and want to know the 
lesson of the Armenian tragedy, that one lesson is the creation of 
modern political institutions with human values and with sufficient 
responses to the needs to deal with them. That is what I suggest has 
been done in our federal institutions and it is one reason why this 
country is so respected and why it is a great country in which to 
live. It is respected by everyone.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	I know that my time is limited. I would like to say in closing that 
the amendment proposed by the government is not only consistent 
with the Bloc Quebecois' basic motion but it also introduces the 
much broader notion that respect for human rights must enjoy 
universal recognition. This respect also introduces the notion that 
our country is based on tolerance and multiculturalism. It is a 
federal state that guarantees respect for all its citizens, whether 
they come from Armenia or any other country.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Maurice Bernier (Mégantic-Compton-Stanstead, 
BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, first of all, I want to commend my colleague 
from Rosedale for his comments. Had his remarks led to the tabling 
of a motion, I would support it almost in its entirety, except of 
course when he refers-I understand that he may have to toe the 
party line-to his support for the amendment put forward by his 
colleague, the Secretary of State responsible for Multiculturalism 
and the Status of Women.
<P>
	In fact, as we mentioned several times, the government's 
amendment to this motion plays down the impact of the tragic 
events experienced by the Armenian people in 1915-16, thus 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1858"> 1858 </A></B>
<P>
managing to avoid calling a spade a spade and referring to those 
events as a genocide.
<P>
	I understand that the evolution of international law and attitudes 
certainly allows us to be more specific in analyzing such events. It 
seems to me that, even when referring to the 1915-16 context, the 
facts can only point to a recognition that a real or at least attempted 
genocide of the Armenian people took place at that time.
<P>
	I fully agree that what my colleague said about Canada's human 
rights record should be acknowledged. Both the international 
community and the official opposition recognize outright that 
Canada's human rights record is quite good. Last week, the Chief 
Commissioner of the Canadian Human Rights Commission 
testified before the committee on human rights to point out the 
major improvements needed with regard to the First Nations and, 
of course, the need to add sexual orientation to the list of prohibited 
grounds of discrimination. Having said that, I recognize, we 
recognize that there are advantages to living in this country as far 
as human rights are concerned.
<P>
	But precisely because of the progress made in Canada and 
Quebec in terms of human rights, I think the international message 
we are trying to convey should not, as I mentioned, be watered 
down in any way.
<P>
<B>(1635)</B>
<P>
	That is why we must send a clear message with regard not only 
to the Armenian genocide but also to the other crimes against 
humanity being committed around the world. Can my colleague 
tell us to what extent Canada must compromise because of 
international trade and set aside human rights in favour of Canada's 
commercial interests?
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> I would ask for the 
co-operation of the hon. member for Rosedale in giving us a short 
answer in the few moments remaining in the period set aside for 
questions and comments.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Graham:</B> Mr. Speaker, I have two comments for my hon. 
colleague. First of all, I too am delighted to be living in a system in 
which the human rights commissioner can raise such issues and 
bring them to our attention. I agree with the hon. member when he 
says that we Canadians still a long way to go. Instead of always 
pointing an accusing finger at others, we should start by dealing 
with our own problems. I am very pleased to be sitting in this place, 
because I look forward to be doing just that with him and the other 
members of this House in the near future.
<P>
	Regarding the relationship between international trade and 
human rights in other countries, do we really want, given the total 
system we live in, to condemn others? Does condemnation foster 
understanding and behaviour modification in other people or not? 
That is what we must ask ourselves.
<P>
	It may well be that, in some cases, condemnation is absolutely 
necessary, while in others, maintaining a relationship with the 
people in question will give us the opportunity to convince them to 
change their minds. This must always be decided on a case by case, 
or ad hoc basis.
<P>
	This is why I find that the amendment moved by the minister is 
more in keeping with today's needs than the wording of the original 
motion. This is why I support these amendments and hope that they 
will receive the support of all members of this House, because it is 
in that spirit that we will be able to change people's ways. This 
should be our aim. W should think ahead, and have the future of 
mankind in mind. I think that this is what we are trying to do with 
these amendments.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Before resuming debate, it is 
my duty, pursuant to Standing Order 38, to inform the House that 
the questions to be raised tonight at the time of adjournment are as 
following: the hon. member for Parry 
Sound-Muskoka-FEDNOR; the hon. member for 
Davenport-Fisheries.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Derek Lee (Scarborough-Rouge River, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am pleased to have an opportunity to participate in the 
debate on the motion proposed by the official opposition.
<P>
	The theme is man's inhumanity to man, an exhortation that we 
set aside a time every year to take note of this unfortunate subject. 
The subscript on the theme is the Armenian genocide of 1915.
<P>
	Some amendments have been proposed by the government and 
by the third party dealing with technical aspects of the resolution 
and exhibiting some caution in terms of the use of the word 
``genocide.''
<P>
	Perhaps some of us are looking for ways to finesse the use of 
these historical facts, bring them into the present and find the 
proper pigeonhole, the proper categorization, the proper way to try 
to articulate it. I think there is some difficulty in doing that. 
Members on both sides of the House have articulated various 
perspectives on the difficulty. It is not easy to articulate events 
which happened a long time ago, in this case 81 years ago.
<P>
<B>(1640)</B>
<P>
	In any event, I have made up my mind. I made up my mind some 
time ago. I do not care about the technical aspects of this. I will 
leave that to others. Frankly, after 81 years we are at the point 
where the lawyers have become irrelevant.
<P>
	I first became aware of what is being called the Armenian 
genocide about 12 years ago. I had an Armenian Canadian friend. 
He certainly did not become my friend to make me aware of the 
issue. However, in knowing his family I became aware of it.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1859"> 1859 </A></B>
<P>
	About the same time I had the occasion to read an academic 
article in a British magazine of political philosophy and history. 
That magazine is called ``Encounter''. It was a well written and 
objective presentation of many aspects of history and political 
philosophy.
<P>
	The article that I read was quite objective. It dealt with the then 
existing historical controversy about the issue of how many people 
actually died in the Armenian genocide. At the time, and perhaps 
still, there are conflicting views on the number. However it is 
measured, we are dealing with six or seven digits. However it is 
measured, it was, at least, a tragedy. It was the first genocide of this 
century. I have accepted that.
<P>
	Irrespective of the vote on the motion and how the lawyers 
amend it, dovetail it and finesse it, I want Canadians to recognize 
what happened in 1915.
<P>
	Since that time I have attended the annual commemoration of the 
April 1915 events. Everyone will know that the perpetrators were 
incapable of killing 1.5 million people on April 24, 1915. It went 
on for some time. At the time the world was engaged in another 
slaughter, the first world war. Millions were killed in that exercise. 
It happened at the same time that Lawrence of Arabia was pursuing 
his military career, perhaps 100 miles south of where this was 
happening. The world did not pay too much attention.
<P>
	However, there were those who took note. I am pleased to say 
that there were those in Canada who took note. About 1921 some 
Canadians got together to bring to Canada some orphans of the 
Armenian genocide. Those orphans came to be known as the 
Georgetown boys. They were brought to a place near Georgetown, 
Ontario. While by present day standards it does not look too pretty, 
these orphans were parcelled out and taken to farms. They were not 
adopted. They had guardians. They were sent to school and they 
worked very hard on farms. Recently there was a commemoration 
of them by the Armenian community in Toronto which I attended. 
It was very moving.
<P>
	These people are now very old. Most of them had smiles. 
However, the wrinkles in their hands and faces showed me 
something very real that happened 81 years ago.
<P>
<B>(1645)</B>
<P>
	We can all pick whatever term we like on this, tragedy, genocide, 
but all of us cannot help but pause and ask how this could have 
happened and to ask God not to let it happen again.
<P>
	Following that, for the Armenians of that part of the Middle East 
and eastern Europe there was a diaspora. Those who were able to 
flee did. Those who were deported moved on. Somewhere between 
a few and many found their way, thankfully, to Canada, with the 
Armenian community regarding itself as a minority  within 
Canada. Many of them have been mainstreamed, leading lives not 
so much as Armenian-Canadians but as Canadians of Armenian 
heritage.
<P>
	However, one cannot forget that a huge chunk of people, part of 
one's heritage, was simply liquidated by a political entity, the 
Ottoman Empire. I was not alive during the time of the Ottoman 
Empire so I do not know what it was. I can read about it in the 
history books but I cannot reach back and touch it as part of history. 
However, those who survived those events have told me they 
happened. It is more than past due for the rest of the world to 
recognize it as it really was.
<P>
	We should not leave this event alone in history without 
recognizing that man has on numerous occasions killed just as 
many in this century. There was the first world war, the Russian 
revolution which killed millions, and the genocidal German 
concentration camps which killed millions of Jews, Gypsies and 
political opponents.
<P>
	We were a party to the second world war during which millions 
were killed. The Chinese Communist revolution was not a 
genocide but millions died. There was a massive slaughter of 
military personnel and civilians in Yugoslavia immediately 
following the first world war.
<P>
	In the partition in India in 1947-48, two million people were 
killed trying to draw a line between India and Pakistan. It was a 
terrible tragedy. No one willed that one; it was man's inhumanity to 
man.
<P>
	Just since I have had the privilege of serving as a member of 
Parliament, we have had the ugliness of the slaughter in Bosnia and 
in Rwanda.
<P>
	This motion today is not just an attempt to recognize what 
happened in Armenia in 1915. It is an attempt by all Canadians to 
reconcile inside themselves with what has happened here, these 
tragedies, this death, these inhumanities. We have very little else 
we can use to help us reconcile inside ourselves. This resolution is 
one of the ways we can do it as a people.
<P>
	We also wish, if we can, to reconcile ourselves with history. In 
this case it is my view the history books do not show exactly what 
happened. Maybe some do. Forgive me for not being able to read 
all the books and articles on this. However, in my experience as a 
Canadian and with my education I did not have access and was not 
made aware of the extent of this slaughter as I went through my 
schooling, as I was privileged to do for many years. I regret that we 
do not in a dedicated and comprehensive way try to make our 
students aware of some of these aspects of history.
<P>
<B>(1650)</B>
<P>
	I do not think we should be too partisan about the 1.5 million 
dead. I hope there is a way the opposition motion, the government 
amendment and the subamendment from the third party will 
resolve this in a unanimously adopted motion. It would be difficult 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1860"> 1860 </A></B>
<P>
for  anyone to vote against a motion when we are looking down a 
gun barrel at this many dead.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I thank my hon. friend for his fine intervention.
<P>
	In the House on many occasions we have discussed genocides 
which have taken place around the world, from Armenia to 
Cambodia to the tragedies in Rwanda and Burundi.
<P>
	Time after time we have said it is unfortunate, a tragedy, it is sad. 
What have we done to prevent genocide in the future?
<P>
	I ask my hon. friend if he has any ideas on what the Canadian 
government could do and what he is prepared to do to intervene 
with the Minister of Foreign Affairs to make some constructive 
suggestions on how Canada can work with its partners in the 
international community to put forth ideas on collective actions 
that can be taken to prevent genocides.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Lee:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the member for the question. I 
resist the urge to be too philosophical about a proposed solution. I 
am sure all members of the House are prepared to do what they can 
as legislators to advance Canada's role in the international arena in 
a way that would hopefully obviate the need to address these kinds 
of tragedies in the future.
<P>
	I am compelled to recall a remark to me by a legislator of the 
Indian Parliament. In a conversation we were having about another 
issue he said you can only address the politics of a gun with a gun. 
This to me means that if there is a potential genocide or a slaughter 
by a machete or a gun or poisons the only way to deal with it is with 
force. That means the United Nations, of which Canada is a 
member, must pay more attention to the proposal of a rapid 
reaction force. That means using a gun against a gun, a blade 
against a blade.
<P>
	If we want to sit around and be philosophical about why these 
things should not happen for the next half century we may end up 
watching another Rwanda or Cambodia without the means to stop 
it. We will end up simply wringing our hands.
<P>
	The only short run solution to stop these things when they begin 
to brew is a rapid reaction force that will use force with prejudice 
for the purpose of ending what may appear to be a genocidal 
initiative.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Daviault (Ahuntsic, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, at the 
beginning of his reply to my colleague's question, the hon. member 
referred to the symbolism of today's motion. I am a bit shocked 
because, to me, this is much more than a symbol.
<P>
<B>(1655)</B>
<P>
	One of the first things that struck me when I started working on 
the commemoration of the Armenian  genocide was what Adolf 
Hitler, when he started his exactions from the Jews, asked the SS: 
``Who remembers the Armenian genocide nowadays?''
<P>
	The first measure that a country must take when a genocide 
occurs is to make sure that it is not forgotten. The dictators of this 
world must be reminded that such atrocities will be taken into 
consideration by the international community. This is why Bloc 
Quebecois members and Reformers wish to keep the term genocide 
in the motion.
<P>
	The word tragedy is not as strong. I ask the hon. member to 
reflect on the very nature of the motion and to support it because of 
its purpose, which is to make reference to the Armenian genocide 
and to be a concrete action whereby the government will remind 
the international community of such acts, which are all too 
common.
<P>
	This is meant to be a comment. I would like to hear the hon. 
member's views on this.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Lee:</B> Mr. Speaker, I agree with almost all of what the 
member said. I congratulate him on introducing the motion. If 
somehow in the translation the word symbolic came across in my 
remarks, I do not recall using it or at least intending it. I do not 
consider there is anything symbolic in this at all. It means what it 
says.
<P>
	In terms of how the voting goes on the motions and the technical 
words, I have already made my point that I do not want to be into 
the technical side of this at all. I made up my mind long ago about 
what went on 81 years ago. I simply want a resolution of the House 
that is effective for the very well intentioned purpose of the 
member opposite.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Maud Debien (Laval East, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the official 
opposition day on the Armenian genocide affords me the 
opportunity to speak on this most important matter. The debates 
surrounding this question are aimed at encouraging the Canadian 
government to officially recognize the genocide of 1915. This 
crime against humanity is, we believe, something that must not be 
left in the shadows to be ignored.
<P>
	The motion presented by the Bloc Quebecois stipulates that, on 
this 81st anniversary of the genocide, the government ought to 
designate the week of April 20 to 27 of each year as the week to 
commemorate man's inhumanity to man, acknowledging that the 
actions in question are to be strongly condemned and all people on 
earth are to bear witness to them.
<P>
	In fact, the Bloc motion essentially reflects the spirit of a motion 
tabled by the Liberal member for Don Valley North in April of 
1995. Unfortunately, some of his colleagues opposed it, and the 
motion was not put to a vote in the House at that time.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1861"> 1861 </A></B>
<P>
	It would have provided the government with another feather in 
its cap as a defender of human rights. Instead, we are faced with 
an astonishing about face.
<P>
	The Liberal government's attitude in this matter is 
disappointing, but not really a surprise. When the Liberals were in 
the opposition benches, they did not hesitate to call for explicit 
recognition of the Armenian genocide by this House. Since they 
have returned to power, they have completely changed their tune, 
you might say. Human rights are no longer necessarily a priority, 
but are often subordinate to economic interests.
<P>
<B>(1700)</B>
<P>
	Just recently, the brand new Minister of International 
Cooperation was pressuring the mayor of Montreal to abandon his 
plans to erect a monument to the victims of genocide, including the 
Armenian people. The minister would have preferred ``tragic 
events'' to be used instead of the term ``genocide''. Watering down 
the concept in such a context is tantamount to confirming that the 
final step in a genocide is to attempt after the fact to deny its very 
existence, or at the very least to minimize its importance, and that 
is what we are seeing here today.
<P>
	This is what the Liberal government is again trying to do, by 
proposing an amendment in an undignified attempt to water down 
the seriousness of the situation. If it refused to support the motion 
of my friend and colleague from Ahuntsic, the Liberal government 
would be implicitly supporting the extremists who wish to stifle 
historical memory. This in no way reflects the fundamental values 
of Quebecers and Canadians.
<P>
	Fortunately, the governments of Quebec and Ontario have long 
supported the universal values human rights represent. In 1980, 
they both adopted motions recognizing the Armenian genocide and 
demanding that the federal government follow suit.
<P>
	It is incongruous that, 16 years later, here we are still in this 
House calling for the Canadian government to act. Does the federal 
government refuse to recognize this reality? During World War I, 
the Ottoman Turk government committed atrocities against the 
Armenian people.
<P>
	The Ottoman Empire executed one and a half million Armenians 
and deported another 500,000. And what is especially sad is that 
many people are keeping this situation hidden.
<P>
	If we want to avoid impunity one day inciting other peoples to 
similar actions, and, unfortunately, we have more recent examples 
still fresh in our minds, Parliament must today recognize that the 
genocide of the Armenian community is one of this century's major 
tragedies. We must avoid euphemisms at all cost and give words 
their due in keeping with the events that occurred. As the proverb 
has it, ``An idea well conceived presents itself clearly, and the 
words to express it come readily''.
<P>
	When things are described as they are and international pressure 
is brought to bear, one day soon, Turkey will take responsibility for 
this genocide. We must not close our eyes to such crimes and allow 
the passage of time to bury them.
<P>
	The government's position on human rights, as I said earlier, is 
disappointing. For the present government, trade and export are all 
that count. Foreign affairs and business affairs go hand in hand, and 
the rights of the individual are being muddled with the rights of the 
businessman.
<P>
	The Liberal government is so obsessed by the simple rationality 
of money and trade that it forgets the vital element and has to be 
reminded of it by the Canadian Exporters' Association. At a 
conference organized by the international centre for human rights, 
the president of the exporters' association pointed out that 
international trade and efforts to increase respect for human rights 
were not mutually exclusive and that the government should 
seriously pursue both. He also added that business should 
voluntarily adopt rules of conduct for activities abroad.
<P>
	Finally, and this is what counts, he pointed out that international 
trade and investments alone did not bring about improved respect 
for human rights. This is from the Canadian Exporters' 
Association. And yet, the Prime Minister has been endlessly 
repeating the opposite ever since he came to power. The world is on 
its ear.
<P>
	The government's priorities in this area do not reflect the values 
shared by Quebecers and Canadians.
<P>
<B>(1705)</B>
<P>
	In a recent poll, Canadians and Quebecers were asked to rank the 
various objectives of Canada's foreign policy according to their 
importance. Fifty three per cent of Quebecers and 48 per cent of 
Canadians said that the protection of human rights was very 
important.
<P>
	In Quebec the protection of human rights was deemed more 
important than the promotion of trade. Fortunately, the peoples of 
Quebec and Canada are much more compassionate toward victims 
of terror than their government.
<P>
	These values shared by the peoples of Quebec and Canada as a 
whole are universal values which can be found in the universal 
charter of human rights. They must be reflected in Canada's 
international policies. The values of equality, justice and respect 
for fundamental rights transcend culture, language, continents and 
even time.
<P>
	It would be too easy, for instance, to keep trading with China 
without uttering a word regarding its shameful record of human 
rights violations. I refuse to believe that the Chinese are marginally 
more inclined to live under dictatorial rule or that their culture 
makes it easier for them to do so.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1862"> 1862 </A></B>
<P>
	Along the same line, we cannot endorse the idea that women 
are second class citizens, just because they are women, and view 
this as normal, because local religious beliefs.
<P>
	Another case in point: the Canadian government must react 
when trading with a country where young children work in 
appalling conditions. The government has the moral duty to 
promote and protect human rights. This is one of the main reasons 
for its international involvement.
<P>
	As a Montreal journalist said last week: ``Finally, this issue 
raises-and I believe it is of the utmost importance-the question 
of the universality of rights. Are relativism and piecemeal policy, 
which are the essence of politics and diplomacy, not being taken 
too far when we hear major western leaders preach the relativity of 
universal values?'' This is the crux of the matter. It has also been 
said that it was a very popular theme with despots in Africa and 
Asia''.
<P>
	To conclude, I would urge my colleagues to support the motion 
brought forward by the member for Ahuntsic to set aside a week to 
commemorate man's inhumanity to man. This way, every year we 
would have the opportunity to remember the errors of the past, and 
to offer on the international stage an image of Canada reflecting the 
values of the peoples of Quebec and Canada.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Sarkis Assadourian (Don Valley North, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I want to ask a question of the hon. member for 
Scarborough-Rouge River. I also want to ask the same question of 
my colleague from the Bloc Quebecois. It is with regard to what is 
taught in school regarding the history of genocide and the 
holocaust.
<P>
	Before I do that, I want to make a statement. Since 1965, or 31 
years, I have been involved with this issue. This is the first time we 
have had seven hours debate and the word ``alleged'' has not been 
used. I give credit to this House and members of Parliament for not 
using the word ``alleged'' in the discussions we have had so for.
<P>
	I want to make the point that nobody has ever denied the fact that 
1.5 million innocent people perished in 1915 during the first world 
war as the first genocide of the century.
<P>
	I am quite sure that Armenians in this country and all over the 
world are prepared to do as the Jewish people did after the 
holocaust. Once this issue is addressed by the Turkish government 
they are prepared to forgive what happened but never to forget what 
happened. Once you forget it will be repeated again. I hope this 
debate will focus attention on the fact that the victims these days 
are prepared to forgive if they are asked but they will not forget. 
Once we forget we repeat it again in the future.
<P>
<B>(1710)</B>
<P>
	I go back to the first point I made. Would the hon. member 
encourage including the subject of genocide, or crimes against 
humanity, or however it is described, a tragic event, massacres, as 
part of the school curriculum so the younger generations can be 
taught in the high schools what happened? Awareness is the key. 
Once they are aware of what happened in history hopefully they 
will not repeat it because that is where the problem is. Once it 
happens it repeats itself over and over again.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Debien:</B> Mr. Speaker, I wish to thank the hon. member for 
Don Valley North for his question and comments.
<P>
	As you can imagine, Mr. Speaker, I fully support most of his 
comments, except for one. He said no one had denied or refused to 
acknowledge the Armenian genocide. He said no one had denied 
this event, and I totally agree with him. The hon. member's 
statement, however, raises the following question: If no one denies 
it, why refuse to give it official recognition? That is what I cannot 
understand on the part of Liberal members.
<P>
	As for his second question concerning what is taught in the 
history books in Quebec and Canada about the genocides that have 
taken place throughout the world, I also fully agree with him. 
Being an educator who taught for many years mostly at the primary 
level, I obviously think that, in terms of giving students a sense of 
history, of collective conscience, it is very important to teach them 
about all these tragic errors, all these genocides that have been 
committed throughout the world, to give them this sense of history, 
this collective conscience so that, once they become adults, they, 
too, will exert pressure on their governments to ensure that such 
mistakes are not repeated.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stéphane Bergeron (Verchères, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I must 
admit that it is very difficult for me to speak on the motion put 
forward by my hon. colleague, the member for Ahuntsic. It is not 
that I disagree with what it says, quite the contrary, but the subject 
is so terribly sad.
<P>
	If I have agreed to participate in the debate today, it is because I 
believe that the events referred to in this motion must never be 
forgotten by present or future generations.
<P>
	Who has not heard about the violence and mistreatment inflicted 
upon the Armenian people in the early part of this century? The 
violence was such that the word genocide, as defined by the United 
Nations in 1948, can be used without hesitation. And I believe that 
any amount of manoeuvring to avoid using the word genocide 
would be sheer deception or hypocrisy.
<P>
	In a nutshell, genocide means the systematic and purposeful 
extermination of entire groups of people,  whether ethnic, national 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1863"> 1863 </A></B>
<P>
or religious. There is no doubt that the Armenian people were the 
victims of a genocide. As painful as it may be, it is therefore 
necessary to remember the tragic events which started on April 24, 
1915. On that day, the Armenian genocide, the first genocide of our 
century and one of the most important in terms of number of 
victims, started in what was known at the time as the Ottoman 
Empire.
<P>
	In ensuing years, more than 1.5 million innocent victims will be 
murdered or deported for reasons that remain unclear, their temples 
and monuments destroyed and the names of their towns changed. 
They even tried to wipe away all mention of their very existence.
<P>
<B>(1715)</B>
<P>
	All this simply could not be a series of coincidences. It had to be 
a carefully planned and methodically executed plan. The Bloc 
Quebecois believes that humanity must be constantly reminded of 
the Armenian genocide. Why? So that this type of orchestrated 
violence against our fellow human beings can never occur again.
<P>
	We may sometimes think that a genocide is a rare occurrence, 
that it is a thing of the past. Unfortunately, it is still current 
practice. We cannot and must not forget that, since 1915, many 
leaders on this planet ordered radical, extremist and immoral 
measures carried out. The excessive number of genocides that have 
occurred since then clearly demonstrates this fact.
<P>
	How can we forget the fate of the Jews and gypsies at the hands 
of Hitler's regime? How can we forget the fate of the Cambodian 
people at the hands of the Khmers Rouges, in 1975? How can we 
forget the fate, in 1994, of more than 500,000 Tutsi, in Rwanda? 
How can we forget the ethnic cleansing of civilian populations in 
the former Yugoslavia? How can we forget the fate of the Tibetan 
population at the hands of the Chinese occupant? How can we 
forget the reign of terror imposed by Indonesia in East Timor? The 
list goes on and on.
<P>
	These few examples, already far too numerous, are most 
revealing. Millions of people have been assassinated, while 
millions of others were deported, and are refugees, without a 
country and without a family. According to the UNHCR, over 27 
million individuals currently live outside their country because 
they had to flee war and repression. These 27 million persons are 
refugees, in a century that is said to be modern.
<P>
	It is with horror that, every day, we witness barbaric and 
inhumane practices that we thought were history. Will the human 
race ever learn from its mistakes? What is surprising regarding 
these genocides and their consequences is that, all too often, their 
authors are never punished. They act with complete impunity. But 
who is responsible for these deaths? Who is responsible for this 
suffering?
<P>
	Given its magnitude, a genocide cannot be the work of mere 
individuals. The participation, or at least the consent, of 
government leaders is necessary.
<P>
	Too frequently in the past, those responsible for these genocides 
have gone unpunished. A laudable effort is now under way and we 
can only rejoice in the creation of the International Criminal 
Tribunal in The Hague. This tribunal, created in 1993 by the UN 
Security Council and responsible for judging crimes committed in 
the former Yugoslavia, is a step in the right direction, particularly 
because, in 1995, another international tribunal was created, this 
time to judge crimes that took place in Rwanda.
<P>
	These two courts are still in their early days. It is to be hoped that 
they will soon have real means of rendering justice. In the former 
Yugoslavia, over fifty charges have been laid, including charges 
against Bosnian Serb leaders Radovan Karadzic and Ratko Mladic. 
But a large problem remains and is experienced in the same way in 
both the former Yugoslavia and Rwanda. This problem is related to 
the impossibility of actually laying hands on the criminals, who put 
themselves under the protection of governments or take refuge in 
other countries.
<P>
	War crimes must not, and should never, go unpunished. The 
international community, including Canada, has a legal and moral 
obligation to find the criminals. Some will even say that the 
international tribunal should be able to count on the assistance of 
an international police force with the power to apprehend suspects 
wherever they are.
<P>
	For the time being, the Bloc Quebecois reiterates an opinion it 
expressed at the time of the Dayton peace accords. The 
International Criminal Tribunal in The Hague must continue its 
efforts and judge war criminals. It is important that the tribunal 
retain its autonomy and that its mandate not be hampered by any 
amnesties negotiated and granted by the parties in question. 
Bargaining to have sentences dropped and pardons granted to 
criminals accused of genocide should not be allowed.
<P>
	We know that Canada has for a long time been considered one of 
the world leaders in promoting and protecting human rights. This 
excellent reputation did not come about simply through the 
importance accorded to trade.
<P>
<B>(1720)</B>
<P>
	This enviable reputation is the result of the priorities set by 
former prime ministers such as Lester B. Pearson, awarded the 
Nobel Peace Prize in 1957 for having initiated the creation of 
United Nations peacekeeping forces, and John Diefenbaker, who 
constantly defended human rights, particularly by taking a stand in 
1961 against apartheid in South Africa.
<P>
	Today, the Bloc Quebecois feels it is high time for the House of 
Commons to finally recognize the Armenian genocide. If the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1864"> 1864 </A></B>
<P>
motion is rejected, this will confirm our gravest doubts about the 
real importance the Liberal majority assigns to human rights as an 
issue. It is not because Canada maintains profitable trade ties with 
Turkey that we need to close our eyes to a historical reality.
<P>
	As far back as 1980, the Ontario legislature recognized the 
Armenian genocide. The Quebec national assembly followed suit 
in 1985. This past year, in April 1995, the Russian parliament also 
recognized it. What is the Liberal majority here waiting for?
<P>
	Even if we often have the impression that money, productivity, 
and trade are what rules our lives, we must not lose sight of the fact 
that other values must be taken into consideration when looking at 
trade relations with other countries. As markets become global, it is 
important to ensure the respect of human rights.
<P>
	Since their arrival in power, the Liberals have been thinking they 
can drift along on Canada's excellent reputation abroad in order to 
put the emphasis on strictly trade relations. In April 1994 in this 
House, the Prime Minister himself claimed that his government 
had a policy to protect human rights and raised the issue in every 
country it traded with. However, Team Canada's latest trip to Asia 
revealed just how little importance the Liberal government pays to 
human rights.
<P>
	It took a 13 year old youth, Craig Kielburger, to accost the Prime 
Minister in India and finally bring to light the sad truth of the lack 
of respect of the fundamental rights of children. This young man's 
cause immediately caught the sympathy of Quebecers and 
Canadians thus proving that our fellow citizens are concerned by 
this important issue of human rights.
<P>
	This is why the Bloc, like all Quebecers and Canadians, wants all 
people to be able to grow and develop on this planet without fear of 
threat to their life and liberty in any way. This is why we must act 
to prevent the government, through its silence, from becoming a 
partisan and an accomplice of the indifference and individualism 
that all too often seem to have become the prerogative of this 
century.
<P>
	Governments must sometimes be called to order on the issue of 
basic human rights. The House of Commons and the government 
members must take special action to make sure that the Armenian 
genocide is not forgotten, contrary to all the other acts of violence 
committed against innocent civilian populations.
<P>
	This is why I support with all the might and fervour I can muster 
the motion asking that every year the period of time between April 
20 and 27 be set aside to commemorate man's occasional 
inhumanity to man. Even if it is sometimes easier to forget past 
events and to chose to plough on, the House of Commons and the 
Liberal majority must officially recognize the genocide of 1915 to 
avoid the reoccurrence of tragedies of this kind.
<P>
	In closing, I would like to salute all our fellow citizens of 
Armenian origin in their beautiful tongue.
<P>
	[<I>The member spoke in Armenian.</I>]
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Andy Scott (Fredericton-York-Sunbury, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I would like to thank the hon. member for Ahuntsic for 
bringing this motion to the attention of the House. The issues raised 
are far reaching and universal.
<P>
	History has not focused its brutality. Its cruelty has not been 
limited to one community or to one people. The tragedies of history 
have not discriminated on the basis of race, religion or ethnicity for 
they befell humanity as a whole. The deaths of innocent men, 
women and children, cut down by tyranny because of their 
ethnicity, their religion or their race is a tragedy for the entire 
human family.
<P>
<B>(1725 )</B>
<P>
	Canadians need to be sensitive to this reality and recognize that 
the individual histories of many of our citizens do not begin on our 
shores. We must be sensitive to the experiences of our fellow 
Canadians who by birth or by ancestry may have been victimized 
by the inhumanity of wars and oppression.
<P>
	By being compassionate and understanding of the deep scars that 
such experiences have on individuals and communities, we are 
contributing to the healing process. While our actions today help 
ease the pain, we must know that the scars will never be erased.
<P>
	We are, by and large, a country of immigrants who have come to 
Canada from every corner of the world. As immigrants we have 
attachments to our respective heritages. In Canada we take pride in 
the fact that these diverse heritages are what makes Canada unique 
as a nation.
<P>
	We seek to build a society that ensures fair and equitable 
treatment and that respects the dignity and accommodates the 
needs of Canadians of all ethnic, cultural, religious, linguistic and 
racial origins. The challenge for us now is to strengthen a cohesive, 
respectful, inclusive and democratic society and a shared sense of 
identity reflective of the diversity of Canada's people.
<P>
	What makes a society cohesive? Three pillars in my mind: social 
justice, civic participation and a sense of identity. How do we 
create a cohesive society that incorporates these three principles?
<P>
	First, we offer to all Canadians, regardless of their ethnicity, 
colour or religion, the opportunity to contribute to society and 
enjoy the full benefits of participation.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1865"> 1865 </A></B>
<P>
	Second, we ensure that Canadians of all backgrounds are able 
to participate in society. To foster this very important symbiotic 
relationship requires Canadians to work hard.
<P>
	Our Canadian mosaic means that we must be accommodating in 
ways that other nations feel free to ignore. We have built a strong 
tradition of respecting each other's cultures, of understanding how 
diversity enriches us. We work with many partners across the 
country to accomplish this. We work with other levels of 
government, with major institutions, with organizations, business 
and labour and with individual Canadians to make sure that we all 
have the opportunity to participate fully in society.
<P>
	Why do we go to this trouble? What is our incentive? We do it 
because when Canadians are treated equally and fairly, when they 
feel they belong and when they have the opportunity to contribute, 
we are ensuring our future growth and prosperity. We do it because 
Canada in its diversity is a mirror for the rest of the world. We dare 
hope that other nations who see themselves reflected in our 
diversity will be persuaded to follow us toward peace, 
understanding and justice for all.
<P>
	From our beginnings as a country, diversity has been a fact of the 
every day lives of Canadians. The issue is not whether we are 
culturally diverse-there is no question about that-but rather how 
we intend to make sure that our diversity continues to strengthen us 
as a nation.
<P>
	Even today as religious and ethnic conflicts take their toll around 
the globe, Canada has been a light of democratic resolution of 
profound political difference. We have been a beacon to displaced 
people from around the world who recognize what racism, 
prejudice and ignorance can lead to. We are an example of respect 
and accommodation that has been far too lacking in other parts of 
the world.
<P>
	Our efforts in this regard have been recognized by Nelson 
Mandela, president of the Republic of South Africa. In his message 
to Canadians, President Mandela referred to Canada's lasting 
tradition of dedication to human rights and hoped that our efforts 
would continue to ``enrich humanity''.
<P>
	With this very desire in mind, the government remains 
committed to the multiculturalism policy built on the pillars of 
identity, civic participation and social justice. These are the 
cherished principles of democracy that are the best deterrents to 
tyranny and oppression. These are the values that bind all 
Canadians as a nation.
<P>
	While the pace of change may be challenging or even 
frightening, we want to ensure that all who call Canada home are 
able to take full and active part in the affairs of their community 
and country, that Canadians are valued for their individual 
contributions, for their value as human beings and not judged by 
their membership in any number of identifiable communities.
<P>
<B>(1730 )</B>
<P>
	So by all means, Canadians, remember who you are and where 
you came from, but do not forget that Canada's future lies ahead of 
us and that its creation depends on how well we work together.
<P>
	We are a diverse society. We will remain a diverse society. Our 
job is to make that diversity work for all of us. It is this 
compassionate vision of our community that has and will continue 
to make Canada a beacon to victims of violence and oppression 
from around the world.
<P>
	April 24 is an emotional day for Canadians of Armenian ancestry 
as they recall the very painful and tragic events of the past. The 
Canadian government has consistently extended its heartfelt sense 
of sorrow on this difficult occasion.
<P>
	However, the motion as presented does not reflect accurately 
Canada's position. The Government of Canada does not deny the 
tragic events that befell the Armenian community. Indeed, it 
sympathizes with the victims of the tragic events of 1915 and with 
their descendants, particularly those who have come to Canada to 
make a new life.
<P>
	In memory of the victims of inhumanity: Armenians, Jews, 
Bosnians, Cambodians, aboriginal peoples, gay men and lesbians 
and people of colour, I urge the House to support the amendment 
proposed earlier by the Secretary of State for Multiculturalism.
<P>
	In the government's recognition that we must be ever vigilant in 
our defence of the values we share as Canadians, it is this 
government's commitment to never forget and to work toward 
reconciliation and understanding.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Tony Ianno (Trinity-Spadina, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it 
gives me pleasure to rise today to speak to the motion presented by 
the member for Ahuntsic with regard to the commemoration of the 
Armenian genocide.
<P>
	The member for Ahuntsic should remember that my colleague 
from Don Valley North introduced a private member's motion, 
Motion No. 282, on April 3, 1995. That motion, on which 
incidentally the member opposite spoke in favour, was a motion 
which called for the designation of the week of April 20 to 27 each 
year to commemorate the issue of man's inhumanity to his fellow 
man.
<P>
	In speaking to that motion, which read:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That, in the opinion of this House, the government should designate the 
period from April 20 to 27 of each year as the week in which we commemorate 
the issue of man's inhumanity to his fellow man, to remind Canadians that the 
use of genocide and violence as an instrument of national policy by any nation 
or group at any time is a crime against all mankind which must be condemned 
and not forgotten.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1866"> 1866 </A></B>
<P>
	I have deliberately chosen to speak to this issue of man's 
inhumanity to his fellow man during the week that we remember 
the tragedy of the Armenian genocide for one main purpose. 
During the years that followed, it was very difficult for many 
people of Armenian background to accept the genocide caused by 
the Turkish army and to understand why victims were whipped, 
clubbed and refused water as they passed by streams and wells. 
These were men, women and children. The victims were lashed 
when they lagged behind.
<P>
	Telegrams to provincial capitals captured by the British army 
and reports by witnesses like Henry Morgenthau, the American 
ambassador to Turkey, provide evidence that the extermination of 
the Armenians was planned and organized by the central 
government.
<P>
	The significance of this week in relation to man's inhumanity to 
man does not, however, end with the commemoration of the 
slaughter of the 1.5 million Armenians at the hands of the Turkish 
authorities. April 20 to 27 was chosen because April 19 and 20, 
1939 was the beginning of the holocaust committed by the Nazis 
against the Jewish population. April 27 was the end of the apartheid 
regime of South Africa which gave the South African population 
the right to vote, one person, one vote.
<P>
	Throughout history there are terrible examples of man's 
inhumanity to man. There was the holocaust which included the 
extermination of six million Jews in various concentration camps 
all over Europe. The Nazis were also responsible for the death of 
over one million gypsies, homosexuals and other minority groups 
deemed unacceptable by Hitler's Third Reich. The holocaust was a 
denial of God and of man. It was a destruction of the world in a 
miniature form.
<P>
<B>(1735)</B>
<P>
	Hitler, and those he appointed to his imaginary government, 
regarded the Jewish people as a political problem and its so-called 
solution as a political necessity that had to be addressed in 
Germany's foreign and domestic policy. The Nazis used mass 
terror, forced labour, starvation, forced immigration, deportation 
and other forms of oppression to achieve their end goal, the 
destruction and annihilation of the Jewish people.
<P>
	In 1975 after a five-year civil war, the communist Khmer Rouge 
gained victory and power in Cambodia. They evacuated all of the 
cities, including Phnom Penh, the capital whose population had 
swollen with almost three million refugees. All were brutally 
driven from the city and some were killed immediately.
<P>
	Whomever Pol Pot and his small group of communist leaders 
regarded as potential enemies of the ideal state they wanted to build 
were executed. Those killed included officers of the army, 
government officials,  intellectuals, educated and professional 
people such as doctors and teachers.
<P>
	Communists who became victims of infighting were often 
interrogated before being killed. The killings varied according to 
regions; meaning more were killed in certain areas and during 
different times. The killing became more rampant just before the 
end of the Khmer Rouge rule in 1979.
<P>
	Rwanda is another recent example of one group pitted against 
another, where the world's complacency allowed the slaughter of 
hundreds of thousands. The genocide of Rwanda began in April 
1994. It was preceded by a war launched in October 1990 by the 
Tutsi guerrillas of the Rwanda Patriot Front against the Hutu led 
government.
<P>
	Before this, Rwanda was already one of the poorest nations in 
Africa. The war's origins go back to a wave of violence from 1959 
to 1966, when the Hutu overthrew the Tutsi monarchy which had 
ruled for centuries. About 20,000 to 100,000 Tutsi were killed in a 
slaughter that the British philosopher, Bertrand Russell, described 
as the ``most horrible and systematic massacre we have had 
occasion to witness since the extermination of the Jews by the 
Nazis''. The violence caused about 150,000 Tutsi exiles to flee to 
Uganda, Burundi, Tanzania and Zaire.
<P>
	The recent fighting in September 1994 had begun after Rwandan 
president, Juvenal Habyarimana, was killed in a mysterious plane 
crash in April. At least 500,000 were estimated to have been killed 
in the massacres which has prompted a UN investigation into the 
charges of genocide.
<P>
	The list of horrors continues with the mass deportations and the 
so-called ethnic cleansing that the world witnessed in the former 
Yugoslavia. Only now are the independent observers free to 
investigate. The situation is tragic now that the extent of the mass 
executions are coming to light.
<P>
	How can we pretend to live in a civilized world when decade 
after decade we witness such terrible crimes? We must condemn 
these crimes of the past, of the present and of the future. We must 
do so by recognizing the Armenian genocide for what it was, not 
allow revisionists to rewrite history along with that of many of the 
other atrocities that have occurred in the world.
<P>
	Canada is a tolerant nation. Over half of its population are 
Canadians of other origins. I believe that we live in a very tolerant 
society where we respect each other and we respect the rule of law. 
I believe that we must do something and encourage the UN to 
implement an all-encompassing, international instruments which 
codify crimes against humanity. Whenever some crime against 
humanity occurs it not only affects the people directly involved but 
also affects all of us no matter where we live.
<P>

<P>
	<B>Mr. Philippe Paré (Louis-Hébert, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I listened 
carefully to my colleague opposite and I conclude in the end that he 
thinks that the United Nations should find a way to deal with 
crimes against humanity.
<P>
	In my opinion, there are some inconsistencies between what we 
are hearing today from the government side and reality.
<P>
	I will remind the House that Pierre Sané, the president of 
Amnesty International, was in Ottawa on April 11. He spoke on the 
issue of human rights and trade.
<P>
	I will highlight a number of points he raised. I believe he was 
right when he said: ``The fight to protect human rights can only be 
fought on a global scale otherwise it will be lost before it starts''. 
He added: ``In this era of globalization, the question is to know how 
to ensure that exchanges are not limited to goods, information and 
money, but also include values''.
<P>
	Could my colleague opposite explain through which magical 
trick his Prime Minister believes that trading with countries with 
no regard for human rights is going to address, just like in a crystal 
ball, the issue of the violation of human rights? In this regard, I will 
remind the House that in 1994, the Prime Minister said: ``I could 
make resounding speeches on the issue and make headlines, but I 
prefer to open markets and trade; eventually, the walls will fall''. 
My colleague from Laval East said earlier that even the Canadian 
Exporters' Association is considering a voluntary code with respect 
to trade relations with countries that do not respect human rights.
<P>
	How can the government believe that the issue of human rights 
will be settled as if by magic?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ianno:</B> Mr. Speaker, one makes a choice as head of 
government on how to deal with human rights. I believe that the 
Prime Minister has chosen the right vehicle.
<P>
	Isolation does not accomplish the shared values that we can 
bring from our perspective to many peoples. Let us take China as a 
prime example. I believe that by increasing interaction with the 
Chinese and with our shared education, business and the other 
values that we are able to share with one another, we see that they 
start to get a sense of what Canada is all about and the values we 
have as Canadians.
<P>
	I can give an example. On Saturday I met with 40 Chinese 
visitors that are in the union movement. They had taken a course in 
Canada and met with many trade unionists. They had learned a 
great deal in a short period  of time. When I sat with them they said 
basically what they saw in Canada was tolerance and respect for 
one another. I asked: ``How do you see that helping you in China?'' 
The response was: ``What we saw was the partnership that occurred 
within Canada between labour, business and government somehow 
produced a sharing of goals, ideals and of course, economic 
value''. They realize that if those in China who are working for 
very low wages could improve their plight, somehow or other by 
showing it from the perspective of a partnership and how their 
enterprises would benefit by everyone sharing in the pie, they 
would accomplish their goal.
<P>
<B>(1745)</B>
<P>
	When we hear of that kind of example, and we would not have 
dreamed of the Chinese having union movements considering what 
we hear, there is hope. As long as we continue to interact and share 
values, ideas, education, et cetera, there will be improvement, 
especially when we take into account the new global economy and 
satellite communication. It is very difficult to consider southern 
China as being isolated when we take into account the fact that it 
receives TV signals from Hong Kong and other places. The 
Chinese are beginning to see how the rest of the world lives.
<P>
	Sharing is what will accomplish the goal of achieving a freer 
society. It will also provide an opportunity for us to work toward 
the end of discrimination against people anywhere in the world. I 
strongly believe that by communication we will be able to achieve 
our goal.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, 50 years ago the world emerged from one of the bloodiest 
conflicts in our history. The international community got together 
to try to reform the structure in which nations dealt with each other 
to prevent that tragedy from reoccurring. Out of that catharsis came 
the Bretton Woods institution and the United Nations.
<P>
	Unfortunately, the last 50 years has proven that we have failed to 
prevent genocide, we have failed to prevent conflicts from 
occurring and we have failed to prevent inhumane disasters. From 
Chechnya to Angola, from Cambodia to Rwanda, the world has 
been completely ineffective in preventing these wars from 
occurring. Rather than preventing conflict we have mired ourselves 
in conflict management.
<P>
	Rather than talking about the Armenian genocide of 1915, about 
the holocaust and about Cambodia, rather than speaking of these 
historical events, supplicating ourselves on the ground to God and 
saying never again, we should use these historical tragedies to look 
at what is happening today in the world and what is going to happen 
tomorrow to prevent further conflicts and tragedy.
<P>
	The conflict between North Korea and South Korea is one of the 
hottest potential war zones which could easily become nuclear. We 
see The Sudan, Rwanda and  Burundi occurring again. We see 
Kenya and the decimation of the Kikuyu by the Kelenjin tribe in 
which Mr. Moi is implicitly involved. We see Nigeria and the 
decimation of the Ogoni people. We see China and Taiwan, which 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1868"> 1868 </A></B>
<P>
could easily produce a conflagration that could leave millions dead. 
We see Tadjikistan.
<P>
	We see Turkish Kurdistan where as we speak elected members in 
the Turkish parliament, Kurds, have been incarcerated without 
trial, tortured and summary executions have taken place. We see 
what is happening in the Middle East, the tragedy which has 
occurred which our Parliament has spoken out strongly against in 
the hope that peace can finally come to this ravaged area. It is an 
area where there is little hope in the future for peace to occur unless 
decisive action is taken.
<P>
	These are the conflicts and the genocides of tomorrow. These are 
the issues we must deal with if we are going to prevent millions of 
people from dying unnecessarily and countries from being laid to 
waste.
<P>
<B>(1750)</B>
<P>
	One of the sad things I have found is that words without actions 
are completely useless. Rather than being a collection of mere 
words, I hope that today's debate will translate into definitive 
actions to prevent genocides from occurring in the future. If we do 
not do that the deaths of all the innocent people in previous 
genocides will be for nothing.
<P>
	As I have said before in this House, we have a very difficult 
situation. It is difficult to prevent conflicts but it is not impossible. 
There are solutions we can employ and solutions in which Canada 
can take a leadership role.
<P>
	It is easier to prevent a conflict than to deal with a conflict after 
it has occurred. After a conflict has occurred the seeds of future 
ethnic discontent, the seeds of future death, destruction and war are 
laid out for generations to come. Once the killing begins, it is 
impossible to turn back the hands of time. We must deal with 
conflict before it occurs. It can be done. This is the challenge of the 
post cold war era. This is the challenge I know our country can deal 
with together with like minded nations. It will not cost us more 
money. In fact, it will save us billions of dollars every year which I 
will discuss later.
<P>
	We have to identify the precursors to conflict such as 
inappropriate militarization. Often there is a destruction of basic 
human rights of a group of people. When one group of people is 
dealt with preferentially over another an imbalance exists. Often 
the result is a compromise of the human rights of a certain group of 
individuals. This spirals and becomes early conflict, then more 
widespread conflict. What often happens is a breakdown of 
democratic and judicial structures in a country. These are the 
warning signs of a potential conflict.
<P>
	We must organize a warning system which uses 
non-governmental organizations, peace building  institutions and 
countries, and diplomatic observer forces from the United Nations. 
These groups can extract information and then feed it into the 
United Nations crisis centre in New York. The information would 
be fed directly into a security council, not the security council we 
have today, but a modified security council. I will discuss that later. 
The security council must bring forth non-military initiatives to try 
to defuse the conflict before it occurs. In addressing these 
precursors the following initiatives can take place.
<P>
	There can be diplomatic initiatives from the United Nations to 
try to bring the warring parties together. Positive information must 
be put forth to try to defuse and dispel the myths that are often put 
forth early in a conflict. We need not look any further than the 
tragedy in the former Yugoslavia or what happened in Rwanda and 
Burundi to see one of the early signs is that one group often puts 
forth a lot of very negative hateful propaganda about another group 
which polarizes groups under stress and leads to conflict. This can 
be defused. The United Nations currently has mechanisms to 
achieve that end but it is not employing them as aggressively as it 
should. I hope that Mr. Fowler, our representative there, can take 
the initiative to put this forth in the United Nations.
<P>
	We can use the international financial institutions as 
non-military levers in conflict prevention. It is a cutting edge issue 
that we can put forth, but it requires changing the IFIs and their 
function as we know it.
<P>
	Some of the interventions they can make involve: using 
economic levers on groups in conflict; providing economic and 
technical help to potentially warring parties; providing technical 
assistance on good governance and building up democratic 
infrastructure; and providing loans to peace building groups in 
order for them to pursue peace building initiatives by people in the 
country in question. They could provide small repayable loans, 
such as those of the Grameen Bank, to groups which are being 
subjected to human rights abuse or where economic levers are 
being used to push them down economically.
<P>
<B>(1755)</B>
<P>
	Sanctions must be used very carefully so as not to harm those 
who will suffer the most in these conflagrations.
<P>
	Another approach which is not used often enough is to freeze the 
assets of leaders who are flagrantly abusing the rights of their 
citizens. This can be done to great effect. Unless we employ 
measures that will directly affect these leaders where it counts, in 
their pocketbooks, there will not be much change in their 
behaviour. This could be applied to such individuals as General 
Abacha of Nigeria, Mr. Moi of Kenya and others. By applying 
financial 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1869"> 1869 </A></B>
<P>
restrictions and freezing their assets, a powerful lever can be 
applied to their behaviour.
<P>
	Implicit in this are changes to the UN Security Council. The way 
it is structured now, these suggestions cannot and will not work. I 
suggest expanding the United Nations Security Council to involve 
the top 32 economic countries in the world. Many would argue that 
it is unfair. The reality is that he who pays the piper calls the tune 
and that is the premise it has to be based on. It is not fair, but it is 
certainly better than what we have today. We must also provide that 
there is no veto power. All decisions of the security council must be 
made with a two-thirds majority.
<P>
	These changes are necessary. We cannot use the 1940s model of 
international co-operation which has failed to deal with the present 
geopolitical situation in the world which does not resemble the 
world situation of 1945. The current structure has hamstrung our 
ability to pursue peace and avoid the genocide we are talking about 
today.
<P>
	Some would argue that the aggressive interventions I have 
addressed today are not going to be useful and they are not allowed, 
that they are somehow illegal. That is simply not true. The United 
Nations Declaration of Human Rights presupposes that a nation's 
affairs are not sacrosanct. What is sacrosanct are the basic human 
rights of the individual. In other words, international law protects 
the individual, not the integrity of the nation state. That should be a 
very important consideration if these changes are to be made.
<P>
	There is also an economic rationale for early intervention in 
these areas to prevent a conflict rather than managing the conflict 
at a later time. We only need to look at the statistics of the last five 
years to see that peacekeeping costs have skyrocketed way out of 
proportion and the demands on peacekeeping are going to increase 
in the future. We cannot allow this to happen. It is simply not 
sustainable. Therefore, these conflicts must be prevented.
<P>
	All countries, Canada included, are hamstrung by their current 
economic situation, their debts and deficits. We do not have the 
money to get involved in these conflicts. The time is coming when 
we will not be able to carry out peacekeeping duties which our 
military men and women have done so admirably, honourably and 
bravely for so long.
<P>
	I suggest that Canada cannot do this herself. Canada has an 
international reputation for fairness and good diplomatic initiatives 
which is unrivalled in the world. Canada is known to be fair and 
above board, unlike many other countries. We ought to bring like 
minded nations, such as New Zealand, Australia, Norway, Sweden, 
The Netherlands and Belgium, together as a group and then try to 
influence international structures around the world for peace 
building. As I said, we cannot do this alone. We have to do this in a 
multinational fashion. We can get these groups together right now 
to start.
<P>
<B>(1800)</B>
<P>
	If we are to have peace we will need all parties involved in a 
potential conflagration on board. We cannot deny any one group 
representing the people. We have to also pursue democratic and 
judicial peace building initiatives in a potential conflagration.
<P>
	Another issue we are avoiding in peace building is the economic 
issue. A country will never be able to get on its feet unless the 
economic structures are there for the people to stand on their own 
two feet and provide for themselves.
<P>
	The former Yugoslavia is an excellent case in point. The Dayton 
peace plan which produced the international implementation force 
there today is a noble and good solution for the short term. It will 
not, though, provide peace in Bosnia in the long term. The reason is 
unless the people in Bosnia can have the economic infrastructure 
and can then stand on their own two feet and provide for 
themselves we will always have conflict. We will always have 
people struggling to get the basic necessities for themselves that 
are simply not there.
<P>
	When the basic necessities are not there then we have a desperate 
population which is prepared and willing by necessity to whatever 
it has to do to get those basic needs met. That includes conflict.
<P>
	Those have to be provided. We cannot do it ourselves, and I am 
not suggesting that. The international community must work with 
the nations involved and the belligerents involved to build up the 
infrastructure. In the former Yugoslavia a greater responsibility 
must be placed on the shoulders of the European Union.
<P>
	The world has seen the proliferation of internecine conflicts. 
They have littered the face of the globe over the last 50 years. The 
international community has been completely unable to prevent 
conflict. We have managed it sometimes well, sometimes poorly, 
but we have neglected and have been unable to prevent the 
genocides from occurring.
<P>
	We can do this and we must do it. I have given some suggestions 
I hope the Minister of Foreign Affairs will take into consideration. 
The way to sell this not only to the Canadian people but also other 
countries is not only on the basis of humanitarian grounds, which 
are ample, but on the basis of self-interest.
<P>
	Unfortunately we will not be able to get anything done unless we 
argue in a nation's self-interest. If we do not prevent conflicts 
nation states are laid waste, we have migration of refugees, we 
have increasing demands on our defence forces, our foreign aid and 
our domestic social programs. These are costs that hit home. We 
can prevent these. It takes an investment now but the saving in the 
long term will be far greater than the investment we do today.

	<B>Mr. Michel Daviault (Ahuntsic, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like 
to congratulate the member on his speech, on his knowledge of 
international law and on the excellent suggestions he made for 
reforms to our international institutions. As this debate is winding 
down, I would like to remind my hon. colleagues that the entire 
Canadian Armenian community and members of the Armenian 
National Committee of Canada are watching us today. And I salute 
those who are present in the gallery. As the hon. member was 
saying, words without action are meaningless.
<P>
<B>(1805)</B>
<P>
	In a few minutes we will be called upon to vote in various 
divisions on the proposal I put forward. We have achieved much 
today through this sensitization to the cause of the Armenians, the 
history of peoples and the history of humanity. But words have 
meaning.
<P>
	I therefore salute the member's party for intervening to prevent 
the watering down of the motion and to prevent our calling a 
tragedy what is a genocide. I would like to hear him a little more on 
this attempt at watering down in particular.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Martin (Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca):</B> Mr. Speaker, what 
we are trying to do in the House is apply the tragedy that occurred 
in Armenia in 1915 to what is occurring today and what will occur 
in the future.
<P>
	I hope the purpose for this motion is not only to mourn, to 
commemorate and to teach all of us what occurred in the past, but 
to use this and other genocides such as what occurred in Europe 
during the Holocaust and in Cambodia during the vicious regime of 
Pol Pot to build for the future a constructive, formalized plan for 
Canada and its neighbours in the international community to 
prevent these events from occurring again.
<P>
	As I have said before, the people who have died during the 
genocides in the past, their lives will have been wasted for little if 
we do not act today. It is incumbent on all of us to act on history by 
making the future a better, stronger and more peaceful future for all 
people.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Marlene Catterall (Ottawa West, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
debate today has been a very high level debate, one which restores 
to the public the sense that this is a place to deal with important and 
significant issues not only for our own country but for all of 
humanity.
<P>
	I particularly appreciated the comment from my colleague 
opposite concerning the need for this to not just be a day in memory 
of tragic events throughout the history of mankind but a day of 
dedication to action.
<P>
	I want to pay tribute to my colleague from Don Valley North who 
first brought forward this type of motion at this time last year. He is 
quite gratified by the nature of the debate that has taken place in the 
House.
<P>
	There is no question genocide in a number of forms throughout 
history has been one of the primary manifestations of the 
inhumanity people can exercise toward one another.
<P>
	I ask my colleague if he would not agree that crimes against 
humanity go beyond genocide, that they take numerous forms. 
Certainly war crimes would be some of those. The deliberate 
starvation of people and the deliberate disruption of people from 
their homes would also be part of crimes against humanity. These 
are all tragedies.
<P>
	I prefer the wording before us in the amendment. It refers much 
more broadly to crimes against humanity and to the tragedy of such 
events. I wonder why the member wants to focus in by narrowing 
the description to genocide.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Martin (Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca):</B> Mr. Speaker, I think 
implicit in this statement is the idea that this motion not deals with 
not only genocide but other inhumane tragedies that are occurring 
as we speak.
<P>
<B>(1810)</B>
<P>
	She alluded to a number of very important ones, from the rape of 
innocent civilian women in the former Yugoslavia to forced 
starvation and summary executions and torture in far away places 
such as East Timor, Chechnya and the Sudan. All of these are 
taking place today. We need today as a stepping stone to deal with 
genocide and also to deal with these other inhumanities.
<P>
	I know there are many good ideas in the House today that can be 
applied to the genocides of yesterday and the genocides of 
tomorrow and also to deal with these multiple inhumanities that 
litter the globe today.
<P>
	Again it requires early intervention. Prevention is better than 
dealing with actions after they have occurred. I welcome the hon. 
member and any other members to come together through perhaps 
the committee on foreign affairs or directly through the Minister of 
Foreign Affairs to put forth many of the good suggestions they 
have where Canada can take a leadership role in addressing these 
tragic inhumane situations.
<P>
	We live in a democracy today. We have that amazing freedom to 
put forth these ideas and to translate these ideas into action. I have 
no doubt that some of the fine ideas put forth today and some of the 
big problems my hon. friend has alluded to can be dealt with and  
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1871"> 1871 </A></B>
<P>
addressed. Canada can take a leadership role in putting those forth 
in the international theatre.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Philippe Paré (Louis-Hébert, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I, too, 
want to thank and commend the hon. member for Esquimalt-Juan 
de Fuca for his speech.
<P>
	Reform members have often had a narrow view of things, but not 
in this case. I think the hon. member who just spoke managed to 
open up the debate, to talk about genocide, which is at the heart of 
the motion before us today. He managed to extend the debate to the 
broad issue of human rights.
<P>
	Today's debate allowed us, I think, to address issues of vital 
importance for the future of humankind. There are still major 
issues we barely spoke about. In my car this morning, I was 
listening to a news report that there are now one million 
antipersonnel mines around the world. Given how slowly they are 
being removed, they said it would take 1,000 years to remove them 
all. What is really sad is that such mines are still being laid. I can 
only conclude that the work will never end.
<P>
	Yesterday, there was another news report on CBC about child 
soldiers. In Liberia, children who are only 7, 8 or 10 years old are 
being asked to murder people, something the military are 
sometimes reluctant to do for fear of the consequences. So they 
send children instead. My colleague from the Reform Party also 
talked about a reform of the Security Council. I think this may help 
resolve some of the problems being debated today.
<P>
	I would like to end with a question. The hon. member mentioned 
at one point in his comments that we could use our economic levers 
to intervene in conflicts. Does he not agree that, by setting a foreign 
policy that is totally focused on trade, the Canadian government 
has deprived itself of some of the levers available to it in the past?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Martin (Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca):</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the hon. member for the question. I absolutely agree with him that 
the government has in part abrogated its responsibility by putting 
trade above human rights.
<P>
	They are not mutually exclusive principles. They can occur hand 
in hand. You do not have to abrogate your responsibilities to the 
businesses in this country by just dealing with human rights 
because it is not fair to them.
<P>
	However, to ignore human rights ignores that constructive, 
effective and economic interactions between countries is 
predicated on peace. If you do not have peace you will not have 
trade. Therefore both are two parts of the same whole and both can 
be dealt with in co-operation. I think the international community 
and the business sector must have a vested interest in peace 
building. I know the government can deal with both without the 
exclusion of the other.
<P>
<B>(1815)</B>

[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Osvaldo Nunez (Bourassa, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased 
to participate in this debate on the Armenian genocide and I want to 
salute my Armenian friends from Montreal who are in the gallery.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> And from Toronto.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Nunez:</B> Yes, my friends from Toronto and throughout 
Canada.
<P>
	Needless to say I strongly support the Bloc Quebecois motion, 
which states that, on the occasion of the 81st anniversary of the 
Armenian genocide that started on April 24, 1915, this House and 
the federal government recognize the week of April 20 to 27 of 
each year as the week to commemorate man's inhumanity to man.
<P>
	I cannot support the government's amendment, as this was a 
genocide, not a tragedy. The extermination of one and a half 
million human beings is not a simple tragedy, it is a genocide. I 
commend my hon. colleague, the member for Ahuntsic, a riding 
next to mine, for the great work he has done on this issue.
<P>
	As you know, I was born in Latin America, an area that has gone 
through dictatorships and civil wars, which have resulted in 
millions of murders, disappearances and blatant violations of the 
most basic human rights. I am therefore very sensitive to the ordeal 
the Armenian people have gone through. This people has been 
persecuted for centuries, but one event defies the imagination: the 
genocide that took the lives of one and a half million Armenian 
men, women and children between 1915 and 1917. I should point 
out that these were unarmed and often defenceless civilians.
<P>
	During this tragic period of our history, more than 2,000 
churches and 200 monasteries were desecrated, while half a million 
survivors were exiled and forced to live in foreign countries and 
with foreign cultures. Unfortunately, no reparation has taken place 
and no action has been taken against those responsible for this 
genocide.
<P>
	Armenians are now scattered all around the world, in the United 
States, Canada, Egypt, Iraq, Iran, France, Lebanon, Syria and so 
on. But half of them are still living in Armenia. Canada's cultural 
heritage has been enriched by the arrival of 60,000 Armenians, I 
am told, 25,000 of whom live in Quebec.
<P>
	As an immigrant myself and in my capacity as the official 
opposition critic for citizenship and immigration, I want to salute 
all our fellow citizens of Armenian origin and to recognize their 
most valuable contributions to Canada and Quebec. It is a very 
active and dynamic community whose members are present in all 
sectors of society, including economy, trade, social and community 
organizations, culture and politics.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1872"> 1872 </A></B>
<P>
	I take this opportunity to salute the hon. member for Don Valley 
North, who is the first member of Armenian origin to sit in this 
House. As you know, I am the first member of Latin American 
origin to sit in Parliament. We share the same responsibility and 
honour.
<P>
	The Armenian community is well integrated to its host country 
and it is also well structured. It has its own schools, churches and 
cultural centres. In spite of the hardships, Armenians managed to 
preserve their language, culture, traditions and values. Last 
Sunday, I delivered a speech in Saint-Laurent's Alex Manoogian 
school, during the commemoration of the 81st anniversary of the 
Armenian genocide.
<P>
<B>(1820)</B>
<P>
	I was very touched when a wreath was laid in honour of the 
martyrs by a man of over 85 years of age, who was a survivor of 
that genocide in Armenia, in 1915.
<P>
	I am proud that the Government of Quebec and the National 
Assembly recognized the Armenian genocide, as did Ontario, 
Russia, Israel and the European Parliament. I am also pleased by 
the attitude and the action of Uruguay's president, who took part in 
a ceremony to commemorate this genocide.
<P>
	As for the UN committee on the prevention of discrimination 
and the protection of minorities, it adopted, on August 29, 1985, a 
report which states that the 1915 extermination of Armenians is an 
example of genocide.
<P>
	Meanwhile, the Canadian government merely deplored the fact 
that a large number of Armenians were killed during the wars that 
marked the end of the Ottoman empire, and extended its sympathy 
to the Armenian community. Given its tradition of democracy and 
respect for human rights, I hope that, some day, Canada will 
formally and clearly recognize the Armenian genocide. Why is the 
Canadian government waiting to make this long-awaited decision 
by Armenians and, I think, by Quebecers and Canadians as well? 
The government should stop making speeches and start taking 
concrete action. Even senator Bob Dole, who is now a candidate to 
the U.S. presidency, criticized Turkey for refusing to recognize the 
Armenian genocide.
<P>
	I also want to express my support for the construction of a 
memorial for the Armenian martyrs by the city of Montreal. Mayor 
Pierre Bourque promised to erect such a monument in 
Marcelin-Wilson park, at the corner of Henri-Bourassa and 
l'Acadie boulevards, not far from my riding. The ground was 
broken for it in a ceremony on April 22, 1995 attended by various 
VIPs but then, seemingly as a result of pressures from the Turkish 
and Canadian governments, the work was stopped.
<P>
	It must be noted, however, that such monuments are already in 
place in a number of cities throughout the world, in France, 
Lebanon, the United States, Switzerland, Colombia, Argentina, 
even in Toronto and  Ville-St-Laurent in Canada. There are plans in 
Los Angeles to build an Armenian genocide museum. I therefore 
appeal to the mayor of Montreal to keep his promise to erect a 
monument to the Armenian martyrs.
<P>
	I would like to take advantage of this opportunity to point out the 
worrisome state of human rights in the world. According to 
Amnesty International, torture is still practiced in more than one 
hundred countries. Basic human rights are being violated in 
Liberia, Algeria, Indonesia, China and other countries. Despite 
some improvements in Latin America, Amnesty International, the 
Inter-American Commission on Human Rights, and a number of 
NGOs have condemned certain countries' use of torture, violence, 
repression, forced relocation of indigenous communities, the 
emergence of paramilitary groups, disappearances and impunity.
<P>
	I feel it is my duty to condemn in this House the contradictions 
and lack of cohesiveness in the Canadian government's record in 
promoting democracy and human rights. When the Liberals were in 
opposition, they had a great deal to say about it, but now they are in 
power, they place trade before human rights.
<P>
	This government does nothing to dissuade Canadian companies 
that invest in countries that do not respect human rights. It ought to 
follow the example of the European Union, which has taken such 
actions as making it illegal to import rugs that have been made by 
child labour.
<P>
	The Canadian government ought to ensure that its trade 
agreements include clauses on the respect of human rights. It must 
be realized that repressive governments lead to instability, which is 
not propitious to trade and to investment.
<P>
	I thank the Armenian community for marking, each year, the sad 
anniversary of this genocide. It has all my admiration and esteem, 
and deservedly so, for its struggle, its courage, its faithfulness to its 
language, its culture and its traditions.
<P>
	It has not forgotten, nor will it ever forget, this tragic event. I 
support its efforts and tenacity in persuading the international 
community to do justice to its nation. I salute all those of Armenian 
origin, and offer them my sympathy and my undying solidarity.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Sarkis Assadourian (Don Valley North, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I take this opportunity to thank those who participated in 
this debate. It is the first time this issue has been debated in 
Canadian history.
<P>
	I also want to thank the parties involved, in this case the Bloc 
Quebecois, the Reform Party and the Liberal Party. I regret that the 
NDP and the Progressive Conservative Party did not participate in 
the debate.
<P>
	I think it is incumbent on all of us to stand for one moment of 
silence for the victims of genocide.

<B>(1915)</B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	A motion to adjourn the House under Standing Order 38 deemed 
to have been moved.
<P>
<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="FEDNOR">FEDNOR</A></H4>
	<B>Mr. Andy Mitchell (Parry Sound-Muskoka, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, many of the constituents in my riding of Parry 
Sound-Muskoka are directly affected by recent changes to 
FEDNOR programming. As a new initiative, this will have a 
positive impact on their businesses.
<P>
	I wholeheartedly support the government's renewed 
commitment to regional economic development in northern 
Ontario. The budget for this program is being increased to $60 
million over three years. The government is assuring that this 
money is being wisely invested on programs and services that work 
to increase the economic and employment potential in northern 
Ontario.
<P>
	In his response to my initial question, the Parliamentary 
Secretary to the Minister of Industry referenced an approximate 
fivefold leveraging of money from Canada's financial institutions 
to help get capital into the hands of northern Ontario's small 
business men and women.
<P>
	This partnering is an excellent example of how government and 
the private sector can work together for the benefit of small 
businesses. This is very good news for northern Ontario. Improved 
access to capital constantly dominates small business' wish list. It 
is one very important part of the recently announced FEDNOR 
initiative and is an improvement that my colleagues and I in 
northern Ontario worked very hard to see implemented.
<P>
	The government has also worked persistently to get more money 
into the hands of Canada's small business men and women so they 
in turn can invest in their businesses, expand their services and 
most importantly, hire fellow Canadians.
<P>
	The government's renewed FEDNOR initiative emphasizes 
working with private and public sector partners to facilitate in five 
specific areas: access to capital which I mentioned; enhanced 
business competitiveness; community economic development; 
networking, and providing a stronger regional voice for the north.
<P>
	This emphasis on developing specific tools for northern Ontario 
businesses is of critical importance in the communities in my 
riding and in communities across northern Ontario. I strongly 
support the partnership approach in the new initiative which creates 
<P>

<B><A NAME="1881"> 1881 </A></B>
<P>
an  environment in which small businesses can create wealth and 
jobs in northern Ontario.
<P>
	It is also significant to note that not only are the programs being 
improved but service delivery is being made more efficient. 
FEDNOR's operating expenditures will be reduced by 40 per cent.
<P>
	The existing Community Futures development corporation will 
become a major delivery component of this program, making 
highly effective use of resources that are already in place in 
northern Ontario. These organizations will be provided new capital 
and given the tools to attract additional private sector investment.
<P>
	Also, the new FEDNOR program will be providing up to $4 
million in direct investment in tourism, another very important 
component of the economy in my riding of Parry 
Sound-Muskoka. This will be done through co-operative 
marketing initiatives and through the development of specialty 
tourism packages and training.
<P>
	The government cares about northern Ontario. It understands its 
role to create an environment in which the small business 
community of northern Ontario can create jobs. The changes to 
FEDNOR demonstrate this Liberal government's commitment to a 
jobs and growth agenda.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Morris Bodnar (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Industry, Minister for the Atlantic Canada Opportunities 
Agency and Minister of Western Economic Diversification, 
Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, in 1995 a major conference was organized in 
Timmins on the economic development needs of northern Ontario. 
Over 200 northern Ontario stakeholders attended.
<P>
	The results of the conference were analysed by expert groups 
that formulated recommendations which were further refined by 
regional sounding boards comprising a cross section of regional 
interests.
<P>
	The new FEDNOR will work closely with all existing regional 
economic development stakeholders, including the province. It 
seeks to create a permanent set of local capabilities to support jobs 
and growth while reducing overlap and duplication. Under the new 
FEDNOR, small businesses will have better access to the 
information, services and capital they need to be successful.
<P>
<B>(1920)</B>
<P>
	FEDNOR will increase the availability of capital in northern 
Ontario by forming partnerships with financial institutions to 
provide new forms of higher risk financing of small businesses. It 
will also provide additional capital to community futures 
development corporations to further develop their micro-lending 
programs.
<P>
	Finally, FEDNOR will provide start-up financing for emerging, 
innovative small businesses as well as for such activities as 
non-bankable R and D specialized training.
<P>
	FEDNOR remains a work in progress which will continue to 
evolve to meet the needs of northern  Ontario. Future priorities 
include programs to address the equity and quasi-equity needs of 
intermediate small businesses having difficulty attracting venture 
capital, initiatives to meet the special needs of aboriginal 
entrepreneurs and northern Ontario's francophone communities 
and measures to improve the economic prospects of women and 
youth.
<P>
<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="FISHERIES">FISHERIES</A></H4>
	<B>Hon. Charles Caccia (Davenport, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, in 
essence this intervention is to urge the Minister of Fisheries and 
Oceans not to give away key federal powers.
<P>
	Let me explain. Last week I asked the Minister of Fisheries and 
Oceans not to delegate to the provinces section 35(2) of the 
Fisheries Act. In brief, this section prohibits the harmful 
alternation, disruption or destruction of fish habitat unless 
authorized by the minister or under regulations.
<P>
	If section 35(2) is delegated to the provinces it could no longer 
serve as a trigger for the Canadian Environmental Assessment Act. 
The result would be less protection for our streams, our shorelines 
and wetlands when it comes to the environmental assessment 
process.
<P>
	Instead the suggestion is being made that environmental 
assessment be carried out only on large projects, as some are 
proposing. I submit this is not desirable because dealing with large 
projects only means that the cumulative effect of small projects 
would not be taken into account.
<P>
	In the past the government has, on occasion, delegated certain 
powers under the Fisheries Act to the provinces but it should be 
cautious and learn from experience. For example, in his 1990 
report the auditor general points out that when powers were 
delegated to the provinces for monitoring and enforcement of 
mining effluent regulations under the Fisheries Act, compliance 
fell from 85 per cent in 1982 to 48 per cent in 1988.
<P>
	This poor track record is now compounded by the fact that some 
provincial governments such as the Harris government in Ontario 
are deeply cutting their ministries of the environment and natural 
resources. These are the ministries that would be charged with 
monitoring and enforcing the federal powers such as the protection 
of freshwater fish habitat under section 35(2).
<P>
	For example, the Ontario government is cutting 752 staff from 
the Ministry of the Environment and Energy and 2,170 from the 
Ministry of Natural Resources. Furthermore, with the 
implementation of Bill 26 and the repeal of the Planning Act 
legislation, the Harris government has effectively eliminated 
protection for environmentally significant areas in the province of 
Ontario.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="1882"> 1882 </A></B>
<P>
	In light of this massive dismantling of environmental 
regulations, can the minister of state responsible for natural 
resources assure the House that he and the  government will not 
give away section 35(2) of the Fisheries Act and actually retain that 
section as a federal power so that the trigger offered by the 
Canadian Environmental Assessment Act will not be lost and its 
benefits to the Canadian population and future natural resources 
not damaged?
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Fernand Robichaud (Secretary of State (Agriculture 
and Agri-Food, Fisheries and Oceans), Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
Department of Fisheries and Oceans administers a piece of 
legislation, the Fisheries Act, which contains very broad 
prohibitions against the destruction of fish and their habitat. In 
simple terms, no one can modify a fish habitat without being 
authorized to do so by the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, which, 
by the way, is the only one empowered to grant such authorizations.
<P>
	Many human activities can alter fish habitat, from the 
construction of a culvert to the damming of large rivers to generate 
electricity.
<P>
	Reviewing development proposals to determine their potential 
impact on fish habitat is a key component of DFO's habitat 
management program. Like all other DFO activities, this program 
is being assessed as part of the program review.
<P>
	In other words, the department asked itself if maintaining this 
function was justified. The provinces are also reviewing a number 
of these development proposals according to their own legislation 
on the environment as well as on land and water use.
<P>
	The Department of Fisheries and Oceans wondered whether its 
was appropriate for two levels of government to be involved in 
projects of such little significance as building a drainage trench or 
if efforts should not be made instead to identify any potential areas 
of duplication and overlap with a view to eliminating them. I think 
that the choice was obvious.
<P>
	As the hon. member knows, this government's intention to take a 
more efficient approach to freshwater fish habitat management in 
closer partnership with the provinces was clearly stated in the 
speech from the throne. The challenge now facing all levels of 
government will be to identify those sectors where activities can be 
streamlined while at the same time ensuring the level of protection 
that we all want for the environment in general and fisheries 
resources in particular.
<P>
	To conclude, I can assure the hon. member that the government 
attaches and will continue to attach great importance to the 
protection of fish habitat and to the integrity of the environmental 
assessment process.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> The motion to adjourn the 
House is now deemed to have been adopted.
<P>
	Accordingly, the House stands adjourned until tomorrow at2 p.m., pursuant to Standing Order 24.
<P>
	(The House adjourned at 7.27 p.m.)
