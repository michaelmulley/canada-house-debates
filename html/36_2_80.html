enforcement environment in Canada's marketplace and to enhance 
protection for business and consumers from anti-competitive 
activities.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Specifically, the bill will modernize current provisions on 
conspiracy to avoid discouraging strategic alliances, enable 
individuals to apply to the Competition Tribunal in cases of 
refusal to deal, exclusive dealing, tied selling and market 
restrictions, provide a new power to make temporary orders 
halting anti-competitive acts and broaden the powers to the 
tribunal to include cost awards and summary dispositions.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Charles Caccia (Davenport, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
would like to table a number of petitions from constituents and 
citizens at large, residents of Canada, who are asking parliament 
and the House in particular to pay attention to the fact that 
there is child poverty in this country.  They remind us of the 
unanimous resolution of November 24, 1989 to end child poverty 
and are asking parliament to fulfil this promise to end child 
poverty by the year 2000.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Art Hanger (Calgary Northeast, Canadian Alliance):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I have several petitions to present today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first set of petitions, which contains 786 signatures, calls 
upon parliament to enact legislation to establish a pedophile 
registry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second group of petitions contains 249 signatures. The 
petitioners seek the protection of the communities and children 
in our country and ask parliament to pass legislation to prevent 
the release from lawful custody of anyone convicted for a second 
time of a sexual offence against a minor person. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The third set of petitions contains 75 signatures. The petitioners 
call upon parliament to eliminate the right of a convicted 
pedophile to be let out of jail on bail pending an appeal.  This 
would thereby ensure the protection and safety of the victims and 
the community from a convicted sexual offender.

a number of people from British Columbia who are concerned about 
the undemocratic nature of the Senate and the fact that it is the

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>PROCEEDS OF CRIME (MONEY LAUNDERING) ACT 
</H3><P align=left>

<A NAME="LINK32">&nbsp;</A>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed from April 5 consideration of the motion that 
Bill C-22, an act to facilitate combatting the laundering of 
proceeds of crime, to establish the financial transactions and 
reports analysis centre of Canada and to amend and repeal certain 
acts in consequence, be read the second time and referred to a 
committee. 
<P><A NAME="LINK33"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough, PC):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I am very pleased to continue debate with respect to 
this very important piece of legislation, Bill C-22, which deals 
with money laundering. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Money laundering poses a great challenge these days to law 
enforcement agents in their battle against organized crime.  For 
example, a few months ago in the United States, American 
officials discovered the biggest money laundering operation ever 
in the history of the United States.  Federal investigators 
believe that Russian gangsters had channelled up to $10 billion 
through the Bank of New York, the 15th largest bank in the United 
States. This news sent extreme shock waves throughout the entire 
financial services sector and proved that money laundering can 
certainly affect even the big banks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is vital that we get more aggressive in the fight against 
money laundering and give law enforcement agencies better tools 
to do their job.  For Canadians to feel a sense of security and 
faith, we must arm our police agencies with all the necessary 
resources to make sure they can take up their fight against 
organized crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada has continued to come under heavy criticism in recent 
years as a result of being identified as an easy place for 
criminal organizations to launder money.  Criminals have found 
Canada as an attractive place to hide large financial 
transactions because of our proximity to the United States, our 
stable political system, the high volume of cross-border 
transactions and because the odds of being caught in this country 
are lower than in other jurisdictions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberal government has been talking about tougher reporting 
rules for at least three years.  As far back as May 1996 federal 
officials said that they were considering a mandatory reporting 
system.  This was reported in the <I>Financial Post</I> on May 3, 
1996. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Globally, approximately $3 billion to $5 billion American in 
criminally diverted funds enter the international capital markets 
annually.  The federal government estimates between $5 billion 
and $17 billion in criminal proceeds are laundered in Canada each 
year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-22 was first introduced in May 1999 as Bill C-81 which 
died on the order paper when parliament prorogued.  It was one of 
the many pieces of legislation that were victims of partisan 
proceedings and manoeuvres by the government. Currently Canada 
has money laundering legislation, the Proceeds of Crime (Money 
Laundering) Act which was passed in 1991 as a Progressive 
Conservative initiative. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a backward glance, the G-7 Financial Action Task Force 
established in 1989 drafted 40 recommendations aimed at enhancing 
and co-ordinating the international effort against money 
laundering. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>According to that task force, the major weakness of Canada's 
current legislation which was passed in 1991 is the inability to 
effectively and efficiently respond to requests for assistance in 
relation to restraint and forfeiture.  The use of domestic money 
laundering proceedings to seize, restrain and forfeit the 
proceeds of offences committed in other countries is recognized 
as sometimes ineffective.  Legislation to allow Canada to enforce 
its responsibilities in foreign forfeiture requests is needed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The task force also recommended that mandatory reporting 
requirements be legislated.  Currently the reporting transactions 
in Canada are voluntary.  A financial intelligence unit should be 
established to deal with the collection, management, analysis and 
dissemination of suspicious reports and other relevant 
intelligence data. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many of these recommendations are embodied in Bill C-22 which 
proposes to bolster Canada's anti-money laundering efforts by 
requiring mandatory reporting by financial agencies of 
information relating to certain types of transactions. This 
information would then be sent to a central data gathering and 
analysis body, the financial transactions reporting and analysis 
centre of Canada.  This would be an independent government body 
which would be separate from the RCMP but presumably would work 
closely with all law enforcement agencies.

<A HREF="#LINKT5"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The disclosure of information by the centre would then be 
strictly controlled. The centre would be authorized to provide 
key identifying information of suspicious transactions, for 
example, the name, date, account number and value of transaction, 
to the appropriate police force as it has the reasonable grounds 
to suspect that the information would be relevant to investigate 
and prosecute if money laundering offences have occurred. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is also subject to restrictions set out in other 
legislation, for example the Privacy Act and the Access to 
Information Act.  This same information may be provided to 
Revenue Canada, the Canadian Security Intelligence Service, 
Citizenship and Immigration Canada or other relevant agencies. 
It would also be relevant, for example, to tax evasion offences 
or threats to national security. For the police to have access to 
additional information from the centre, they would first have to 
obtain a court order for disclosure and meet with the standard of 
reasonable and probable grounds that applies to all offences. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This mandatory reporting is a step certainly in the right 
direction.  The new law would require individuals or entities 
importing, exporting or transporting currency or monetary 
instruments in excess of $10,000 across the border to report all 
activities to Canada Customs.  Failure to do so would result in 
the seizure of the cash or monetary instruments being 
transported. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill does not however define what is and what is not a 
suspicious transaction, nor has the government yet published its 
draft regulations.  These will certainly flesh out the substance 
of the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The current system of voluntary reporting of suspicious 
transactions would be replaced with mandatory procedures. 
Reporting requirements would apply to regulated financial 
institutions, casinos, currency exchange businesses, as well as 
any individuals acting as financial intermediaries, such as 
lawyers or accountants.  These individuals would therefore be 
required to file reports for certain categories of financial 
transactions, as well as any transaction where there is 
reasonable grounds to suspect that the transaction is related to 
the commission of a money laundering offence.  Making ill-gotten 
gains essentially appear legitimate is what is at the root cause 
of money laundering and it is an attempt to wash or cleanse this 
dirty money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There has been great concern in legal circles over the issue of 
solicitor-client privilege and confidentiality.  Lawyers and 
accountants acting as intermediaries would have to report 
suspicious financial transactions carried out by their clients or 
face stiff fines and possible prison sentences.  The Criminal 
Lawyers' Association in particular said that this kind of 
reporting violates guarantees of reasonable search and seizure 
under the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.  Alan Gold of 
that association states that the bill ignores these concerns. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Certainly ethical considerations already apply for all lawyers 
and accountants. I would suggest that the reasonable person test 
would be applied and that there is a greater good at issue here. 
That greater good is to ensure that we do everything we can to 
dissuade individuals who would be trying to embark on this type 
of criminal activity so that we can eradicate it.  Certainly 
there can be a common ground and a middle ground that would 
satisfy the constitutional requirements of freedom of expression 
and freedom from unreasonable search. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Penalties for failing to report suspicious transactions are 
quite heavy.  They can be up to $2 million and imprisonment for 
five years. This certainly expresses the seriousness and the 
punitive sanctions reflect this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Americans have already moved in this direction with their 
own tough new law on money laundering.  They are very concerned 
about Canada's approach to crime prevention, particularly since 
the government changed in 1993.  There must be some attempt to at 
least have a degree of co-operation and parity with the steps the 
United States has taken. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberal government has given the Americans much evidence to 
validate their concerns. In December 1999 a U.S. customs officer 
discovered an Algerian Canadian with Algerian terrorist 
connections attempting to enter the United States through Seattle 
with a carload of explosives.  In February 2000 the American 
government suspended firearms and ammunition sales to Canada, 
which was done at the request of our government.  Legal import 
licences were being used to import large quantities of handguns, 
rifles and ammunition.  The firearms were then being smuggled 
into other countries and often back into the United States. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is an embarrassment for our country.   We cannot have the 
reputation of being soft on crime.  It is another blow to the 
relationship that we have, in particular with respect to the open 
border relationship with the United States. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since 1993 the Liberal government has talked about increasing 
penalties for money laundering as a matter of increasing public 
safety. 
Yet the RCMP still very much lacks a proper budget to deal with 
today's sophisticated criminal.  For example, the budget this 
year saw $810 million spread over three years, much of it being 
earmarked to fight organized crime, including activities such as 
money laundering. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1115"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT6"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us put this into perspective.  Some 62% of this new money 
will not be available until 2001-02.  This will be added to the 
RCMP base budget of approximately $2.1 million.  We suggest this 
is still not enough. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mounties already have to curtail their undercover operations 
which target organized crime, along with a reduction in training. 
The inability to conduct proper fraud investigations in British 
Columbia has been highlighted, as has the important issue of 
inadequate resources. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To correct these problems the Progressive Conservative Party is 
proposing that over 5,000 RCMP officers are needed.  As well, 
there is a lack of staff at forensic laboratories needed to 
analyze DNA data and other data that has to be placed on the CPIC 
system.  The police forces need to know that this quickly 
advancing technology will be incorporated into their services, 
yet the government will not commit enough money to even upgrade 
the new CPIC system.  It gave $115 million when it was clearly 
indicated by the RCMP that $283 million was needed to bring it up 
to snuff. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The British Columbia mounties may shift away from organized 
crime to deal with more pressing needs such as filling police 
vacancies and simply paying their officers to show up for work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In rural areas this is of extreme concern.  There is a problem 
with RCMP detachments being closed, or losing municipal police 
forces in small communities.  Granby, in the riding of Shefford, 
is facing this threat.  At the same time, we know that biker 
gangs are terrorizing farmers, forcing them to grow marijuana in 
their fields, and even threatening members of the House of 
Commons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is part of a larger problem.  The financial transactions 
and reports analysis centre is certainly a welcome relief to one 
aspect of the ongoing struggle that the RCMP faces in trying to 
protect Canadians, but the RCMP is being stretched to the limit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must guard against the beginning of a rivalry between 
agencies, such as we have seen taking place between the RCMP and 
CSIS.  The breakdown in communications and not sharing 
information is certainly counterproductive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Department of Finance has set an approximate cost for the 
centre at $10 million per annum to staff and operate.  I suggest 
this is a small price to pay for public safety, especially when 
compared with the over $300 million that the Liberal government 
has already spent on a very inefficient, ineffective and 
discriminatory gun regulation scheme, which is certainly not a 
priority when faced with the ongoing problems of simply staffing 
RCMP detachments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In August 1999 the solicitor general told a meeting of police 
chiefs that this bill was a top priority for the federal 
government.  However, we saw that this bill languished on the 
order paper for some time and it has taken a full seven months 
for it to be presented to the House for debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Reaction from various organizations concerned and affected by 
the legislation has been positive thus far.  The RCMP calls it 
long overdue.  Superintendent Ben Soave, head of the RCMP's 
combined forces and special enforcement unit, said that this 
legislation will make a significant difference. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Gene McLean, director of security for the Canadian Bankers 
Association, has also referred to this legislation as having been 
long awaited by the banking industry.  Organized criminals will 
be less likely to consider bringing their money to Canada as a 
result. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even as we debate this legislation today, criminals are finding 
more and more sophisticated ways to launder money in this 
country.  There are many concerns that the Conservative Party of 
Canada has.  Although we support Bill C-22, there are examples by 
which the legislation could be improved. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Smurfing, which is the practice of breaking down transactions 
into smaller amounts so that they will not be reported, is still 
a way that money launderers have to undermine and come in behind 
this legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are all kinds of new tricks, including dummy corporations 
or avoiding banks by using money transmitters such as Western 
Union and storefront businesses that cash cheques, sell money 
orders or travellers cheques and then exchange them for foreign 
currency. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Progressive Conservative Party of Canada believes very 
strongly that it is time for the government to do more and to be 
more proactive in fighting organized crime. 
Instead of simply being reactive and following the lead of other 
countries, it is time for Canada once again to be a pioneer, to 
step forward and to set an example.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Why is Canada the last G-7 country in the world to implement 
money laundering legislation?  Surely the Minister of Finance, 
while attending meetings around the world, must have been 
embarrassed that we are the last G-7 country to implement such 
anti-money laundering legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Enforcement issues and the burden of investigation continue to 
be top priorities.  Draft regulations are not set out in terms of 
the precise information which will be required with respect to 
disclosure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are all kinds of other ways to improve this legislation. 
What about the exemption for retailers?  The bill aims at 
detecting large cash transactions as an indication of suspicious 
activity.  Why are retailers not required to report purchases 
made with large amounts of cash? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Money laundering frequently takes place in the form of big 
ticket purchases, for example, real estate, boats, cars, 
jewellery, et cetera.  Disclosure issues as well will have to be 
addressed and the centre is only authorized to share information 
with police forces, Canadian Customs, revenue agencies, CSIS and 
Citizenship and Immigration.  There may be others with whom this 
information will need to be shared. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While we certainly acknowledge that this is a step in the right 
direction, we are going to have to try to improve this 
legislation at the committee, and we will endeavour to do so.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Scott Brison (Kings—Hants, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
thank my colleague for his worthwhile intervention this morning 
on Bill C-22. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My question for him is, does the legislation and this new 
agency, and in fact does the government have plans to investigate 
some of the more advanced types of money laundering? I am 
speaking specifically of e-laundering, the ability to transmit 
large amounts of money via technology, the Internet in this case. 
These transactions are almost impossible to track today, and with 
sophisticated financial instruments such as derivatives it will 
become increasingly difficult for governments or regulatory 
agencies to oversee this type of thing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would be concerned if the government did not have a strategy 
to address this in the future because, clearly, with the 
increased sophistication of organized crime in this area, this 
will be a problem; not just for tomorrow, it is probably already 
a problem today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope this legislation does not simply address yesterday's 
problem because of the hesitancy of the government to address the 
issue earlier.  I hope that we are well on the way to addressing 
today's and tomorrow's problem, that is, electronic commerce 
being used as a vehicle to launder money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my 
colleague from Kings—Hants.  I know he is greatly concerned with 
this issue.  Coming from Nova Scotia, which is bounded by a large 
body of water, we often face a great deal of importation, not 
only of money, obviously, but potentially drugs and other 
contraband material. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The question was very probing.  The legislation itself is not 
crafted in such a way to address the specific question with 
respect to e-commerce. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member quite rightly points out that this is very much 
the wave of the future with respect to financial transactions and 
potential criminal activity on the Internet. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The new centre which is being set up, because it will be in its 
infancy, will be very early on faced with the task of trying to 
craft a response, a way to police the Internet in an attempt to 
prevent this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would suggest that establishing the centre is a step in the 
right direction.  Having personnel will be the crucial response 
to the hon. member's question, ensuring that we have individuals 
who are trained, intelligent and up to speed on the latest 
technological advances.  Hopefully the centre, with shared 
resources and with the ability to hear from agencies such as 
those in the United States, will be able to address this serious 
problem in the future. 
<P><A NAME="LINK35"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lynn Myers (Waterloo—Wellington, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I have a long history in this kind of issue.  I sat for 
10 years on the Waterloo Regional Police Commission.  As 
chairman, I can tell members that this was an area of primary 
concern. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We went across Canada and, in fact, went to international 
conferences where we looked at these issues because they were 
very, very important, not only to Canada, but to nations around 
the world.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was quite heartened by the fact that the hon. member opposite 
deemed it appropriate to make his comments.  I know that he has a 
very strong interest in this area.  I congratulate him for some 
of the recognition that he gave to the government with respect to 
the kind of initiative we are taking. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This initiative will require not only physical resources but 
human resources to accomplish the desired result.  I applaud the 
government and members on this side of the House for the kind of 
measures we are taking.  It is always a question of whether we 
should go further or faster, more money, and those kinds of 
issues.  It is often a question of priorities.  However, I think 
at the end of the day Canadians will applaud what the government 
is doing in this very important area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In light of the globalization that is taking place and in light 
of the interconnectedness of the world, does the hon. member see 
that this is a problem which will escalate over time?  I am sure 
he will say yes.  I would like to know his views with respect to 
how best to try to curtail this very severe problem in a 
globalized world.  After all, it is a very severe problem. 
People, no matter where they live in the world, find themselves 
caught in the trap with these kinds of criminal activities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I was chairman of the Waterloo Region Police Commission, 
with 700 police officers and civilians, we went to great lengths 
to look at this issue.  We had symposia and went to places across 
Canada and internationally to see what could be done.  I would be 
very interested in his views because of his background and his 
very strong interest in this area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member 
opposite for his question and his intervention.  I certainly 
acknowledge his similar interest in matters of justice and 
policing around the country.  As a former police officer I am 
sure he appreciates the incredible pressures that frontline 
police officers and those who specialize in areas such as 
organized crime are faced with on a daily basis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also want to acknowledge his commentary with respect to the 
usefulness of the bill.  We in the Progressive Conservative Party 
applaud this government initiative.  In fact, it is a 
continuation of a bill that we put in place when we were in 
government in 1991.  I do not want to get into a partisan rant, 
but we have seen similar instances where the current government 
was not so complimentary of the Progressive Conservative 
government of the day and absolutely castigated the government 
for things such as free trade and the GST, but then, similarly, 
when in office, enhanced, expanded, embraced and took credit for 
bills and legislation put in place by the Progressive 
Conservative government.  We will not follow that path.  We will 
acknowledge that the Liberal government has done the right thing 
by continuing to move in the right direction, which was started 
by a Progressive Conservative government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To address his specific question, this legislation and the 
setting up of this centre will very much put in place a process 
that will allow us to embark on the further information sharing 
that the hon. member referred to, the ability to see what other 
countries are doing, in particular the United States, and to draw 
on the best minds, the best personnel and the best intelligence 
that is available to see that we address this very serious global 
problem to which he referred quite correctly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That and recruiting individuals from the country, keeping our 
very best and brightest here, and offering them opportunities in 
this area is another suggestion that I have as to how we can 
continue to fight this problem and enhance our ability to guard 
against this type of criminal activity that is becoming very much 
a global problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would suggest, and he alluded to it in his question, that it 
has a great deal to do with the personnel and the intellectual 
property that we have to preserve and enhance in the country in 
our attempt to address what is a wonderful opportunity when it 
comes to technology and the Internet and the use of global 
communication, but it is also something that can leave us very 
vulnerable if we are not prepared to put in place the safeguards. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The centre can be a centre of excellence.  It can be a great 
opportunity for those trained in this capacity, and hopefully we 
will, and I have every confidence that we will, continue to 
produce very bright, intelligent people who will be able to help 
us in this task.

Every detachment along the border with Montana in the United

area reported that because of cutbacks they were not able to 
investigate all reported crimes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Knowing that the staff is not available, people are failing to 
report crimes such as break and enter.  The statistics show that 
the crime rate is going down, simply because they are not being 
reported.  I would like the member to comment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I could not agree more 
with the hon. member.  He has made a very useful and very 
straightforward commentary on the task before our law enforcement

our ports and our border police. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This country, if I can make the analogy, is like a big, 
beautiful racehorse and these criminals are like horseflies 
buzzing around it.  We are very much in danger of the parasites 
taking over the host if we do not allow our police agents the 
ability and give them the necessary resources to do something 
about it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must be prepared to take the necessary steps, put the money 
into resources, and when we are made aware of situations like the

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay—Columbia, Canadian Alliance):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, we are debating today Bill C-22, an act to 
facilitate combatting the laundering of proceeds of crime, to 
establish the financial transactions and report analysis centre 
of Canada and to amend and repeal certain acts in consequence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On December 3, 1998, the solicitor general said that early in 
the new year of 1999 the government would introduce legislation 
to curb money laundering.  It did not happen in early 1999.  In 
fact it happened in May 1999, but due to the agenda of the 
government the legislation ended up dying on the order paper. 
This vital legislation, which was supposed to have been 
introduced according to the words of the solicitor general in 
early 1999, was finally reintroduced for passage by the House on 
December 15, 1999, not exactly early 1999. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yesterday the solicitor general came to the standing committee 
on justice and told us that when he had last appeared before the 
committee he said they would do it and now they have done it. 
Yesterday was the first day, one full year after he had been 
there in the first place, that he could sit there and boast about 
the fact that they had done it.  What is involved?  It strikes me 
that if the Liberals were given a hamburger franchise they would 
do away with the term fast food.  I do not understand. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us take a look at an article from the <I>Globe and Mail</I> 
of April 4.  It is important that the government get on with it. 
The article reads: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>“The effect of organized crime can be traced in the smallest, 
most remote communities and in areas as diverse as insurance 
premiums and ice cream retailing”, law enforcement officers told 
a conference that ended yesterday in Montreal.  “For the first 
time, organized crime, serious criminal organizations, are 
actually threatening the democratic institutions of this country 
and the values that we hold dear.  It is a real threat to the way 
of life we have in this country.  It is that serious”. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That was a quote by an RCMP deputy commissioner.  The article 
continues: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—said former Crown prosecutor Louis Dionne, now head of the 
organized crime directorate for the Surete du Quebec, “You can't 
see it.  You can't smell it.  But if you have the misfortune of 
putting your wet fingers in the socket, it'll hurt you”.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is where we are.  I have actually been questioned by 
reporters on its significance, on what money laundering is all 
about.  Although Canada is a member of the Paris based 
international task force against money laundering, it does not 
get good grades from world experts on this problem.  They also 
say that it would be a good idea, perhaps, to set up money 
laundering in Canada because the charges are less and the risks 
are lower. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why has the government delayed and delayed the introduction of 
the bill?  We will be supporting the bill, but the point is that 
we would have supported similar legislation if it had been 
brought in, in a timely manner, two years ago.  The bill will 
leave the House after second reading, go through the committee 
process, come back to the House, go through report and third 
reading stages, and then to the other place for senators to do 
their thing.  Why has there been this delay on legislation which 
I dare say all members of the House would support? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are members of the House of Commons who are threatened by 
organized crime directly and personally.  They and their families 
are directly and personally threatened by organized crime.  How 
close can we get to the bone when even members of the House are 
threatened?  I say shame on government members for taking so long 
to bring in the legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-22 received first reading in the House of Commons on the 
December 15, 1999.  The purpose of the bill is to remedy the 
shortcomings in Canada's anti-money laundering legislation as 
defined in the G-7's financial action task force on money 
laundering in its 1997-98 report which said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The only major weakness is the inability to effectively and 
efficiently respond to requests for assistance in relation to 
restraint and forfeiture.  The use of domestic money laundering 
proceedings to seize, restrain, and forfeit the proceeds of 
offences committed in other countries is recognized as sometimes 
ineffective, and legislation to allow Canada to enforce foreign 
forfeiture requests directly should be introduced. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, the FATF recommended that reporting requirements in 
Canada be made mandatory rather than voluntary, as is currently 
the case, and that a financial intelligence unit be established 
to deal with the collection, management, analysis and 
dissemination of suspicious transaction reports and other

</I></B></P><P align=left>Organized criminals, particularly in the drug trade, generate 
and launder billions of dollars annually.  They launder money in 
order to continue their illegal operations.  They move to 
jurisdictions with strong controls to jurisdictions with weak or 
no controls, and I have just unfortunately described where the 
government has allowed Canada to fall.  Financial transactions 
conceal criminal profits to make them appear legitimate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yesterday my colleague from Surrey Central gave some examples of 
the criminal use of money laundering, but it is more than just 
the criminal use of money laundering.  There is also the whole 
issue of terrorist organizations being involved. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On January 5, 1999, a television report reported on criminal 
organizations that want to launder money through Canadian 
business.  A multinational company trading in the stock market 
was found to have ties to the Russian mob.  While investigating 
the company, YBM Magnex, this market investigator traced the 
company's corporate history back to one of the world's top 
criminals and head of the eastern European Mafia.  The company, 
now delisted, had stocks valued at $600 million and its principal 
business was laundering money for organized crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The story went on to say there are an estimated $400 billion in 
profits from the sale of state assets that are now looking to be 
laundered.  It is more than just ordinary criminal activity that 
we associate with drugs.  Now we are talking about the use of 
money laundering to move state assets from Russia.

</I></B></P><P align=left>As one investigator puts it, Canada and the U.S. are like candy 
stores for criminals.  The unanswered question is how many 
investors were hurt with the evaporation of the $600 million 
equity in YBM Magnex. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have just seen in the last couple of days billions of dollars 
removed from the stock exchange.  Probably hundreds of thousands 
of retail investors in Canada have been seriously hurt with their 
speculation in the stock market, but this was a situation where 
$600 million evaporated in value from the stock market.  What 
about those investors? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even the former premier of the province of Ontario and very high 
profile Canadians in the public eye were sucked into the YBM 
Magnex vortex.  The Ontario Stock Exchange and Securities 
Commission got a deserved black eye for not adequately protecting 
investors.  This followed on the heels of the $6 billion Bre-X 
debacle.  It is little wonder Canada has a less than stellar 
reputation in the global investment market. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Capital investment is what builds an economy.  It is well past 
time for the federal government to take its responsibilities more 
seriously and to do things in a more timely manner. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I mentioned, the member for Surrey Central yesterday gave 
some good examples of how money is laundered, but what about the 
issue I have raised of terrorism?  According to an RCMP report, 
Toronto and Montreal groups support the Tamils and Hamas. 
According to the Ottawa <I>Citizen</I> of Monday, March 27, 2000: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Violent street gangs in Toronto and Montreal are channelling 
criminal profits to Tamil terrorists waging a bloody fight for an 
independent homeland in Sri Lanka, says an RCMP intelligence 
report.  An extensive probe by the Mounties found “strong 
connections” between the outlaw gangs and the Liberation Tigers 
of Tamil Eelam, one of the world's most dangerous guerrilla 
groups. “There is clear evidence to support the relationship and 
that the money involved is being funnelled to the LTTE for 
extremist purposes in Sri Lanka,” says the newly declassified 
report, obtained through the Access to Information Act.  The RCMP 
implicate the Tamil criminal groups in a staggering variety of 
activities, including extortion, home invasion, attempted murder, 
theft, importation and sale of brown heroin, arms trafficking, 
production and sale of counterfeit passports, migrant smuggling, 
bank and casino fraud, and money laundering.  The activity is 
escalating and likely will become more difficult for police, adds 
the report. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is an exceptionally serious issue.  I say one last time, 
shame on the government for the unnecessary delay in bringing the 
legislation to the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some concerns have been raised about the legislation.  Criminal 
defence lawyers and the federal privacy commissioner warned the 
reporting scheme could turn Canada into a nation of snitches. 
The Canadian Security Intelligence Service said the transaction 
reporting regime could become “a bureaucratic monster”.  CSIS 
proposed more selective measures that would target parties known 
to engage in dubious activities.  A writer in the <I>Financial 
Post</I>, Terence Corcoran, indicated: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>If passed, Bill C-22 would give Ottawa fresh authority to trap 
the innocent, infringe on privacy, collect mountains of 
information on citizens and put routine money transactions under 
suspicion.  It would also conscript lawyers, banks, accountants 
and others into a national subculture of informants and snitches. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In a letter to the justice minister last December, the Canadian 
Bar Association listed some of the threats posed by Ottawa's plan 
to increase its surveillance over money transactions greater than 
$10,000.  It said routine legitimate business transactions could 
be disrupted and solicitor-client relationships undermined. “The 
mandatory reporting of information which may be confidential is a 
drastic measure and a gross intrusion into a previously protected 
sphere”.  The bill, it said, amounted to “restructuring the 
relationship of trust between lawyers and clients”.

</I></B></P><P align=left>There are protections under criminal law.  I have read that: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>At common law, securing a conviction for money laundering 
requires the Crown to prove four elements of the offence beyond a 
reasonable doubt. Specifically, it must be proven that the 
accused (i) dealt with the laundered property (ii) with intent to 
convert or conceal it.  Moreover, the property must have been 
(iii) derived from the commission of a predicate offence, and 
(iv) the accused must have had knowledge of that fact. As a 
result of legislative enactments, however, the Crown is now 
required to prove only the accused's subjective belief that the 
proceeds were derived from the commission of the predicate 
offence, even if this is not the case.  This allows the police to 
arrange “sting” operations. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is another tool in the ability of the police to be able to 
go after that. 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, all the money laundering offences include a 
companion offence relating to possession of proceeds, which may 
result in a conviction even where the Crown is unable to prove 
the laundering offence.  The “possession of proceeds of crime” 
provision is broader in the Criminal Code than in other statutes; 
it applies to the possession of proceeds of any indictable 
offence, not only to predicate offences.  While these are not 
money-laundering provisions themselves, they have proven useful 
to police in securing convictions in the absence of sufficient 
evidence to secure a conviction for a laundering offence. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I suggest that this is exactly the fine tuning the committee 
will have to get into. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There will always be exceptions in criminal law, but on balance 
the criminal law, as it is presently constituted, works as far as 
it has gone.  Late though the government may be, it is now adding 
another tool to the tool kit so the police will be able to enact 
enforcement.  This gives us an idea of the balance between 
entrapment of the innocent and effective tools of law to help our 
enforcement agencies do their job. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In another article from the Montreal <I>Gazette</I> on December 4 
1999, Tom Naylor, an economics professor at McGill University in 
Montreal, wrote: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yet money laundering is a contrived offence that has no business 
in the Criminal Code.  And perfectly satisfactory instruments for 
stripping criminals of their ill-gotten gains already exist. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is not the point. The point is not to strip the criminals 
of their ill-gotten gains.  It is a byproduct of this and other 
legislation.  The point is to interdict the flow of ill-gotten 
gains and determine its source.  By determining its source, the 
police can then proceed with proper criminal investigations and 
proper criminal prosecutions against people who are involved in 
these illegal activities, which are not only dangerous to our 
families and our society in the broader context but perhaps even 
dangerous to the very sovereignty of our nation as we understand 
it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore, inflammatory comments about the effect of this 
legislation are not helpful in this dialogue.  Sincere concerns 
about ensuring that our individual rights and freedoms are 
protected and sincere concerns about drawing out what the 
trade-off will be are valuable contributions to this.  However, 
with every law there is a degree of trade-off for the person who 
is involved in the illegal activity against the freedoms that we 
as law-abiding citizens have a right to enjoy in our society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us deal with the funding issues of this legislation. 
Previous attempts to curb money laundering have been hampered at 
every step by budget problems.  Curbing money laundering is a 
very effective weapon against the drug trade and frontline RCMP 
officers risk their lives every day in the fight against 
organized crime.  I am not only thinking of frontline RCMP 
officers who risk their lives, but I am also thinking of the 
people who co-operate with the RCMP and funnel information to 
them.  Those people also put their lives on the line. 
We have read and are aware of many situations where people have 
put their lives on the line and then, due to lack of adequate 
legislation, the perpetrators of the offence have been able to 
either walk away or get off with a reduced charge.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The benefits of crime control far outweigh the cost of 
implementing the programs to curb money laundering.  We must 
ensure resources are available to get the job done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have been advised that a separate agency is required to create 
protection for our freedoms.  With the agency standing alone and 
enforcement regimes like the police and CSIS having to 
substantiate further requests through courts of law, it is 
expected there will be sufficient protection for law-abiding 
citizens.  Again, this is something that all members of 
parliament will be examining very closely when the legislation is 
before a committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to make sure that we have proper laws for Canada so that 
we are not a haven for the proceeds of crime.  However, at the 
end of the day, what we also have to be very clear about is that 
when we give these tools to the enforcement officers in our 
community, we also have to be sure that there are proper 
safeguards built in so that law-abiding citizens are not drawn 
in. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will reflect back for a second on the YBM Magnex International 
Inc. example.  We also need this legislation to ensure that

money laundering that is currently going on within the boundaries 
of our sovereign nation.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lynn Myers (Waterloo—Wellington, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I was somewhat heartened to hear the member opposite 
talk in terms of the benefits of the bill.  Of course, we on the 
government side take these kinds of issues very seriously, as 
well we should, because Canadians, no matter where they live in 
our great country, take it seriously. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we have done historically and specifically with regard to 
this bill, we have proceeded in a timely fashion, unlike the 
member opposite who thinks we should have taken more time.  We 
have taken the required time to review the circumstances and talk 
with partners around the world, not only in terms of policing 
agencies but to get the kind of bilateral and multilateral 
arrangements in place that are part and parcel of the Canadian 
way of doing business. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am heartened to hear that some members opposite are indicating 
that this is a good bill.  It certainly underscores the 
commitment of the Government of Canada to do the kinds of things 
that are appropriate when it comes to this all important issue of 
money laundering and the exchanges of cash that take place, et 
cetera, and in trying to secure our banking and monetary systems 
in a way consistent with the values of Canadians and the 
international community. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we move into more globalization in the future, would the hon. 
member agree that we should bring in more partners to be a part 
of this process?  Should other countries in the world be 
assisting in this area? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Could he also outline not only his position but especially the 
Canadian Alliance's position vis-à-vis this criminal activity? 
Could he perhaps, in point form fashion, outline his party's 
position on the steps that would be appropriate to curtail, in a 
globalized economy, these kinds of things, especially as it 
relates to bringing in other partners from around the world?  I 
will be interested in his response. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Abbott:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the question 
from the member.  From time to time he has been quite vocal in 
his criticism of the Canadian Alliance, and I do not take his 
intervention today as being that. 
I take it as being a very responsible intervention.  I cannot 
resist the temptation to say, for a change.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would suggest very gently that his statement that the 
government takes these issues seriously is a catch-all phrase for 
the government.  I will be answering his question, but I do want 
to make this statement.  My criticism is that the government has 
not acted in a timely fashion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government had a clear understanding in 1997-98, fully two 
years ago, about what the expectations were of the G-7.  I 
seriously question the member's intervention when he says that 
the government has acted in a timely fashion taken the time 
required.  How much time is required?  The legislation in its 
basic form, as it presently sits, was brought before the House 
and due to the legislative calendar set up by the House leader on 
behalf of the Prime Minister, who is the leader of this 
government, it ended up falling off the legislative agenda for a 
full 12 months.  I do not think that is taking the issue 
seriously and I do not think it is working in a timely fashion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To answer the member's question, I am stating this as the 
solicitor general critic for Her Majesty's Official Opposition, 
the Canadian Alliance.  I believe that the government, if it is 
going to do the things necessary in terms of, as he puts it, 
bringing on more partners and working in co-operation with other 
international agencies, the government will have to step up with 
more resources, more resources in legislation and more resources 
in dollars and cents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has squeezed the heck out of the RCMP to the 
point where it did not even have wheels to be able to turn to go 
down the highway.  The RCMP has reached a point of rust-out.  The 
RCMP is a very dispirited organization at this point in terms of 
its manpower because of the constant squeeze on the salaries of 
the RCMP. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the government is going to do what is necessary there has to 
be full global co-operation between the Canadian government, the 
other governments of the G-7, the OECD and indeed all 
governments.  The government cannot be seen to be what it is 
presently, which is kind of treating this whole issue almost like 
a poor orphan son. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government needs to step up the resources required in order 
to get the job done.  I do note that the government did come 
forward with some $500 million plus for the RCMP.  It is a start 
but it is late.  The point I am trying to make is that the RCMP 
requires more resources in terms of dollars and cents and CSIS 
requires more resources in terms of dollars and cents, but they 
also require a heavier attention by the government to this very 
important issue because it permeates every part of our society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government is on the right track.  I prod it once again 
though because I do not think it is working nearly quickly enough 
on this and other very important issues that relate to organized 
crime and terrorism and the sharing of criminal intelligence 
around the world.

is a rare thing for me to agree with the Canadian Alliance, but 
I agree 100% with the comments by the hon. member on the job the 
Liberals are doing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have always had to force the government to act, whether in 
connection with crime, with legislative amendments, or other 
things that had to be done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Take, for example, the $1,000 bill.  A while ago, they announced 
their intention of taking it out of circulation.  The Bloc 
Quebecois has been calling for this famous $1000 bill to be 
withdrawn ever since 1994, because this was one of only a few 
countries with such a high denomination.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are well aware that these notes were used by organized crime. 
I realize that the member opposite does not like to hear the 
truth, that he is running away to avoid hearing it, but the Bloc 
Quebecois had to introduce private members' bills in this House 
to convince the government to take the $1,000 notes out of 
circulation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The issue of money laundering and the introduction of a measure 
similar to Bill C-22 were discussed as early as during the Bloc 
Quebecois' first mandate. The issue was also part of our 
platform in 1997. Everyone knew that there was a major money 
laundering problem in Canada. 
It was only after the Americans ridiculed it that the government 
opposite finally decided to do something about this problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals had better not tell us that they have been diligent 
in this area. I fully agree with the Canadian Alliance member 
about the government's negligence. Since the Liberals took 
office, and while they were not taking any action, between $80 
billion and $100 billion were laundered in the Canadian economy. 
This is unacceptable. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Abbott:</B>  Mr. Speaker, of course we are in 
agreement.  It is unusual for the Canadian Alliance to agree with 
the Bloc on many things.  Clearly, when one of the members of the 
Bloc Quebecois has been threatened by organized crime in his 
constituency, we must pull together.  This brings the importance 
of this to the attention of the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On another up note, as a result of a Bloc Quebecois motion which 
I believe was supported 100% by the House, a subcommittee has 
been struck to examine the whole issue of organized crime in 
Canada.  I commend the Bloc Quebecois for that.  The subcommittee 
was struck just two days ago.  The committee chair has been named 
and we will start to work on this issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again, I agree with the Bloc it is unfortunate that the 
opposition has had to push the Liberal government so hard to get 
it to do the things necessary to get on with the very important 
job of protecting Canadian society.

<P><A NAME="LINK40"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier—Montcalm, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to rise to speak to Bill C-22. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We should make it clear right off that the bill was introduced 
by the Minister of Finance.  It is surprising from its title, 
because it could have been introduced by the Minister of Justice 
or even the Solicitor General of Canada. This bill is entitled 
an act to facilitate combatting the laundering of proceeds of 
crime, to establish the financial transactions and reports 
analysis centre of Canada and to amend and repeal certain acts 
in consequence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>From the contents of the bill, we can see that the Minister of 
National Revenue is the minister primarily concerned, since the 
bill concerns a number of matters relating to income. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact that this bill could have been introduced by a variety 
of ministers is not insignificant.  It means that Bill C-22 
involves of matter of some scope affecting various facets of our 
society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-22 is in fact a tool to help us fight a scourge, whose 
impact can be felt on the streets, in the schools, in the vaults 
of our financial institutions and in our penitentiaries.  It is 
even felt by our farmers, as we saw last fall, and in a number 
of economic, social and even cultural sectors of our community. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This scourge has a name.  It is called organized crime.  It 
comprises many aspects: the bikers, the Italian mafia, the 
Russian mafia, the Asian triads, street gangs and so on.  Each 
aspect operates in its own way and has its own varied and 
effective methods of intimidation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Thus, members will understand that organized crime is an evil 
poisoning our lives in many ways.  And it is precisely because 
it is organized that this type of crime is so hard to fight. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1205"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT16"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is only one way this can be done: we must get organized 
ourselves.  This means that, like crime, justice must be 
organized.  We must also provide adequate funding—I am happy to 
hear members of other parties in the House say so—to the police 
to help it organize its efforts.  Stiff measures are needed and 
they must be organized.  In a nutshell, it would be better if we 
started calling the shots or others will keep calling them for 
us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But all this is not easy—far from it.  Organized crime is not 
just the occupation of a few influential masterminds. 
It is no longer the playground of people like Al Capone and the 
mobsters of the early 1900s. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Organized crime involves many kinds of individuals, some of whom 
may often bear a strong resemblance to you or me.  Most of them 
are anonymous members of the public who appear to lead their 
lives in an entirely above-board and ordinary manner.  All the 
players in organized crime do not bear some easily identifiable 
mark.  On the contrary, the people involved in organized crime 
are often anonymous. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Obviously, there is a more visible type of crime that often 
makes the news and appears in the headlines.  There was the 
biker war that was splashed all over the media a while back, and 
which makes a return appearance from time to time.  But the 
whole biker war phenomenon is only the tip of the iceberg. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members will therefore understand that the phenomenon we are now 
seeing is extremely complex.  It was time that the government 
suggested some effective responses to one of the most harmful 
aspects of organized crime, money laundering. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On more than one occasion, the Bloc Quebecois has been critical 
of the failure of Canadian legislation to prevent money 
laundering.  Even so, the government waited until Canada found 
itself in the unenviable position of money laundering centre of 
the world before it decided to take action.  It was high time 
that Canada did something because it has become, in the opinion 
of many international experts, a real sieve. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What exactly is “money laundering”?  It is the process by which 
revenue from criminal activities is converted into assets that 
are difficult to trace to their criminal origins. 
What is involved here is the concealment of the proceeds of 
crime by making them appear legitimate.  The bulk of these 
assets are related to drug trafficking, and most of the rest to 
criminal activities such as robbery or cigarette smuggling. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since, by their very nature, money laundering and the criminal 
activities it attempts to camouflage are clandestine activities, 
it is hard to have any clear idea of the scope of money 
laundering activities.  According to experts, however, the 
annual figure for the laundering of the proceeds of organized 
crime is about $17 billion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What weapons did we have, then, against such a huge problem? 
Far from enough.  A brief overview of Canadian legislation would 
be appropriate here. 
Hon. members will recall that the federal government passed 
legislation in 1988 amending the Criminal Code, the Food and 
Drugs Act, and the Narcotics Act, creating a distinct criminal 
offence of money laundering and providing for the seizure and 
forfeiture of the proceeds and property derived from various 
criminal and drug offences.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The Criminal Code includes a list of 35 crimes coming under the 
definition of enterprise crime offence. 
We can see that something has been around since 1988, but we 
have to look at the decisions, the jurisprudence directly 
concerned with this section to realize it is inadequate, that it 
is insufficient to effectively fight crime.  There is no need to 
be a great expert in criminal law to recognize this.  It is 
enough to visit the courts to see how easy it is for a defence 
lawyer to get around these sections. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1991, there were other amendments to the Proceeds of Crime 
(Money Laundering) Act.  Legislation was enacted in an extremely 
important area—financial institutions, real estate brokers, 
portfolio managers, and so on.  It provided that, for any 
transaction of over $10,000 of a suspicious nature, information 
was to be taken and kept for five years. 
However, this was left to the discretion of the institution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When a client of a financial institution has several million 
thousand dollars, and his portfolio is managed there, members 
will understand the reticence of the financial institution to 
report these sums.  There is a problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the last election campaign, the Bloc Quebecois included an 
approach in its platform to tighten things up, to provide major 
legislation to fight money laundering.  Finally, the government 
seems to have understood with Bill C-22. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In introducing this bill, the government significantly remedies 
the situation by establishing three mechanisms to control 
suspicious transactions.  The first is the mechanism of 
mandatory reporting of suspicious operations, as provided in 
clauses 5 to 11 of the bill. 
The second is a mechanism for the reporting of major cross 
border movements of currency, as provided in clauses 12 to 39. 
The third is the establishment of the financial transactions and 
report analysis centre of Canada, as defined in clauses 40 to 72. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us examine these mechanisms and the centre.  With Bill C-22, 
the reporting of suspicious operations relating to money 
laundering, currently voluntary under existing provisions of the 
law, would become mandatory. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, the obligation to report would extend to non 
banking financial institutions and certain other companies. 
Therefore, the reporting requirements would apply to regulated 
financial institutions, casinos, foreign exchange traders, stock 
brokers, insurance companies and persons acting as financial 
intermediaries, such as lawyers and accountants. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These people and institutions would be required to report 
certain categories of financial transactions and any other 
transaction regarding which there are reasonable grounds to 
believe that they are connected with the laundering of money.

<A HREF="#LINKT18"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, when it comes to transborder operations, people who 
import or export considerable amounts of currency or 
instruments, such as travellers cheques, will be required to 
report these sums of money to Canadian customs officers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If a Canadian travels to the United States and takes $35,000 in 
travellers cheques for a three day trip or, conversely, if an 
American comes to Canada with $35,000 in travellers cheques or 
in cash, we are justified in asking questioning that person if 
he is only going to be in Canada for two or three days, or even 
just a few hours. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Failure to comply with this requirement could lead to the 
seizure of the currency or instruments carried by the 
individual, unless he gives up the idea of importing or 
exporting these sums of money. He can decide to go back to his 
country of origin. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Third, the financial transactions and reports analysis centre of 
Canada is an independent government agency that will collect and 
analyse the information provided on financial transactions and 
transborder movements involving currency. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The centre will also be a central repository for information on 
money laundering activities. It will analyse and assess the 
reports submitted and, if necessary, give leads to law 
enforcement agencies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I said earlier, the government opposite should have acted 
sooner. 
It should not have waited until Canada had a reputation as a 
major centre of organized crime before taking action.  The 
government should have been much more proactive.  It should have 
listened to the Bloc Quebecois. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is odd that Bill C-22 has finally made it to the House a few 
weeks before a parliamentary committee begins looking at the 
issue of organized crime.  Members will recall that I introduced 
a motion in the House a while back calling for the creation of a 
committee to examine this issue and to propose amendments to the 
legislation, if necessary, or other approaches. The 
parliamentary committee will study the issue and report to the 
House on the whole question of organized crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A few weeks before they start their deliberations, the 
government introduces Bill C-22 on money laundering. 
The government probably did not want to be criticized for having 
taken no action in this regard, but the usual drill is that 
every time the government opposite takes action, it is because 
the Bloc Quebecois has pushed it right to the wall. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was the Bloc Quebecois that initiated the anti-gang 
legislation passed just before the last federal election.  The 
Bloc Quebecois had questioned the government, which decided to 
do something about the problem just before heading into a 
general election. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was the Bloc Quebecois that took the initiative with respect 
to getting the $1,000 bill withdrawn from circulation, and the 
government listened to us.  With respect to Bill C-22 now before 
us, again it was the Bloc Quebecois, in its first term of 
office, specifically in its 1997 election platform, which said 
that the federal parliament should bring in legislation to do 
something about money laundering. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, the government over there had no other choice, since 
the Americans have even told it Canada was an all-round champion 
as far as money laundering is concerned, but to decide to comply 
with the Bloc Quebecois' demands by introducing the bill we now 
have before us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have already mentioned the $1,000 note.  It is extremely 
important for the government to heed us on this, and withdraw it 
from circulation as soon as possible.  It is used mainly by 
organized crime, and must therefore be pulled, so that only 
denominations of $10, $20, $50 and $100 are available.  It takes 
a whole lot fewer $1,000 notes to make $1 million, and is far 
less unwieldy, than $1 million in $10s, $20s or $50s.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Care must be taken, however, not to see Bill C-22 as a solution 
to all our problems.  We must point out that this bill does give 
the government considerable regulatory power.  Clause 73 of the 
bill in fact authorizes the Governor in Council, on the 
recommendation of the Minister, to “make any regulations that 
the Governor in Council considers necessary for carrying out the 
purposes and provisions of this Act”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At first glance, the regulatory power assigned to the minister 
may seem extremely broad, even too broad, one might say. 
Although such power could eventually bring about changes in the 
law without the need to amend it, still, a number of important 
issues, which should be debated by parliamentarians, will be 
handed over to officials.  That is a bit risky. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here is an example.  The government will set, by regulation, the 
amount requiring reporting.  Under subclause 12(2) as well, 
regulatory conditions will determine whether individuals may be 
exempt from the requirement of producing such a report. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Knowing that the required report is the backbone of the 
mechanisms put in place by Bill C-22, we can see that the 
government is giving itself vast regulatory powers. 
With its history, I fear that the government is not too eager to 
tighten the screw, to require reports, which are difficult to 
prepare, from offenders, and to be too demanding about the 
reports people or groups are to do.  The public may rest 
assured, however, that we on this side of the House will be very 
demanding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would be derelict in my duties if I did not mention that Bill 
C-22 raises significant questions about the protection of 
certain basic rights covered by the charter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In a free and democratic society, the legislator may limit 
certain individual rights, as dictated by the larger interests 
of the community.  However, this limitation must not be 
exercised outside certain rules.  Bill C-22 must comply with 
certain basic procedural rules. 
In fact, in the case of seizures and searches, great care must 
be exercised in the drafting of the bill to prevent effective 
contest before the courts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Work in committee will ensure us that these standards are 
met, before the bill is passed.  If parliamentarians fail to 
examine in minute detail the impact of this bill, lawyers who 
are well paid by organized crime will review it and arrange to 
have this law declared illegal and unconstitutional.  It is up 
to us to work properly and effectively on this bill. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>]

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Scott Brison (Kings—Hants, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is 
with pleasure that I rise to speak to Bill C-22, which will 
create a new agency to oversee and try to prevent money 
laundering in Canada, the financial transactions and reports 
analysis centre of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-22 would bring Canada up to date with the standards of 
our G-7 trading partners.  It does not take us beyond the minimum 
standard, but it takes us up to that standard.  It covers 
professionals, lawyers and chartered accountants, and even stock 
brokers and investment bankers would have responsibility to 
report under this legislation.  It does not include, as in some 
other countries, a “know your client” rule, which would go much 
further in policing money laundering. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The responsibility to report suspicious transactions is 
described in this legislation, but it is not really spelled out 
in terms of what would define a suspicious transaction.  I have 
some concerns about that.  I would hope that as the legislation 
progresses we would define in a more comprehensive way what 
criteria would be required for an agency, an individual or a 
professional to define a transaction as being suspicious. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1225"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT20"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It would also expand the reporting by financial agencies of any 
transactions over $10,000 beyond banks.  Currently banks report 
voluntarily.  This would expand to include money marts and 
casinos.  It does not delve into the retail side of commerce, 
which perhaps should be considered. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have some concerns about that.  Earlier I heard some members 
refer to the potential of the legislation being expanded at some 
point to include retail operations, for instance, jewellers or 
car dealers, where allegedly this type of money laundering exists 
quite a bit in terms of large sum purchases. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would caution against expanding the scope too much, thereby 
creating a regulatory nightmare that would be extremely difficult 
to administer and could potentially have a negative impact in 
terms of the abilities of Canada's retailers to actually keep up 
with the paperwork and other requirements. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The legislation addresses cash transactions but does not address 
what is really the greater current and future issue of e-commerce 
or e-laundering. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is very difficult to track financial transactions today that 
occur over the Internet or electronic financial transactions, 
particularly with sophisticated financial vehicles or 
instruments, for instance, derivatives.  It is possible to hide 
transactions through derivatives and other financial instruments. 
In fact, cross-border electronic transactions, from a tax 
perspective, are becoming increasingly difficult to tax. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would suggest to the government that the legislation is 
definitely long overdue, but that it addresses a problem which is 
really yesterday's problem, as opposed to addressing a problem 
which is clearly a problem of today and the future, that of 
electronically based money laundering. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The whole issue of smurfing, breaking large transactions into 
smaller units to get them below the $10,000 threshold which would 
trigger some level of activity by the new agency, is a real 
issue.  For instance, in terms of deposits, several people could 
use various bank machines to deposit cash into the same account. 
Something as simple as a bank machine could play a role in money 
laundering, simply by breaking down transactions into smaller 
amounts to bring the transactions below the threshold that would 
trigger some level of investigation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am also concerned about the budget of the agency.  I 
understand that the budget would be anywhere between $7.5 million 
and $10 million.  Some suggestion has been made that there would 
be about a hundred people doing this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would suggest that it may be a very, very difficult job to 
police this type of activity with that size of budget.  It sounds 
to some as a large budget, but I would suggest it is not really a 
very large budget at all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also suggest to the government, as this agency and the 
government investigates ways to police the electronic money 
laundering side of it, that the government look toward some of 
the private sector solutions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What I am speaking of are some of the companies that have 
developed technologies to deal with these issues—security issues 
on the Internet, et cetera—which may in fact be outpacing the 
technological advances capable of being developed by government. 
I think there will have to be some private-public sector 
engagement on some of these issues, particularly as we delve into 
the new world of electronic commerce. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1230"></A>

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have some concerns about Bill C-22.  The legislation would 
create a new agency that is at arm's length from the government. 
That is positive from the perspective of preventing political 
interference in an investigation, but it is negative from the 
perspective that this new, all powerful agency could conceivably 
overstep its boundaries on an investigation of an individual 
case. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A Canadian citizen being persecuted by this agency on a given 
case would not have the protection offered by ministerial 
intervention to potentially defend that citizen.  Only if 
systemic abuse is suspected would the minister be able to 
intervene. Whenever I see these new agencies, whether it is the 
new Revenue Canada agency or this new agency to police money 
laundering, I have some concerns about the lack of direct 
ministerial accountability and potential intervention on behalf 
of an individual Canadian who may be treated unfairly by one of 
these agencies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another concern I have is that this new agency would have the 
power to release information to Revenue Canada in accordance with 
the act.  If reasonable grounds existed for the agency to believe 
that money laundering had occurred, there would be potential for 
abuse. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to be very clear that if the agency has some reasonable 
grounds to pursue an individual case of money laundering, that is 
one thing.  However, if the agency does not have enough evidence 
to pursue a case of money laundering and determines that while 
the evidence does not exist it may be able to get the person on 
tax evasion, conceivably the agency could release the information 
to Revenue Canada.  This would help Revenue Canada or the new 
Revenue Canada agency pursue the individual.  Therefore, while 
there may not be a case against an individual for money 
laundering, this agency could potentially help the new Revenue 
Canada agency in pursuing someone on a tax evasion charge. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is absolutely, fundamentally wrong.  The two agencies have 
to be separate.  Unless there are very clear grounds for a case 
of money laundering, it would be wrong for this agency to work 
with Revenue Canada on individual cases or to share information. 
We have to ensure on behalf of Canadian taxpayers that this does 
not become some souped up Revenue Canada annex or addendum. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the new agency had reasonable grounds to suspect money 
laundering, that is one thing.  However, if it was simply a case 
where it did not have enough grounds to pursue someone on that 
basis and determined that there was some level of evidence for 
tax evasion, it would be clearly wrong for the sharing of 
information to exist. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is still nebulous as to whether or not this agency would have 
the ability to do spot or random audits on banks, money marts or 
casinos.  I would assume that would be the case but it has to be 
spelled out. Again, we have to ensure in our pursuit of doing 
something that is valuable and important, which is policing and 
reducing the incidents of money laundering, that we do not create 
some new godzilla agency that would have an immense amount of 
power to hurt legitimate Canadian enterprise, impede legitimate 
Canadian transactions, and effectively pursue some of the 
negative and oppressive activities we have seen from Revenue 
Canada in the past. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those are my cautions.  We are supporting this legislation with 
some concerns.  We hope as this evolves, the government's 
policies on some of these issues will become more proactive in 
terms of addressing the real issues of today and in the future, 
and in particular embrace the notion of the electronic issues 
facing Canadians and law enforcement agencies.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Again these border on questions of resources. I have significant 
concerns with the extent to which the government has starved 
Canada's law enforcement agencies.  It has prevented the RCMP 
from having the ability to enforce some of Canada's laws. As we 
expand these types of oversight agencies we have to ensure they 
are properly funded and that we give them the tools to do the 
job. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In that regard it may be very important for the government to 
consider some level of private participation.  At least it should 
dialogue with the private sector on the electronic commerce side 
to ensure that the government is using the most up to date 
technologies to address these issues.  A lot of these 
technologies exist in the private sector.  The government should 
be more responsive to those forces and more amenable to work with 
private sector entities within Canada and elsewhere to develop 
solutions to these very real problems.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Williams (St. Albert, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I appreciate the opportunity to speak to Bill C-22 which 
deals with money laundering. As my colleagues on this side of the 
House have pointed out, this has been a long time coming from the 
government.  We are the last of the G-7 countries to get around 
to doing something about money laundering. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the great scourges of our modern society is the illegal 
movement of products such as drugs.  That has an effect on our 
society.  It affects the minds of our young kids.  They get 
themselves bent out of shape by using drugs.  It ruins their 
careers.  It ruins their futures, ruins their minds and ruins 
their potential. It also leads them into crime to generate the 
cash required to pay for the drugs and to keep the cartels 
supplied with billions of dollars in profits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The proceeds of these drugs move through many countries in many 
ways in order to get into this country.  People stand there with 
their hands out.  They know it is illegal and illicit and 
therefore they are capable of demanding some kind of payment, a 
form of bribery, for them to turn their eyes in another direction 
as the drugs pass by. We in the House have talked about crime and 
how young kids feel the need to commit crimes such as shoplifting 
and a lot worse than that in many cases, in order to feed and pay 
for their habit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am glad the government is doing something about money 
laundering.  Most of us have no real concept of how big the 
movement of drugs is and the amount of money, the billions of 
dollars that are moving around because of it.  I understand that 
the largest cash based industry in British Columbia today is the 
growth of marijuana.  The export of marijuana across the country 
and to other parts of the world is perhaps one of the largest 
industries in British Columbia today. That is shocking. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have met with parliamentarians in other parts of the world.  I 
am thinking of parliamentarians in South America.  I recently 
attended a speech by our ambassador for Colombia who was here in 
Ottawa telling us about the situation there.  We were told of the 
insurrection, the track that the government is losing control of 
its own country.  In essence there is a civil war going on, not 
between two factions over who should rule the country, but the 
drug cartels do not want government anywhere near the growth of 
the drugs or the plants that produce the drugs. 
The cartels have their own air forces. They are able to fly the 
drugs out of South America through the Caribbean and up to the 
United States and Canada. This is a scourge on our society.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Money laundering is only one part of it. I want to broaden the 
debate.  Money laundering deals with the movement of cash by 
illicit and illegal means but it is not just drugs we are talking 
about.  We see bribery and corruption in all parts of the world. 
Believe it or not, Canada is not exempt; it happens here too. 
There are horrendous problems in South America.  A year ago the 
commissioners of the European Union had to resign because of 
corruption.  Members may have read about it in the paper. In 
Canada in the Prime Minister's riding, police investigations are 
going on because of potential misappropriation of government 
funds.  If this is proven to be so, this would also be 
corruption.  It is everywhere. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We read about it in the papers in the United States. Numerous 
elected officials in senior positions have been bought. I read 
one article just the other day regarding a governor who insisted 
on a $400,000 payment before he would vote in a certain way.   It 
goes on.  China has acknowledged that corruption is a major 
problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would hope that we would start to do something about it. 
Transparency and openness is how to deal with bribery and 
corruption.  It has to be brought out into the open so everybody 
can see what is going on.  If a transaction cannot stand up to 
the light of day, it is likely illegal.  If it is automatically 
going to be exposed in the light of day, it likely will not 
happen in the first place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Look at what has happened with the HRDC scandal. Numerous audits 
were done and none of them were brought out into the open. On 
January 20 the last HRDC audit became part of the public debate. 
What has happened since then?  The minister has told us that 
there has been a major review of all processes that go on in the 
department to ensure that the administration of the programs will 
now be done properly.  Why were they not done properly before? 
Because there was no openness, no accountability and no 
transparency. We were not privy to the fact that previous audits 
had slammed that department and the administration of the files. 
It gets sloppy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>People with power and influence start using their influence and 
now numerous police investigations are going on.  If these result 
in convictions, then that will show there has been corruption 
right here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am glad the world is finally waking up to the fact that 
bribery and corruption are perhaps the greatest scourge to 
economic development around the world.  People with power and 
influence skim 10% and 20% right off the top and the money is 
going straight into Swiss bank accounts.  There are also the 
people at the bottom end of the economic scale who, because they 
do not get paid enough money, have no choice but to insist on 
bribes for the work that they do or do not do.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In some cases we have people in positions of influence and 
power, such as policemen writing tickets or others granting 
permits, insisting on bribes to feed a large group of people or 
an extended family that depends on them for support because there 
is no cash in the economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need economic development.  We want to help the poor not only 
in this country but around the world.  We can help the poor by 
attacking this cancer on society, the scourge of bribery and 
corruption.  The OECD passed a protocol that was endorsed by a 
number of countries including Canada which says that bribery in a 
foreign country is no longer a tax deduction but a crime to be 
prosecuted in the home state.  These are small beginnings. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I compare the current attitude on bribery and corruption to the 
position of society on the environment and human rights back in 
the 1960s.  When we talked about the environment and our concern 
for the degradation of the environment in those days, people said 
that it was awful and asked why somebody did not do something 
about it. Then they would continue their daily routines. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is 30 years later and the environment is now a core issue not 
only of this government and this country but of every developed 
country around the world.  It is a core part of policy making. 
When they make policy the environment is a major consideration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Human rights is the same.  Back in the 1960s when people's human 
rights were being violated around the world, they would say it 
was awful and that somebody should do something about it, and 
they would continue their daily routines.  Today we have war 
crimes tribunals.  We have agreements and protocols.  We insist 
on human rights when we enter into other agreements.  Human 
rights is now a core principle of democracy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope in a number of years, and hopefully not too many years 
from now, that the battle against bribery and corruption will 
also be at the core of civilized society in order for us to 
ensure that economic benefits accrue to all in society and that 
the cream or the profit is not ripped off illegally by those who 
happen to have power and influence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is everywhere.  I have heard numerous examples, small and 
large.  I will not bore the House with the details, but I would 
like to see the government and Canadians recognizing that bribery 
and corruption can and should be fought at every turn. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-22 on money laundering is a small start.  I hope we will 
continue on from here and join forces with parliamentarians in 
other parts of the world to ensure that we carry the momentum 
forward so that in a number of years from now not only will we 
say that the environment and human rights are at the core of our 
policy making but that the fight against bribery and corruption 
is also at the core of our policy making.

<A NAME="LINK44">&nbsp;</A>
<P><A NAME="LINK45"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Maria Minna (for the Minister of Finance)</B> moved that 
Bill C-25, an act to amend the Income Tax Act, the Excise Tax Act 
and the Budget Implementation Act, 1999, be read the second time 
and referred to a committee. 
<P><A NAME="LINK46"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Roy Cullen (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Finance, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise to speak to second 
reading of Bill C-25, the Income Tax Amendments Act, 1999. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even though the 2000 budget was brought down in February, hon. 
members can appreciate that the legislation before us today stems 
from the 1999 budget.  These are the measures that should be the 
primary focus of this debate. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-25 seeks to implement a large number of initiatives 
designed to ensure tax fairness, including personal income tax 
measures, announced in the February 1999 budget, and certain 
other measures dealing with the demutualization of insurance 
corporations, the fiscal situation of the trust established by 
the federal and provincial governments to provide compensation 
to hepatitis C victims, and the taxation of first nations. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before I discuss the specifics of the bill, however, I will take 
a moment to put the legislation in context.  The fundamentals of 
our government's tax policy are crystal clear. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, our approach to tax relief must be fair, which means 
starting with those who need it most, low and middle income 
Canadians, especially families with children.  Second, we must 
place priority on personal income taxes where the burden is 
greatest and where we are most out of line with other countries. 
Third, we have to ensure that Canada has an internationally 
competitive business tax system.  Fourth, because of our debt 
burden, tax relief must not be financed with borrowed money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government remains committed to providing substantial tax 
relief to Canadians on an ongoing basis.  Last fall Canadians 
were promised in both the Speech from the Throne and the Minister 
of Finance's economic and fiscal update that the government would 
set out a multi-year plan for further tax reductions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Budget 2000 delivered on that commitment through a five year tax 
reduction plan which indexes the tax system against inflation, 
reduces the middle tax rate and overall cuts taxes by at least 
$58 billion by the year 2004, an average annual tax cut of 15% 
with even greater relief for families with children.  It is a 
plan that will provide further real and lasting tax relief for 
all Canadians, but it is also a plan whose foundations were laid 
in previous budgets, including the one of 1999. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Getting back to that budget and the legislation at hand, hon. 
members know that tax revenues finance important government 
programs that Canadians need and value such as health care and 
education.  Therefore, there must be a balance between keeping 
taxes low and providing a source of revenue for vital social and 
economic programs. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If they are to become permanent, tax relief measures must be 
affordable and they must not jeopardize the soundness of 
Canada's finances. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the first time since 1965, the 1999 budget provided an 
opportunity to offer tax relief to all taxpayers, without the 
government having to borrow money. Low and middle income 
Canadians are the ones who will benefit most from these 
measures. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Each of our budgets to date has provided targeted tax relief to 
achieve social and economic goals.  Areas of support include 
students, charities, persons with disabilities and the children 
of parents with low incomes, groups where it would be most 
beneficial. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Eliminating the deficit in 1997-98 opened the door for the 
government to begin broad based tax relief measures. 
The 1999 budget builds on these measures as part of our long term 
strategy to permanently reduce taxes.

<A HREF="#LINKT26"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Together the 1997, 1998 and 1999 budgets reduced the income tax 
burden of Canadians by some 10%.  This is a significant step, but 
we have moved further.  Combined with the actions in the 2000 
budget, annual personal income tax reductions will total 22% on 
average by the year 2004-05. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The measures in Bill C-25 go a long way toward helping the 
government reach this target.  This is the context within which 
today's debate on Bill C-25 is taking place.  These measures are 
all part of the government's commitment to tax fairness and our 
long term tax reduction strategy. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Initially, three comprehensive tax relief measures were 
announced in the 1999 budget, and these measures are all 
included in the bill before us. Provided this legislation is 
promulgated, each of these measures will be effective July 1, 1999. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, the amount of tax exempt income that Canadians may earn 
has been increased. Budget 2000 raises this amount further, but 
that will be discussed in another debate. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under the present income tax system basic personal, spousal and 
equivalent to spouse credits ensure that individuals and families 
receive a basic amount of income tax free.  The 1998 budget 
raised the amount of money low income Canadians could receive on 
a tax free basis by $500.  The 1999 budget extends this relief to 
all taxpayers and increases that amount by a further $175. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a result of these two measures all taxpayers will benefit 
from a basic personal credit sufficient to allow the receipt of 
up to $7,131 of tax free income.  That is an increase of $675 
over what was available in 1997, and in budget 2000 we increased 
that even further. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The amount upon which the spousal credit is calculated will also 
be increased by $675 to $6,055.  The threshold where the spousal 
credit begins to be reduced will increase from $538 to $606.  In 
addition, the bill eliminates the general 3% surtax for all 
taxpayers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With the books balanced, the 1998 budget was able to eliminate 
this surtax for taxpayers earning under $50,000 and reduce it for 
those with incomes between $50,000 and $65,000.  Now it is 
abolished completely.  Together the 1998 and 1999 budget measures 
removed 600,000 Canadians from the tax rolls and reduced taxes 
for all 15.7 million Canadian taxpayers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While all taxpayers will benefit from these measures, low income 
earners will have the most to gain.  For example, under the 1999 
budget measures a single filer earning $15,000 will pay 15% less 
federal tax while a similar individual earning $30,000 will pay 
6% less tax. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have more examples.  A typical one earner family of four that 
receives an annual income of $30,000 or less will pay no net 
federal income tax.  A similar family earning $40,000 will enjoy 
a 15% federal income tax reduction. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will now deal with some of the other tax equity budget 
measures contained in the bill before us, beginning with income 
splitting among children who are minors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As members know, the progressive structure of the rates is one 
of the basic principles of our personal income tax system. It 
goes without saying that high income individuals are in a better 
position to absorb a higher tax rate than lower income earners 
are. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Income splitting occurs when high income individuals arrange to 
divert income to low income earners, generally family members, to 
avoid tax. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1300"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT28"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT28"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1300

<A HREF="#LINKT27"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The tax benefits of income splitting can usually only be 
accomplished by high income individuals with dependants.  Even 
then, these arrangements are only effective for certain types of 
income. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As hon. members will appreciate, a tax system that enables some 
to income split through corporate structuring while denying it to 
others is not sustainable both in pragmatic terms and from a tax 
fairness perspective.  Fair taxation based upon a taxpayer's 
ability to pay, which is reflected through the progressive rate 
structure and uniformly applied, is the only sustainable 
approach. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To improve the fairness and integrity of our tax system the bill 
introduces a special tax aimed specifically at structures 
designed to split income with minors.  Applied at the top 
marginal rate on the income of individuals aged 17 or under at 
the end of a taxation year, the types of income to which this 
special tax would apply include taxable dividends and other 
shareholder benefits on unlisted shares of Canadian and foreign 
companies received from a trust or partnership, and income from a 
partnership or trust where the income is derived from a business 
carried on by a relative of the child. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another measure in the bill deals with retroactive lump sum 
payments on which individuals are taxed in the year payment is 
received, even though a significant portion may relate to prior 
years. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Because of the progressive rate structure of the income tax 
system, the tax payable on these payments can be appreciably 
higher than it would have been if payments had been staggered 
and taxed upon receipt. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those who receive eligible retroactive lump sum payments of 
$3,000 or more will be able to calculate the tax under a special 
relief mechanism. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Income eligible under this mechanism will include certain office 
or employment income, superannuation or pension benefits, spousal 
or taxable child support arrears and EI benefits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another measure in Bill C-25 affects Hutterite colonies which 
for income tax purposes qualify as communal organizations.  These 
organizations own property on a collective basis and typically 
carry on farming and related businesses.  They are subject to 
section 143 of the Income Tax Act, which is meant to subject 
their income to a level of taxation that is roughly comparable to 
the level of taxation on farming income earned outside these 
organizations.  This is achieved by allowing the income earned by 
these organizations to be allocated among their adult members. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, the method of allocation of income for communal 
organizations has remained the same since the mid-1970s.  This 
method has permitted income to be allocated to only one spouse 
per family in a communal organization, while general income tax 
rules have been changed to make wages and salaries paid to 
spouses employed in farming and other businesses tax deductible. 
This is despite the fact that, generally speaking, each adult in 
a communal organization makes a direct contribution to the income 
generating business activities of the organization. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore, in order to maintain a roughly equivalent level of 
taxation on income earned by communal organizations and on 
general farming income, the tax burden on communal organizations 
would be reduced by allowing allocations of income to both 
spouses in a family under section 143. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill also deals with misrepresentations by third parties. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Criminal and civil penalties are imposed when taxpayers 
attempt to evade payment of their fair share of taxes through 
fiscal misrepresentation.  However, there is no specific rule 
for assessing the application of civil penalties to 
individuals who make false statements regarding the fiscal 
obligations of another taxpayer. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill introduces two civil penalties applicable to third 
parties who make false statements that could be used for tax 
purposes.  One concerns tax shelter and other tax planning 
arrangements.  The other concerns advising or participating in a 
false tax filing. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1305"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT28"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>These changes stem from various recommendations made by the 
auditor general, the public accounts committee and the technical 
committee on business taxation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The integrity of the tax system and the market for professional 
tax services are not well served if the tax law does not provide 
for the application of civil penalties against those who make 
false statements which could be used by a taxpayer for a purpose 
under the tax law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A culpable conduct test, consistent with the types of conduct 
which the courts have in the past applied civil penalties to 
taxpayers under the tax law, will be instituted.  This test 
applies to conduct which is tantamount to intentional conduct, 
shows an indifference as to whether the tax law is complied with, 
or demonstrates a wilful, reckless or wanton disregard of the 
law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill also provides a reliance on good faith exception to the 
culpable conduct standard.  However, this exception will not 
apply to persons who promote or sell tax shelter arrangements, as 
these arrangements have the potential to adversely affect the tax 
base and taxpayers to which such arrangements are promoted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As well, the Minister of National Revenue has indicated that the 
Canada Customs and Revenue Agency will be taking special 
administrative procedures in respect of the third party penalty 
proposal.  In particular, the Canada Customs and Revenue Agency 
will conduct a head office review before assessing any third 
party civil penalty.  It will also be seeking private sector 
input on the development of guidelines for the administration of 
third party civil penalty rules. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I now want to discuss the tax situation which arises when a 
holder of an RRSP or a RRIF dies and the value of the RRSP or 
RRIF is included in the holder's income for the year of their 
death.  This income inclusion is offset by RRSP or RRIF 
distributions made after death to a surviving spouse.  This same 
offset is available to financially dependent children or 
grandchildren, but currently with the restriction that this 
treatment is only available where there is no surviving spouse. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In both cases, these distributions are included in the income of 
beneficiaries.  When the beneficiary is a spouse, a minor or a 
disabled child, there are mechanisms which allow the tax on 
these distributions to be carried forward. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The 1999 budget removes this restriction.  When there is a 
surviving spouse but the RRSPs or RRIFs have been left to 
dependent children, they, not the deceased's estate, are 
responsible for any resulting income inclusions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This tax treatment is beneficial because income tax rates for 
dependent children would be expected to be low.  It is meant to 
provide tax assistance to dependent children at the time of a 
parent's death. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Turning now to tax relief for Canadians with disabilities, hon. 
members are aware of the government's continuing commitment to 
help these Canadians by building on the assistance that is 
already available.  In the last two years additional assistance 
has been provided through such measures as a caregiver tax 
credit, a refundable tax credit for low income earners with high 
medical expenses, and the addition of new eligible expenses under 
the medical expense tax credit, the METC. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The METC is being extended further to cover expenses for the 
care of people with severe disabilities living in a group home, 
therapy for those with severe disabilities and tutoring for the 
learning disabled.  In addition, talking textbooks for 
individuals with perceptual disabilities who are enrolled in 
educational institutions will be included on the list of eligible 
equipment for persons with disabilities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Moving on to another tax credit, some hon. members may be aware 
that the production or processing of electrical energy, or steam 
for sale, was not eligible for the manufacturing and processing 
profits tax credit.  Given the changes and restructuring that the 
electricity generating industry is currently undergoing 
throughout North America, there is now increased competitive 
pressure on Canadian producers of electricity.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>To help this sector compete, corporations producing electrical 
energy for sale or steam for use in such production will now be 
eligible for the manufacturing and processing tax credit. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-25 also regularizes the situation where interest is 
calculated with respect to a corporation on an underpayment of 
income taxes for one taxation year, while interest is 
concurrently owed to the same corporation on a tax payment that 
is higher by an equal amount for a different taxation year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact that the interest on the refund is taxable while the 
unpaid interest is not deductible results in a net cost to the 
corporation.  The discrepancy in interest rates only makes 
matters worse. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This situation is not unusual, as corporations with complex tax 
returns are often in a position where multiple taxation years are 
reassessed at the same time and income and expenses reallocated 
from one taxation year to another.  Bill C-25 institutes a 
relieving mechanism, enabling a corporation to request that both 
amounts be offset for interest calculation purposes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada's investment services industry is another area where fine 
tuning is required due to the rapid growth of mutual funds and 
other investment vehicles.  Canadian service providers are 
concerned that foreign funds which engage them may be taxable in 
Canada because of our tax rules.  A new rule, and I can reassure 
the House that this is not a tax exemption, ensures that engaging 
a Canadian firm to provide certain investment services does not 
mean that a non-resident investment fund is carrying on business 
in Canada. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Where this rule applies, Canadian corporations with customers in 
other countries will continue to pay tax in Canada on their 
profits.  Similarly, foreign funds receiving revenue of Canadian 
origin remain subject to Canadian income tax. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This measure will help the Canadian investment services sector 
to compete internationally. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Investments by individuals in labour sponsored venture capital 
corporations, or LSVCCs, is another area where the federal 
government provides generous tax assistance in the form of a tax 
credit.  Many provinces provide similar assistance.  Measures 
were announced last year to help LSVCCs continue to be important 
suppliers of venture capital to small and medium size businesses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The 1999 budget contains additional measures to encourage LSVCCs 
to focus more on small business investments and to clarify the 
rules that apply when a LSVCC is part of a merger or other 
corporate restructuring. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A final budget measure in the bill further extends the surcharge 
on large deposit making institutions under part VI of the Income 
Tax Act to October 31, 2000.  This 12% capital tax surcharge was 
introduced in the 1995 budget and extended in subsequent budgets. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me now provide hon. members with a brief overview of the 
measures in the bill which were not part of the 1999 budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, the bill helps to implement taxation agreements with 
first nations by providing for a reduction in federal tax for 
individuals who are subject to the income tax legislation of 
certain first nations.  This amendment puts the federal 
government's tax sharing agreements with self-governing Yukon 
first nations into force. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to personal income tax collected from residents of 
these Yukon first nations settlement lands, the federal 
government will vacate 75% of its tax room for the Yukon first 
nations governments to occupy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill also ensures that the tax burden of an individual 
subject to first nations taxation is the same as in surrounding 
jurisdictions. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-25 also includes a provision which exempts from tax the 
trust established by the federal, provincial and territorial 
administrations to compensate hepatitis C victims.

</P>
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The tax treatment of demutualization is another non-budget tax 
measure in the bill.  As hon. members know, demutualization is a 
process whereby mutual insurance companies owned by their voting 
policyholders can convert to ordinary stock companies owned by 
their shareholders.  This allows additional capital to be raised 
in the stock markets to support the business operations of 
insurers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Federal insurance legislation has already been passed to permit 
large life insurers, regulated under Canadian law, to 
demutualize. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Department of Finance released draft rules on the income tax 
consequences of demutualization on December 15, 1998 and has 
worked closely with the demutualizing insurers since that time in 
refining these rules. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The basic cash treatment for cash demutualization benefits is 
that they are treated as dividends and therefore are subject to 
the low rate of tax for dividends.  There is no immediate tax 
benefit associated with a policyholder receiving a share as a 
demutualization benefit but a capital gain would be recognized 
once the share is sold. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Legislation to ensure that the guaranteed income supplement of 
elderly policyholders is fairly calculated after they receive 
demutualization benefits was enacted by parliament earlier this 
year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The measures in Bill C-25 are not contentious.  They are well 
thought out and all adhere to the principles of tax fairness. 
Each measure addresses an inequity, inconsistency or discrepancy 
in the tax system.  Each improves the operation of the tax 
system.  Many of these measures are the result of consultations 
with the industry or clients affected, a process to which our 
government is dedicated in any major policy change. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As hon. members can see, even if the various elements of this 
bill are not interconnected, they are all aimed at improving the 
situation of the Canadian taxpayers and enhancing the equity of 
the tax system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With the five year tax reduction plan set out in Budget 2000, 
which brings in the most significant structural changes to be 
made in the federal tax system in more than ten years, the 
measures in the 1999 budget are in line with the government's 
long term tax reduction strategy. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I urge my hon. colleagues to pass this bill without delay so we 
can move on to budget 2000 and enable Canadians to benefit fully

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Forseth (New Westminster—Coquitlam—Burnaby, 
Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is April and it is 
snowing outside.  It is cold comfort for the hapless taxpayer, as 
we just heard from the previous speaker. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before us we have Bill C-25, an act to amend the Income Tax Act, 
the Excise Tax Act and the Budget Implementation Act, 1999, 
tendered by the Minister of Finance.  This bill is representative 
of how the government spends the people's money.  We must 
remember that fact; it is the people's money and not the 
government's. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know that the Liberals, in an overall sense, tax too much, 
spend too much and then end up owing too much.  It could be said 
that they are just the lowly Liberals; they exist, therefore they 
will spend.  Because of that nature, the economy is not in great 
shape, especially when we compare ourselves to the world 
community. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In considering how our future is being squandered by the waste 
and mismanagement of the government, we need to hold this 
administration to account and to outline a real vision of hope 
and responsibility of what could have been done. We have so much 
potential as a country but what stands in our way is the ideology 
carried by the Liberals in budget after budget.  It seems Canada 
is always described as having a great future as far as living 
memory recalls, but when will it ever arrive? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill still represents an old style of governance that does 
not reflect what the country needs in wise fiscal management. 
However, it is somewhat in character with what the Liberals 
calculate they can buy votes with and keep the national attitude 
going that it is the Liberals who will dole out local favour to 
those who ingratiate themselves to the party rather than 
administer it as a trust for the protection and sustenance of 
all.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Finance and his minions know, for example, that 
HRDC spending is only marginally successful as an overall 
economic benefit to the economy as compared to alternative 
strategies.  However, the government pursues them anyway no 
matter how much it will hurt the country in the future because in 
the short term politicians can make political spin and political 
boasting about their accomplishments. Patronage and vote buying 
may influence elections, but it is a perpetuation of the rape of 
the country for the favoured few. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The electorate needs to distinguish between wise economic 
governance and crude vote buying, which has now been fully 
revealed in the House, and what is the character of a Liberal. It 
is very hurtful behaviour to the country economically and, in a 
moral sense, it is wrong. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Specifically in the bill, the amendments implement certain 
measures announced in the budget of February 16, 1999.  Also 
included are income tax amendments to implement a measure 
relating to taxation agreements with aboriginal groups, included 
in a notice of ways and means motion tabled in the House of 
Commons on December 2, 1998, and income tax amendments relating 
to the demutualism of insurance corporations that were released 
on December 15, 1998.  In some ways it is a technical bill, but 
it is representative of a misguided and hurtful quasi-socialist 
ideology with a lot of old style political conniving thrown in. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What the bill is part of is an overly intrusive administration 
that is Keynesian to a fault.  Voters must understand that 
Liberals cannot manage.  When they influence the economy for 
party interests rather than in the interests of every citizen, we 
see the reason why historically our country has always come in as 
an also ran, never great, never bold, full of unrealized 
potential. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Fiscal decisions are measures of how a government attempts to 
influence the economy.  The national budget generally reflects 
the economic policy and it is partly through the budget that the 
government exercises its three principle methods of establishing 
control:  the allocative function; the stabilization function; 
and, the distributive function. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To understand how we are doing as a country, we must look hard 
at the world of nations in the global village market so to speak. 
The comparative picture is not great.  Responsibility for 
Canada's measure of prosperity rests mostly with our own 
governments and not outside forces.  When we hear socialist talk 
of globalization, it often leads to feelings of helplessness, 
resentment and envy.  The NDP have done fairly well with its 
politics of envy.  Certainly with inadequate economic attitudes, 
a country can feel like flotsam in the great tide of global 
economic change. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The irony in globalization is how much importance it places on 
local attitudes and strategies as determinants of national 
success.  Never before has the maybe tired phrase “think 
globally, act locally” had more meaning, especially in the realm 
of macroeconomic. Canada need not be a victim of forces reputedly 
beyond its control.  The degree to which this country shares and 
engages in the wondrous economic opportunities created by 
globalization and new technology depends in good measure on what 
we do at home to be effective abroad.  Understanding that we are 
powerful rather than weak, that we have choices to make rather 
than immutable facts to accept and that we are as good as anyone 
else on a level playing field is the key to our national 
prosperity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The stakes go far beyond simple measures of per capita wealth 
and gross domestic product, although those matter very much. 
Canada's real per capita GDP grew by only 5% in the 1990s despite 
our embrace of freer trade, some tax reform and other 
adjustments, for they were too timid.  The real per capita income 
of the Americans rose almost four times; of the Dutch, five 
times; of the Norwegians, six times; and of the Irish an 
astounding 18 times, almost doubling in a decade.  The Irish 
might now have higher incomes than Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Faster rates of growth beat the higher standards of private and 
public consumption, better housing, more cultural expression, 
better education, health care, environmental conditions and 
leisure opportunities.  The converse is also true that the 
evidence is that the more socialistic or centrally controlled the 
national economy is, the more impediments there are for open 
markets to function, the worse off are the people both in their 
household budgets and in their more polluted environment and in 
their more circumscribed lives with the lack of basic human 
rights.

</I></B></P><P align=left>However, the rewards of a global consciousness for local 
competitive conditions go deeper.  They ensure that a compelling 
variety of career opportunities exist for the next generation. 
Creative and exciting jobs will exist in those localities that 
learn to serve global markets well.  Of all the things we owe to 
the next generation, this is the most important:  good jobs for 
their own sake and economic freedom to fulfil natural potential. 
However, the Liberals have not been able to create the needed 
optimistic economic climate required for growth because they have 
been too socialistic and too prescriptive for the average 
taxpayer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>An in-depth 1999 survey of 50 leading corporations in Canada 
revealed some sad realities. Forty per cent of chief executives 
from Canadian and foreign-owned companies alike put the 
probability that their own jobs would leave Canada within 10 
years at 50/50 or higher.  An exodus of chief executives or legal 
head offices does not put at risk all the Canadian jobs of such 
companies, but the place where a company's decision making power 
resides is linked to everything from the opportunities opened to 
talented Canadians to the potential for strategic alliances with 
other Canadian companies and broad synergies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Twenty years ago many Canadians worried about the presence in 
Canada of foreign-owned companies with significant operational 
responsibilities here.  Many of those firms have since 
centralized power in their home countries, leaving their Canadian 
branches with externally directed world product mandates.  Now 
the pressing concern is whether globally successful 
Canadian-owned companies will stay here or even start here.  Why 
would they?  The Liberals tax too much, spend too much, owe too 
much and they cannot manage the people's money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have much higher corporate and personal tax rates, more 
restrictive regulations governing mergers, compensation, exchange 
listings and tax deferrals.  There is a brain drain from the 
universities.  Inflexible unions and rigid labour markets hold us 
back.  Boondoggle waste starves needed infrastructure investment. 
Sadly, we still have a cultural hostility to economic success. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many Canadians dismiss business community concerns, especially 
after the turmoil of the 1980s, but they can be explained in 
large part by mismanagement of public finances from government 
rather than private sector activity. Many more changes are 
required to reap the benefits and opportunities of globalization. 
As the most recent federal budget showed, we have not understood 
how urgent these issues are and how amenable they remain to our 
own decisions.  The Canadian Alliance clearly says that we could 
do so much better as a country.  Canada's story is one of missed 
opportunity, a story of what could have been if we had a more 
competent and ethical government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, we have warned for the need to anticipate high 
interest rates and its consequences, but the debt bomb has been 
left ticking away.  We should have been accomplishing more in 
reducing the national debt.  Every prudent householder and small 
business owner knows that when times are more prosperous it is 
time to put the finances in order to withstand a future downturn. 
It means paying down debt to reduce interest payments.  At the 
same time, capacity room is created for borrowing later should it 
be necessary.  This applies to the country as well.  If we do not 
reduce debt when times are good, when will it every be 
appropriate, when the economy is in recession and revenues are 
falling while expenses are rising?  Hardly.  That again is the 
Liberal record. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada has enjoyed almost nine years of uninterrupted moderate 
economic expansion, which, among other benefits, has helped the 
government to eliminate the yearly deficit.  Long term economic 
policy should be such that the government sets its fiscal levels 
of taxation and expenditures to promote economic growth without 
inflation.  As the economy continues to grow, while running close 
to capacity, and as the unemployment rate declines, the threat of 
inflation grows. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These circumstances call for rapid debt reduction and limited, 
if not zero, increases in government spending.  Debt reduction 
itself will restrain inflation somewhat and holding back 
expenditures will dampen the damaging economic fires.  The old 
habit of the Liberals is to use rising government revenues to 
spend for redistributive programs rather than reduce debt.  It is 
reasoned that there are potentially more votes when the 
government writes cheques to people than relieving burden that is 
not immediately evident. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This approach has two problems.  First, increased expenditures 
fuel inflation in a heated up economy resulting in higher 
interest rates.  Second, high levels of taxes that were necessary 
to slay the deficit are out of line with those in other 
developing countries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>High taxes act as a break on future growth as money seeks to 
escape the claw of the tax man. 
High taxes discourage risk taking and tend to send investment 
offshore.  That means no growth.  Without growth there will be 
less income to redistribute and fewer resources to put medicare 
or other social programs on a stable, sustainable footing and be 
more shielded from the ups and downs of the world economy.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Taxes can be significantly and permanently reduced only if the 
interest on the national debt can be reduced.  Our permanent 
outstanding debt is more than $570 billion.  It costs more than 
$40 billion per year just to pay the interest.  This is the 
single largest program of government. For each $1 billion of debt 
reduction, interest payments would decline by at least $60 
million, funds that could be either spent on programs or applied 
to tax reductions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The biggest part of the so-called $58 billion in tax reductions 
announced in the recent federal budget is scheduled to take place 
three, four and five years from now, long after the mandate of 
the current government runs out.  It is an insincere ploy to make 
that kind of future commitment when a future government cannot be 
held to them.  It was a wrong choice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If debt were reduced more aggressively now, the government would 
gain future room to manoeuvre in two ways.  First, the current 
interest payments would decline and second, a return to deficits 
would be less a possibility. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another way of looking at things is the present surplus is 
hurtful high taxation and the money could be more productively 
left in the hands of the consumer and entrepreneur, rather than 
languish in the hands of a government bureaucrat. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Fortunately the debt to GDP ratio is gradually declining.  The 
main reason is moderate growth of the economy and not a decline 
in the debt through wise management. The debt ratio could decline 
even faster if only the government devoted more appropriate 
effort toward planned debt reduction rather than increased 
program spending.  Among other things, increased spending will 
further complicate the workings of monetary policy and will 
probably result in yet even more pressure for higher interest 
rates.  As interest rates rise, so will the cost of servicing the 
debt.  It is a vicious cycle which the Liberals have ignored 
because they chose questionable spending schemes instead of tax 
relief, internal reallocation and debt reduction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The way things stand, when a downturn occurs, and it surely will 
come soon enough, government revenues will decline, interest 
payments will remain at choking levels and expenditures on 
employment insurance and welfare will increase.  We could easily 
be right back in the deficit spiral that nearly destroyed the 
country and the few revenue reductions in the recent budget may 
never occur.  All the sacrifices of the past few years will have 
been for naught. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are not out of the woods.  Our national balance sheet is far 
from strong.  Until we pay down a good part of the national debt 
for past unwise spending, we will still be at serious risk. 
Without real debt reduction, the promised tax adjustments may 
just disappear. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We cannot put groceries on the table with headlines and budget 
speeches.  We cannot put more money on people's kitchen tables 
with Liberal Party economics.  Personal relief is what Canadians 
really want and need.  They want more money left in their hands 
for economic freedom.  They want more groceries.  They might even 
want to buy a pair of jeans, but they will not be able to do that 
with this bill because it just does not leave them nearly enough 
money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Instead of giving Canadians a fake break, we should give them a 
real tax break.  The Liberals unreasonably disturb the market, 
confiscate too much from the taxpayer and then poorly and 
inefficiently deliver high priced services. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The preferred choice is solution 17 of the Canadian Alliance. 
Our proposal will dramatically lower taxes for all Canadians and 
ensure that middle class Canadians whom this government is 
targeting end up with more real disposable income in their 
pockets and not just a headline and a speech which does them 
nothing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The finance minister said in his 1995 budget speech that 
subsidies to business impede growth.  All economists know that 
this is true in the Canadian context, however the finance 
minister continues to rubber stamp all kinds of subsidies to 
business.  The minister has previously admitted that government 
cannot pick winners, but losers can pick governments.  Truer 
words were never spoken. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There have been many losers who have not only picked the pockets 
of this government, but have also taken resources from the 
average taxpayer. Yet the finance minister rubber stamps more of 
these spending schemes.  They go to the human resources minister, 
the Indian affairs minister, the industry minister and the 
Canadian heritage minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Too often they are used for things which appear to be political 
slush, or things which are of such low priority that they are 
seen by the average person as complete rip-offs.  In some cases 
they go to some of the wealthiest companies in the world, and too 
often to boards of directors associated with the Liberal Party 
that is close to their political fundraising.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my theme of the character of Liberal style spending and 
governance, I want to touch briefly upon what has been going on 
in the Department of Human Resources Development. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Back in January we brought to light an audit which revealed all 
kinds of mismanagement and a callous attitude toward the 
hard-earned money taken from Canadians.  We found there was little 
or no monitoring of files on over $1 billion worth of grants and 
subsidies.  There were many cases where applications were not 
even submitted but grant money was given to people. We found all 
kinds of unbelievable things especially in Liberal ridings. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The sad thing is that instead of following accepted standards of 
professional public administration, program designs were flawed 
and unreasonably open to political interference in what should 
have been business standards and program delivery decisions 
rather than questionable political favours. When they were found 
out, a six point fix-up plan was hatched afterward with a promise 
to do better.  The plan is an unbelievably simple recitation of 
the most basic procedures that ordinarily should be followed in 
any federal program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The conclusion from all of this is irrefutable and absolutely 
conclusive.  The Liberals cannot manage.  The more we have dug, 
the worse it gets. The government hangs onto every bit of 
information as long it can, running a game of confusion all 
geared to hide the true nature of the Liberal style of the money 
game. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Indian affairs minister has all kinds of disasters going on 
in his area and the police have been called in to conduct 
investigations in the Prime Minister's riding.  This has happened 
at a time when the finance minister has brought down a budget 
that has more of the same.  There is even more money in the 
budget going to the human resources minister.  It is almost like 
a dare to stick it to the taxpayer one more time.  It is 
unbelievable after the record of poor program design, general 
mismanagement and even outright political meddling. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The ministerial accountability rule dictates that at least 
several ministers should resign in view of this.  They are 
responsible for the planning, approval and ultimate delivery of 
those programs.  There is no question that they should resign. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government spends about $13.5 billion a year on grants and 
contributions.  The entire time the government was cutting the 
heart out of health care, it maintained very questionable 
spending for grants and contributions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals' desire to spend for their friends and to support 
their outmoded prime the pump economic strategy kept them funding 
these pet projects.  They made a cruel heartless choice.  They 
cut hospital beds across the country so that they could fund 
hotel beds in Shawinigan.  That is what it appears to be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Repeat that word picture a thousand times across the country. 
The Liberals call these schemes job creation.  When challenged 
about its claim of 30,000 jobs, the government cannot provide any 
quality evidence that it produced significant program goals. 
Many of the companies just got the money and then went bankrupt. 
For many there were no records, but for the Liberals it was only 
$1 billion so who needs to keep records?  Many of these programs 
likely hurt more than they helped. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must also remember that this comes on top of massive tax 
increases which the government has brought forward over the six 
and a half years it has been in power.  Canadians know that at 
the end of the day they will be paying more in taxes than they 
did when the Liberals took power. We would never know that from 
reading a headline the other day, “$58 billion in tax relief”. 
The real impact is that Canadians will still be paying a lot more 
in taxes than when the government came to power, about $700 per 
family. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can congratulate the government for pulling the wool over the 
people's eyes, including a lot of the fawning, unquestioning 
media, but the truth is that Canadians will still be paying taxes 
that are far too high even after the implementation of this bill. 
Canadians will see the effect on their pay stubs as the year 
progresses, as the changes in this bill and others are 
implemented. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addressing budget 2000, I am sure all members are conscious 
that millions of Canadians have hopes and dreams for themselves 
and their children that can be affected by the spending and 
taxation policies and budgetary promises of the federal 
government. For example, if the federal government wastes 
taxpayer dollars through irresponsible spending, then it is 
Canadians who will suffer. They are the ones who then have fewer 
dollars available to fund services such as health care which 
Canadians value highly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the federal government taxes Canadians too heavily, it is the 
take home pay and the bank accounts of individuals, families and 
employers that are savaged.  It is Canadian jobs and economic 
opportunities that are smothered, or exported to more friendly 
economic climates. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the Minister of Finance makes promises and commitments in his 
budget which are then broken, if the truths asserted in the 
budget turn out to be half-truths, then it is the faith of 
Canadians and the integrity of the government itself which are 
eroded.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Indeed that is where we are at, for fewer voters bother to 
exercise their hard won right to vote at the ballot box.  In each 
election the percentage of turnout is going down as people get 
fed up and disengage from the political life of our country. That 
is what the Canadian Alliance can mend and change, putting real 
power and democratic influence into the hands of the electorate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is clear from the last budget that the highest priority of 
the Liberal government is not tax relief but increased spending 
of taxpayers' dollars.  The budget reveals that the government 
will be spending more this year than provided for in last year's 
estimates.  In other words, the promises in last year's budget to 
limit spending for this year will once again be broken.  The 
chronic tendency of the government to break promises to limit 
spending has often been criticized by the auditor general.  One 
expert said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>While responding to health care needs and refurbishing the RCMP 
and military spending clearly reflect the priorities of 
Canadians, taxpayers should be concerned about the fact that the 
government is using the surplus of over taxation to fund these 
priorities.  Instead of reallocating from existing budget 
envelopes by ending corporate welfare, winding down regional 
development schemes and ending job creation boondoggles, the feds 
have opted to use the surplus of over taxation revenues to fund 
new initiatives. The finance minister and his colleagues have 
ignored the obvious lessons arising from the HRDC.  This puts a 
blemish on this taxpayer friendly budget. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Until the government embarks on a legislated line item plan of 
annual debt reduction, we will continue to lose on average $114 
million a day to institutional bondholders.  Reducing debt today 
cuts tomorrow's taxes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>After years of deep cuts in the wrong places, the Liberals began 
restoring the Canada health and social transfer, the CHST. 
However by 2002 federal spending on health care will only reach 
1995 levels.  The CHST allocation hardly revitalizes the system. 
What it does not do is take into account an increasingly older 
population, expensive advances in technology and advances in 
capabilities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The announced $2.5 billion is spread over four years and the 
provinces are free to spend it on universities and colleges as 
they see fit. This freedom may be good, but the overall picture 
and economic environment set by the federal level is 
insufficient.  The budget increase will not fix the crisis in 
acute care, update old technology or heal the shortage of medical 
and nursing professionals, let alone build new programs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian dollar falls to 63.5 cents U.S. and the Prime 
Minister's response is “No problem”.  Canada's best trained 
people leave for the United States and he says “What brain 
drain?” The human resources department is found to have 
mismanaged at least $1 billion in jobs funds and according to the 
auditor general untold billions of dollars have been wasted.  The 
Prime Minister calls it a minor administrative problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Given that history, imagine my smile when the recent Liberal 
Party convention highlighted the great danger in being next to 
the world's most dynamic economy.  A danger. Anti-Americanism has 
always proven to be a valuable tool when it is time to rally the 
troops of the NDP or the Liberals to justify more intrusion of 
government into markets. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Given that virtually every economist has noted that our growth 
in the past six years has been a result of our record trade 
surpluses with the U.S.A., cabinet should be a little embarrassed 
by focusing on our proximity to the U.S.A. as a big problem. 
There is little doubt that our future prosperity is based on the 
American economy remaining strong. Canada is riding the American 
economic wagon, yet we are complaining about the driver. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In an effort to excuse more government regulation and 
intervention, focusing on preventing American takeovers of 
Canadian companies in certain sectors might be worthy of some 
discussion, but it misses the bigger problems. While too many 
members of the media play into the fearmongering politicians who 
decry American ownership in Canada, a real threat to our economy 
is the huge amount of Canadian money leaving the country.  In 
1998 a total of $17 billion came into Canada from the United 
States while $54 billion left. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not know why it is so hard for some people to understand 
that when money leaves it takes jobs and tax revenues with it. 
When money comes in, most of the jobs stay here and only perhaps 
some of the profits leave the country after a lot of taxes have 
been paid. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the corporate world as much as 70% of all taxes collected are 
unrelated to income, so the vast majority of tax revenue 
generated from businesses stays here.  The government does not 
acknowledge the negative economic impact of capital outflow, but 
the amount of money leaving the country may be the biggest 
economic problem we face because of the poor economic climate the 
Liberals have created.

</I></B></P><P align=left>In the past 10 years $135 billion more left the country than 
came in.  If the Liberals want to focus on just one economic 
problem, this would be a good place to start, and the solution 
would not be more government intervention, as that would be 
identified as a major cause of the problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There has been a surplus in the last few years despite poor 
priority allocation, as it has been done with high levels of 
taxation, which has been an unnecessary drag on economic growth. 
The budget should be balanced every year, save for times of 
national emergency.  However, it should be balanced at a lower 
level, where there is not a wasteful confiscation of citizens' 
labour and production, for at some point taxation even becomes a 
moral issue of basic economic freedom.  The basic economic 
freedom of Canadians is too tightly held by the government.  An 
excess surplus year after year can also be seen as evidence of 
burdensome, hurtful taxation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Concerning taxation, the net impact of the last five Liberal 
budgets has been to raise Canada's tax bill some $6 billion in 
1999-2000 above what Canadians would have paid under the 1993 tax 
regime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If Canada needs to reduce taxes, what about the bill before us 
today?  At first glance the bill tries to pass itself off as 
legislation to bring about tax relief to Canadians.  A closer 
look reveals that for each token tax relief measure there is an 
accompanying tax grab through another initiative.  Specifically, 
clauses 3, 6 and 8 are revenue generating amendments.  Clause 12 
enhances incentives for labour sponsored venture capital 
corporations, which are known to distort the market with respect 
to sound investments.  The other changes in the bill are 
primarily of a housekeeping nature and include items such as RRSP 
proceeds on death, demutualization of insurance companies and the 
hepatitis C trust fund. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In contrast, the Canadian Alliance single rate tax plan, 
solution 17, would deliver significant, deep, across the board 
tax relief.  The basic personal exemption would be increased to 
$10,000 and it would also introduce a $3,000 per child standard 
deduction.  Once implemented the measures would remove 1.9 
million low income taxpayers from the tax rolls as well as 
increase disposable income and financial freedom for all 
taxpayers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under our plan taxpayers would pay a maximum federal rate of 
17%.  The 5% surtax would be eliminated and capital gains would 
be reduced.  Our overall tax relief proposals would improve 
incentives to work, encourage investment and business risk-taking 
entrepreneurship and help stem the costly brain drain. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We still have the overwhelming crushing tax burden faced by 
Canadian taxpayers and businesses.  We still have one of the 
highest personal income tax rates in the G-7.  The token measures 
outlined in Bill C-25 do nothing to reduce that burden.  Once 
again the government masquerades as a proponent of tax relief 
while simultaneously hiking taxes elsewhere. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, solution 17, our single rate tax plan, offers real, 
comprehensive tax relief compared to the tinkering the government 
has proposed in the bill.  Try as it may the government will 
attempt to portray these legislative measures as a symbol of its 
ongoing commitment to generous tax relief, but it is our duty to 
expose the plan for what it really is:  tinkering, tokenism, 
empty of the priorities this country needs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the end of January we released the details of solution 17, 
our 17% single rate tax.  Solution 17 is designed to deliver 
significant tax relief to all taxpayers and it would take 1.9 
million low income Canadians completely off the tax rolls. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here is why we believe this is the right time for major tax 
reform in Canada and why we believe a single rate plan would be 
the best vehicle for delivering tax fairness and tax relief to 
all Canadians.  Right now Canada is in a tax crisis.  We are 
paying too much, losing too many people and businesses to the 
United States, discriminating against families who want to care 
for their children, creating disincentives for people to work for 
themselves, to get out of the welfare trap, and penalizing people 
who want to save and invest for their own retirement and 
security. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal Liberals argue that Canada's fiscal dividend should 
be used to increase the size of government.  Yet the recent OECD 
analysis of member countries shows that only Denmark, Norway, 
Sweden and Iceland spend more per capita on government spending 
than we do in Canada.  With our high tax load and the finance 
minister predicting surpluses approaching $100 billion over the 
next five years, the timing could not be better for significant 
across the board tax relief.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Not only is the government taking too much from us in taxes, it 
is taking it in the wrong way.  Over the next few years as we 
look at growing surpluses we will have a golden opportunity not 
only to reduce the actual tax load aggressively and quickly, but 
to reform the tax system to reduce or at least minimize the harm 
that the system imposes on Canadians' lives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada's current income tax system is structured around three 
main tax brackets and a surtax.  What is wrong with this?  The 
severity of the jump in marginal rates at low income levels 
exacts a heavy toll on all our taxpayers and, ultimately, the 
economy.  The highest marginal rate, about 50%, kicks in at 
roughly $60,000, compared to $430,000 in the United States.  The 
U.S. rate is about 39.6%, depending on the state. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a massive disincentive to work and save and invest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This discriminates also between single and dual income families. 
It leads to accounting gymnastics.  Our plan would bring a single 
rate tax system, augmented by significantly increased personal 
and spousal deductions and a restored deduction for dependent 
children.  Every Canadian would see lower taxes under this plan. 
It would maintain all existing deductions and credits, with three 
significant exceptions.  The personal and spousal exemption would 
be increased and equalized, and we would introduce a standard 
$3,000 children's deduction to acknowledge the family expense of 
raising children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In our plan 1.9 million low income Canadians would be completely 
taken off the tax rolls.  The impact of any single marginal tax 
rate would then depend on the base exemptions and the rate 
selected.  If we combined the single tax rate with lower taxes 
for all and greatly enhanced personal exemptions to assist those 
at the lowest income range, everyone would benefit.  That is what 
would be achieved under our single rate plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under our single marginal rate not only would those individuals 
and families with a greater ability to pay now pay a greater 
absolute amount, they would also pay at a greater proportion of 
income than those at the lower end.  A single rate system of 
taxation would do something else.  It would remove the massive 
disincentive to work, to save and to invest, which is currently 
the case in Canada.  It would end the penalty for hard work and 
success. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our current multiple rate system penalizes extra work.  Why be 
more productive or take an extra contract only to have Ottawa 
take an even higher percentage of the fruits of our labour?  Why 
take investment risks, saving for the future, when Revenue Canada 
will get a bigger chunk of our effort?  This marginal tax penalty 
would be removed under a single rate system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A single rate tax would end the existing discrimination between 
single and dual income families.  Right now families who choose 
to have one parent stay at home are taxed at a higher marginal 
tax rate.  They are penalized by the tax system if they choose to 
stay home with their children.  A single rate system would remove 
this discrimination and, along with a significant per child 
deduction, would lower the overall tax burden for families.  The 
Canadian Alliance is the real family friendly party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Not only would our single tax rate bring income levels more in 
line with our largest trading partner, it would significantly 
lower capital gains taxes.  This would discourage the brain drain 
in key sectors of our economy and encourage new businesses and 
the venture capital formation necessary to attract the well 
paying jobs that build wealth and ultimately raise the standard 
of living for all Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The benefits of a single rate are obvious.  A single low 
marginal rate would eliminate the discrimination between families 
and would deliver tax relief for everyone.  It would eliminate 
the disincentive to succeed.  It would increase take home pay. 
It would encourage more high tech firms to set up shop in Canada, 
and it would make all of us more internationally competitive in 
the new global economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a plan that would promote growth and wealth creation by 
making all taxes simpler, flatter and lower.  It is a plan for 
today and a tax plan for Canada's future, and it is all possible 
using the same economic assumptions and basic numbers of the 
Minister of Finance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, if we can deliver such an astounding package 
compared to the Liberals, the basic question must be asked:  What 
are the Liberals doing with the money?  They are wasting it and 
mismanaging it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill does nothing to change the conclusion of the argument 
that I have made today, and that is that the Liberals cannot 
manage.

Since that time this date has held immeasurable historical 
importance and significance to Scots the world over. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The contribution of Scottish immigrants to the history and 
evolution of North America in general and to Canada specifically 
has been and continues to be both massive and proud.  As a 
result, numerous provincial legislatures have passed resolutions

province of Ontario in 1991.

criss-crossing Canada with a letter to MPPs from the leader of 
the Bloc Quebecois. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They want to bring home to Canada's elected representatives Bill 
C-20's threat to democracy, specifically the hijacking of the 
prerogatives of legislative assemblies and the double standard 
that the federal government wants to apply to the votes cast by 
Quebecers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In his letter, the leader of the Bloc Quebecois points out that, 
with Bill C-20, the federal government is granting itself the 
power to judge the validity of decisions taken democratically by 
elected representatives of legislative assemblies.  By calling 
into question the 50% plus one rule, it is contradicting its own 
foreign policy, under which it recognized the results of the 
referendum in East Timor. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bloc Quebecois members will be reminding provincial 
representatives that Bill C-20 provides no solution at all to the

this morning the keynote speaker at the annual parliamentary

Pastor Dale Lang and his wife Diane said goodbye to their son 
Jason a year ago when he was shot in the tragic high school 
shooting in Taber. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This morning Pastor Lang reminded us that we live in a

diminished the value of being a human and the value of human life 
and have glorified violence.

also told us that we can be healed if we practise forgiveness. He

forgive the troubled young man who caused that death. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>God bless Dale and Diane as they bring this powerful gift of 
forgiveness to our nation's young people and to all of us.

negotiate the necessary agreements and the bill has no teeth to 
make it do it.

Laboratories, the subsidiary of CDC.  The Minister of Finance was 
on the board of directors at that time.  The memo is dated 1983. 
It says “In view that Connaught's blood products are not yet 
registered in most countries, nor do we have heat-treated 
products, it is essential that we capitalize on every inquiry 
that we may receive”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In other words, Connaught Laboratories was trying to sell a 
product, which would not be allowed in the United States or 
Canada, abroad.  This was during the time the Minister of Finance 
was on the board of directors of the CDC. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Will the Prime Minister be able to assure us that these kinds of

confirmation of quantities which will be available for export as 
of September 27 of 400,000 units for Iran and another for 
Spain”.  In other words, Connaught Laboratories sold products in 
1983 that it knew full well were tainted blood products.

extended by the government to private-for-profit clinics in the

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
in relation to the comments made by the member for Sudbury, I 
take it from the reports that there is some suggestion there is 
an old boys' network, that we do each other favours out of 
friendship.  I want to make it clear to the House and to the hon.

Canada Health Act simply because of my warm and cozy relationship 
with Mike Harris and Ralph Klein. 
<P><A NAME="LINK107"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg—Transcona, NDP):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I did not raise the comment about the old boys' club. I 
raised the question about the 12 principles that the government 
had signed onto and I asked the minister whether he was prepared 
to repudiate those principles. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not care whether it is an old boys' club or an old girls' 
club.  The fact of the matter is that this government is now 
tolerating private-for-profit clinics and has been doing so for 
some time.  Former ministers of health have called attention to 
this.  We are at a critical point.  Bill 11 will move the 
involvement of these clinics up to a level that threatens 
medicare in the way that extra billing and user fees did before 
Monique Bégin acted in 1984. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is time for the minister to act in that same tradition.  Will 
he do so?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
I can assure the member that we will do everything required to

</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me correct something the member said.  He refers to 12 
principles being signed onto.  Let me make it clear that there is 
no agreement between the Government of Canada and any provincial 
government with respect to principles beyond the Canada Health 
Act and nothing in any principles promulgated by any provincial 
government will ever stand in the way of our enforcing the Canada 
Health Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, in relation to bill 11, as I have assured the member

government that cut $35 billion out of health transfers.  As a 
member of this government said herself, “You get the type of 
health care system you pay for”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of every dollar that is spent in health care, the federal 
government puts one dime toward the provincial costs of health 
care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Will the Prime Minister listen to his former Minister of Health 
and meet with the premiers and fix this crisis?  Maybe the 
finance minister should bring his cheque book with him. 
<P><A NAME="LINK112"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, next year transfers to the provinces will be $31 
billion.  That is an all time high.  Transfers in terms of 
equalization will be at an all time high. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact is that this government put a floor under the transfers 
to make sure that they would never drop further, a drop which had 
occurred under the previous Tory government.  At the same time, 
this government has invested amounts in health care research that 
the Tory government could not even contemplate.  We have put 
money into the child tax benefit, helping poor and middle income 
families. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are all things that the Tory government let lie fallow and

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bob Mills (Red Deer, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
the finance minister appears to be in a serious conflict of 
interest as a result of his relationship with Connaught 
Laboratories in the 1980s. 
Minutes from CDC board meetings could clear the air.  The ethics 
counsellor passed those minutes on to the finance department and 
he warned that they would have to be released under the Access to 
Information Act.

<P><A NAME="LINK115"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, first of all the purpose of the ethics counsellor's 
report is to determine the very question the member has raised. I 
was the person who asked the ethics counsellor to undertake that 
full examination. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As far as access to information is concerned, I mentioned 
yesterday that I was not involved in that for obvious reasons, 
given the nature of the query.  I have asked my department to do 
a thorough examination of the whole matter, and at the same time, 
in order to make sure it is as open and transparent as possible, 
my department has invited the information commissioner to come in 
and participate fully.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bob Mills (Red Deer, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr.

caused the minister to refuse to release those documents? 
<P><A NAME="LINK117"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B>  Mr.

the Bloc Quebecois asked for an investigation as early as 1995.

<P><A NAME="LINK121"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George—Peace River, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the finance department has shown a 
high level of interest in this potential conflict of interest 
case.  First a department official followed an ethics 
investigator to CDC's successor, Nova Chemicals in Calgary. Now 
we have documents that show that the finance minister himself 
seemed preoccupied with Nova. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister had the most senior ranks of his department 
involved in gathering information about Nova's move from Calgary 
to Pittsburgh. Was the finance minister really just concerned 
about the 65 jobs or did he have his senior finance officials 
digging because Nova was on his mind for other reasons? 
<P><A NAME="LINK123"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, this is ludicrous.  The fact is that when this issue 
first arose it was quite clear, as I stated in the House, that I 
asked my department to look into it right away. They began to do 
so.  A very short time thereafter, I asked the ethics counsellor 
if he would undertake a full and thorough examination of the 
whole thing.  For a period of time they operated on a parallel 
track until such time as the department turned the whole thing 
over to the ethics counsellor. That is exactly what happened. 
<P><A NAME="LINK124"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George—Peace River, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, let us look at what is ludicrous. The 
deputy minister's office, two assistant deputy ministers, an 
associate deputy minister and other senior officials were tasked 
with getting information on Nova Chemicals for the Minister of 
Finance. 
That is pretty high priced help, I would suggest.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B>  Mr.

hon. member is talking about in terms of all of this assemblage 
of public servants who are looking into one company. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact is part of Nova Chemicals did move to Pittsburgh and 
many people were quite interested in the move.  However I do not 
think there was anything untoward and I do not think that the 
Department of Finance took any untoward interest in that.

today marks the first anniversary of the tragic shootings at OC 
Transpo in Ottawa which resulted in the deaths of five workers. 
The OC Transpo inquest produced a series of recommendations 
concerning violence, harassment and workplace problems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Has the Minister of Labour had the opportunity to review these 
recommendations with her cabinet colleagues, and are there any 
changes contemplated to federal workplace policies? 
<P><A NAME="LINK159"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Claudette Bradshaw (Minister of Labour, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, on the anniversary of this tragic event I would like to 
offer my sincere condolences to the families and friends of the 
workers whose lives were lost that day.  I would like to convey 
to those families that I will continue to push forward with 
legislative changes that will provide workers with protection 
against workplace violence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In that spirit, I strongly urge all members of the House to 
support the passage of Bill C-12.  Bill C-12 would provide the 
authority we need to develop regulations to prevent violence in 
the workplace and to better protect employees.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I cannot say that it gives me great pleasure to discuss this 
bill.  Everyone will remember how terribly disappointed we were 
by the budget brought down last year by the Minister of Finance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We were disappointed because, once again, the Minister of 
Finance did not tell us the whole truth about how the nation's 
finances were handled.  He did not tell us about the various 
avenues open to him to provide relief to taxpayers and the 
disadvantaged, to introduce truly constructive measures, to put a 
stop to cuts in social programs, for example. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Moreover, I have a clear recollection that on that date, that is 
February 17, 1999, the <I>Globe and Mail </I>minced no words in 
describing the Minister of Finance as lacking in imagination, 
and in stating that he had never been in a situation of managing 
growth and surpluses, and ought to let someone else take over. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The budget brought down just a few weeks ago was no exception to 
the rule.  It is, in all aspects, along the same lines as last 
year's, in other words, disappointing and drab.  Last year's 
budget was so drab in fact that I can hardly keep my eyes open 
today when referring to it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First of all, the Minister of Finance, sticking to tradition, 
both last year and this year—and this will go on until he quits, 
which we hope will be soon, because we are fed up with all his 
sneakiness—has hidden the true surplus from us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Hon. members need only to look at the figures. 
Since 1994, if one took all the budgets, all the Minister of 
Finance's figures, one would see that every time he opened his 
mouth, speaking first of the deficit and only after of 
surpluses, within a few months, his forecasts were shown to be 
close to 100% off, sometimes even 150%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the 1999 budget, the one of interest to us here, the minister 
said “For this year 1999-2000”—the fiscal year that has just ended 
on March 31—“the surplus will be only $3 billion”.  A scant few 
months later, in his economic update, exactly seven months after 
bringing down his budget, he informed us that his surplus for 
the last fiscal year might be as high as $5 billion.  This means 
a difference of $2 billion in just a few months. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With the 2000-01 budget, this year's budget, a few weeks ago, the 
Minister of Finance again revised the figure for his surplus to 
$5.7 billion.  That was at the end of February.  The figure is 
therefore $2.5 billion more than it was two and a half months 
previously. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><I>The Fiscal Monitor</I> of the Department of Finance has just brought 
out its most recent estimates based on the first ten months of 
the last fiscal year.  It places the surplus for this fiscal 
year at nearly $12 billion.  That is a bit of a difference. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Do you know what the Bloc Quebecois was saying as of February 
last year, when the Minister of Finance brought down his budget? 
The Bloc Quebecois said, based on the most reasonable 
assumptions, the information available to us over a year ago, 
that the surplus would be around $12 billion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>And so, doing an analysis using generally recognized parameters, 
a personal computer and a small team, not the hundreds of public 
servants in the Department of Finance and Revenue Canada, but 
with a few people, we succeeded, 12 months ahead, in predicting 
that the surplus for 1999-2000 would be about $12 billion, exactly 
as <I>The Fiscal Monitor</I> just said a few weeks ago, based on the 
first ten months of the last fiscal year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We managed it not because we are smarter than other people.  You 
will agree, and you have already said so to me, Mr. Speaker, 
that we are good.  There is no doubt about it.  We have not been 
wrong since 1994.  When we make forecasts, we are rarely wrong. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the Minister of Finance makes forecasts, he has always been 
wrong.  They have not been minor mistakes.  As I mentioned, he 
has been out by 100% or 150%.  That is a lot.  That denies 
people the opportunity of really evaluating what is available to 
this government to implement the measures expected of it.  This 
impedes democracy.  It is undemocratic to work this way, very 
undemocratic.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Finance shows up with so-called unexpected 
surpluses either because he was unable to foresee them or 
because he hid them from us for a whole year. He uses that money 
to lower the debt, or he thoughtlessly jumps the gun regarding 
certain expenditures and steps in provincial jurisdictions, just 
like the self-sufficient and know-it-all federal Minister of Health 
has been doing these past few months. This is what the minister 
is doing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With the prospect of a surplus we had already estimated at 
$12 billion back then, we thought the Minister of Finance would 
take concrete measures to lower taxes and give taxpayers a 
break. Not only did he not do that with the potential $12 billion 
surplus in the last fiscal year, but he is not doing it this 
year either, when the surplus for fiscal year 2000-01 could 
exceed $21 billion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister's tax reductions are ridiculously low this year and 
they were even lower last year. In fact, the results of these 
reductions are totally insignificant. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me give you an example. For the 1999-2000 fiscal year, middle 
income taxpayers, that is those who earn between $30,000 and 
$70,000, will save an average of $150 in taxes. This is over a 
period of 365 days. Just do the calculation. 
This will not even buy a cup of coffee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But there were winners in 1999, as there were in the last 
budget—the rich.  In 1999, if you were one of the lucky few with 
an income of $250,000 or higher, the elimination of the 3% 
surtax saved you over $3,500 in taxes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>You are a middle income earner.  The federal government has been 
relying on you heavily since 1993 to help put its fiscal house 
in order.  There is a hefty $12 billion surplus in 1999-2000 but 
it does not help middle income earners.  Those who are already 
very rich get another break in the form of a $3,500 tax saving 
starting with the tax year for which we are now filing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is sad. 
The Minister of Finance tells us that there were tax cuts last 
year, and that there will also be some this year, but things are 
no better this year.  In fiscal 2000-01, it will be pretty much 
the same—$150, $300, in real tax savings.  Once again, with the 
cuts, the 5% surtax that remained, as well as the increase in 
the capital gains exclusion rate, it is those in the $250,000 
plus income bracket that will benefit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not $3,500.  Another $4,000 has been added.  Both measures 
taken together, i.e. last year's elimination of the 3% surtax, 
and this year's increase in the capital gains exclusion rate 
from 75% to 66%—33% of capital gains are not subject to any 
taxes—put another $4,000 in these folks' pockets.  In two years, 
they have saved $7,500 in taxes. 
However, those earning between $30,000 and $70,000 had a tax 
saving of $300 for the entire year, and this has just been 
described as fair. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last year, with the $12 billion in surplus, which was known 
about but deliberately concealed from us, the Minister of 
Finance could have revised the zero taxation levels, that is the 
point at which families start paying federal income tax. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this connection, I will point out a few figures that 
demonstrate the considerable imbalance that exists between the 
federal taxation system and Quebec's system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To take the example of a couple with two dependent children and 
one single employment income, the federal cut-off point after 
which they start to pay tax is $13,719. 
Do hon. members know at what point they start paying Quebec 
taxes?  At $30,316.  Hon. members see the imbalance here.  Back 
in 1999, with a potential surplus of $12 billion, the Minister 
of Finance could have moved the zero tax threshold upward.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us take another example, a retired couple, age 65, with no 
children.  They start paying federal income tax at the $20,000 
level, while in Quebec the level is $26,000.  This could have 
been brought back into balance.  With less of a surplus 
available to it, Quebec has done more with less than the feds, 
with surplus funds coming out of their ears, not to mention out 
of the pockets of the Minister of Finance.  However, what is 
spilling out of his pockets is not his money, but ours.  It is 
the money of the middle income taxpayers, the largest group of 
taxpayers in Canada.  Yet he has done nothing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He could also have changed the employment insurance plan, this 
man who says he has a lot of compassion for the most 
disadvantaged.  Since becoming the Minister of Finance, he has 
put people in the hole, tossed them out on the street.  With his 
savage measures of the right, this minister who claims to have a 
social side, almost socialist the way he puts it, this man has 
pushed people at the threshold of middle income into a low income 
bracket.  He has pushed them into poverty.  He has thrown them 
into the pit of poverty.  He did so in 1999 and is still doing it 
in 2000 with his latest budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He could have changed the employment insurance plan, which 
covers only 42% of the targeted clientele, the unemployed, who 
pay.  We know, now, all workers pay into employment insurance, as 
do all employers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When these people lose their job, fewer than half of them will 
benefit from employment insurance.  Six out of ten unemployed 
persons are excluded from the employment insurance plan.  He 
could have changed the plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are not saying the plan has to be permissive, open, with 
money pouring out uncontrolled.  We know that Department of Human 
Resources Development has no need for our suggestions on this 
subject.  We know that in this department they stalk the 
unemployed in order to not give them what they are entitled to as 
benefits.  They wake them up at 6 a.m. to make sure they are 
available for work, they treat them like robbers and cheaters. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can see too how this department treats friends of the party. 
They grease their palms, they give them hush money. 
They get a $1.2 million grant, no questions asked, but unemployed 
workers are asked to return $5 of $200 received, because their 
benefits have been reviewed.  They are hunted down like thieves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The friends of the party are not treated like thieves.  The 
federal government shuts it eyes and deliberately hands over the 
$1 million, not even requiring that any jobs be created.  We have 
the HRDC scandal to prove it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On another topic, the Minister of Finance could have overhauled 
the EI scheme.  He could have arranged things so that most of 
those who pay premiums qualify. But no, he did not.  He did not 
do so in 1999 with a $12 billion surplus, nor did he do so this 
year with a surplus of over $21 billion.  When will he do so? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When will he decide to stop abandoning those who are already 
down and out?  These people do not qualify for EI because the 
criteria are too restrictive, and they do not qualify for 
welfare because they have assets that they must first sell. 
They are being reduced to poverty, put out in the street, driven 
to suicide.  There are people living out these tragedies today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Finance has a $12 billion surplus this year, and 
he will have a $21 billion surplus at the end of this fiscal, but 
he has done nothing to help these people out.  This is not just 
unacceptable, it is completely revolting. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government used the 1999 budget to pull a fast one 
on Quebec.  The Minister of Finance says he is a Quebecer and 
holds international fora in Montreal, and naturally we are very 
pleased. 
Montreal is becoming the financial capital not only of Canada 
but, thanks to the initiatives taken by Mr. Landry, of North 
America. It is perfectly normal to recognize that and to at 
least hold a first meeting of G-20 members in Montreal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He claims to be a Quebecer, but why did he take advantage of the 
1999 budget to pull a fast one on Quebec by unilaterally 
changing the formula for the Canada social transfer? Until then, 
the sharing was based on a number of criteria, including 
population. But population was not the primary factor. The 
primary factor was the need for the portion of federal transfers 
earmarked for social assistance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This Minister of Finance, who claims to be very understanding, 
to treat Quebec well, to be a good representative for our 
province, unilaterally decided to pull a fast one on Quebec and 
to amend that formula. The result is that Ontario was the big 
winner, following the $2 billion adjustment made to the Canada 
social transfer in 1999.

<A HREF="#LINKT56"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>By using population as the primary criterion, Ontario benefits 
because its population is larger than that of Quebec. Ontario is 
the province with the largest population in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Half of the $2 billion adjustment went to Ontario. The richest 
province in Canada received $1 billion out of the adjustment to 
the Canada social transfer, to fund social assistance, higher 
education and health. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since 1994, a well-oiled system has been put in place by the 
Minister of Finance in order to arrive, by 2004, at cumulative 
cuts of $32 billion in social transfers to the provinces. By 
2004, Quebec will have absorbed 50% of these cuts, which 
represents a $16 billion shortfall. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They pulled a quick one over on it in the 1999 budget by 
exchanging the criterion for one based on population.  Ontario 
won the prize.  Quebec has absorbed double the amount it should 
have in federal government cuts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the Prime Minister did last week, government members from 
Quebec were bragging that, in 1999, Quebec received a $1 billion 
adjustment in equalization payments.  Of course,  we got $1 
billion, because equalization payments are calculated 
mathematically rather than politically. The Liberals make 
political hay with it. No matter, they make political hay with 
everything, such as the fate of the sick and the most 
disadvantaged. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These people make political hay with everything and delay the 
right decisions until the next election campaign instead of 
easing things for people who have suffered for three or four 
years.  They play petty politics. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They gave Quebec a $1 billion adjustment in equalization 
payments.  Why?  Because they did not give it enough before under 
the brutal calculations of the equalization formulae. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, what they do not say is that what they gave with one 
hand they took away with the other.  I talked of the new formula 
for allocating the Canada social transfer.  In this, they took 
from Quebec what it was entitled to.  There is also a $2 billion 
shortfall Quebec is still seeking for having harmonized the GST 
with the QST in 1991. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal Minister of Finance, who claims to be a Quebecer and 
to stand up for Quebec, gave $800 million to three little 
maritime provinces, because they harmonized their sales tax with 
the GST.  Quebec did so in 1991 and is seeking compensation from 
the Minister of Finance. 
We did exactly the same calculations as were done for the three 
maritime provinces, coming up with a total of $2 billion.  The 
Minister of Finance informed us “No, you are not entitled to 
it”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We made adjustments.  The Government of Quebec also collects the 
GST on behalf of the federal government.  It is calling for $2 
billion in compensation for having carried out harmonization of 
the QST with the GST.  Quebec is asking for nothing more and 
nothing less than the fair treatment according the three 
maritime provinces, and yet it is being told it is not entitled 
to it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is also an annual shortfall of another $2 billion in 
federal government procurement of goods and services.  We are 
not the ones saying so.  It comes from Statistics Canada.  In 
relation to its demographic weight, Quebec ought to have $2 
billion more each year in federal government procurement of 
goods and services. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This adds up as follows: $6 billion in cuts to the Canada social 
transfer since 1994, $2 billion shortfall annually in goods and 
services procurement, and $2 billion in compensation for 
harmonization with the GST, for a total of $10 billion.  Here 
they are boasting about making us a gift of $1 billion, while we 
were shortchanged to the tune of $10 billion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is liking having a burglar break into your house, one who 
might just happen to be Minister of Finance.  He helps himself 
to $10,000 of your money.  You chase him and nab him at the 
corner, and he gives you back $1,000.  You hug him in gratitude 
for returning 10% of what he took.  There is a limit to what a 
person can put up with. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the 30 seconds remaining to me I will just raise an important 
point that comes up in Bill C-25, which is the trust set up for 
hepatitis C compensation. 
As announced in 1999, this bill proposes to consider the 
compensation received by the hepatitis C victims as tax exempt. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1530"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT57"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I take this opportunity to remind the House that those who were 
infected before 1986 or after 1990 are still not entitled to any 
compensation, even though they are victims just like the others. 
We must remember that, and this is a good opportunity to remind 
the House of it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Moreover, those who are entitled to compensation are still 
waiting for their cheques because, seemingly, these cheques are 
in the hands of the lawyers. It might be a good idea for the 
government—and I will conclude with this message—not only to 
think about tax treatment, but also to use its money to treat 
those who are not entitled to compensation on the same level as 
the others. These people are no less affected by hepatitis than 
the others and they too should be compensated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will vote against Bill C-25 at second reading. It reflects 
the finance minister's lack of imagination, his total lack of 
compassion for the needy and his refusal to follow up on the 
numerous requests made by the governments of Quebec and the other 
provinces to restore the Canada social transfer, to review the 
employment insurance reform and, in the case of Quebec, the 
minister's refusal to follow up on a request to be compensated 
for having harmonized the GST and the TVQ—the federal government 
owes $2 billion to Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois has been asking since 1993 that Quebec be 
treated fairly regarding the procurement of goods and services 
the allocation of budgets for research and development. We are 
still waiting for a reply from the Minister of Finance. No reply 
is provided in the 1999 budget, in the 2000 budget, and even less 
so in the 1999 budget implementation bill, namely Bill C-5.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Scott Brison (Kings—Hants, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is 
with pleasure that I rise today to speak to Bill C-25, the Income 
Tax Amendments Act, 1999. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yesterday I attended the Business Council on National Issues' 
annual CEO summit in Toronto.  At that summit there was an 
immense amount of discussion surrounding some of the issues 
facing not just the business community but all Canadians in the 
complex and hypercompetitive, globally integrated economy that we 
are entrenched in today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I heard a lot of very serious and legitimate concerns about the 
future of our country.  I was dismayed by a sense of 
disconnection between the people in that room, who were working 
hard to create greater levels of opportunity for Canadians and 
greater levels of prosperity for Canada, and the people here in 
parliament and the House of Commons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yesterday morning the Minister of Industry spoke to the group 
assembled.  His speech contained some very positive messages with 
respect to the future competitiveness of Canada.  However, in the 
question and answers after, he clearly disappointed those 
assembled by demonstrating that he lacked the vision and the 
leadership to provide the types of initiatives that Canada needs 
at this juncture to forge forward as a globally competitive 
country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister was asked a question by Izzy Asper, the CEO of 
CanWest Global Communications Corp. and head of the Global 
Television Network, concerning the Canadian tax system.  I will 
quote Mr. Asper. 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian tax system that we're living under was last 
reformed 32 years ago.  It is 
obsolete and the world it was designed to deal with no longer 
exists. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The (system) is a nightmare of complexity, a sea of 
uncertainty...The tax system is now anti-business, anti-private 
sector and anti-entrepreneurial. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In short, Mr. Asper was saying that our tax system is 
anti-growth.  I would argue that is clearly not to the benefit 
of any Canadians, whether in the business community or outside 
of it. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1535"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT58"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In his response to that very serious question, the Minister of 
Industry said that a fundamental reform of the tax system would 
require an enormous amount of consensus among the taxpayers.  He 
effectively said that it was impossible to reform the tax system 
because it would require a consensus. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In his statement, I think he was speaking to a larger truth, 
that is, to the lack of vision on the government's side in terms 
of these very important issues and the incrementalist, 
poll-driven style of this government relative to many issues, in 
particular, economic issues.  In its tinkering, in its short term 
focus on next week's polls, it is ignoring the interests of 
Canadians well into the next century. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We heard from a number of individuals who were participating in 
the conference yesterday.  A gentleman by the name of Tom 
Axworthy spoke to the group assembled.  As an experienced former 
professor at Harvard, he indicated that in the last several years 
he has seen the percentage of expatriate Canadian students 
studying at Harvard, who returned to Canada, significantly 
reduced, to the extent that now virtually none of the Harvard 
graduates from Canada are actually returning to Canada.  They are 
staying in the U.S. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are very troubling and not simply anecdotal experiences. 
These are signs of a greater truth.  The Conference Board of 
Canada's report on brain drain indicated that the number of 
Canadians leaving Canada to go to the U.S. seeking greater levels 
of opportunity and growth for themselves and their families has 
grown from 16,000 per year to over 100,000 in the last year. 
These types of statistics are very troubling for Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also heard yesterday from the U.S. economist Lester Thurow 
who, a number of years ago when the Liberals were in opposition, 
spoke to a Liberal policy gathering.  In referring to the current 
Prime Minister he said that the Prime Minister's “one problem at 
a time” and “Canada is number one” rhetoric reflected his 
personal and political convictions that setting national targets, 
exhorting citizens to make special efforts, using his office as a 
bully pulpit in outlining serious challenges for citizens to 
consider, are all potentially fatal political traps. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While we are listed by the UN as the greatest country in the 
world to live, and all Canadians are quite proud of that, and 
while the Prime Minister pontificates about how we are the 
greatest country in the world, he is using that as a reason for 
not pursuing economically visionary policies.  Whenever a 
politician or a government pursues policies that are visionary or 
forward-thinking there is risk.  Clearly the previous government 
paid a significant price for pursuing policies that were 
visionary and politically dangerous. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Free trade, which is lauded now by almost all parties in the 
House, and certainly by the opposition Liberals who fought 
vociferously against it prior to 1988, was a very controversial 
issue in the 1988 election.  In fact over half of Canadians voted 
against free trade.  The majority of Canadians voted for parties 
that were opposed to free trade. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That step went far beyond the Minister of Industry's statement 
about tinkering and consensus.  That step was one of vision and 
of leadership.  Making the types of structural changes to the 
Canadian economy, which have enabled Canadians, toward the end of 
the 1990s and now as we have entered the 21st century, to be in a 
position where we can potentially take advantage of the 
opportunities and face the challenges of the new economy.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Similarly, the GST, against which the Liberals successfully 
fought in the 1993 election, is now embraced by the Liberals.  In 
fact, the Prime Minister on foreign travels claims to have 
invented or implemented the GST. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The difficulty with the Minister of Industry's statement 
yesterday, that no steps can be taken without the consensus of 
Canadians, indicates that this government is so focused on 
following the polls that it is failing to lead Canadians. 
Canadians deserve better government than that.  I would argue 
that on the GST there was a consensus.  Unfortunately, it was not 
a consensus that was positive for my party in 1993. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John McKay:</B>  That is the best part of your speech so 
far. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Scott Brison:</B>  One of the Liberal members opposite has 
commended me on my oratory today.  I appreciate that.  It is 
tremendously kind. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I thank the Liberals opposite for not changing those excellent 
policies of the previous government because, frankly, they have 
been the policies that have enabled the current government to 
eliminate the deficit, along with the support of the Canadian 
taxpayers who have been pummelled under this government's 
leadership.  It could be said that the government opposite is a 
government of sound and original ideas.  Unfortunately, its sound 
ideas are seldom original and its original ideas are seldom 
sound. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are speaking today to Bill C-25, an act to amend the Income 
Tax Act, the Excise Tax Act and the Budget Implementation Act, 
1999.  This is a collection of tinkering measures that fail to 
address some of the significant tax reform issues challenging 
Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under this government we have seen declining productivity and 
investment and, in fact, an exodus of not just Canadian talent, 
in terms of the best and brightest young people we have in 
Canada, but also an exodus of investment in what is sometimes 
called the corporate takeover of Canada.  We have seen a huge 
loss of Canadian economic sovereignty under this government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important to note that sovereignty is not about economic 
symbols.  It is about economic performance.  While the government 
will continually go back to symbolism and try to defend its 
record based on particular symbols, it is missing the basic 
message or mantra of the new economy which is that individuals, 
wherever they live in the world, are prosperous or poor based on 
the degree to which their governments create environments for 
their citizenry to participate fully in this new challenging 
global economy.  This government is clearly failing to recognize 
the opportunities and challenges of this new economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians deserve much better.  Canadians deserve a government 
with a clearer vision, a government willing to take some risks on 
economic policy and forge ahead of where the polls are indicating 
the government should be right now and actually do some of the 
things that Canadians need to be done to prepare them for well 
into this millennium. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Based on the last three budgets, it is clear that the Liberal 
government is big on labels.  We saw in the 1998 budget that it 
was the education budget and 12 months after that budget, over 
12,000 Canadian graduates declared bankruptcy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The 1999 budget was the health care budget.  In the year 
following that budget, we still see the Canadian health care 
system in a shambles and health care reeling in every province in 
Canada, not because we have bad provincial governments but 
because the federal government has abdicated its responsibility 
to defend the Canada Health Act and has not provided the type of 
funding necessary for the provinces to maintain the principles of 
the Canada Health Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The year 2000 budget was the tax cut budget.  Before this 
budget, Canada had the highest personal income taxes in the G-7. 
After this budget Canadians face the highest personal income 
taxes in the G-7.

After the tax relief measures of the budget are fully implemented 
over a five year period, Canada will have the fourth highest 
corporate taxes of the 31 OECD countries.  That is assuming that 
other OECD countries will not reduce their corporate taxes, when 
in fact 27 of the 31 OECD countries are already planning to 
reduce their corporate taxes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While the Liberals pontificate about Canada heading in the right 
direction with their tax policies, I remind them that a tortoise 
heading in the right direction on the autobahn is still roadkill. 
The Liberals' tortoise tax reform is a hindrance for Canada and 
is holding Canadians back when we should be unleashing the 
Canadian potential not just to compete globally, but to succeed 
globally in this new economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under the Liberals we have seen a reduction in our personal 
disposable income of about 8%, during a period of time when the 
Americans have enjoyed an almost 10% increase in personal 
disposable income.  I suspect that I have to remind members 
opposite that it is impossible, wealth being a relative thing, 
for Americans to have become richer while we have been getting 
poorer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is one of the reasons we are seeing the dollar drop by 
approximately eight cents since the election of the government in 
1993. The dollar is one of the best indicators of economic 
performance. It is like a share value in Canada.  It reflects the 
confidence not just of Canadians, but of investors from around 
the world.  Every time the dollar drops, Canadians have a pay 
cut.  It reduces the standard of living and the purchasing power 
of Canadians who increasingly in the globally interconnected 
economy can purchase what they want and need from companies and 
individuals almost anywhere. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our productivity growth has been the worst in the G-7 in recent 
decades.  There has been a secular decline in our productivity 
growth rate, particularly relative to the United States.  Again, 
that needs to be addressed.  Broad based visionary and courageous 
tax reform and reduction is only one way, but it is a very 
important way to address that issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will speak to some specific issues in Bill C-25. We support 
the demutualization of life insurance companies.  That is a step 
in the right direction.  It has already been the case in the U.S. 
and there is a broad based level of support within the life 
insurance community for this.  Demutualization stands to benefit 
a lot of policyholders. Effectively in some ways it makes them 
shareholders in some of these companies. There are some benefits 
to that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1999 there was an increase in the basic personal exemption by 
$675 to approximately $7,100.  That is a baby step in the right 
direction.  To be taxing Canadians who are making $7,100 is 
purely too low a figure.  Comparatively in the U.S. one does not 
start paying income tax until one's income reaches approximately 
the equivalent of $11,000 Canadian.  We are supposed to be a 
kinder and gentler nation yet with the recent budget, we will be 
taxing people who earn only $8,000.  The increase is a step in 
the right direction, but just a baby step. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again bracket creep was not eliminated in the 1993 budget. 
A lot of these little tiny baby steps on tax reduction were 
eliminated by bracket creep in the years since then.

</I></B></P><P align=left>On the issue of the deficit surtax there was an announcement in 
the 1999 budget for a reduction in this tax and we supported 
that.  It should have been done earlier. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The 5% deficit reduction surtax was not touched in the 1999 
budget. In the 2000 budget there was a commitment to decrease it 
by 1% per year.  Of course the government is reticent to reduce 
the 5% surtax because it is a surtax on who the government 
considers to be high income Canadians.  It is part of the 
politics of envy the Liberals try to create in Canada and an 
attitude of anti-wealth or anti higher income which is a recipe 
for failure in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada's highest marginal tax rates are higher than all but two 
of our trading partners.  Canadians are taxed at the highest 
marginal tax rate when they hit an income of $70,000 per year. In 
the U.S. one does not hit the top marginal tax rate threshold 
until $420,000 Canadian. That says to an MBA graduate or someone 
entering the computer industry, software industry or e-commerce 
industry who is starting at that pay almost immediately after 
university that we do not want them here, that we do not want 
their talent or their innovation.  Unfortunately when we say that 
to them all their potential to build better futures for 
themselves and their companies and a better future for a country 
will benefit other companies outside of Canada.  It will benefit 
countries other than Canada if we are not very careful. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this legislation which has to do with the implementation of 
the 1999 budget there has been a bunch of tinkering, a series of 
baby steps that do not really address the holistic and systemic 
issues facing Canadians.  It indicates the anemic approach by a 
tired government which Canadians are growing concerned about. 
They watch this complacent government and the near toxic levels 
of arrogance which emanate from the government benches.  They 
know they are paying a significant price for a government with no 
vision and no courage to lead Canada bravely into the 21st 
century.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.)</B> 
moved that Bill C-19, an act respecting genocide, crimes against 
humanity and war crimes and to implement the Rome Statute of the 
International Criminal Court, and to make consequential 
amendments to other acts, be read the second time and referred to 
a committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said:  Mr. Speaker, I would like to begin just by recalling 
for the House a statement that was made by Isaiah Berlin, one of 
the great moral philosophers of this century in a lecture that he 
gave about 30 years ago.  He said that we must be reminded that 
the Nazi concentration camps of the second world war offer the 
most conclusive justification for the necessity of a universal 
moral law. 
He then went on to say, and I think it is a pertinent comment for 
this debate, that the primary duty of any politics was to avoid 
the extremes of human suffering.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since the second world war there have been people in politics 
who have made every effort and given voice to the question of the 
extremism that leads to human suffering.  The Nuremberg trials 
themselves immediately after the war and the development of the 
convention on human rights and the genocide convention or the 
tribunals that have been established for Rwanda and the Balkans 
have all been efforts to establish a new trend of humanitarian 
law that begins to set standards for that universal moral 
behaviour. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This movement has been an effort to develop a fundamental 
principle about the protection of individuals and their rights, 
not the protection of nation-states, not the protection of the 
interests of the grand powers but the fundamental protection of 
the security of individuals and to hold people accountable for 
those who commit crimes against individuals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am pleased to report that the adoption two years ago of the 
statute for the development of the International Criminal Court 
was perhaps one of the most substantial and forward looking steps 
our generation has ever taken to prepare the world for that new 
sense of accountability. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This was why I had the privilege, in December, of introducing 
Bill C-19 concerning crimes against humanity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill would implement the Rome Statute of the International 
Criminal Court in Canada and would also strengthen the 
legislative groundwork for the prosecution of crimes in Canada. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is in this debate and discussion at second reading that we 
must bear in mind the vital reasons we need to support the 
International Criminal Court and why Canada has taken such a 
position of leadership. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have seen time after time on our television screens, human 
suffering and shocking violations of people's rights throughout 
the world.  Instead of diminishing over time, the scale of human 
violence has substantially increased. Perhaps the most stark, 
dramatic and horrendous statistic that comes to mind is that 90% 
of today's victims in war are civilians, women and children, the 
most vulnerable.  They are the ones who pay the price.  In fact 
they are often the targets. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We read in the newspapers about the trials going on in the Hague 
and about the deliberate planned violation of women as part of 
the war aims during the Bosnia war.  This brings to mind the 
horror that takes place in this world of ours.  Millions of women 
and children have suffered torture, rape, expulsion and 
extinction.  They have been mutilated for no reason other than a 
hatred for their tribe, their religion or their ethnic 
background. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I recently read the book <I>We Wish to Inform You That Tomorrow 
We Will Be Killed with Our Families: Stories from Rwanda</I> by 
Philip Gourevitch.  The author went into a school that had been 
attacked by the genocidaires, the murderers, during that horrible 
period in 1994.  He described how he walked in and saw a room 
full of mutilated corpses and skeletons of young children and 
what had happened to them.  The genocidaires had arrived one 
morning and had asked who were the Hutu and who were the Tutsi. 
The Hutu kids were told to leave and the Tutsi kids were 
murdered. He then went on to describe how the international 
community ignored that peril and threat.  Almost half a million 
people were killed for no other reason than who they were and who 
they belonged to. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is so important that we begin to establish the fundamental 
principle of accountability.  We can no longer tolerate people 
hiding behind the walls of national protection, the impunity that 
says “I am simply doing my duty” or “I am in a position of 
responsibility”.  We can no longer accept that as being a basis 
for international law.  That is why we are debating Bill C-19 at 
second reading.  Establishing the International Criminal Court is 
one way of safeguarding the culture of accountability against the 
threat of impunity.  That is the basic question we are here to 
decide. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is also a practical imperative.  The more deterrents we can 
provide to this kind of human violence, to this kind of attack 
against individual rights, the more we stop it from happening, 
the more it begins to provide a lesson and a warning to those who 
would commit crimes in the future.  It begins to establish basic 
principles. 
That is why, in establishing this new culture of individual 
accountability, we need new tools and institutions.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The International Criminal Court represents in a sense a gift 
from the last century to the new century.  It is the first new 
international institution in the UN family or community of 
institutions that has been established specifically to deal with 
the question of international crime.  It will begin to hold 
deliberately liable those who violate victims and to hold them 
personally responsible for those actions.  It is a huge step 
forward for humankind in developing this kind of institution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is true that we have war crimes tribunals working in Rwanda 
and in the Balkans but it is an ad hoc approach.  It is subject 
to the wrangling that takes place in the security council or in 
other forums along the way.  It sometimes leads to selective 
justice and is not universally applied. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The creation of a permanent, independent institution can 
overcome these weaknesses.  It can build upon those foundations 
and because of its permanence it will serve as a more reliable 
deterrent to perpetrators of these crimes. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is why Canadians spoke out so strongly in favour of the 
International Criminal Court and supported the important role 
played by Canada, which insisted that the court be independent 
and effective. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In July 1998, Canada presided over the final negotiations, 
during which the international community adopted the Rome 
Statute. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to pay a personal tribute to one of our senior 
officials, Master Philippe Kirsch, who was the president of the 
Rome meetings and was instrumental, along with many other 
officials of our department and a great number of NGOs in the 
country and internationally, in providing the momentum and kind 
of direction that allowed us to bring this court into being. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The ICC statute now provides a permanent court to try those 
accused of the most serious crimes recognized by international 
law, namely genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes. 
Significantly, and this was a major Canadian initiative in Rome, 
the statute contains new provisions responding to crimes against 
women and children.  For the first time that is now becoming part 
of the new basis of international humanitarian law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me deal with one of the critiques we hear sometimes from 
right wing commentators and others that somehow this is a threat 
to our sovereignty.  It is absolutely not the case.  The statute 
of the court makes very explicit and clear that the first line of 
defence is the domestic court system.  Those countries that have 
a fair and impartial legal system are being asked to use that 
system.  The international court is only a court of last resort 
and within it are built a whole series of safeguards on the 
appointment of judges and the thresholds that have to be reached 
before it can be triggered. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However it fills the vacuum of those failed states in which the 
judicial system no longer exists, is politically biased or simply 
cannot function to bring criminals to account.  This court will 
only take jurisdiction where national judicial systems are either 
unwilling or unable to investigate these crimes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Other safeguards are designed to ensure that the court provides 
a fundamental basis but gives the stimulation and the inspiration 
for countries themselves to ensure that they bring into law their 
own implementing legislation which charges their own judicial 
systems for the implementation of criminal acts against humanity 
and war crimes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important to say that this has received worldwide 
acceptance.  Some 120-odd countries have already signed the 
treaty.  Eight have now ratified it.  I want to say with some 
pride in the House that the statute we are debating today, the 
Crimes Against Humanity Act, is the first major comprehensive 
implementing legislation brought forward by any legislature 
around the world and will provide a model for all other countries 
to determine how it will implement the international court 
statute. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The act will create new offences of genocide and crimes against 
humanity. 
These changes will allow Canada to prosecute those responsible or 
to surrender them to the ICC.  Similar provisions will be created 
to respect serious crimes committed outside Canada.  As we know 
from a supreme court judgment of a few years ago there has always 
been an ambiguity as to the capacity of Canada to apprehend those 
who have committed war crimes outside this country.

<A HREF="#LINKT64"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>These new provisions in the act will overcome problems that we 
have faced in the past.  The legislation will strengthen Canada's 
ability to carry out successful prosecutions wherever and 
whenever they occur.  In addition, new offences would also be 
created to protect the administration of justice of the court as 
well as the safety of judges, officials and witnesses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The act will enable Canada to surrender persons sought by the 
International Criminal Court for genocide or war crimes.  The 
person who is the subject of a request for surrender by the court 
would not be able to claim immunity from arrest or surrender. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The act will also ensure that those who possess or launder the 
proceeds from war crimes can be prosecuted. Money obtained from 
forfeited assets and the enforcement of fines will be paid into a 
crimes against humanity fund for the benefit of all victims of 
these serious war crimes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope the bill we are debating today can very quickly be put 
into the standing committee so we can invite the full 
participation of all Canadians.  Let us have a serious debate, 
because this is one of the historic steps forward this country is 
taking in implementing a new legal order.  We must move forward 
so that we can affirm very clearly Canada's commitment to 
ensuring that the world's worst criminals do not escape justice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is truly a watershed in history, a breaking from the past 
in which victims of those crimes were so often ignored.  As we 
proceed we can also say that with the help of many other like 
minded countries and many of the international civil groups that 
have been working on it, we are also seeking to obtain the 
support of those who did not originally sign on.  We are 
beginning to broaden the consensus and develop more recruits for 
this international court statute. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can say to members that the degree to which we can affirm our 
commitment will stand as a beacon, a signal to the rest of the 
world that we mean business and that we are continuing to provide 
that kind of leadership.  Even though the International Criminal 
Court is not yet fully ratified, it has already established new 
standards to deal with the question of impunity and 
accountability. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since the adoption of the ICC statute in Rome we witnessed the 
indictment of Pinochet and the affirmation that former heads of 
state do not necessarily enjoy immunity.  It is a new standard 
that will begin to act its way through the various councils, not 
just in terms of the heads of government or military people but 
also the war lords, the heads of organizations that undertake 
mass murders in countries like Angola and Sierra Leone.  It 
begins to apply accountability to all individuals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is really the break from the past.  We are saying in terms 
of our human security agenda that is not a matter of just the 
security of the state, as important as that remains.  It is also 
increasing the security of the individual.  To do that we begin 
to establish this new principle of accountability and, 
furthermore, put in place an institution to make sure it happens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is fair to say there has been a groundswell of support.  It 
is fascinating to me that beginning this week, as we go to the 
security council, that the Canadian mission will be debating for 
the first time in the council the question of transgressions 
against the rights of women in Afghanistan.  Following that there 
will be a number of initiatives dealing with the protection of 
civilians, the use of sanctions, and the whole question of the 
application of security council measures dealing with displaced 
persons.  All of a sudden, even in that implacable centre of 
conservatism when it comes to international change, the council 
is beginning to shift its point of view. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope that we can do our part in the House today.  I hope we 
can maintain the strong momentum that has been developed to shift 
the world's perspective to what we mean by international justice 
and accountability.  The adoption of the legislation and the 
ratification of the statute can affirm that Canadians are 
appalled by the breaking of these laws and these crimes and are 
committed to ensuring that justice is done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During the course of my remarks I mentioned the book about 
Rwanda written by Philip Gourevitch and how he opened the book by 
talking about the horrible violation against young children in a 
school in Rwanda.  At the end of the book I think he comes to an 
appropriate closing which may, while it is still a horrendous 
story, leave us with a small sense of hope. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He describes how, when he was leaving Rwanda after completing 
the work on his manuscript, he turned on the radio and heard that 
once again the same kind of horrendous crime was taking place and 
that the genocidaires who had escaped across the border as part 
of their refugee movement had come back into Rwanda and were once 
again undertaking these violations and crimes. 
Murambi, a Catholic girls school in Rwanda, had been attacked by 
the genocidaires the day before.  They used the same practice of 
dividing the students into the Hutu and Tutsi.  They said that 
the Hutu could leave and the Tutsi must stay.  However, this time 
there was a difference.  The young Hutu women in the Catholic 
school said they would not leave, that they would not betray 
their friends.  They stayed behind.  They too were murdered by 
the genocidaires.

</I></B></P><P align=left>It is an awful story but within it there is an element of hope 
that these courageous young women gave their lives not to betray 
their friends and stood in solidarity for spirit and principle. 
In effect they expressed what this legislation is all about. 
Humanity can stand up to crimes.  We can stand up against 
violations.  In the spirit of those young women in that Catholic 
school, I hope the House will endorse the bill.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gurmant Grewal (Surrey Central, Canadian Alliance):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I rise on behalf of the people of Surrey Central to 
speak to Bill C-19 that will fulfil Canada's obligations in the 
establishment of the International Criminal Court. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before I go into the details of the bill, I would like to point 
out that this is my first speech as chief foreign affairs critic 
for the official opposition.  I pay tribute and express 
appreciation to the former chief foreign affairs critic for the 
official opposition, the hon. member for Esquimalt—Juan de Fuca 
who is now running for leader of this great party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also pay tribute and express appreciation to the hon. member 
for Red Deer, who was deputy foreign affairs critic for this 
party, for a job well done during his duty tenure.  He did a 
great job.  I have learned a lot and continue to learn a lot from 
them.  I hope they will assist me when I need their help. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are a few things I would like to mention before I go into 
the details of the bill.  We understand that no nation stands 
alone in the global arena.  We have to work with other countries 
in assisting and making sure that criminals, those monsters who 
have blood on their hands, are held responsible and accountable 
for their crimes and that justice is served.  This is a very 
important justice issue.  Criminals must be brought to 
accountability. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I listened with interest to the minister's speech on which I 
will comment in a moment.  Before I do so I draw the attention of 
the House to the images of concentrations camps, ethnic wars and 
civil wars we have seen on television or have read in the 
newspapers.  Very few Canadians have had firsthand experience. I 
know someone who was watching a documentary on CBC and switched 
if off because it was such a horrible experience.  Let us imagine 
the circumstances and situations faced by individuals, families 
and nations torn apart because of those crimes, because of bloody 
civil wars.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know that when crimes are committed against an individual we 
feel for that victim.  But when crimes are committed against a 
mass of people, a huge number of the population, it is difficult 
to think about.  Crime against a single person is wrong.  Crime 
against humanity is wrong.  Genocide is wrong.  Ethnic war is 
wrong. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must do the best we can to play Canada's role.  Canada has 
played a significant role on the world scene in the past, showing 
leadership.  I believe there is a need for us to continue to 
capture and maintain that position. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I lived in Liberia, a country in west Africa, for about eight 
years.  Many people who are watching will know that there was a 
bloody civil war there in the early nineties.  I lived in that 
country because I was a university professor, an assistant 
professor of management, teaching at the University of Liberia. 
I also had business there.  I had close contact with youth who 
were studying at the university.  I know how the people felt when 
that bloody civil war broke out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have two sons who were born there.  Now they are 17 and 14 
years old.  I am often reminded of those families, who were poor, 
who were hard-working, but who somehow managed to make ends meet 
at the end of the day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The civil war was based on the ethnicity of the people.  Because 
the distribution of assets was wrong in the country, important 
positions in the government were given based on ethnicity and 
geographical regions that played a significant role.  Small 
children, as young as eight and ten years, had AK-47s and other 
lethal weapons.  They were killing people.  They were chopping 
off hands and killing relatives and neighbours because they 
belonged to different ethnic groups. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wonder about those little children.  They were supposed to be 
going to school, instead of killing people with lethal weapons. 
When we look at pictures we can see that they were not even fully 
dressed.  They were barefoot.  I do not think they ate twice a 
day, but they had lethal weapons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Where was the international community?  Why could it not stop 
the infiltration or importation of the weapons?  Those weapons 
were not manufactured in that country, but somehow they got the 
weapons to kill people.  Why did they do that?  Because someone 
was leading them.  Someone was luring those children to take up

</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada should recapture its role and show leadership in the 
international arena. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian Alliance supports the bill in principle.  We 
believe it is a good initiative, a step forward, but we do not 
agree with the contents of the bill, and I will give our reasons.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our support is conditional.  Until the conditions are met we 
will be unable to support the bill.  Let me give some background 
as to why we do not support the bill in its present form. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our Canadian negotiators on their way to Rome met with the 
foreign affairs committee approximately one week before their 
departure.  Upon cross-examination the officials said in 
committee that they did not know what the details of the 
agreement might be.  They did not know what it might cost.  They 
did not think that any of the major offending countries would 
sign it.  They did not think the Americans would sign it, our 
neighbours.  They could not answer questions about the make-up of 
the code at that time.  Above all, they would sign the agreement 
without knowing all of these things, like this weak, arrogant 
government has done in the past in signing the Kyoto agreement, 
the Rio convention, the Cairo agreement, the Beijing agreement 
and so on; signed without knowing the cost, the details, the 
signatories and so on.  I cannot understand how the government 
could do that.  The concept of signing agreements and then having 
parliament rubber stamp their implementation is not acceptable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me highlight some of the important reasons we oppose this 
bill.  The bill has every possibility of implementing another 
bureaucratic, non-functional international body.  International 
agreements should not be signed before parliamentary debate. That 
is the purpose of parliament.  The hon. members sitting in the 
House are the elected representatives of Canadians.  They are 
representing 30 million Canadians.  How can the government sign 
an international agreement without hearing members, without 
debating the issues or without giving members information about 
what will happen?  That is how Canadian democracy should not 
work.  We should not be part of a rubber stamp process.  Hon. 
members have a significant role to play.  They are not mute or 
people to be used as a rubber stamp. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian Alliance will oppose this bill because the bad 
countries will not sign such a treaty.  Therefore, we will have 
liberal democracies around the world trying each other for 
genocide and war crimes.  Without belligerent countries signing 
on this treaty will be meaningless. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Will this allow us to prosecute dictators in the francophonie 
who might visit us?  Will we be able to arrest them and try them 
for war crimes, or will we continue to apply our double standard? 
The foreign minister did not answer these questions.  Now he is 
not here to listen.  He left the Chamber. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I question how effective the land mines treaty is because the 
offending countries have not signed.  The U.S. has not signed the 
treaty and Canadians are still using mines to protect their 
troops.  Land mines made in the basements of Kosovo, Angola and 
many other countries are as prevalent as ever.  This was a PR job 
for the foreign minister, who desperately wants to become 
director general of the United Nations.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The foreign minister believes in these world governments, this 
concept of the United Nation; however, I do not believe that 
Canadians do.  We should not support projects that have no cost 
or budget projections.  An ad hoc tribunal approach would be more 
flexible, less expensive and would allow countries closer to the 
problem to participate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Agreeing that there will not be capital punishment for those 
monsters who commit war crimes, genocide and crimes against 
humanity is hardly an argument to support Bill C-19.  I am sure 
that if there were a referendum on this issue the huge majority 
of Canadians would support capital punishment for those monsters 
who have committed crimes against humanity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Having said that, let me go into further detail, with a little 
softer attitude toward the bill.  What would the bill do?  It 
would, through the court, deal with cases of genocide, crimes 
against humanity and war crimes.  The bill would give Canada the 
domestic legislation to facilitate the prosecution of these 
criminals by Canadian courts, whether the alleged offences were 
committed outside Canada or inside Canada.  The bill would give 
Canada the right to have first crack at the investigation, 
prosecution and sentencing of such cases at home.  We could waive 
that right, if we wished, to extradite the accused to the 
International Criminal Court. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill would also affirm that Canadian law would not bar 
prosecution in Canada or extradition to the International 
Criminal Court or to any international criminal tribunal 
established by resolution of the security council of the United 
Nations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Because our immigration laws are such that anyone can abuse 
them, they are like sieves, the back door is wide open and the 
front door is comparatively closed, anyone can sneak in. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If an individual suspected of a war crime was living in Canada, 
then that individual could stand trial here in Canada, if we so 
wished, or before the International Criminal Court.  If Canada 
undertook an extensive investigation and the individual was found 
innocent of any charges, that would satisfy the requirement of 
the ICC. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I mentioned earlier, the Canadian Alliance is hesitant to 
support the bill.  The Canadian Alliance favours the prosecution 
of individuals who commit genocide, war crimes and crimes against 
humanity.  We are committed to protecting national sovereignty, 
which is very important and which could be at stake.  Before 
supporting the bill we demand that such protections be assured 
and that the other conditions I mentioned be met. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The relationship between domestic and international law is not 
spelled out in Bill C-19.  The proposed amendments to the bill 
must be adopted at the committee stage before any support could 
be given to the bill.  If these conditions are not met, then the 
Canadian Alliance must oppose the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me mention some of the positive aspects of the bill.  There 
are many good parts to the bill.  It places further emphasis on 
guaranteeing the interests of victims.  The court will be obliged 
to take all appropriate measures to protect the safety, 
well-being, dignity and privacy of victims and witnesses.  The 
judges and prosecutors will be completely independent.  The 
suspects and the states concerned will have the right to 
challenge the court's jurisdiction and the admissibility of the 
case during investigation or at trial. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill is one step toward creating an international judicial 
system in which any individual, regardless of position, will not 
be above the standards of the rule of law.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is some criticism of the ICC that says that individual 
tribunals would be preferable and a superior option to 
establishing a permanent ICC.  A tribunal would examine one 
specific case, render a verdict, and then disband.  This could 
eliminate the cost of maintaining a permanent body and there 
would be no long term bureaucratic body in existence.  However, 
these types of tribunals have proven to be ineffective in 
tracking down criminals and in having the legal authority to 
prosecute them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The establishment of the international criminal court would 
bring legitimacy to international justice.  By establishing one 
court for all war crime cases, much duplication is eliminated, 
counterbalancing the cost of the court's permanently. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I said earlier, the bill is supposed to go to committee, 
where the real work should be done.  It is critical that Canadian 
military and legal experts present testimony at the committee 
stage of this bill.  That will definitely contribute to the 
quality of this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If government members were listening and the Minister of Foreign 
Affairs was listening to the concerns of the official opposition, 
they will let the committee do the real job, listen to the 
official opposition and add some quality and substance to the 
bill which will be in Canadians' interests. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We want them to talk about the accountability of soldiers, 
officers and superiors in relation to the bill and in the Rome 
Statute giving rise to this legislative proposal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need to have on record their comments concerning the 
provisions of this bill which have been considered and negotiated 
at length by Canadian and American military experts at their own 
conference.  Appearances by Canadian experts at committee should 
help to allay the concerns of some Canadians, particularly my 
constituents of Surrey Central, regarding certain aspects of this 
bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since the Nuremberg trials of 1945, the international community 
has been working toward the creation of a permanent international 
criminal court.  Momentum for the creation of the international 
criminal court was invigorated by strong support from the public, 
the media and non-government organizations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>After years of negotiations and an intense five week diplomatic 
conference with a thorough range of interests, the basis for the 
international criminal court was adopted in Rome on July 17, 
1998.  National judicial systems have failed to satisfactorily 
investigate or prosecute such individuals.  There is a need for 
the measures in this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also understand, with the limited information the government 
has provided to opposition parties, as is usually the case, that 
the ICC is not retrospective.  It will only study incidents that 
happen after the court is established.  There will be no backlog, 
thereby allowing the court to begin immediate work on cases 
brought before it.  This will help ensure that justice prevails 
quickly yet fairly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-19 is retrospective for crimes committed outside of 
Canada, since we have always had domestic legislation in this 
domain.  This legislation will be replaced by Bill C-19.  The new 
retrospectivity of Bill C-19 is based on the status of 
international law at the time and place of the commission of the 
offence.  This has always been the case in Canadian law.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill will allow individual governments to try war criminals 
within their own borders.  Or, countries will have the means to 
transfer alleged criminals to the international criminal court to 
stand trial on the international stage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>No longer will heads of states have immunity against 
prosecution.  They will be subject to the same laws as ordinary 
citizens.  Crimes such as rape, other serious sexual violence and 
forced prostitution may be judged as a war crime and crime 
against humanity.  Imprisonment and fines will be administered. 
However, capital punishment will not be administered. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will quickly go over the organizational component of the ICC. 
The international criminal court statute will come into force 
once 60 states have ratified it.  It will be seated in the Hague, 
Netherlands.  The 18 judges of the ICC and the prosecutor are 
selected on qualifications of supreme court level and must be 
ratified by two-thirds of states parties.  Their terms are for 
nine years, staggered by one-third, that is, every three years 
six new members are appointed and six will leave.  They may be 
removed by a similar two-thirds vote, if there is a need. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The registrar will be responsible for administration of the ICC. 
The rules of procedure and evidence are currently being 
negotiated through a series of meetings of a preparatory 
commission which includes delegations from signatory states and 
other interested states. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The details of precise meanings of terms found in the statute, 
evidence and court procedures, administrative structure, that is, 
languages, treatment of child witnesses, conditions of 
imprisonment, et cetera, are to be concluded in consensus 
agreements adjacent to the statute. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Parliament and Canadians need to have the information on these 
details once they are fleshed out.  As I urged earlier, 
parliament should be given the information so that Canadians can 
know it is public knowledge. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The assembly of states parties to the court will ratify these 
rules of procedure and evidence upon the enactment of the statute 
after the 60th ratification comes on board.  The assembly of 
states parties will meet once a year to provide management 
oversight and review the annual audit and budget in an effort to 
ensure financial accountability.  Financial accountability is 
very important for international institutions to run smoothly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The definitions of genocide, war crimes and crimes against 
humanity are carefully spelled out in the Rome Statute and are 
based on existing international law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will now go back to the part about the costs.  Before going to 
Rome, the Canadian representatives or delegates had no idea what 
the costs would be.  At present there is no set amount to be paid 
by Canada, as we learned. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All member states of the ICC will pay a fee for the creation, 
operation and management of the ICC.  The United Nations will 
contribute half of the initial start-up costs and will continue 
financially when specific cases are mandated by the Security 
Council to the ICC.  The remaining costs will be shared equally 
by all states parties, no less than 60 and potentially much 
higher. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As of February 7, 2000, 94 countries had signed the Rome 
Statute.  The costs will not kick in until at least 60 
signatories have ratified the statutes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>After some digging, the official opposition has found that the 
estimated financial obligation for Canada for the ICC, from a 
discussion with Mora Johnston in February 2000, revealed that the 
total initial contribution for the first to second years of the 
set-up period, after 60 ratifications brings the Rome Statute 
into effect, would be something like $300,000 to $500,000 
Canadian. 
That cost will be less than the cost of the fountain installed in 
the Prime Minister's riding, which has created neither jobs nor 
any justice.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The annual expected contribution once the ICC is up and running 
is expected to be $1 million to $2 million Canadian.  Canada's 
annual contribution to Rwanda and Yugoslavia's war crimes 
tribunals in 1998-99, assessed through the United Nations, was 
$6.3 million Canada.  We can see how the cost operates. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are some questions relating to the ICC.  The permanent 
international body may become unaccountable and may override the 
sovereignty of a nation's legal and government systems.  We did 
not get any answer nor did we hear about this in the minister's 
speech. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although the ICC is to be complementary to national courts, it 
will investigate and prosecute a crime when the nations with 
jurisdiction are unwilling to do so.  Here is one example of how 
the ICC can overrule the sovereignty of a nation. The ICC has 
been structured so that the sovereignty of nations will remain 
primordial.  It does so by requiring the enactment of domestic 
legislation in each ratifying state which gives that sovereign 
state both the judicial equipment and the right to prosecute 
suspected cases of the crimes domestically. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-19 is Canada's version of this legislation.  We can 
choose to waive the sovereign right to prosecute in our own court 
system and send the case to the international criminal court. 
This right cannot be circumvented unless we are unable or 
unwilling to use it, that is, that there is a deliberate 
fraudulent attempt to shield a suspect from prosecution, or our 
rule of law has completely collapsed and we have no government in 
place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That this assessment could ever be made in a Canadian case is 
agreed among Canada's negotiating team and justice department 
experts to be simply unthinkable.  In order for the unthinkable 
to occur, that is, the ICC were to nullify a Canadian 
investigation or the prosecution of a war crimes case, the 
following process would have to have been followed:  First, the 
prosecutor must decide that there is a reasonable basis to 
question that Canada has deliberately and fraudulently 
misinvestigated or misprosecuted allegations with the aim of 
shielding a suspected war criminal; second, the prosecutor must 
consult with the Canadian government regarding his suspicions and 
try to arrive at a negotiated resolution of the discrepancy; and 
third, the prosecutor must convince a pretrial chamber of the ICC 
that the case is valid. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This stage would require concrete evidence that the accused war 
criminal is guilty of the offence and that Canada used a scam 
process to shield the accused from prosecution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada could appear in front of the chamber to plead its case at 
this stage and could bring the case to a fourth appeals chamber 
stage.  If the judges of the ICC go stark mad and judge that 
Canada is deliberately and fraudulently shielding a war criminal, 
this should be obvious to the international community. In this 
case, Canada has recourse in the procedure to remove rogue judges 
by a vote of two-thirds of states parties, if they agree. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In short, the international criminal court statute and Bill C-19 
provide for substantial protection of a state's sovereignty 
viable only in blatant cases of judicial dishonesty or 
incapacity.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The strict requirements to overturn a sovereign country's 
treatment of a case have been negotiated and approved by the 
sovereignty maverick, the United States, and signed by the United 
Kingdom and France.  They are intended specifically to protect 
state sovereignty for well behaved states while stopping rogue 
states from fraudulently protecting verifiable war criminals from 
accountability for their actions.  In a way Bill C-19 affords us 
more sovereignty than improvised war tribunals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are some other problems.  The ICC could lead to judicial 
activism on a global scale.  Global judicial rulings should not 
be deemed regressive.  It has been argued that a uniform, fair 
and equal system to prosecute individuals before the ICC will 
eliminate any chance of a kangaroo court. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is clear that there is very limited room for any judicial 
activism in Bill C-19 or the Rome statute, either in terms of 
expanding the mandate of the ICC which is restricted to the three 
crimes listed or playing with the definition of said crimes which 
are very strictly and identically defined in both documents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why not continue the common practice of establishing ad hoc 
tribunals as cases involving these crimes come up?  The 18 judges 
and prosecutors remain independent of government interference, 
with the exception of the removal clause, the two-thirds of 
states parties.  The appointments are for nine year terms, as I 
mentioned.  As shown in these numbers it is less expensive than 
setting up and administering individual ad hoc tribunals that 
lack the experience and legitimacy to efficiently and effectively 
hold criminals accountable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The ICC not only allows the countries most implicated in a 
conflict to participate in the process.  It gives them the 
judicial equipment and the right to prosecute the war crimes in 
their own courts.  It gives them mechanisms and international 
support to achieve justice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The ICC bureaucracy would be skeletal at first since it is 
purely prospective and does not have a backlog.  It would only be 
used in cases where countries are unwilling or unable to 
prosecute domestically.  When not in use, again the bureaucracy 
will be skeletal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a one-stop shop for war crimes prosecution with specific 
expertise and experience in its limited mandate.  It ensures 
continuity and consistency of international law.  It will be much 
more legitimate and effective in bringing war criminals to 
justice and setting deterrents for potential war criminals than 
ad hoc tribunals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me mention something about our neighbours, the United 
States.  The U.S. has not yet signed the Rome statute. The Senate 
is unlikely to ratify it, given its present political 
composition.  Some may argue that this makes the court 
ineffective.  Although the U.S. is not a signatory the Rome 
statute can still be applied.  The need for international justice 
can still be carried out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are examples of treaties and alliances that are successful 
without American participation.  The United States has not 
rejected the Rome statute yet and is presently studying the ICC 
within the Pentagon, the State Department and the White House. 
They are heavily involved in negotiations on the rules of 
procedure and evidence at the preparatory commission.  This 
involvement in the process could lead to their acceptance of the 
court. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, I think we should participate in negotiations on 
the rules of procedure and evidence before they are concluded. 
We should participate in deciding the definitions that are being 
worked on before the bill is ratified by parliament.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Svend J. Robinson (Burnaby—Douglas, NDP):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I am pleased to rise in the House today on behalf of my 
colleagues in the New Democratic Party to indicate our strong 
support for Bill C-19 and to commend the minister for bringing 
forward this historic and landmark legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is appropriate that today, April 6, we as parliamentarians 
should be considering legislation that deals with genocide, war 
crimes and crimes against humanity.  Today is the sixth 
anniversary of the start of the Rwanda genocide, 100 days of 
terror which led to the murder of as many as two million people, 
Tutsis and moderate Hutus.  They were calculatingly and 
unmercifully butchered in what was clearly a genocide on April 6, 
1994.  It is timely that we consider this important legislation 
at this time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to note as well that an essential element of this 
legislation is to establish what the minister called a culture of 
accountability.  We strongly support the notion of that culture 
of accountability, that those who have blood on their hands, 
those who are responsible for these terrible crimes, must be 
brought to justice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is with a sense of sadness that I remind the House that one 
of those who must be held accountable for the genocide in Rwanda 
remains within Canada's borders today.  Mugesera Léon, who 
publicly called for ethnic cleansing and extermination of the 
Tutsi people in the period leading up to the Rwanda massacre, is 
still in Canada today.  Mugesera Léon said in a speech that was 
broadcast in November 1992 nationwide on Radio Rwanda: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will take care ourselves of the massacre of the cockroaches, 
the Tutsi.  We demand that we make a list of all those people. 
What are we waiting for decimate these families?  Destroy them. 
No matter what you do, do not let them get away. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The author of those words, which were an incitement to genocide, 
is in Canada today.  He remains unpunished.  Canada must not be a 
haven for people like Mugesera Léon.  Canada must not just deport 
this individual.  Surely we must extradite Mugesera Léon so that 
he can stand trial for his terrible crimes against humanity.  My 
colleagues and I in the New Democratic Party join with people 
from the Rwandan community and many others in appealing to our 
government to demonstrate leadership on this fundamentally 
important question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I support the bill.  I salute the government not just for 
bringing the bill forward.  I commend not just our government but 
in particular Ambassador Philippe Kirsch who has played such an 
extraordinary leadership role in the international community in 
bringing the International Criminal Court from a dream to 
reality.   The statute that created the court came into force on 
July 17, 1998, in Rome at a conference which was chaired by 
Ambassador Philippe Kirsch.

</I></B></P><P align=left>It has been over 50 years since the United Nations first 
recognized the importance of establishing an international 
criminal court, an international tribunal to prosecute crimes 
such as genocide.  In a resolution of 1948 the general assembly 
noted that genocide had inflicted great losses on humanity and 
pointed out that in order to liberate mankind from such an odious 
scourge international co-operation was required.  In the early 
1950s the United Nations attempted to pull together a statute to 
create an international criminal court.  It is only today, some 
50 years later, that the court has finally become a reality. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada can be proud of the role we have played in the 
establishment of that court.  It is not just of our government. I 
want to signal as well the contribution of many NGOs.  The 
Canadian Network for an International Criminal Court included a 
broad cross-section of NGOs.  It included many churches. It 
included the International Centre for Human Rights and Democratic 
Development.  It included Amnesty International and many other 
Canadian NGOs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Among those I want to pay particular tribute to today is one 
gentleman from the World Federalists of Canada, Fergus Watt, who 
played such an instrumental role in rallying support for the 
International Criminal Court within Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a day to celebrate the creation of this important 
international tribunal, but it is also a day to reflect on what 
might have been and what should be when it comes to genocide, 
crimes against humanity and war crimes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have mentioned the history and we know the tragedy of Rwanda, 
of Bosnia and Herzegovina, of East Timor and of the crimes 
against humanity in Chile.  Certainly many of us were saddened 
that Augusto Pinochet, instead of facing his accusers, the 
families of those who disappeared, those who were murdered in 
cold blood, in a court of law, has now returned to Chile where 
tragically he may never, ever face justice.  As my colleague from 
Saskatoon has said, that is a shame and a tragedy.  Hopefully 
under the International Criminal Court there will be no 
repetition of the failure to have a reckoning for those kinds of 
terrible crimes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know that Canada's record with respect to the prosecution of 
those responsible for crimes against humanity who are within our 
borders is a shameful one.  Irving Abella has written eloquently 
of our history of slamming the door shut to those who were 
attempting to flee the Holocaust in Nazi Germany.  His book was 
entitled <I>None is too Many</I>.  The fact of the matter is that 
we have not come to grips with our responsibility to bring these 
war criminals to justice.  Certainly the passage of time does not 
in any way diminish the significance of their crimes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I said, the legislation codifies and ratifies our adoption of 
the principles of the Rome statute established in the 
International Criminal Court.  One very important element of that 
statute is that there are a number of provisions specifically 
addressing the plight of women and children in armed conflict. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The statute recognizes, for the first time, rape, sexual slavery 
and other forms of sexual violence as war crimes and as crimes 
against humanity.  It also recognizes the enlistment or the use 
of children under 15 in armed conflicts as a war crime.  Those 
are very important provisions.  I know that Canada fought 
particularly hard to ensure that they were included in the 
legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can be proud of our role, but there are inconsistencies in 
our approach.  Even as we support this legislation, even as the 
government introduces this landmark legislation, we are fighting 
in another international forum, the ad hoc tribunal for the 
former Yugoslavia, the international criminal tribunal looking at 
war crimes in the former Yugoslavia. 
We are fighting its jurisdiction to look at the issue of war 
crimes which may have been committed by NATO in the former 
Yugoslavia during the very tragic events which occurred in the 
spring of 1999 both in Kosovo and in Serbia.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We cannot have it both ways.  Our government cannot on the one 
hand say that there must be responsibility for crimes against 
humanity and war crimes and that it must be universal, yet when 
there are attempts made to ensure that those universal principles 
apply within the context of the situation, the war and bombings 
which took place in the former Yugoslavia, our government cannot 
say that that jurisdiction does not apply to us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada is indeed one of the 10 countries that have been cited in 
that complaint brought by Professor Michael Mandel of Canada, 
among others.  I believe we have to take that very seriously. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We look at some of the allegations made about the conduct of 
that war.  A bridge was bombed by NATO in broad daylight.  A nine 
year old child on a bicycle was murdered in cold blood, along 
with too many others.  A train crossing a bridge was hit by NATO 
missiles not once but twice.  The headquarters of Serbian 
television and radio were bombed deliberately, killing innocent 
technicians and makeup artists, young men and women.  We have to 
ask ourselves if those who are responsible for these crimes must 
not also face their day in court.  I believe that indeed they 
must face that reckoning. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can also look at another context, a context of what many of 
us believe is effectively genocidal policies.  That is the 
context of what is taking place in Iraq today.  It is what has 
been taking place over the past decade under the imposition of 
United Nations sanctions which have resulted in the death of over 
500,000 innocent children.  This has been well documented by 
UNICEF and other international tribunals.  It has been eloquently 
denounced by the former UN humanitarian co-ordinator, Denis 
Halliday, eloquently and passionately denounced by his successor, 
Hans von Sponeck, who has announced his resignation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I had the privilege of meeting with Hans von Sponeck when I 
visited Iraq along with a delegation from a group called 
Objection de Conscience or Voices of Conscience.  They pointed 
out the combined impact of the destruction of Iraqi 
infrastructure from bombing in the spring of 1991, the ongoing 
bombing which is taking place illegally by the U.S. and the 
United Kingdom, and the massive starvation of innocent civilians, 
children and others, malnutrition used as a weapon of war against 
innocent children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Dr. Sheila Zurbrig of Halifax, one of the world's experts on 
this subject, has made it very clear that this is a breach of the 
most fundamental international obligations which exist.  The 
Geneva conventions say that we cannot use malnutrition and 
starvation as a weapon of war, yet that is what is happening in 
Iraq. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to be very clear.  This is certainly not suggesting that 
we should not be calling Saddam Hussein to account for his crimes 
against humanity.  We all know of the terrible attacks on the 
Kurds, the gassing of Kurds in Halabja and elsewhere, but it is 
not acceptable that innocent Iraqi people should be victimized in 
this way, allegedly in order to attack Saddam Hussein. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Denis Halliday said that we are destroying an entire society. It 
is as terrifying and as simple as that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We call for support for this resolution, this bill before the 
House today.  At the same time I would appeal to our government 
to recognize that we should not be a part of the genocidal 
policies in Iraq ourselves. 
We should be using our position of leadership as we preside this 
month at the security council to call for a de-linking of 
military and economic sanctions, for the immediate lifting of 
economic sanctions, for an end to the illegal bombing in the 
north and the south, for the opening of a Canadian embassy in 
Iraq and for regional disarmament in that deeply troubled region.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is very important that we work toward the day when there will 
be truly universal accountability under this International 
Criminal Court.  It is not good enough, frankly, that the United 
States should say that it will not be bound by this statute, that 
it arrogates unto itself the power to say no, it will not be a 
part of this acknowledgement by the international community that 
there must be a tribunal that has jurisdiction over all, 
including the United States.  It has said no to the International 
Criminal Court, no to the land mines convention.  We appeal to the 
United States to join with Canada in signing and ratifying this 
treaty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reality is, as former United States under secretary of state 
David Newson wrote in the <I>Christian Science Monitor</I>, “If 
the U.S. will not accept its obligations to the citizens of other 
lands, its own citizens will be less safe abroad”.  I think it 
is important that we recognize and understand that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today we call on the Government of Canada to continue its 
important and valuable work in seeking the ratification of this 
treaty by other countries as well.  So far I believe seven 
countries have ratified this treaty.  Sixty are needed before it 
comes into force.  Let us hope that we can get those 60 before 
December 2000 and that we can get those ratifications without any 
opting out declarations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us celebrate the fact that the Rome Statute that establishes 
the International Criminal Court did not include the death 
penalty.  I heard with sadness my colleague from the Reform 
Party, whom I congratulate on his recent naming as foreign 
affairs spokesperson for that party, lament the fact that this 
treaty did not include the death penalty.  Surely we have moved 
beyond that to the point that we recognize that the death penalty 
is a barbarism that should not be included in any statute and 
which should be abolished throughout the world.  I hope we 
continue to take a strong position on that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, let me say that I welcome the minister's suggestion 
that there be a full study of the bill by the committee so that 
those who do have concerns about the bill can be heard.  I know 
that the Ukrainian Canadian Congress for example has written to 
members of the foreign affairs committee voicing concerns about 
the legislation.  It is important that we invite them to be heard 
at the committee and that their concerns be listened to. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>David Matas speaking on behalf of Amnesty International has 
raised concerns about some elements of the legislation while 
strongly supporting it.  There are issues such as the rights of 
the defendant in the statute; the question of the mental elements 
of crime; the importance of clear definitions of crime both 
inside and outside Canada; the fact that individual criminal 
responsibility should be entrenched in the law; and that section 
3.77 of the criminal code should be kept to ensure that people 
with connections to crime can also be convicted, that those who 
are directly involved and those who are intimately connected with 
crimes should accept their full responsibility. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those are our concerns.  As I have said, we support the bill. I 
am pleased to rise on behalf of my colleagues in supporting the 
bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In closing, I want to remind the House of the words of José 
Ayala-Lasso, the former United Nations High Commissioner for 
Human Rights.  He said that a person stands a better chance of 
being tried and judged for killing one human being than for 
killing 100,000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That has been the truth too long on our planet.  Let us hope 
that the adoption of the bill will be an important step forward 
by Canada on the road to universal jurisdiction, on the road to 
full responsibility and hopefully on the road to one day 
eliminating all crimes of genocide, crimes against humanity and 
war crimes.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dennis Gruending (Saskatoon—Rosetown—Biggar, NDP):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my NDP caucus colleague from 
Burnaby—Douglas for his wise and articulate remarks today. In 
the circles in which I circulate he is respected for the work 
that he does in this and other areas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know that he is in touch with groups widely and often holds 
table meetings in the mornings with different groups to talk 
about issues.  It is on that score I would like to ask him the 
following question.  We are often told that Canadians and many 
other people have turned inward as we have suffered from a 
recession throughout the 1990s.  We are told that people are less 
interested in international issues and affairs than they may have 
been in some golden age. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to know, on the basis of the discussions he has had 
with Canadians and with groups particularly, if he senses that 
there is widespread or at least a significant interest in this 
bill and these issues.  For example, I read a very good brief 
about Iraq from a church group which included the Mennonite 
Central Committee.  It would seem to me there is an interest 
there.  Could he enlighten us about what he sees as widespread or 
otherwise interest by Canadians in this important issue? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Svend J. Robinson:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank my hon. 
colleague for his question.  I certainly want to thank him for 
the role he plays in international affairs as our spokesperson on 
development issues.  He certainly has a longstanding record in 
this area in working with a number of groups including, I 
believe, the Canadian Conference of Catholic Bishops over the 
years on many of these issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am very hopeful about the response of Canadians on these 
issues.  Sometimes we hear that Canadians do not care what is 
going on outside our borders. The fact of the matter is more and 
more young people particularly are getting involved and want to 
make a difference. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yesterday I had the privilege of speaking at the University of 
Toronto on the issue of Iraq and the impact of sanctions on Iraq. 
It was very heartening to see the large number of young people 
who were present and who wanted to get involved. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>People are working in solidarity with movements, trying to 
promote human rights in many different parts of the world. 
Whether it is in Burma or Colombia, working on behalf of the 
Kurds or in solidarity with Tibet, and in many other parts of the 
world, there is a growing awareness of the importance of this. 
Sadly it is not reflected so much in the media, but I am 
heartened by the extent to which Canadians do recognize that we 
are not just citizens of our local communities and citizens of 
Canada, but we are truly also citizens of the world. 
<P><A NAME="LINK203"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Louise Hardy (Yukon, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I was 
wondering if my colleague could elaborate on sanctions as a war 
crime.  The UN sanctions against Iraq have indeed turned into a 
siege whereby citizens are starved.  Where do we cross the line 
in turning these supposedly helpful implements into in truth 
weapons of war, of starvation? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Svend J. Robinson:</B>  Mr. Speaker, this is a profoundly 
important question.  I know that Canada is putting on the agenda 
of the security council this month the issue of the impact of 
sanctions.  I am hopeful that perhaps arising from that study we 
can look at the fact that in many respects sanctions are having a 
devastating impact on people who are not in any way responsible 
for the terrible actions of those against whom they are allegedly 
directed.  For example, the sanctions on the former Yugoslavia 
are hurting innocent people but in no way are diminishing the 
capacity of Milosevic.  That is why many of us have appealed for 
the government to join in calling for a lifting of those 
sanctions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The sanctions in Iraq are the most glaring example of that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have also seen the impact of the blockade on Cuba and its 
people and the impact of the denial of a blockade.  It is an 
American blockade in this case.  It is not an international 
blockade. In fact it is an illegal blockade which has been 
condemned by the United Nations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to start recognizing that these tools are blunt tools 
which hurt innocent people.

an opportunity to do that.  I know that the Standing Committee on

privilege of being a member, will also be tabling reports, both 
on Iraq and on Kosovo, and will be addressing these very serious 
issues of the impact of sanctions on innocent human beings.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bob Kilger:</B>  Mr. Speaker, in our discussions earlier

speak when this matter again comes before the House at a later

<P><A NAME="LINK207"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jacques Saada (Parliamentary Secretary to Solicitor General 
of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the motion we are debating today 
calls on the government to convene a meeting of like-minded 
nations in order to develop a multilateral plan of action to 
reform international organizations in order to encourage them to 
play a more effective role in the prevention of conflict. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During the earlier debate on this motion, the hon. member spoke 
about the importance of strengthening the ability of 
international organizations to prevent conflict.  He presented a 
number of ideas, such as creating an early warning centre at the 
Royal Roads Military College in Victoria, the Norman Paterson 
School of International Affairs in Ottawa, or the International 
Centre for Human Rights and Democratic Development in Montreal. 
Another idea was the formation of a diplomatic rapid reaction 
force. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member also spoke about the problem of war economies in 
conflict zones, particularly the present situation in Angola, 
and the need to address the problem of the destabilizing effect 
of the accumulation of small arms. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These ideas are laudable and they reflect Canada's concern for 
the affected populations.  The fact is that Canada is already 
working actively to equip the international community with the 
right tools to prevent and, if necessary, manage conflict. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to speak about some of the initiatives already 
under way, to show that a new process aimed at increasing the 
number of means of conflict prevention available to the 
international community would really not be useful at this time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are several early warning mechanisms already in place to 
give the international community notice of potential violent 
conflicts.  Canada has supported international efforts aimed at 
bolstering the international community's early warning capacity. 
For example, Canada has contributed $500,000 to the training of 
UN personnel, through CIDA's peacebuilding fund.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>A course on early warning and conflict prevention is given at 
the United Nations Staff College.  UN staff involved in this 
field learn how to interpret available data. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have also provided assistance to regional organizations such 
as the Organization of African Unity, or OAU, in order to improve 
its information-gathering capacity.  Canada will continue to 
provide support to enhance the capacity of existing organizations 
and systems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In order to prevent a conflict from breaking out, early warning 
must be followed up with early intervention.  Unfortunately, the 
creation of additional early warning centres will not solve the 
problem of divergent approaches to conflict prevention. These 
differences sometimes make it hard to mobilize political will, 
and make the process of reaching a decision on where the rapid 
intervention will be focussed a painstaking and time consuming 
one. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before determining where early intervention will take place, the 
states need to reach agreement on what constitutes legitimate 
objectives for preventive actions by neighbouring states and on 
the nature of such actions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Experience has taught us that there will be no sudden 
improvement in the capacity to intervene in response to an early 
warning; instead, it will be gradually enhanced through the 
creation and reinforcement of international humanitarian 
standards. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The role played by diplomats in prevention and conflict 
resolution is undeniably important.  Canada supports the 
appointment of special representatives and other envoys by the UN 
Secretary General, and is very pleased to see such appointments 
made. 
These representatives can play a significant role in preventing 
conflict and in securing peace. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In July 1998, Canada co-sponsored a high level seminar to improve 
the effectiveness of the secretary general's envoys.  Special 
representatives, past and present, met to examine and develop 
strategic options for their role and responsibilities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>More recently, the secretary general and the security council 
expressed their grave concern to Indonesian authorities over the 
violence that broke out following the independence vote in East 
Timor.  We will recall how closely we followed these unfortunate 
developments in this part of the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A security council mission travelled to Jakarta and Dili in 
September. 
By acting in co-operation with the secretary general, it 
succeeded, and I would say succeeded well, in obtaining 
Indonesia's agreement to the sending of a multinational force to 
restore peace and security in the region and to facilitate 
humanitarian assistance operations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will continue to encourage the use of special representatives 
and missions like the one to East Timor, and we believe this 
function of envoy incorporates the member's proposal to 
establish a rapid diplomat intervention force. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Naturally, like the hon. member, the government is concerned 
about the development of war economies, which feed violent 
conflict.  We are especially concerned by the endless conflict 
in Angola, fed by the illicit diamond trade. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1993, the security council established sanctions with the aim 
of stopping the UNITA rebel troops from funding its military 
operations in Angola.  The aim of these sanctions is to prevent 
UNITA from attaining its objectives through military means by 
targeting the illicit diamond trade and other sources of 
financial support for the UNITA war. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This means reducing deliveries of arms to UNITA and its access 
to petroleum products.  It also means limiting the opportunities 
of the UNITA leaders to travel and be represented abroad. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada currently chairs the security council's committee 
responsible for implementing the sanctions against UNITA. 
Council members are united in their commitment to make current 
sanctions a more effective tool to restrict UNITA's ability to 
engage in war activities.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In so doing, we hope to foster the conditions necessary to 
resume negotiations and thus facilitate a lasting resolution of 
this civil war, which has been raging for 20 years, has claimed 
the lives of more than one million people and resulted in an 
even greater number of people being displaced, of course, and 
injured. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition to these energetic measures to develop public 
awareness, Canada also worked to strengthen the sanctions. 
Ambassador Fowler, who chairs the security council's Angola 
sanction committee, made visits to the region and to Europe to 
promote a stricter implementation of the sanctions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A task force of ten was asked to recommend practical measures to 
improve the implementation of the sanctions and their 
compliance. The task force submitted its recommendations to the 
council on March 15, 2000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada is not alone in looking for ways to strengthen the 
sanctions against UNITA. The European Union, the OAU and other 
organizations have adopted resolutions and made other public 
statements to promote a strict application of the sanctions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The leading diamond mining company, De Beers, and other 
companies have taken measures to ensure full compliance—and I 
would ask the House to please listen—with the sanctions. 
Moreover, the international association of diamond makers 
promised to support the sanctions by pushing for zero tolerance 
for any violation of the sanctions within the industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I could go on and on, but I want to stress the fact that we sit 
on the security council—we will be chairing it—, Canada is a 
member of the G-8, and most G-8 members also sit on the security 
council, and we have great opportunities to intervene 
effectively to prevent conflicts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But the best way for Canada to strengthen the international 
community's ability in that respect is to support existing 
initiatives. We intend to participate very actively. 
Engaging in another process at this point would not be very 
useful.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  The amendment is in order.  The 
question is on the amendment. 
<P><A NAME="LINK210"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg—Transcona, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I welcome the opportunity to participate in this debate about 
reforming the international organizations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will use my time to talk about some of the reforms that I 
think are important with respect to the International Monetary 
Fund, the World Bank and the United Nations but also with respect 
to the WTO, which is an increasingly important international 
organization that has been left out of the member's motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, with respect to the International Monetary Fund and the 
World Bank, this motion is particularly timely in the sense that 
in a few weeks from now there will be a meeting of the World Bank 
and the International Monetary Fund in Washington.  I, and I am 
sure other members of parliament, are aware that a great many 
Canadians are planning to visit Washington in the same way that a 
great many Canadians paid a visit to Seattle at the end of 
November and early December.  They are going to pay a visit to 
Washington and to the meeting of the International Monetary Fund 
and the World Bank in order to signify their displeasure, 
dissatisfaction and objection to the way in which the 
International Monetary Fund and the World Bank now operates, in 
the same way as they did with the World Trade Organization. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a growing feeling among a great many Canadians, and for 
that matter thinking people and democrats all around the world, 
that these international organizations are not serving the global 
community well, that they do need to be reformed and that they 
need to be made more democratic and more representative. They 
need to be restructured in such a way that they are more 
sensitive to the needs of all peoples of the world and not just 
the multinational corporations whose ideology and whose world 
view tends to infuse and take over these organizations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not sure if that is what the hon. member for 
Esquimalt—Juan de Fuca had in mind when he was calling for the 
reform of these organizations but it is certainly what I have in 
mind when I talk about the reform of these organizations, and 
what a lot of other Canadians have in mind when they talk about 
the reform of these organizations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I think about the World Bank, I am reminded of the 
restructuring programs that were imposed on so many third world 
countries by the World Bank.  These restructuring programs were 
not restructuring programs.  They were a cover for the World Bank 
imposing a particular ideology on these third world countries. 
What it often meant was that these countries had to cut back on 
what little social services and health care they had in their 
countries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remember, going back to when the Conservatives were in power, 
the person who later became a Liberal Cabinet minister was the 
head of CIDA at that time, Mr. Massé. 
I remember confronting him in committee at that time with the 
fact this restructuring program of the World Bank and the IMF was 
causing the death of hundreds of thousands of children who were 
being cut off from basic social services in order to satisfy the 
ideology of the banks with respect to debt repayment.

<A HREF="#LINKT82"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This sort of thing continues to this very day.  When push comes 
to shove, capital must be protected.  It really does not matter 
as long as it is indirect.  It really does not matter how many 
people have to die, particularly children and the powerless, in 
order to protect the rights of capital and the rights of people 
who have lent money and want their interest and want it all. 
They had a name for this in the Bible.  They used to call it 
usury. It used to be condemned and thought of as something that 
was morally reprehensible.  We now have a whole financial system 
that depends on it, that thrives on it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To the extent that the World Bank and the International Monetary 
Fund have no critical perspective on this at all, they not only 
need to be reformed, their basic principles need to be 
re-thought, particularly in this year which is the year of the 
jubilee being celebrated by the churches, calling upon all 
Canadians and their governments in the year 2000 to extend 
significant debt relief to the poorest countries of the world so 
that these countries have a chance to crawl out of the hole that 
they are in.  Oftentimes the hole has been created by governments 
and regimes that are long gone, holes that have been created by 
fluctuations and depressions in commodity prices that are long 
gone, but the people of these countries are indentured to this 
debt forever and ever because we cannot seem to break the hold of 
the ideology that the IMF and the World Bank represent to the 
world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I only have limited time and I would not want to spend all my 
time on the IMF and the World Bank. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion also mentions the United Nations.  In that context, I 
think we would all like to see a strengthening of the United 
Nations.  We would all like to see it perhaps in Canada but not 
everyone in the world would like to see it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the things that bothered me not so long ago, when I was 
at a NATO north Atlantic parliamentary assembly meeting, was the 
way in which Americans kept talking about how regrettable it was 
that NATO had to do all these things because the United Nations 
was too weak.   This is coming from the same country that does 
not pay its dues to the United Nations.  No wonder the United 
Nations is weak, when the most powerful country in the world will 
not pay its dues to the United Nations.  They cannot have it both 
ways. They cannot lament the weakness of the United Nations and 
say “We are just going to have NATO do that because the UN is so 
weak” and, at the same time, be directly contributing to its 
weakness through their own refusal to pay their dues to that very 
organization. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is something that I think needs to be said when we are 
talking about UN reform.  One could make a whole speech about UN 
reform. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of course when it comes to the World Trade Organization, this is 
an organization that also needs to be seriously reformed, if not 
completely abolished.  We need to start from scratch with an 
organization that is not committed to entrenching the rights of 
the powerful while leaving the rights of the powerless to be 
dealt with another day, which is exactly what we have in the 
current WTO.

<P><A NAME="LINK211"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. André Harvey (Chicoutimi, PC):</B> Mr. Speaker, first of all, I 
wish to congratulate the member for Esquimalt—Juan de Fuca on his 
initiative. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Organizing a meeting of like-minded organizations and nations in 
order to reform international organizations may seem a bit 
utopian.  Someone famous once said that our achievements are 
always rooted in utopian dreams. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I encourage the Canadian Alliance member to pursue his efforts 
in this direction.  I am sure that important initiatives often 
begin with initiatives that do not always seem momentous.  A way 
must be found to reform all these international organizations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I therefore think it important that the motion by the Canadian 
Alliance member be given very serious consideration.  I hope 
that the government will pay close attention and that it will do 
everything possible to promote the reform of international 
organizations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also wish to pay tribute to the member for Richmond—Arthabaska, 
who is working hard on all issues having to do with 
intergovernmental affairs, as well as international trade. 
These issues are not always very obvious. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I feel that Motion M-30 is modest, but extremely important for 
the future of all inhabitants of this planet.  It is of the 
utmost importance for us as Canadians.  Even if we are 
considered a developed nation, the motion, with its ultimate 
goal of getting international organizations to devote a bit more 
of their energy to the service of humankind and all inhabitants 
of this earth, deserves to be treated seriously and with 
respect. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although we belong to different political parties and are often 
ideologically at opposite ends of the spectrum, I think we must 
congratulate the member on his initiative. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Internationally, we must consider all the criticism that has 
accompanied meetings of international organizations such as the 
International Monetary Fund or the World Trade Organization. 
When these organizations meet, there are many demonstrations. 
Ordinary people, people in our communities realize that 
globalization, which is really being pushed by private 
interests, does not always fully respect the citizens of the 
world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Corporate interests—just think of international mergers and 
ongoing negotiations—are not always consistent with the best 
interests of our fellow citizens, far from it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is obvious that the countries involved in negotiations within 
international organizations chose those that best serve their 
interests. For free trade agreements, the Americans and the 
Canadians may turn to the World Trade Organization if they feel 
they have a better chance of getting something out of that 
organization. 
They may also call on the dispute settlement panel created when 
the free trade agreement was signed, a treaty regarding which 
the Conservative government played an extremely active role. The 
FTA promoted trade, with the result that our exports to the U.S. 
market increased from $90 billion to $250 billion in just a few 
years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the end, these changes did not prevent poverty from 
increasing world-wide. I think the hon. member's motion suggests 
that we look into these issues. Wealth is more and more 
concentrated in the hands of a corporate minority and in the 
hands of a minority in each of our respective countries.

<A HREF="#LINKT84"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>These changes did not prevent poverty from becoming more 
prevalent here in Canada. If I raise the issue of poverty time 
and time again, it is because poverty, particularly among 
children, has increased by about 50% since 1993. I have asked 
the Minister of Finance to take a close look at the issue of 
guaranteed minimum income. There are 37 federal-provincial 
programs, yet the problem of poverty keeps growing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Quebec government is beginning to take an interest in the 
issue of guaranteed minimum income, which will be on the agenda 
at the Parti Quebecois convention, in May. A number of European 
countries are also taking an interest in that option. 
That is why, in order to halt the rise in poverty resulting from 
globalization and internationalization, which are inescapable, 
the best way of ensuring that the globalization of trade is 
achieved a bit more humanely is to have national measures that 
allow us to help those in the greatest need. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is unbelievable that poverty has risen 50% since 1993 and 
that the government continues to think that small, stopgap 
measures will eliminate the problem.  Commercially, there is an 
enormous amount of compensation due nationally if we are to 
assume our responsibilities and do everything possible to stop 
poverty from growing at the frightening pace it has so far. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the organizations that is often mentioned is the United 
Nations. There are many who question its existence.  First, from a 
budgetary point of view, it has some work to do; second, when 
there are major conflicts, very often, the United Nations are 
called on thanks to the leadership exercised by one political 
figure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I recall former Prime Minister Brian Mulroney—to whom I pay 
tribute—being instrumental in ensuring that the Gulf War be 
conducted under the aegis of the United Nations, thanks to his 
relationship with members of NATO in particular.  He managed to 
have the UN put in charge of the operations.  I think this is an 
important step. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important that international organizations be reformed. 
We cannot continue to soft-pedal our efforts to have all 
countries assume their responsibilities in connection with such 
things as the environment. 
Everybody is concerned about what is happening in that area. We 
cannot think that we will be able to control climate 
deterioration through ad hoc measures in each country. I am sure 
our own organizations should review their practices. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am thinking about the Canadian International Development 
Agency, whose mandate it is to help the poorest countries. What 
we hear about it is not always nice. Perhaps we should make a 
greater use of NGOs. For each dollar invested in poor countries, 
65 cents find their way back here one way or another. We have 
been told that wells have been dug, but that there is no water. 
This is bad management. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think the motion brought forward by our colleague from the 
Canadian Alliance deserves serious consideration. I hope this 
simple motion will bring all parliamentarians, particularly on 
the government side, to greater awareness of international 
organizations and the need for reform that will make these 
organizations more effective for every human being, be it in 
relation to international trade, environmental issues or finding 
a better way of resolving armed conflicts. I think we must give 
that very serious consideration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I thank you, Mr. Speaker, for giving me the opportunity to say a 
few words on this motion, because we have a tendency to look down 
on private member's motions. I think we must give this motion all 
the consideration it deserves. I am sure that, if we want to live 
in a better world in the decades to come, all these organizations 
need to be better co-ordinated and restructured to meet real 
targets.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Hart (Okanagan—Coquihalla, Canadian Alliance):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I rise on behalf of the people of 
Okanagan—Coquihalla to speak to Motion No. 130. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The 20th century was host to two of the most costly wars mankind 
has ever known in terms of lives lost and material resources 
consumed.  In the aftermath of the second world war, the 
international community banded together to form the United 
Nations.  One of the prime roles of the UN was to engage in the 
new concept of conflict prevention.  By providing the 
international community with a forum for debate, international 
players could air and resolve their differences without resorting 
to conflict. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During the last 50 years the United Nations has largely failed 
as an institution which could engage in successful conflict 
prevention.  With the start of the cold war and the nuclear arms 
race the international community was divided between the east and 
west, both supporting a number of client states which engaged in 
a number of small and medium size conflicts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With the collapse of this bipolar world over a decade ago, the 
number of international conflicts has actually grown with the 
gulf war and the recent conflict in the Balkans as two conflicts 
in which Canada has been actively and heavily engaged. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The international community's reaction to these conflicts has 
been slow and focused on conflict management, post-conflict 
resolution and reconstruction.  This has not only proved costly 
in material terms but has created a major burden for the armed 
forces of mid-size powers like Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberal government has spent the last seven years slashing 
defence spending and cutting personnel and hardware from the 
Canadian armed forces.  Despite cutting defence spending by 23% 
and over 13,000 personnel since 1993, Canada has more troops 
abroad than at any time since the Korean war 50 years ago. 
Despite having a mandate to monitor and defend Canadian territory 
and the territories of our allies, more and more of the resources 
of the Canadian armed forces are being dedicated to peacekeeping. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Figures from the Department of National Defence claim that 
direct peacekeeping duties cost the department $1.45 billion 
during the 1999-2000 fiscal year.  Almost $1 billion is forecast 
to be spent next year on peacekeeping.  That is over 10% of the 
armed forces budget which has shrunk so small that urgent 
acquisitions of equipment such as the replacement for the Sea 
King helicopter has been postponed a decade and counting. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The cost of peacekeeping has more than doubled from the $465 
million spent by DND during the 1997-98 fiscal year.  The status 
quo has become unsustainable.  With the number of conflicts 
around the world escalating and Canada's defence budget 
dwindling, the international community must finally act and move 
from a focus on conflict management and post-war reconstruction 
to one of conflict prevention.  International financial 
institutions must play a role if we are to succeed, with the 
World Bank and the international monetary fund being two key 
examples. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the other hand, however, soft power initiatives must be 
accompanied by hard power military assets because without hard 
power there will be little incentive for some nations to respond 
to purely economic levers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is where Canada is letting down the international 
community.  The problem is that the idea of influencing other 
nations using soft power initiatives does not always work.  Look 
how influential our Minister of Foreign Affairs was with the 
military junta which took over Pakistan recently. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the Minister of Foreign Affairs really think that Saddam 
Hussein or Slobodan Milosevic will really mend their ways?  Both 
have already experienced punitive economic blockades with little 
effect on their inherent aggressiveness.  Ironically, even the 
creator of the soft power concept, Joseph Nye, understood that 
soft power meant absolutely nothing without hard power to back it 
up. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As mentioned, the Liberal government has slashed defence 
spending by a whopping 23% from $11.28 billion to a low of just 
$9 billion last year.

<A HREF="#LINKT86"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The modest defence spending increase in this year's budget 
barely maintains the status quo with only $60 million in 
additional funding to purchase badly needed equipment.  This has 
literally gutted the Canadian armed forces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe many of my Liberal colleagues on the defence committee 
would agree with what I am saying here today.  Both the Liberal 
members and the Canadian Alliance members supported the defence 
committee's first report to the House of Commons calling for 
significant increases in defence spending as a percentage of GDP 
over the next five years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The finance committee has also realized the urgency of this 
situation and recommended a five year budget increase for 
national defence.  The result of the massive cuts to defence 
spending was predictable.  Personnel levels had to be cut to 
60,000, far below that recommended by the special joint committee 
of 1994 and a dramatic drop from the 87,000 troops we had in 
1987. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>According to the Conference of Defence Associations which 
appeared before the defence committee last December, the number 
has even fallen below the 60,000 level to 57,000 because national 
defence cannot afford to replace those who have left the Canadian 
forces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we know, manpower is an essential aspect of combat 
capability.  The army is particularly hard hit with personnel at 
only 65% of what is needed.  The Conference of Defence 
Associations told the defence committee that the Canadian armed 
forces would be hard pressed to fulfil the Liberal government's 
1994 white paper commitment to build a combat capable brigade 
size force.  This is important because the 1994 defence white 
paper is the government's policy on national defence and the 
government cannot ensure that the commitment it made to Canadians 
can be enforced. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Conference of Defence Association argued the Canadian army 
was really only combat capable at the company level, which is a 
group of about 150 troops.  Here is Canada, a nation of 30 
million people, only capable of fielding company size combat 
capable forces.  We have seen how stretched our two battalions 
are in Kosovo and Bosnia.  We have to bring home our battalion of 
1,300 troops from Kosovo because we cannot effectively sustain 
two battalions in the region. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The army is getting so desperate that recently Colonel Howie 
Marsh advised the government, contrary to the government's own 
defence policy, to cut the army to 10,000 from the current 20,000 
and make up the difference using high technology.  What a 
ludicrous argument.  The idea is unworkable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Conference of Defence Association stated to the defence 
committee that our army at 20,000 was far too small.  High 
technology, as crucial as it is, will not make up for the role 
played by highly trained individuals.  Soldiers on the ground are 
what the army needs.  It is just as important as the massive 
deterioration and rust out of our Canadian forces equipment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last year the auditor general determined that equipment 
requirements of the Canadian forces exceeded the planned budget 
by $4.5 billion.  With a capital budget increase of only $60 
million, Canadians are wondering how DND will replace the aging 
Sea King helicopters and enter the revolution of military 
affairs, and how our armed forces with the latest technology will 
be able to put up any combat capability whatsoever. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, preventing conflict before it begins must become 
an international priority.  I congratulate my colleague from 
Esquimalt—Juan de Fuca for bringing to the House such an 
innovative and worthwhile international plan of action.  He has 
my support, and I suspect he should have the support of all 
members of the House on this initiative.

</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not mere happenstance that the Bretton Woods 
institutions—the International Monetary Fund and the World 
Bank—came into being in the wake of the war. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Their founders realized in 1944 that solid economic foundations 
were needed if there was to be any solid peace. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The International Monetary Fund was created in order to prevent 
balance of payment crises by encouraging the harmonious operation 
of the international monetary system and world trade and 
supporting high levels of sustainable economic growth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Similarly, the World Bank was given the task of reducing poverty 
and inequality by raising standards of living and promoting 
sustainable development in developing countries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While the architects of Bretton Woods could not foresee the 
changes that would come about, the institutions they designed 
have nevertheless proven surprisingly adaptable to a changing 
economic environment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These changes continue today. The recent wave of financial 
crises in the emerging markets is forcing the two institutions to 
reassess their respective policies and roles in order to reduce 
the risk and the impact of future crises and to intensify the 
fight against poverty and inequality. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Through the G-7, the G-20 and its membership in the two 
institutions, Canada contributes to the achievement of these 
objectives along with like-minded nations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, the G-20, chaired by Canada's Minister of Finance, 
was set up in the fall of 1999 to give countries whose size or 
strategic importance confers on them an especially crucial role 
in the world economy greater voice in discussion on international 
financial matters. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The G-20 comprises the ministers of finance and governors of the 
central banks of 19 industrialized countries and emerging 
economies, representatives of the European Union, the central 
European bank, the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank 
and their policy committees. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The objective of the G-20 is to promote co-operation in order to 
achieve stable and lasting international economic growth for 
everyone's benefit. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The IMF has taken a number of important steps to better foresee, 
prevent and respond to crises of the type that have recently 
affected a number of emerging market countries.  For example, in 
its surveillance activities the IMF is paying greater attention 
to issues such as external debt and liquidity management and the 
appropriateness of exchange rate regimes.  The IMF has a key role 
to play in encouraging best practices and monitoring compliance 
in these areas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The IMF is also contributing to the development of international 
codes and standards, particularly in the financial sector, and 
developing frameworks for monitoring and encouraging compliance 
through financial sector stability assessments and reports on the 
observance of standards and codes.  These will help identify and 
address vulnerabilities in a country's financial and economic 
systems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The IMF has also developed two new financing facilities to help 
countries and the international community respond to large scale 
financial crises:  the supplemental reserve facility, which would 
be available to countries in crisis situations that could spill 
over to other countries, and contingent credit lines, which would 
be a precautionary line of defence that would be available to 
countries which are pursuing sound policies but are nonetheless 
vulnerable to contagion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>IMF programs and the sorts of adjustments they call for can only 
succeed if the poor and the most vulnerable in society are 
protected. 
The IMF is therefore placing a higher priority on the social 
aspects of adjustments.

</I></B></P><P align=left>In conjunction with the enhanced debt reduction scheme for 
heavily indebted poor countries and as part of its contribution 
to the global anti-poverty effort, the IMF replaced its 
concessional facility, the enhanced structural adjustment 
facility, with the more focused poverty reduction and growth 
facility.  As a consequence, direct anti-poverty measures will 
play a central role in programs supported by the IMF, the World 
Bank and other lenders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The World Bank, which has recently intensified its fight against 
poverty, is also helping countries to eliminate some of the root 
causes of war and conflict.  In this respect the bank has 
proposed that country-specific poverty frameworks should be 
developed by national authorities in broad consultation with the 
private sector, NGOs, academics and other civil society 
organizations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The key principles of the underlying framework are that poverty 
reduction strategies should be country-driven, oriented to 
achieving concrete results in terms of poverty reduction, 
comprehensive in looking at cross-sectoral determinants of 
poverty outcomes, and provide the context for action by various 
developing partners. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The wider involvement of stakeholders may lead to more open 
discussions on the causes of poverty, such as socio-economic 
inequalities, corruption and poor governance.  It is hoped that 
such discussions may help bridge the differences between various 
groups that are divided along ethnic, religious and political 
grounds. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bank also has a long history in post-conflict assistance. 
Indeed, it was established to support the reconstruction of 
Europe after World War II.  Since then the bank has assisted 
countries all over the world in their post-conflict 
reconstruction efforts.  More recently the bank has played a key 
role in co-ordinating international aid to Kosovo, Bosnia, the 
Democratic Republic of the Congo, the West Bank and Gaza. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In recent years operations in countries emerging from war have 
become a considerable proportion of the bank's portfolio. 
Excluding India and China, nearly a quarter of the International 
Development Association's—the bank's concessional lending 
facility—support is going to countries which have undergone or 
are emerging from conflict. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the past much of the bank's post-conflict reconstruction work 
was concentrated on rebuilding physical infrastructure.  However, 
the bank has increasingly broadened its focus to address wider 
needs in rebuilding social infrastructure, reconstructing 
institutional capacity and putting in place key economic reforms. 
In general, the bank's support is designated to facilitate a 
country's transition from conflict to peace. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bank has also been involved in unique post-conflict 
elements, including de-mining, demobilization and reintegration of 
ex-combatants, and reintegration of displaced populations.  For 
instance, the bank has supported demobilization and reintegration 
of ex-combatants in countries such as Cambodia, Chad, Mozambique 
and Uganda, and reintegration of displaced populations in 
Azerbaijan, Liberia, Rwanda and Sierra Leone.  It has been 
involved in post-conflict community development programs in 
Angola, Cambodia and Rwanda, and de-mining programs in Bosnia and 
Croatia.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Art Hanger (Calgary Northeast, Canadian Alliance):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am pleased to address the motion submitted initially 
by the member for Esquimalt—Juan de Fuca and amended by the 
member for Surrey Central.  To refresh everyone's memory, I will 
read the amendment: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—should continue and intensify efforts with other nations to 
develop multilateral initiatives in order to strengthen the 
capacity of international organizations (e.g. International 
Monetary Fund, World Bank and United Nations) to enable them to 
identify the precursors to conflict and improve their conflict 
prevention capabilities. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to reflect on the comments of the mover of the motion 
about the road map to conflict prevention.  I will reiterate the 
three main points and elaborate a bit on them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first was to establish an early warning centre, a spot 
somewhere in the world where information could be gathered and 
analyzed and then a conclusion reached.  He suggested a spot in 
Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This would lead to the second point, the need to have a series 
of responses.  Those responses would be integrated and involve 
diplomatic, economic and military initiatives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The third point the member for Esquimalt—Juan de Fuca raised on 
this road map to conflict prevention was the economic issues. The 
economic issues involved the IMF, the World Bank and multilateral 
foreign aid agreements.  They would be co-ordinated in some 
effort so that pressure would come to bear on those individuals 
or groups of individuals who were placing undue abuse on their 
fellow countrymen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will go back again to the first point on the early warning 
centre.  When we think about the need in society, this is quite 
an initiative.  There are something like 33 conflicts raging 
right now in the world which fit into the category of need of 
some sort of analysis and response.  There are 33 conflicts where 
human rights are being abused and violence is being meted out to 
individuals and groups of individuals.  Torture is taking place 
and polarization between different ethnic groups within areas of 
conflict. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If a conflict is raging it would require a co-ordinated 
response. Certainly there have been co-ordinated responses in the 
past. Unfortunately sometimes they are not as rapid as they 
should be. Canada, in particular, could very well play a 
significant role in bringing some co-ordinated efforts together 
to deal with conflicts where hundreds of thousands of people have 
been killed or where there is potential for hundreds of thousands 
of people being killed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We do not have to reflect too far to look at areas like 
Ethiopia, Liberia and Sierra Leone.  There is a conflict raging 
right now in Sudan.  No one is involved but it is being 
monitored.  I can see Canada playing a role in the diplomatic, 
economic and military initiatives.

<A HREF="#LINKT90"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am going to touch on the military initiative.  To look after a 
military initiative where a conflict is raging, one would need a 
rapid response combat capable force, not one that will take weeks 
and months to put into the field but one that will take a few 
days.  A ground force would be ready to act, if necessary, but it 
would be combat capable.  It would be capable of being in a 
medium intensity environment with fire power that goes beyond 
hand held weapons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada should build its military up to that point.  However we 
do not fall into that category at this point in time.  We have 
some heavy armament but not nearly enough to respond quickly.  It 
is really unfortunate that we do not have heavy lift or rapid 
reaction capability at this point. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The third point is economic clout, a co-ordinated effort that 
the IMF and the World Bank could use against groups of 
individuals who are bent on human rights abuses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  The time provided 
for the consideration of Private Members' Business has now 
expired and the order is dropped to the bottom of the order of 
precedence on the order paper. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It being 6.17 p.m. the House stands adjourned until tomorrow at 
10 a.m. pursuant to Standing Order 24(1). 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(The House adjourned at 6.17 p.m.)
