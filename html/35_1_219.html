	<B>Hon. Christine Stewart (Secretary of State (Latin America 
and Africa), Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, because of the proceedings in 
the House earlier this week I was unable to give the statement I am 
giving today. Nonetheless, our government regards it as very 
important.
<P>
	Two years ago on June 12, 1993 Nigeria held a presidential 
election. It was the largest vote ever in Africa and the first chance 
for Nigerians to choose their president. It was also the climax of an 
extended transition to democracy which had seen the adoption of a 
constitution and local state and legislative elections over four 
years. Most important, it was in the view of international observers 
including Canada the fairest and most peaceful election in 
Nigeria's history.
<P>
	After preliminary results showed Chief Moshood Abiola 
winning a convincing majority of both votes and states, the military 
regime simply annulled the election. Protests at home and abroad 
led to leadership changes and months of confusion which ended 
with General Sani Abacha taking power in November 1993.
<P>
	Since then his regime has disbanded all elected bodies, jailed 
Abiola and many other democratic leaders, closed newspapers, 
repressed labour unions and minorities, given itself absolute legal 
power and immunity, ended the right of habeas corpus and carried 
out public executions. The January 1996 date set by the regime's 
own constitutional conference for return to democracy was  
recently dropped, enabling General Abacha to stay on indefinitely.
<P>
	What happens in Nigeria matters to Canada. Our countries have 
had a broad relationship based on Commonwealth ties, human 
contacts in both directions and a shared commitment to federalism.
<P>
	Nigeria is our largest export market between South Africa and 
Maghreb and our largest source of imports in all Africa. Its 
population and resources should make it a natural leader on the 
continent. Instead, its entrenched military regime has a chilling 
influence on democratic neighbours and has been imitated in 
Commonwealth west Africa and elsewhere. It remains a potentially 
destabilizing factor in the region.
<P>
	Canada has responded to the situation in Nigeria. We have 
condemned abuses as they have occurred and at the United Nations. 
We have ended high level visits, military training assistance and 
military capable exports.
<P>
<B>(1005 ) </B>
<P>
	Our limited diplomatic relations have included many 
representations on behalf of Chief Abiola, Ken Saro-Wiwa and 
other repressed human rights leaders.
<P>
	We have assisted the democratic movement with modest aid 
funds and have invited several prominent Nigerians on visits to 
give Canadians a firsthand impression of the situation.
<P>
	Democracy delayed is democracy denied. Nigerians have been 
under military rule for 12 years and have already demonstrated 
their readiness and enthusiasm for the democratic process. General 
Abacha's regime must now act decisively to restore democracy, the 
rule of law and respect for human rights. In particular the release of 
Chief Abiola and ex-president Obasanjo would be a step in the 
right direction; so would debanning the media, freeing or charging 
detainees or setting a firm date for the end of military rule.
<P>
	In the absence of visible measurable progress toward these 
objectives Nigeria's Commonwealth partners will be obliged to 
draw their own conclusions. Today we recognize the efforts of 
Nigerian democrats and ensure them they are not forgotten nor do 
they work in vain.
<P>
	Dr. Wole Soyinka, a democratic leader and Nigeria's only Nobel 
prize winner, was recognized by the Speaker on Monday and met 
with me. As in South Africa, the struggle may be long but there can 
be no doubt about the outcome, Nigerians will enjoy the rights 
South Africans do today.

[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Maud Debien (Laval East, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, on 
behalf of the Bloc Quebecois, I am pleased today to pay tribute to 
all Nigerian democrats.
<P>
	Barely two years ago, the people of Nigeria believed they had 
acquired a democratic process worthy of the name. Their leader, 
Moshood Abiola, had won a resounding, eminently democratic 
victory. Unfortunately, as we know, the military regime did not 
accept the outcome, cancelled the election and ultimately, 
appointed General Sani Abacha as head of state.
<P>
	In light of the special commercial and political ties between 
Canada and Nigeria, the Canadian government has a duty to 
condemn loud and clear the basic human rights violations that 
many Nigerians have suffered.
<P>
	In our opinion, the Canadian government is not doing everything 
that it can to intervene. As the Minister of Foreign Affairs publicly 
announced only a few weeks ago, Canada is preparing to promote 
trade without taking into account the human rights record of certain 
countries.
<P>
	The Liberal government's new foreign policy is questionable. 
When the Canadian section of Amnesty International gathered for 
its annual meeting last week, the director of the English section 
rightly stated that to remain silent on the human rights issue 
constitutes a serious abdication of our responsibilities, bordering 
on complicity.
<P>
	As we have said, the Canadian government's policy on human 
rights is based on double talk. The policy of the Liberal 
government is to answer only to the economic imperatives of 
Canada's relations with its major trading partners, such as China or 
Mexico. However, it takes a hard line approach to small countries 
with which we have few or non-existent trade relations.
<P>
	The Bloc Quebecois believes that the Liberal government should 
not hesitate to proclaim and publicly defend the fact that 
democracy and human rights are the cornerstones of Canadian 
foreign policy, and that all of our trading partners should be 
expected to have a similar stand, regardless of how much trade 
Canada does with them.
<P>
	By taking such a position, the government will be sending a clear 
message to the people and heads of state or government of 
countries that have trade ties with or receive aid from Canada, as is 
the case with Nigeria. Canada must not pass up this opportunity to 
profess in a vigorous way its democratic faith in an international 
community where the temptation to remain indifferent, detached or 
self-interested is omnipresent. We must move quickly to prove 
wrong the dictators who interpret the collusive silence of countries 
that claim to embrace democratic ideals as support for their 
actions.
<P>
	Instead of turning a blind eye to anti-democratic regimes and 
human rights violations, whether in China or elsewhere, instead of 
discussing the issue of human  rights only behind the scenes to 
spare the feelings of countries with markets that are interesting to 
Canada, the government must adopt a coherent, clearly worded 
policy, one that is entrenched in legislative and regulatory texts and 
that ensures that decisions are based on three established criteria, 
namely human rights, development assistance and international 
trade.
<P>
<B>(1010) </B>
<P>
	Otherwise, the only clear message that the government will be 
sending is that governments of the south need only become good 
trading partners if they want to rule by dictatorship, free of any 
pressure.
<P>
	In closing, I want to express once again my support for all 
Nigerian democrats. I know how difficult it can be to fight for 
human rights and democracy. Sometimes people have the feeling 
that their hard work produces only mediocre results. Yet, we are 
hopeful that their efforts to achieve democracy will prove 
successful. Until then, the official opposition will support their 
actions and join with them in condemning the human rights 
violations that many Nigerians have suffered.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bob Mills (Red Deer, Ref.):</B> Madam Speaker, I share the 
sentiments of the Secretary of State for Latin America and Africa 
who spoke well on the need for the restoration of democracy in 
Nigeria.
<P>
	It is certainly true the people of that country deserve a far better 
government than they currently have. When they went peacefully 
to the polls two years ago they had a genuine hope that for the first 
time they would be able to choose their own president, but their 
hopes were dashed. Not only was their democratically elected 
president Chief Moshood Abiola arrested in jail by the army, but 
almost every personal freedom was taken away from the people of 
Nigeria. This unfortunate set of circumstances was described in 
detail by the secretary of state.
<P>
	In response to this robbery of democracy the Canadian 
government has been quite right to condemn the illegitimate 
government which has taken over. It was similarly correct in taking 
certain punitive actions against that government. In the future the 
Reform Party hopes the Canadian government will vigorously 
promote democracy and improve human rights in Nigeria and 
throughout the world.
<P>
	In general Reform supports positive measures to improve human 
rights such as support for the strengthening of democratic and legal 
institutions in the developing world through our international aid 
program. Canadian aid should support human rights promotion, 
democratic change and institution building. Reform also supports 
working with non-governmental organizations and the private 
sector to build up a civil society and middle class in developing 
countries. As civil society expands and the middle class grows, 
human rights issues will improve.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13881"> 13881 </A></B>
<P>
	In severe cases such as Nigeria where the government is 
responsible for massive human rights abuses and with which 
a co-operative approach is not likely to be successful, we would 
support the multilateral use of certain penalties.
<P>
	I pass on a message to the people of Nigeria that Canada does 
care and we will continue in our commitment to assisting 
democratization and human rights in that country and in others. 
With hard work and persistence they can overcome tyranny and 
Canadians look forward to the day when we will welcome their 
democratically elected leaders to our country.

	<B>Mr. Richard Bélisle (La Prairie, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have the 
honour to present today to the House the 13th report of the 
Standing Committee on Public Accounts concerning the 
Correctional Service of Canada.
<P>
	At the conclusion of the report, the committee recommends that 
the auditor general monitor the efforts of the Correctional Service 
of Canada to improve its accommodation planning and supervision 
of released offenders, and that he report his findings when he 
considers it appropriate.
<P>
	The committee believes that the recommendations contained in 
this report should be actively implemented. It also recommends 
that unless it is directed to do otherwise, the Correctional Service 
of Canada report on the progress made in implementing the report's 
recommendations by April 1996 at the latest.
<P>
	Appended to this report is the official opposition's dissenting 
opinion on the policy of double bunking. In closing, I would like to 
quote two recommendations contained in this dissenting opinion: 
one, that the Correctional Service of Canada assess the short, 
medium and long term impact of the policy of double bunking on 
inmates, particularly its effect on inmate rehabilitation and that the 
results of the study be published by January 1996; and two, that the 
Correctional Service of Canada await the results of this study 
before making the double bunking policy part of its 
accommodation standards.
<P>
<B>(1015) </B>
<P>
	Pursuant to Standing Order 109, the committee requests that the 
government table a comprehensive response to this report.

sent to me by Mrs. Margaret Wiens of Quesnel, British Columbia, 
and signed by over 1,000 constituents from many areas of my

<P>
	The petitioners call for the government to enact immediate

integration of alternate practitioners, homoeopathic, herbal, 
naturopathic, et cetera, into the Canadian health care system with 
full equal coverage of visits and necessary remedies.

<P>
	My constituents request that Parliament not amend the human 
rights code, the Canadian Human Rights Act or the charter of rights

approval of same sex relationships or homosexuality, including 
amending the human rights code to include in the prohibited 
grounds of discrimination the undefined phrase of sexual

to present four petitions on behalf of the citizens of Simcoe Centre. 
The first petition deals with the subject of state imposed 
bilingualism.
<P>
	Given that the large majority of Canadians are opposed to the 
official languages policy imposed on them by the former Liberal

either accept or reject this flawed policy.

concerned that naming some groups in legislation will exclude 
other groups from protection and that sentencing based on the 
concept of hatred is very subjective and will undermine our justice

	<B>Mr. Ed Harper (Simcoe Centre, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the final

sexual orientation. The petitioners are concerned about including 
the undefined phrase sexual orientation in the Canadian Human 
Rights Act. Refusing to define the statement leaves interpretation 
open to the courts, a very dangerous precedent to set.

	The petitioners request that Parliament urge the government to 
recognize the unborn fetus from fertilization onward as an 
individual in its own right with access to article 15(1) of the charter

	Furthermore, the petitioners request that Parliament recognize

means available the public funding of and the practice of abortion, 
thereby honouring Parliament's and the government's obligation

Question No. 186-<B>Mr. Duncan:</B>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>With regard to Indians making purchases on reserve or having purchases 
delivered to the reserve, what was the amount of GST exemption for eligible 
Indians for the fiscal years 1991-92, 1992-93 and 1993-94?</BLOCKQUOTE>
	<B>Hon. David Anderson (Minister of National Revenue, Lib.):</B> 
Although Revenue Canada gathers information to administer the 
Excise Tax Act on the goods and services tax return including the 
amount of the GST collected and input tax credits claimed by each 
registrant, information is not collected on exemptions for particular 
groups. Consequently, it is not possible to provide the data 
requested.
<P>
Question No. 187-<B>Mr. Duncan:</B>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>With regard to Indians making purchases off reserve at designated remote 
stores, (<I>a</I>) what was the amount of GST exemption for eligible Indians for the 
fiscal years 1991-92, 1992-93 and 1993-94, and (<I>b</I>) what are the designated 
remote stores off reserve by province?</BLOCKQUOTE>
	<B>Hon. David Anderson (Minister of National Revenue, Lib.):</B> 
Remote stores are not required to accumulate or report on the total 
dollar value of their sales to Indians. There is no requirement in law 
for reporting this information to Revenue Canada. Moreover, 
accumulating such information would significantly increase the 
vendor's reporting requirements.
<P>
	Off reserve vendors qualifying as remote stores are entitled to 
waive the delivery requirement on tax relieved sales to Indians. 
The department does not maintain a comprehensive list of 
qualifying remote store vendors. The individual vendors are 
responsible for determining their eligibility as a remote store and 
are accountable for the GST receivable if they did not meet the 
requirements. Their eligibility is later verified by a deparmental 
audit.
<P>
Question No. 188-<B>Mr. Duncan:</B>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>What was the amount of GST credit paid to eligible on reserve status Indians 
for the fiscal years 1991-92, 1992-93 and 1993-94?</BLOCKQUOTE>
	<B>Hon. David Anderson (Minister of National Revenue, Lib.):</B> 
The information requested is not available as Revenue Canada does 
not keep statistics on the number of goods and services tax, GST, 
credit payments issued to status Indians. In addition, the 
department does not categorize individuals by status or residence 
and is therefore unable to extrapolate the requested information 
from its data banks.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gagliano:</B> Madam Speaker, I ask that the remaining 
questions be allowed to stand.
<P>

	The House resumed from June 14 consideration of the motion in 
relation to the amendments made by the Senate to Bill C-69, an act 
to provide for the establishment of electoral boundaries 
commissions and the readjustment of electoral boundaries; and of 
the amendment.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> Prior to resuming debate, 
due to the statement by the minister, Government Orders will be 
extended by 12 minutes.
<P>
	I would inform the hon. member for North Vancouver that he has 
14 minutes left in the debate.
<P>
<B>(1025 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ted White (North Vancouver, Ref.):</B> Madam Speaker, 
when my speech was interrupted last night, I was speaking on Bill 
C-69. At the time when I began my speech I mentioned the 
continuing growth of the debt and deficit.
<P>
	I would like to mention that in the 11 hours since I have stopped 
speaking and have started again, the debt has increased by 
approximately $50 million. Overnight while we were out of this 
place the government overspent by $50 million. That gets added on 
with interest to the debt burden already being carried by our 
children and our grandchildren.
<P>
	I also mentioned earlier in my speech last night and I would like 
to reiterate that the issue of constituency representation is a very 
important aspect of many of the bills we are considering. Free 
votes were never an issue in past Parliaments because the three 
worn out, dictatorial, arrogant old line parties all played the same 
game of agenda politics.
<P>
	They never wanted to and still do not want to govern the country 
according to the wishes of the Canadian voters. They are not 
interested in conducting business in accordance with the wishes of 
taxpayers. There was a very good example of that less than 15 
minutes ago when the government created a situation where the 
House has to stay open well after midnight, debating bills and 
motions that could have been debated adequately many months ago 
when there was plenty of time to have public input, to do these 
things properly. Those bills and motions do not have to be rammed 
through the way it is being done, all jammed into a few days at the 
end of the session when the public and the media do not get an 
adequate opportunity to look at things.
<P>
	If the government had been truly interested in carrying out the 
wishes of Canadian voters and taxpayers, it would not engage in 
this type of activity. It would admit that many of its bills are badly 
flawed and would simply allow them to die or withdraw them.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13884"> 13884 </A></B>
<P>
	At the moment, with the exception of the Reform MPs and 
a few independently minded Liberals, most of the MPs are 
nothing more than voting machines. All we do is keep busy 
between votes. Apart from the group I just mentioned, MPs are 
simply not interested in reflecting their constituents' wishes in 
the House.
<P>
	All of the debates, the questions, the committee meetings, the 
hearings, the witness testimony and the travel junkets are nothing 
more than make work projects to keep MPs busy between votes, 
votes for which the outcome is already known because the Prime 
Minister knows what he wants to happen before the first words of 
debate are uttered.
<P>
	As I finished last night, I mentioned that last year the 
government introduced approximately 60 bills. By the end of the 
year, approximately 60 bills had been passed. Members could have 
come here for one day, for one hour last year, stacked the whole 60 
bills this high on the Clerk's table, voted once and the outcome 
would have been pretty much the same.
<P>
	For all of the debates and discussions that went on, the outcome 
would have been pretty much the same. That is because the 
outcome is already known before debate begins. It makes a 
mockery of attempts by people to properly represent the taxpayers, 
the constituents of this country.
<P>
	Instead of having a reasonable approach to the bill before us, 
members end up debating a bill that resulted from partisan 
interference in the non-partisan electoral boundaries redistribution 
process.
<P>
	When is the bill being debated? Right at the end of the session. 
Members have to go through the process of speaking right into the 
small hours of the morning. The government does not particularly 
care about input or debate any more than it cares for input or debate 
on any other bill.
<P>
	The Liberals know it will pass because the Prime Minister has 
already issued his instruction. It will pass. Yesterday maybe half a 
dozen Liberal MPs were brave enough to defy the orders of the 
Prime Minister and to vote against the gun control bill in order to 
represent their constituents. Congratulations to those members who 
felt strongly enough to stand up for the principles that were 
important to them.
<P>
	We heard that the Prime Minister gave a speech during the 
Liberal caucus meeting yesterday morning in which he told Liberal 
MPs that if they vote against a government bill twice, then they are 
out. If that is true, then I hope the hon. ladies and gentlemen on the 
government side think very carefully over the next few days about 
whether they can tolerate such an ultimatum.
<P>
	Can they maintain their dignity? Can they continue to claim to 
have ethics? Can they look their families and their constituents in 
the eye? And can they continue to support their party if they would 
accept such a dictatorial ultimatum? Are they grown adult 
Canadians with a sense  of morality, or are they prepared to be 
pawns in a giant political machine?
<P>
<B>(1030) </B>
<P>
	Clearly, we have a little way to go before free and representative 
votes are a normal part of the operations of this place, but I truly 
believe we are on the verge of a revolution in the way Parliament 
functions. If there are dinosaurs on the other side of the House who 
refuse to accept the inevitable change, they will soon be sent into 
retirement by the voters. Then there will be no more Bill C-18s and 
no more Bill C-69s, because the people of Canada will be 
represented here instead of the political parties of Canada being 
represented here.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Terrana:</B> Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of order. I am 
disturbed to hear that our hon. colleague is saying that the Prime 
Minister yesterday threatened the caucus that they would be out of 
caucus if they did not vote for our legislation. That is not correct, 
and I would like to say that I oppose it.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> I am sorry, but that is an 
item for debate.
<P>
	<B>Mr. White (North Vancouver):</B> Madam Speaker, as I was 
saying, once we get to a point where the representatives in this 
place are clearly representing their constituents, there will be no 
more need for Bill C-18s or Bill C-69s, Bill C-41s, because the 
people of Canada will be represented here rather than the political 
parties of Canada being represented here. The legislation passed 
will be meaningful because it will be legislation wanted by the 
voters and taxpayers who are building the country and supplying 
the funds we need to run this place. The debates will be real 
debates. The committee meetings will actually mean something. 
Questions during question period will actually be answered, and 
members of Parliament will regain the respect of the people of 
Canada.
<P>
	In closing, I would like to mention two things. Our debt has 
increased by almost a million dollars during the time it took me to 
give the speech, the total time of the speech. The second point is 
that the Deputy Prime Minister promised to resign if the GST had 
not gone within a year of the election. She still has not done it.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Pierrette Ringuette-Maltais (Madawaska-Victoria, 
Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, I am astonished by our colleague's 
comments. Perhaps he would care to tell the members of this House 
how many of the votes taken by Reform Party members since they 
were first elected to this House have in fact been free votes.
<P>

<P>
<HR>

<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. White (North Vancouver):</B> Madam Speaker, I would like to 
thank the hon. member for her question.
<P>
	I am astonished that she is astonished. Having had the 
opportunity to be in this House for some time since the last 
election, I would have hoped that the hon. member would have 
noticed that every vote that has been taken in this House by Reform 
has been a free vote.
<P>
	We think very carefully about the details of the bills before us. 
We all consult with our constituents on an ongoing basis. For the 
most part we have been elected by voters who have similar beliefs 
and feelings, so it is not uncommon for us to be able to vote the 
same way on a bill. On routine bills, that is the way it happens. On 
controversial issues or issues where there are regional differences, 
it quite clearly can be witnessed that Reform has been able to 
demonstrate that freedom of voting quite regularly. There is never 
any punishment. There is never any animosity between the 
members because that is the understanding. The constitution of the 
Reform Party requires Reform MPs to reflect the wishes of their 
constituencies whenever that desire can be clearly demonstrated, 
and it is compulsory in the case of moral issues.
<P>
	I do thank the hon. member for permitting me to elaborate on 
that and to clarify that point.
<P>
<B>(1035 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Peter Adams (Peterborough, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, with 
respect to what the member refers to as new style politics and the 
wishes of his constituents, could he explain the activities of the 
Reform last evening, when for about three hours during the votes I 
noticed the members were deliberately standing up and sitting 
down very slowly? Instead of standing up so that the clerks could 
do the count very quickly, they were standing up and sitting down 
very slowly. With respect to this new style of politics, is this a new 
tactic the Reform Party has developed? Was it requested by their 
constituents?
<P>
	<B>Mr. White (North Vancouver):</B> Madam Speaker, that is an 
interesting question from the member. The member asked why 
some of the members on the Reform side were getting up rather 
slowly during the votes on C-41 last night. I would like to mention 
that I think they were emulating and mimicking the member for 
Burin-St. George's, who makes a habit of carrying on that 
activity.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Gouk (Kootenay West-Revelstoke, Ref.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, it is very interesting that this bill would come back from 
the Senate. They have already expressed displeasure with the kinds 
of bills the Liberals put through and are expressing it once again. 
Maybe this time the government will get the message.
<P>
	One of the reasons we had this bill in the first place was the fact 
that many Liberal members did not like the way the boundaries 
were changed. This did not suit the demographics that they thought 
were in their best  interests, and without any thought to whether it 
was in the best interests of their constituents or the taxpayers of this 
country they set about to basically eradicate $8 million worth of 
work by the boundary commissions.
<P>
	In my riding and in all the ridings that are pretty well 
interconnected with mine we went through the public hearing 
process in British Columbia, as I am sure all the other provinces 
did as well. The initial boundaries that were set were not liked 
there. It is not important whether they were liked by the MPs or 
not; they were not liked by the constituents of those ridings.
<P>
	The public hearings were held, which is the process that is in 
place, and they did their job. The boundary commission came out 
to the various towns where these were advertised and were 
absolutely deluged with letters, briefs, and with people coming 
before the commission at the public hearings to testify. The people 
who were not happy with those first boundaries explained in detail 
what it was they did not like about them, what they thought the 
alternatives were, why theirs were better and how things could 
work with the new plan they had.
<P>
	The people from the boundary commission who came out on 
these public hearings accepted this information. They went to 
subsequent hearings until they had heard from the entire area. They 
then went back and considered all the information and input that 
took place. That is the way the process is supposed to work. If there 
is something wrong, it is up to the people it affects, not the MPs. It 
is up to the constituents, the voters. It is up to them to tell the 
people who have the authority to set these boundaries what is 
wrong with this in the first place. That is the process that took 
place. The people involved in setting the new boundaries took this 
information and decided that obviously it was what the people 
wanted. So they redrew the boundaries and changed the program 
based on the input of the people of the affected ridings.
<P>
	What they came out with for my riding and for those 
interconnected with my riding was not absolute perfection as we 
would like to see it, but it was something that was much better than 
originally brought up. It was something that reflected the wishes of 
the people in the various ridings and it was something we could all 
live with. Unfortunately, it was not something, even at that point, 
members of the Liberal government could live with. They decided 
that they had to have changes. Well from time to time these things 
do need to be upgraded and changed, but that does not mean you 
should spend millions and millions of wasted dollars to make those 
changes. There is a time and a place for everything.
<P>
<B>(1040 ) </B>
<P>
	Simple changes to the Electoral Boundaries Readjustment Act 
can always be brought in, but they should not be brought in at the 
eleventh hour, scrapping all the work that had been just about 
completed before this started.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13886"> 13886 </A></B>
<P>
	One of the problems with what the government is doing is 
that the cost of boundary examination and modification runs 
about $8 million. As I said, most of that work had been 
completed. There is only the final step left to take place. Yet 
the government would have us scrap that so we can bring in 
a change of rules and have this work done all over again.
<P>
	The public has already had an opportunity to talk about the 
boundaries and what was proposed. One of two things is going to 
happen if this bill goes through and they scrap all the work that has 
gone before and start back at square one: either the government is 
going to listen to the people, the voters of Canada, and do what they 
want, which has already been done; or it is going to ignore the 
voters of Canada, which is often its style, and do whatever it wants 
in order to get the boundary ridings that best reflects its members' 
ability to be elected. The latter is unacceptable.
<P>
	If we are going to change the act there are a lot of things that 
should be in there. Some of those things have been addressed by the 
Senate amendments and some have not. One thing we proposed 
was a cap or even a reduction in the total number of MPs in this 
House.
<P>
	We see the kinds of high jinks and antics exhibited by one side 
evoking a response from the other side and causing further 
retaliation. Do we need more people to do that? It costs a lot of 
money to have an MP here. Are people going to be better 
represented because we stuff more people into this place, increase 
the operating budget of Parliament, revamp this whole Chamber so 
we can squeeze extra seats in, and not only that but leave it in a 
formula that will see it continue to expand year after year? Is that in 
the best interest of the Canadian public? I do not think so.
<P>
	We need elected representatives who are going to listen to the 
people. It does not matter if there are a thousand people in here, if 
they do not listen to what the people say it will do absolutely no 
good. That is what is happening in Bill C-69.
<P>
	The government is not listening to the people who have already 
had input to the boundary commissions and said this is what they 
want. It is prepared to scrap that. There are not enough changes in 
these amendments or in the legislation proposed by the 
government, sent once already to the other place and returned to be 
sent back again, to justify spending $6 million to $8 million all 
over again. As I said, the end result is going to be the same thing or 
the total ignoring of the wishes of the public.
<P>
	I am here to represent my constituents. My constituents can best 
be represented by the style of boundary changes we already have in 
place. If this bill goes through, with or without the Senate 
amendments as they have been proposed, then the wishes of my 
constituents are going to be ignored. Consequently, I do not support 
the government's legislation dealing with C-69 one way or another, 
with or without the  amendments from the other place. It is still an 
unacceptable piece of legislation and I will never support it.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary North, Ref.):</B> Madam Speaker, 
I was interested to hear my colleague talk about the bill coming in 
at this time.
<P>
	I am interested in his experience in the transportation portfolio 
he is working on. I wonder whether he has made any observations 
in that area with respect to the kinds of representation people are 
talking about. I know he has travelled quite a bit and he has talked 
to a number of people who may be looking for the kind of 
representation he is talking about. Is he basing his concept of 
representation on the remarks and the comments he hears from 
people as he travels? If so, what is he hearing?
<P>
<B>(1045 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gouk:</B> Madam Speaker, I thank the hon. member for her 
inquiry. I have travelled a great deal and I have talked with people 
on a number of issues not only in the transportation area but in 
many other areas as well, including representation and how that 
would be affected by the make-up of a riding.
<P>
	For example, one of the problems we will have if the bill passes 
is that we will not know what the boundaries are. When we talk 
about representation we have no idea whatsoever who will be 
representing what area. The hon. member from Calgary could have 
her boundaries changed substantially. In my own riding I could 
look at the original model of boundary changes. It was changed 
immensely from the initial proposal by the boundary commission 
after listening to input from people who would be affected.
<P>
	As I said, we either represent the will of the people or we ram 
something down their throats. In this case we do not know which 
way government members will go because once in a while they 
listen. I do not know if it is because we are getting to them or the 
people are getting to them but every now and then they listen. It 
catches us off guard when it happens. More often they do not listen 
to the people. We are seeing all kinds of legislation being rammed 
through the House right now and they are certainly not listening to 
the people on those matters.
<P>
	That is one of the problems we have, and I am hearing about it as 
I travel from riding to riding across Canada. I have had meetings in 
places like Mississauga. The problem is that if the bill goes through 
the way the government proposes it, with or without the 
amendments now before us, we are looking at an unknown future 
for all ridings and for all boundaries. We have absolutely no idea 
who will be representing which portion of which riding.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13887"> 13887 </A></B>
<P>
	In the case of my riding of Kootenay West-Revelstoke, a 
portion of the north would be cut off under the current proposal 
and massive areas would be added to the west. On the previous 
proposal I would go east all the way through the next member's 
riding and lose a portion of the compact area of my own. It is 
very important that we consider not only our own ridings but 
those of all MPs across the country.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Peter Adams (Peterborough, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
noticed the hon. member was concerned about the cost of 
Parliament and the cost of members of Parliament, and I think 
rightly so. It is very important that taxpayers' money be well spent 
and be seen to be well spent.
<P>
	However I noticed last evening the member sitting down and 
standing up very slowly during the votes. I have heard that one of 
the costs of Parliament is the cost of running the House and I have 
been told that it is roughly $48,000 an hour. It seems to me last 
evening the standing up and sitting down very slowly perhaps cost 
us an extra three hours, which would be roughly $150,000 or 
roughly the salary and associated costs of an MP for a whole year.
<P>
	I noticed the hon. member was standing up particularly slowly 
and sitting down particularly slowly. I wonder what he thought 
about spending the equivalent of the annual salary and benefits of 
one member of Parliament in one wasted period of three hours last 
evening.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gouk:</B> Madam Speaker, I am very pleased the hon. member 
on the other side noticed anything at all.
<P>
	With respect to the cost of running Parliament last night and 
getting around his stopwatch timing of how fast or slow I do my 
callisthenics from here, I would suggest to him that he should talk 
to his party leaders. We inquired if they were interested in moving 
things quickly last night. We were prepared to do that. We offered 
to have the whole House close down and we could have been well 
on our way long before he ever envisioned. However they chose not 
to go that way.
<P>
	If we want to talk about wasting money and wasting time, let us 
examine why we were here last night in the first place. The reason 
we were here is that all last spring and all last fall the government 
had all kinds of opportunity to bring the bills forward that we are 
now ramming through with time allocation and late night sittings. 
Let us talk about things like Bill C-7, an absolute piece of garbage. 
That legislation has sat for an entire year with absolutely nothing 
being done, and the government is talking about bringing it forward 
next week and ramming it through.
<P>
	If there is waste in the House it is not on this side; it sits firmly 
with the member and the Liberal Party on that side.
<P>
<B>(1050 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Anna Terrana (Vancouver East, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
have been travelling with my hon. colleague on the transport 
committee so I know what his principles are. We shared a good 
relationship on the committee.
<P>
	The riding of Vancouver East that I represent includes a portion 
of the former Vancouver-Kingsway riding that will be 
re-established. In 1988 I made a presentation to the travelling 
committee on the Kingsway riding. I remember at the time I 
suggested that Vancouver-Kingsway should be kept where it was 
because the population would grow and we would need it again. 
Most of the constituents of the riding asked for Kingsway to 
remain. As we can see seven years later we are trying to 
re-establish Kingsway and at the time, as I said, the constituents 
wanted Kingsway to remain.
<P>
	Does my colleague think that we should have some kind of order 
in a bill that helps us make better choices on the process of 
redistribution?
<P>
	By the way, the part of my riding that will go is one of the best 
parts of my riding. However I am not speaking to that effect 
because whatever will come will come. I am not trying to change 
things. I am just thinking that there is a need for some order in the 
redistribution of the electoral boundaries and we need a bill to that 
effect.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gouk:</B> Madam Speaker, I thank the hon. member for her 
question. She is right. We have had many good times on committee 
together and I do appreciate her point of view from time to time.
<P>
	However I find interesting one of the comments she made when 
she said: ``that helps us make better choices''. I did not think we 
were here to make choices. I thought we were here to represent the 
choices made by our constituents.
<P>
	In my riding what was proposed was a great problem. However 
the people of my riding had input and as a result the riding 
boundary was changed from the original proposal, not in a minor 
manner but in a major way.
<P>
	The consideration is not what we in Parliament will do but rather 
making sure the people in the riding have the democratic input into 
electoral boundary commissions. I know for sure it happened in the 
B.C. interior. I can only assume the member and her riding, being I 
am sure she would suggest well represented, would ensure that the 
democratic process took place in the electoral boundary 
commission.
<P>
	As far as changes are concerned I said in my speech that changes 
were needed. Changes should be brought in as a routine matter 
between electoral boundary revisions, not at the eleventh hour 
when it is all but completed, which would scrap the entire process 
and we would start all over again at great cost and with great 
uncertainty to the constituents of the various ridings.
<P>

<P>
	<B>Mrs. Pierrette Ringuette-Maltais (Madawaska-Victoria, 
Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, I heard right, but I thought the hon. 
member would come back with different comments and maybe 
undo what he said in the first place. He said that the cost of 
sending MPs here was very high, with which I agree, and that 
we did not need to increase the cost and increase the number 
of MPs in the House.
<P>
	I am surprised because the thrust of the bill will permit western 
Canadians to have adequate representation here as far as numbers 
are concerned. I do not agree with the member from western 
Canada who wants to eliminate the possibility of westerners having 
more MPs and more representation in the House.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gouk:</B> Madam Speaker, I can see where this is a very 
complicated matter for the hon. member, particularly when the 
Minister of Justice says that he does not like mathematics. I guess 
it has affected the whole party.
<P>
	The answer is that we do not always have to adjust upward. We 
can also adjust downward. We are not saying there should not be 
regional balance. We are saying we should adjust the numbers from 
province to province so that there is always equal representation, 
but it does not have to be done by adding to the cost.
<P>
<B>(1055) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Silye (Calgary Centre, Ref.):</B> Madam Speaker, I begin 
my speech today on Bill C-69 by issuing a challenge to Liberal 
members opposite to go back to their ridings this weekend, grab a 
piece of paper, a pen and a clipboard, and walk down the street 
asking their constituents if they think we need more politicians in 
Ottawa. They should not be surprised if they hear responses like are 
you joking, absolutely not, no way, get real, and a few expletives 
that I cannot say in the House.
<P>
	The issue that we are debating today is quite simple: the need for 
more politicians in the House of Commons or the lack of need for 
more politicians in the House of Commons. The Liberal 
government wants to increase the size of the House of Commons 
from 295 members to 301 by the next election. Reformers would 
like to see the House reduced from 295 members and the rate of 
future growth reduced to 265 or less.
<P>
	This is the direction Canadians want Ottawa to take: less 
government, less regulation, less bureaucracy and fewer 
politicians. We only have to look at how successful the Harris 
campaign was in Ontario to prove our point. One of his campaign 
promises was to reduce the number of members at Queen's Park by 
25 per cent. The provincial Liberals were opposed to that, and we 
all know what happened to them once the smoke had cleared.
<P>
	The cost of six new members is a factor that I highlight for 
Liberals. They constantly rise in the House in the name of 
effectiveness, efficiency, lowering the cost of the MP pension plan, 
and how they are keeping all their promises when they are really 
breaking them all. I ask them to justify a contradiction. They will 
increase the  overhead of running the country by millions and 
millions of dollars by adding more politicians full of hot air trying 
to do their jobs, which they do not get done because that select 
group over there, the cabinet, runs the country; the rest of us are 
window dressing.
<P>
	The current compensation or remuneration for one member of 
Parliament-
<P>
	<B>Mr. Speaker (Lethbridge):</B> They are like mayors.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Silye:</B> Exactly. I refer to the cost or the overhead for six new 
members. I am glad to see the President of the Treasury Board is 
here because he has his favourite pet project, the Cadillac pension 
plan.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> I am sure the member is 
well aware that we do not refer to the presence or absence of 
anyone in the House.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Silye:</B> I thought it might have been appreciated but I bow to 
the Chair.
<P>
	The current compensation or remuneration for one member of 
Parliament is: a taxable salary of $64,400; a tax free expense 
allowance of $21,300, which is equivalent to a pre-tax value of 
$42,000; a tax free travel status allowance of $6,000; and tax free 
benefits as follows: free VIA Rail pass, free personal long distance 
telephone calls, free health and dental package, free parking at 
office and airports, free air travel for families, free life insurance 
policy which includes spouse and dependent children, free second 
language lessons, a severance of $32,000 when defeated or retired, 
a re-entry or reallocation payment of $9,000 when defeated or 
retired, plus the lucrative double standard obscene MP pension 
plan for a six-year member worth between $500,000 to $4.5 
million depending upon the years of service and valued at $28,400 
per year by the independent consulting group Sobeco, Ernst &amp; 
Young in February 1994. These benefits do not take into 
consideration the cost of householders, ten percenters, stationery, 
copying mail, and the list goes on.
<P>
	It works out to at least $1 million a year for each member of the 
House based on the overhead and everything else charged to the 
taxpayers. Multiply this by six and we have a cost of $6 million.
<P>
	We should not forget to kick in the cost of increased elections 
and redistributing the ridings, which the Liberals have estimated at 
$5.6 million. The bill is in the $12 million ballpark. It is a $12 
billion bill and the MP pension plan is supposed to save the country 
$3 million. Now they are going to blow $12 million. What is the net 
difference? They will increase the overhead of the country by $9 
million.

<P>
<B>(1100 ) </B>
<P>
	We are $550 billion in debt and the government continues to 
spend money like it grows on trees. How can the Liberal 
government possibly defend the House of Commons' growing to 
301 members? We all know we do not need more members in the 
House. There is not enough room to put in six more chairs.
<P>
	Was it not the greatest classic Liberal of all, Thomas Jefferson, 
who said government governs best that governs least? It now 
appears the principle has been lost by the Liberals.
<P>
	Let me compare Canada with the state of California which has 
roughly 30 million people. Canada has 29 million people. 
California is run on a federal level by 52 congressmen, two 
senators, one governor and one president; 56 federal officials to 
govern that state.
<P>
	In Canada we have 295 members and we want to go to 301. We 
have 104 senators and it could go to 112. We have over 400 federal 
elected officials running the country. Are American politicians 
smarter than Canadian politicians? Do the Americans have a better 
system than the Canadian system?
<P>
	We each represent on average between 80,000 and 100,000 
people. One American congressman represents 570,000 and yet the 
Liberals cry and complain about the huge ridings they have when 
they contain 120,000 people. I do not understand that. What is so 
special about American politicians? I believe we are as competent. 
I believe we can represent more people. I believe the key is 
naturally we would have to hire more staff.
<P>
	However, I will guarantee one thing, staff will cost the country 
and the taxpayers a heck of a lot less money in salaries than an MP 
costs and it would create more jobs at the $30,000, $40,000 and 
$50,000 levels than the half a million dollar level for MPs.
<P>
	Do we not have the intelligence to do what the Americans have 
done? Do we not have the technology to have representation by 
population with a higher population base?
<P>
	In defence of his gun control registry system which he 
introduced yesterday, the justice minister used the new technology 
argument. Why can we not use the new technology argument for 
democracy, for Parliament for the size and the number of 
politicians?
<P>
	If the United States used the same proportion of representation 
as in Canada there would be 2,900 congressmen, 2,900 members of 
Parliament. That is embarrassing. That is how disproportionate we 
are. I believe we are ten times worse off politically than the United 
States because we will not stick to the principle that a government 
governs best that governs least.
<P>
	The Liberal Party pretends to be fiscally conscientious but when 
confronted with an opportunity to show leadership to lower the 
overhead and the cost of running the country it chooses instead to 
increase the size of government.
<P>
	The finance minister has waxed eloquent numerous times, I 
think his next career is that of a stand up comic, about downsizing 
and reducing the cost of government. In Ottawa Canadians still 
have a big, fat, high spending government. Why not downsize the 
House of Commons?
<P>
	The government talks out of one side of its mouth about laying 
off over 40,000 civil servants in the name of restraint, in the name 
of fiscal responsibility. Out of the other side of its mouth it talks 
about the need to bring in six more MPs to help achieve that fiscal 
restraint. Is that not a contradiction? Is that not an oxymoron? I 
cannot believe it; increase the size of the Commons, make it big, 
keep the backbenchers happy.
<P>
	I hear some heckling from the other side. That person is so far 
from the centre of power in his own party that last night while we 
were voting he was told not to vote because they had enough people 
to beat the Reform votes. That is democracy at its best. It shows we 
need fewer people in the House. These backbenchers are willing to 
let cabinet control things.
<P>
	The Liberals refuse to consider more effective approaches 
proposed by Reform to accommodate shifting, growing 
populations. Should the House be downsized from 295 to 265 
members we would have a reasonably sized House. We would have 
members of Parliament who would represent larger groups of 
people and therefore have some leverage. The backbencher who 
keeps heckling me would have more power, more impact in the 
House if there were only 200 people here, not 301. These members 
would truly have some value and some input into what is 
happening, some power to check and balance cabinet's dictating.
<P>
<B>(1105) </B>
<P>
	Someone says why not quit. I would. I do not agree with career 
politicians. I do not believe what these people do here. They come 
back just to qualify for their gold plated fat cat pension plan instead 
of governing the country. That is what is wrong with this place.
<P>
	The reality in this fish bowl is all those red little fish swimming 
around with the yellow little fish and the blue little fish, all these 
people, except for the 20 people who sit around the Prime Minister, 
are just biding their time. All they are doing is costing the country a 
heck of a lot of money and they are just a mouthpiece for the centre 
of power which is a freely elected dictatorship.
<P>
	Reformers believe the time has come to reduce the House and set 
a fixed number. If the size is continually expanded to match 
population increases the House eventually will reach unmatchable 
proportions with unsustainable overhead costs. We will have to cap 
it eventually. Why not now? I do not mean cap in the sense of a 
fixed number that has to be there because I understand the 
Constitution and I know the commitments that have been made to 
provinces vis-à-vis senators, the senator clause, the Senate clause. 
We cannot have fewer MPs in a province than senators. Therefore  
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13890"> 13890 </A></B>
<P>
we need a clause that allows us to expand. I understand and accept 
that.
<P>
	The answer to population growth is not to increase the numbers 
of representatives in the House of Commons but to periodically 
redraw the boundaries and redistribute seats according to the 
population shifts, reapportionment.
<P>
	That is representation by population and that is a very important 
principle. The principle that one MP can represent only 100,000 
people versus 150,000, 120,000 or 200,000 is the principle I am 
asking the House to accept. I am challenging the House to accept 
more people to represent and hire more staff. Overall that would be 
less of a cost to the country than adding more MPs. That is 
representation by population. We cannot have that because the 
urban centres would control and rule the country. We need the 
balance between urban and rural areas and 10 provinces across the 
country with another body, with another House. It is called a 
Senate.
<P>
	The concentration and the thrust should be a triple E Senate, an 
elected Senate so it has some empowerment, so it can be held 
accountable; an equal Senate whether in terms of so many for each 
province or we look at five regions, Atlantic Canada, Quebec, 
Ontario, the prairies and British Columbia, and have an equal 
number of senators on that basis. The country sadly and dearly 
needs regional representation.
<P>
	The gun control bill was born and bred and brought to the House 
from the heart of Toronto by the justice minister, not reflecting the 
true wishes of all of Canada and all Canadians. It was pitting the 
rurals and urbans against each other. If we had an elected, equal and 
effective Senate with some powers it could send it back and say it 
might be good for the little heartland of Toronto and the Ontario 
little area there but it is not what the rest of Canada wants. Fix this 
bill, change it. It is not acceptable in this form.
<P>
	It could not overturn money bills but on other bills in terms of 
effectiveness it could improve things because it would be in touch 
with its constituents. It would be paid to listen to those people. 
Why would it be accountable? It would be elected by those people 
and if it did not represent them its members would be kicked out. 
That is why an elected Senate would be effective. That is why 
giving the Senate some powers would be good for the country. That 
is why equality is important so we are fair and treat each other with 
respect across this land from sea to sea.
<P>
	Only a triple E Senate can balance the interests of less populous 
provinces with those of more populous provinces in Parliament. 
Reformers believe the time has come to bring financial 
responsibility to government, not to make government bigger.
<P>
<B>(1110 ) </B>
<P>
	I plead with my fellow colleagues in the House to apply their 
common sense and represent the common sense of the common 
people and do what is in their best interest.
<P>
	If we had to go from 301 to 200 or if we reduced the size of the 
House of Commons the people who would be here representing the 
country would be more effective. They would have more power. It 
would be more beneficial for Canadians.
<P>
	Politicians have to be accountable to the people of Canada and 
trusted to handle their money. More faces and more people in the 
House sucking more money out of the purse strings will not 
improve the system. It will detract from the system. It will cost the 
country more and more money.
<P>
	We all know what it is like in committees. We all know what it is 
like when we want to make decisions. When we want to rule by 
committee or draft a document by committee we all know how hard 
it is. We all know how hard it is to build consensus. We all know 
how hard it is even within our parties to get everybody to agree. 
Why increase the number of people we want to include in that 
decision making process when we know the number we have 
already is hard enough? Why increase the problem? Why add to the 
problem?
<P>
	Why not fix the problem by having fewer people to make those 
decisions? The decisions will be better. There would be more time 
for debate instead of the silly games that have been played for this 
past week and last night starting with the government's time 
allocation on important bills that affect the country, basically 
attacking the principles of democracy by limiting the freedom of 
speech. We would not have to do the things we do to give ourselves 
the opportunity to stand up on the floor of the House to talk to the 
Canadian people whether they are physically here or watching on 
television or reading it in the paper. It would give us the 
opportunity to explain things. We would not have to play these 
games.
<P>
	We all know how the structure is in here. One has to be 
government. Therefore the minority of the House is already 
neutralized. If one is not in cabinet one gets a parliamentary 
secretary position. If one does not get that then one gets a 
chairmanship of a standing committee. After that everybody else is 
just fill him in, do him in. The reward for attending committee 
work is interparliamentary travel, one of those great eight 
associations that will really help the country and really does the 
country a lot of good because we are learning, giving and 
establishing contacts. The people who go out there to make those 
contacts, those backbenchers who are meeting these people in 
Europe, Asia, China and France come back here and the cabinet 
ministers do not even talk to them. They do not even ask them what 
was said. There is no authority there.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13891"> 13891 </A></B>
<P>
	Why do we not smarten up in the House and get ourselves 
doing things better and differently? This system has to change. 
While the Liberals are politically selling a lean, mean 
government, their rhetoric I guess, they are trying to increase 
the size of the House of Commons, which will cost a lot of 
money.
<P>
	The cutbacks we are talking about do not affect the people in the 
ivory towers. With Bill C-68 the ivory tower is still hiring. The 
ivory tower is the government. The cabinet and the Prime Minister 
have the opportunity to fix what is wrong in the country but party 
discipline is the same old way.
<P>
	There was a newspaper article today about what was said in 
caucus. Whether it is true or not there has to be some smoke and 
fire because these journalists received from one of the 
backbenchers what was told to them by the Prime Minister. It is 
pretty bad when a Prime Minister has been alleged to have said to 
his caucus members that if they do not toe the party line their 
nomination papers will not be renewed. If they do not toe the party 
line they will not be back in the House. If they do not vote the party 
line they will be kicked off the committees and will not be allowed 
to travel. That is not leadership, that is dictatorship.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Anna Terrana (Vancouver East, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker 
The comparison between California and Canada is really 
unnecessary. It does not apply. Canada is a much larger country, the 
second largest country in the world, whereas California is a state 
and is not as large.
<P>
	My riding is in an urban area and I represent a great diversity of 
wants and needs of over 110,000 constituents. They want me to 
speak on their behalf. I imagine that a member who comes from a 
rural area has a much tougher time serving constituents because 
they live far away from each other.
<P>
<B>(1115) </B>
<P>
	I also find my colleague's tone offensive. We are not here doing 
nothing. I work very hard and I hope he does too. I know that most 
of my colleagues work very hard. Apart from the travelling which 
we have to do from the west, there is a large amount of work to do 
both here and in our ridings.
<P>
	I am a backbencher. I have no post nor am I a parliamentary 
secretary. I do not want to be any more than an effective, efficient 
member representing the constituents of my riding. I have as much 
voice in all of this as anyone else. The ministers are here for a 
purpose and have the experience.
<P>
	I have done a lot of volunteer work in the last 20 years. I have my 
integrity and my reputation and I feel offended when I am told that 
I am not doing anything in this job except keeping the seat warm. I 
do much more than that, as do my colleagues.
<P>
	I also want to comment on the gun bill. There are rural areas 
where the bill is not acceptable but the majority of people live in 
urban areas. There are two big boxes of  letters in support of the 
gun bill in my office. Those letters came from my constituents. I 
received very few letters against the bill. I received letters in 
support of the bill. We all know how much more vocal people are 
when they are against something, but the surveys showed support 
for the gun bill.
<P>
	I also want to remind my hon. colleague that we have a 
democratic system. Again, I say that the Prime Minister has been 
misquoted, unfortunately. It is not what he said. It is not up to me to 
tell my hon. colleague what to say. They are in caucus and know 
that caucus is the place where we can discuss our differences and 
our opinions. I want to set the record straight that the Prime 
Minister never said that. The Prime Minister is a very credible 
person and a great leader.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Silye:</B> Madam Speaker, it is too bad the hon. member feels 
offended. I must have struck a nerve. I sense a lot of guilt, as if she 
were trying to justify the fact that the way she works as an MP is 
doing a lot of good in her constituency.
<P>
	I know we all work hard. I do not question whether she works 
hard. That is not the question. The question is: What are the results 
she is achieving? What has she accomplished? That can be a matter 
of opinion. She works hard. At what? What impact has she had in 
her constituency? What has she done better than the person she 
replaced or is she just doing the same old thing?
<P>
	I know what I do in my riding. I know the job I have to do 
administratively. I know what we have to do to help constituents 
solve their problems. However, there must be other reasons for 
being here.
<P>
	She cannot understand my point about the fact that we freely 
elected a dictatorship over there. She chooses to kowtow to it and 
praise it and deny that the Prime Minister said something, when 
everyone in Canada knows he did. Everyone in Canada knows that 
the party discipline which is represented by a 30-year politician 
like the Prime Minister is a habit that cannot be broken. The 
situation is that they are trying to defend something which is not in 
the best interests of the country.
<P>
	If she had her ear to the ground in her constituency she would 
know that there are differences of opinion between rural and urban 
ridings. She knows that not everyone in this room, even if we are in 
the same party, can vote the same way on every issue.
<P>
<B>(1120 ) </B>
<P>
	Also on a non-partisan basis she should be willing to discuss an 
issue like free votes in the House of Commons. On what basis 
could she vote against the so-called party line? That is not even 
being considered by this government, whereas this party made that 
an election campaign promise.
<P>

<P>
	I ran because the member of Parliament for Calgary Centre 
while in government never once in any of his householders 
asked me as a constituent what I thought about the GST, what 
I thought about free trade, what I thought about any of the issues 
being discussed. He never asked me once but he kept sending 
me householders, photo opportunities: Have a nice Christmas; 
we are doing a great job; this is what we are doing in Ottawa 
for you; this is how things are going to get better for you; this 
is why it is important to send me to Ottawa because this is all 
the stuff I am doing for you.
<P>
	I vowed to people door to door that I would represent Calgary in 
Ottawa, not Ottawa to Calgary. Within this Reform Party I have 
been able to do that. We have a mechanism where we do toe the 
party line, where we do discuss in caucus all bills and motions and 
what our position should be. We match it against our blue book 
policy. We match it against our election platform, what we 
promised the Canadian people in order to get elected. We stay true 
to those two. For any bills and motions that come to our caucus that 
are covered under those two areas, we then vote the way we 
promised.
<P>
	The Liberals promised gun control but they never ever promised 
a national registration system. They brought it in. It was not in our 
platform or blue book policy. Therefore, we were obligated to 
make a decision for ourselves and to find out what our constituents 
might want. We did that in various ways and forms. The position of 
our caucus was to be against it. It is a bad bill. It is a terrible bill. I 
am against it personally.
<P>
	I distributed a householder in January in Calgary Centre telling 
constituents about the good and bad aspects of this bill and about 
my position. I did a poll in which 53 per cent said to vote in favour 
of it, but the government poll said 70 per cent of Canadians wanted 
it. I knew there was a difference of opinion.
<P>
	I said on talk shows and working with constituents as I am sure 
the member who asked me the question did as well that during that 
time I received some more input and feedback. After we knew what 
the amendments would be and what the justice minister was 
prepared to change in this bill knowing there were some flaws I did 
a scientific poll. The results were balanced with 50:50 male to 
female, with 21 per cent gun owners in the urban heart of Calgary, 
Calgary Centre with high density population.
<P>
	I was able to do something members in that party could not. 
There were quite a few who voted against the bill, nine of them, 
and they are going to be disciplined. That is why the finger was 
pointing at caucus on Wednesday by the Prime Minister. That is 
why the lecture was given, notwithstanding whether the quotes are 
right or wrong.
<P>
	What is wrong is that the democratic system is not working when 
a party muzzles its own duly, freely elected representatives that are 
paid to be here to expressly represent their constituents and they are 
told not to vote. They are not even allowed to get up to vote if  
enough members have voted already to beat what is in the House. 
That is shameful and unacceptable. That is what I am fighting 
against. That may be offensive to the hon. member and she may 
feel indignation at my comments but I firmly believe I am on the 
right side of the issue.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Fewchuk:</B> Madam Speaker, on a point of order. I believe the 
hon. member across the way is speaking about something that has 
nothing to do with electoral boundaries.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> I am afraid the hon. 
member's time has expired in any event.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ed Harper (Simcoe Centre, Ref.):</B> Madam Speaker, I am 
very pleased to be participating in this debate today on Bill C-69. 
Here we are talking about adding politicians to this place.
<P>
<B>(1125 ) </B>
<P>
	My colleague from Calgary Centre said it so well. If we went 
down the street and asked 10 voters if they would support having 
more politicians in this place, I am sure we would get 10 very 
resounding noes with comments like what planet are we living on 
or where have we been. Here we are and in fact we are debating 
exactly that which flies in the face of everything we have been 
hearing from the Canadian voter.
<P>
	I wonder where our priorities are when we are spending time 
talking about legislation that is so self-serving. This legislation is 
all about: What are my chances of being re-elected? This is the 
we-me syndrome, what is in it for me. That is what this is all about: 
I want to protect my kingdom; how does it affect my riding; how 
does it affect my chances of being re-elected?
<P>
	It does not have the concern about what is best for the 
hardpressed taxpayers of this country. It does not take into 
consideration what the taxpayers of this country indeed want. It is 
the we-me syndrome: I have got to look after myself, never mind 
what the voters of Canada want.
<P>
	We are ignoring the deficit and the debt which was the number 
one issue when we campaigned. In the Ontario election the polls 
indicated it is still the number one issue. Instead of that, here we 
are debating adding more MPs. In fact, there is a good case to be 
made for the fact that more is not better because the deficit and the 
debt have been increasing. In the last year the debt has gone up by 
$100 million. Here we are debating this issue and we are looking at 
$550 billion of debt. We are going into the hole $1,036 per second 
and we sit here fiddling about boundary lines and adding more 
people which I suggest will add to this debt.
<P>
	What about employment? What about creating jobs, the jobs 
which are so desperately needed? What about the criminal justice 
system, the system that is not working and a system which 
Canadians are demanding to be overhauled? What about our social 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13893"> 13893 </A></B>
<P>
programs? The threat  to those social programs is the deficit and 
debt and the interest payments on that debt.
<P>
	What never ceases to amaze me is that bill after bill, debate after 
debate from the other side reinforces the fact that government 
members are just not listening to the Canadian people. Whether 
they are not listening or it is selective hearing, they are absolutely 
not responding to what Canadians are asking for and in fact are 
demanding. They do not understand the change which has taken 
place over the years. The politics of 30 years ago, which 
unfortunately is still directing the group across the aisle, do not 
work any more.
<P>
	Canadians are going to have no part of it any more. The 
Canadian voters have said very loudly and very clearly: ``We want 
politicians in Ottawa who are representing us. We want to have a 
voice in Ottawa because obviously what you people have been 
doing over the years has not worked. We are deeper in debt than we 
have ever been and we are getting fewer services for more dollars 
than ever before''. The old style politics of we know best, we know 
what is best for the mindless masses just is not working any longer.
<P>
	I want to congratulate those government members who have 
stood up and represented the people in their ridings. That was 
courageous. I was absolutely appalled when I heard what was 
supposedly said by the Prime Minister. I do not know his exact 
words. He complimented the ones who changed their position and 
stayed with the party. He said that it took courage not to buck him. 
What about the courage it took to buck the leader and vote with the 
people who sent them here to Ottawa? That is where the real 
courage was. Those people should have been complimented. They 
should understand that.
<P>
	That is the message from the voters. They want politicians to 
represent them in Ottawa, not to listen to the party line. That is the 
curse of this place: Do what you are told. We saw that last night. I 
could not believe the display in this House. Members were being 
told not to vote: Party over people, do not stand up and vote, we 
have got the numbers. Those members are not going to be recorded 
in some of those votes. They were here but they did not stand up to 
vote yea or nay.
<P>
	How can they justify that in their conscience? We are taking the 
salary. We are sent here to do a job. Here we are ignoring the voters 
and responding to one person, the whip. Do as you are told, fall into 
line or else.
<P>
	There is a double standard here that I am sure has not escaped 
members on the other side. They are being disciplined and whipped 
into shape for doing what is right, for representing their voters. 
Then we have the Minister of Canadian Heritage, who violates this 
trust. He invites a group to a dinner and there are political pay-offs, 
but there is no reprimand, that is all right. It does not matter about 
the appearance of a possible conflict here. It is okay.
<P>
<B>(1130) </B>
<P>
	The double standard has to be very confusing to the other 
members of the government, and it certainly is confusing to the 
public and to the staff in the minister's department.
<P>
	What we had here last night was a charade. As a member of the 
Reform Party, I was appalled at what I saw. With 205 new members 
elected to this place, the message was: ``We want change''. You can 
look at it as either 205 new members were voted in or 205 old 
members were thrown out. Either way, the message remains the 
same: ``We want change''.
<P>
	Perhaps part of the problem over there is that the government 
thinks it won the election. Its members actually think they won the 
election. I would suggest that they did not win the election; the 
Conservatives lost the election. And the Canadian voters are still 
looking for a party that will represent them. Day after day they are 
not getting it. I suggest that the day of reckoning is coming in 1997, 
because those members who are not listening will be replaced with 
members who will.
<P>
	What the voters have asked us to do is look at the old ways. ``We 
do not care if that is the way you have been doing it for years. It has 
not worked. We want some change. We want some fresh thinking in 
this place. Do not kowtow to the party line. Listen to us. Listen to 
the common sense of the common people. The message is we want 
less government, we want more efficient government''. That is not 
what this bill gives them, or even addresses.
<P>
	The Reform Party on the other hand has a vision. We are looking 
ahead. We are listening to voters. We are going to question the old 
ways. I am very proud that we are. The windows and doors need to 
be opened. Let us look at the way we have been doing things. There 
has to be a better way because what we have been doing has not 
worked. The country has never been further apart as a complete 
country and we have never been deeper in debt. Very obviously, 
something is wrong. It is broke. It needs to be fixed. Let us get that 
message across.
<P>
	There is a good argument to be made for quality, not quantity. 
There is absolutely no basis or justification for increasing the size 
of this House. Reform proposed a 10 per cent reduction in 
members. We said we can do this job with fewer people, and there 
is no doubt that we can. In our proposal, Ontario would lose some 
seats. I would suggest that Ontario is prepared to accept that, 
because the voters in Ontario know that we have too much 
government. We are overgoverned. They are quite prepared for 
less.
<P>
	In going from 301 to 273 we could reduce the number of 
members by 28. I heard a figure of approximately $1 million to 
keep a member in this House. If that is right, we are looking at a 
saving of $28 million a year, a significant amount of money. And it 
works two ways: We will reduce the cost to the taxpayer, and I 
would suggest we will do a better job in running the business here.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13894"> 13894 </A></B>
<P>
	More does not mean better. That has just been proved by the 
statistics that came out from StatsCanada today. Those stats 
have proved that more taxes mean fewer dollars in the pockets 
of the average family. In 1989 the average family income was 
$46,000, and because of this increased government and the 
increased taxes that has now dropped to $43,000. So the average 
family income has declined by $3,000. There is a very clear 
example that more means less and does not improve the 
situation. We are overgoverned.
<P>
	You can look at Australia. It was mentioned earlier that Australia 
would double the number of voters per member for Canada. 
Germany has about two and a half times the voters per member, 
and just south of the border the United States has five times the 
voters per member. So you can certainly justify reducing the 
number of members we have in this House.
<P>
<B>(1135 ) </B>
<P>
	We just had an Ontario election in which one item in the 
common sense revolution was to reduce the size of the legislature. 
They wanted to take a 25 per cent reduction. That common sense 
revolution was overwhelmingly supported by the majority of 
people in Ontario based on that: less government, more efficient 
government. More does not mean better. We can do a better job.
<P>
	In talking about the Ontario election, the common sense 
revolution would do away with MP pensions and let members look 
after their own pensions and get out of the taxpayers' pockets. We 
have not got that message here in Ottawa. We just changed the gold 
plated pension plan to a platinum. We did a little bit of scraping. 
But I suggest it is not going to sit well with the Canadian voter and 
it will be a major issue in the next federal election.
<P>
	Reference was made to the gun control legislation that has been 
rammed through. You have to vote the party line and never mind 
what the people in your riding say. They say that in the red book 
they said they would do this. There is nothing in the red book about 
registration. The red book did talk about getting tough with the 
criminal use of firearms, but there is nothing in there about 
registration.
<P>
	The voters in Ontario sent a very strong message, but it will be 
missed. All others have. I am sure this one will go right over the 
heads of the Liberals and they will continue to miss it. The voters 
of Ontario said they want a government that will listen, they want 
less government. But it has been ignored, and the Liberals will pay 
dearly for it in the next election.
<P>
	There are some members opposite who have been listening to the 
voters. I would just like to quote some from the earlier debate. I 
will go back to Bill C-18, the debate we had in March 1994. I 
believe it was the solicitor general who said: ``Since Confederation 
the number of seats in the House of Commons has increased 
steadily, from 181 in 1867 to the current level of 295. If new rules 
had not been adopted some years ago the  number of members by 
now would be more than 340. This is something we should be 
considering''. Amen. I think that is right on.
<P>
	There was the member for Halton-Peel, and I quote from the 
debate: ``If one looks at Australia, for example, there are about 
twice as many voters per member in that country. We are at the 
point where we have to make some changes. Either that or we are 
going to have to knock out one of the walls''. Right on. This House 
is full. There is no more room.
<P>
	The parliamentary secretary to the minister of public works: ``In 
the 34th Parliament I had suggested that perhaps this Parliament 
should look at the possibility of significantly reducing the number 
of MPs. Would this not be an opportunity to see whether we could 
do with one-quarter or perhaps one-third fewer MPs?'' What fresh 
thinking. Right on. There is some hope over there. There is a germ 
of common sense.
<P>
	The Liberal member for Carleton-Gloucester, and I quote: ``Is 
this room not getting a little crowded, and has our national and 
public debt not grown so much that we should act to curb their 
growth?'' Right on again. At a saving of possibly $28 million a 
year, there could be substantial improvement in reducing our debt 
and deficit and at the same time doing a better job for the Canadian 
taxpayer.
<P>
	Just to go back to the bill and looking at some of the amendments 
that have been proposed by the Senate, there are some that we can 
support, like the one that will reduce the allowable deviation from 
the provincial electoral quota from 25 per cent to 15 per cent. We 
proposed that and we can support it. It will help equalize the voting 
power between constituencies within a province.
<P>
	We can support the requirement that the two non-judicial 
commission members be resident in the province for which the 
commission is established. That makes good, common sense.
<P>
	There are some amendments in there that have been proposed by 
the Senate that we can support. However, in what we are debating 
here today, unfortunately we are wasting a lot of time and failing to 
deal with the real issues and the real problems the country is facing.
<P>
<B>(1140 ) </B>
<P>
	In closing, I heard the other day that the number of people who 
are watching this parliamentary channel has tripled in this 35th 
Parliament. I was really encouraged by that, because what it says is 
that the Canadian people are watching what is going on here. They 
are watching and they are listening. That is good news, because 
they are not just taking what is necessarily recorded in the press as 
being the gospel but they are watching what is being said and done 
here. They are watching those votes. They are watching those 
members who had the courage to stand up and represent the people 
in their ridings. They know the ones who were told to sit down and 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13895"> 13895 </A></B>
<P>
do as they were told. I will tell you that is exactly not what the  
Canadian voters want from their elected members at this time.
<P>
	I am encouraged when I discover that the viewing audience has 
tripled. I think the viewing audience is going to triple again as we 
get closer to the election and the Canadian voters realize what has 
been going on in this place.
<P>
	The arrogance toward the voters perhaps can be partly explained 
by this leading in the polls. That is pretty heady stuff: We can do no 
wrong; look where we are in the polls.
<P>
	I would suggest that is a very artificial number to base their 
popularity on. They should look to Ontario, because it was a very 
good indication of how wrong that can be. It was their own party 
that was leading in the polls in that province, in Ontario. When the 
rubber hit the road, when they got down to talking about the issues, 
it was just blown away. That is what it is all about today: it is the 
issues and who is best addressing those issues and who is listening 
to the voters.
<P>
	I suggest to you that day after day we are seeing that this 
government is not listening. It is still the same old: ``We know best. 
Listen to your leader. Do not worry about the voters''. That is the 
tragedy for them. It is our salvation, because it is going to ensure a 
government that will be elected in 1997 that is truly listening to the 
people. I suggest that is going to be the Reform government.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Carolyn Parrish (Mississauga West, Lib.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I was in my office watching the TV and shouting at it and 
decided I might as well come over here and ask the members 
opposite the questions I was shouting at my television set.
<P>
	I am rather amazed at their lack of knowledge of the bill, since 
they are here to save the country money and they are here to be 
representing the people and they are here to be efficient.
<P>
	The old boundary system was cobbled together by a bunch of 
dinosaurs called Tories, who are now sitting in the Senate trying to 
block legislation. They have another set of dinosaurs who are 
helping them in the process.
<P>
	There are three things in this bill that I would like the hon. 
member opposite to respond to on a very practical basis. When we 
have these public meetings to look at the electoral boundary 
drawings, people go to these meetings and they have absolutely no 
knowledge of what happens when they change part of the boundary 
in the current system.
<P>
	I was on the committee that designed the new system. I come 
from a riding with 250,000 people and it has not been changed in 
10 years. Ten years ago it had 88,000 people. When these people go 
in and they are supposed to give intelligent responses to the way the 
boundaries are drawn, they have no idea what happens to the 
population within those boundaries when they move them to take in 
a community of interest.
<P>
	This bill gives three alternatives with the numbers of people in 
each of those three alternatives and it gives the rationale for 
picking the one the riding commission picked. This is 
representation in an intelligent way, rather than some sort of 
chaotic magical way.
<P>
	The other thing it does is that it says it will be redistributed every 
five years instead of every ten. So you will not have a member 
standing here who yells at television sets because she is 
overworked with 250,000 people. And it will be 300,000 before the 
next election. How do the members opposite respond to that?
<P>
	In this bill, it says there will be no redistribution in provinces 
that have not had a remarkable change in population. This is really 
a cost saver, because the old system had a commission appointed, it 
had all kinds of bureaucrats appointed, and they had all kinds of 
wheels turning when it was not necessary.
<P>
	I would like the member opposite to specifically respond to 
those three questions and not give me great long speeches about the 
way we are running the government.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Harper (Simcoe Centre):</B> Madam Speaker, I am really 
pleased that the hon. member opposite stopped shouting at her TV 
set and came down to face the real world. I wish more members 
would face the real world and stop sitting there yelling at TV sets. 
Those members are not listening and getting involved in the 
process.
<P>
<B>(1145) </B>
<P>
	The member's first question dealt with the ignorance of the 
public, that the public came to the meetings and did not know 
anything. That is a major mistake. The member is underestimating 
just how smart the voters are. The member does them a disservice 
when she makes remarks like that. She thinks that most people 
came to those meetings without knowing anything; the voters are 
mindless out there and need our direction, that we have to get into 
the system and help explain life to them. I suggest to the member 
opposite that they are a lot smarter than she ever gives them credit 
for being.
<P>
	The system was not changed because of any hue and cry from the 
public. The system was changed because some self-serving 
politicians on that side of the House said: ``It is going to hurt my 
chances of getting re-elected''. That is what we are talking about 
here. The voters did not ask for this. The backbenchers on the 
government side did. Their kingdom was threatened. The member 
may not have said this but many did say: ``This is a threat to my 
kingdom and I have to do something about it. Let us scrap this $5 
million that we have wasted of the taxpayers' money and let us 
redo it all so that I can be looked after here and have a chance of 
getting re-elected''.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13896"> 13896 </A></B>
<P>
	I suggest to the House that regardless of where the boundaries 
are drawn, the member will not get re-elected because she is 
not listening to the Canadian voter.
<P>
	Members talk about the number of voters and how they can 
represent only a certain number of voters. The boundaries can be 
adjusted to reduce the members of Parliament. I am not saying we 
have to stay with the same boundary lines. Changes can be made to 
accommodate shifts in the population. I used the example of 
Australia where it has double the voters. The United States has five 
times what we have here and it is not having any real problems. The 
argument for quantity just does not wash. Quality is what we need 
here, not quantity. More is not better.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Ablonczy:</B> More people for the Prime Minister to threaten.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Harper (Simcoe Centre):</B> More people for the Prime 
Minister to whip into line, to do as they are told, to not represent 
the people in their ridings.
<P>
	Let us get away from this charade. We are talking about doing 
something that is demanded by the voters and not something that is 
going to ensure the re-election of the people on the other side.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Alex Shepherd (Durham, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, I will 
give you a perfect example that backbenchers are still allowed to 
speak in the House.
<P>
	I listened with interest to the hon. member for Simcoe Centre. 
When I listen to the Reform Party I come to one conclusion: simple 
solutions for complex problems. I too have some concern about 
this bill. When I went back and studied it, I discovered that there 
was an agreement with the provinces in 1985 which would have to 
be broken to address the concerns of some, mine included. I had an 
idea that we could freeze the numbers in the House.
<P>
	However, it really requires addressing the constitutional 
agreement that existed at that time. The member has not talked 
about how he is going to address that problem, how he is going to 
go to the provinces and get an agreement with the provinces to 
reduce the numbers.
<P>
	The formula would require major changes to address the concept 
of representation by population. It would require major reductions 
in both the province of Saskatchewan and the province of 
Manitoba. If my memory serves me correctly, the province of 
Saskatchewan would lose about four seats.
<P>
	I do not hear members of the Reform Party from Saskatchewan 
standing up saying they are prepared to sustain a loss of four seats 
in the province of Saskatchewan. Let us be honest and clear about 
these things. They should tell us how they are going to reduce those 
numbers of seats and if they are prepared to lose four seats in the 
province of Saskatchewan. They should also tell us the magic 
solution they have to go back to the provinces and retrench that 
agreement that existed in 1985.
<P>
<B>(1150 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Harper (Simcoe Centre):</B> Madam Speaker, I appreciate the 
questions from the member. I want to start out with his first 
comment, simple solutions.
<P>
	I suggest that the solutions are simple. What is lacking on the 
part of the government is the guts to do what is right.
<P>
	There is nothing complex about the problems in the country 
today. What is desperately lacking is the courage and the guts it is 
going to take to do what is right and bring some fiscal sanity to the 
country.
<P>
	I should take a moment to applaud the member. He is one of the 
few who had the courage to stand up and buck the party line last 
night. He had the courage to stand up and represent the people in 
his riding and I applaud him for that.
<P>
	I will take him to task though for not watching his TV set and 
knowing that last night the member for Kindersley-Lloydminster 
said he has no problem with the reduction in the seats in 
Saskatchewan. It is not all about what is in it for me. He is looking 
at what is good for the country as a whole. We did put our money 
where our mouth is. Nobody hedged on that. The member stood up 
in the House last night and said yes, we will have to share the hurt 
right across the country.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Maurice Godin (Châteauguay, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, as I 
listen to the member for Simcoe Centre, I see that we are talking 
about the electoral map as opposed to a reduction in the number of 
seats. I see that the words or comments used approximate those of 
the Bloc. There are too many members and too much government. 
The country is over-governed and on the verge of bankruptcy. 
Running the country has become too costly and the government 
should be more efficient and less cumbersome. The number of 
seats should be trimmed by 10 per cent.
<P>
	For our part, we are merely offering to eliminate 75 seats in one 
fell swoop. Could it be that they are finally beginning to understand 
our position and that they will soon be supporting us?

<P>
	<B>Mr. Harper (Simcoe Centre):</B> Madam Speaker, the question 
from the hon. member suggested there may be 75 here who want to 
leave this place but I do not for a minute think that they represent 
the majority of the voters of the province of Quebec.
<P>
	I suggest the majority of the voters in that province do not want 
to leave Canada. They want to be represented in this place by 
politicians who are going to keep Canada together, not tear it apart 
and that will be corrected in the next election.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Werner Schmidt (Okanagan Centre, Ref.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, Bill C-69 is a very significant piece of legislation. It is an 
honour for me to follow the member for Simcoe Centre. I am 
enjoying the kind of debate that has been generated around this 
particular topic.
<P>
	I wish to look at this bill from three points of view. I want to look 
at it from the point of view of democracy, the point of view of fiscal 
responsibility and the point of view of leadership.
<P>
	Let me first speak on the first point with regard to democracy. 
The whole democratic system in Canada is represented through the 
election of representatives on the basis of the particular party they 
represent. It makes the representation a rather difficult one because 
there are three things we have to look at when we are that kind of a 
representative. We have the mandate that our party has given us. It 
represents the policies and principles which that party has 
developed in its election platform and its approach to government.
<P>
	The Reform Party has a tripod that supports the representation 
that we as Reformers will give to the House and to the people of our 
constituencies. First, we will reform the democratic system in 
Canada as it exists today. The first requirement is to represent the 
people according to their wishes and represent them to this House, 
not this House to the people.
<P>
	The second principle is that Reformers will manage the affairs of 
the country in a fiscally responsible manner. We will have a 
balanced budget. We will not spend money that we do not have. We 
will treat the money that is given to us by the taxpayers as money 
kept in trust. It ought to be treated at least as well as any personal 
money we would spend. In some cases we should treat it more 
significantly and with greater respect than if it is our own.
<P>
<B>(1155) </B>
<P>
	The third principle of the mandate the Reform Party has given us 
is that we want our streets to be safe. We want the property and 
lives of individuals to be secure. Men, women and children should 
be able to walk down the streets with impugnity, not in fear of 
being attacked. To that end, we want to reform the criminal justice 
system.
<P>
	That is the first duty of a Reform representative. It is the 
mandate. We told the people that we would represent them, be 
fiscally responsible and reform the justice system.
<P>
	A second part in the representation is this. The people have 
trusted us to represent the Reform Party because of certain talents, 
abilities and their confidence in us. They expect us to exercise our 
best judgment concerning the problems and issues that will face 
this country at any given time. We will act in the best interests of 
the people we represent as we understand them and not in our 
personal interests. That is significant.
<P>
	There is a third area in which we want to represent the people. It 
is on certain moral issues such as capital punishment. We would 
conduct a referendum in which we want them to cast their ballot on 
an issue, yes or no.
<P>
	There are three very distinct aspects to the business of 
representation and Reformers want to be true to all three of them. It 
does not make the task easy. It makes it a very responsible one, an 
accountable one where we can stand before the people and say: 
``This is what we stand for. This is the judgment we will apply and 
we want you to have a voice on the issues that affect you directly 
and significantly on a day to day basis''. In a democratic system it 
is the first thing we will do.
<P>
	It also means we listen to the people. The people told us one 
thing about the size of the government. They told us it is too big. It 
is too big in numbers of representatives and too big in the way it 
intrudes into the lives of the people, whether in business, families, 
our communities. No matter where it is, government is all 
pervasive. The people told us they wanted less government.
<P>
	The bill flies in the face of that observation. The bill says more 
MPs, there should be 301 MPs, not 295. The hon. member across 
the way suggests this is a sermon. This is the most accurate 
position in terms of democracy. If the member does not understand 
that, he had better learn to listen to the difference between fact and 
simple statements.
<P>
	That is the problem the Liberals have. They make all kinds of 
statements but where is the action on those statements?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Forseth:</B> What do the people want?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Schmidt:</B> We only need one member on that side of the 
House, the Prime Minister. All they do over there is listen to what 
the Prime Minister says. He tells them what they will do, when they 
will do it, how they will do it and sometimes he explains why they 
should do it: ``Because I said so''. That is not democracy. On that 
basis we could reduce the size of the House rather dramatically.
<P>
	One other point has to be recognized. If the government is going 
to start listening to the people and if it is going to demonstrate what 
is said in the bill, that it is actually going to consult with the people, 
I ask the government with whom will it consult?
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13898"> 13898 </A></B>
<P>
	I want to read from the bill that is currently before us. It talks 
about a community of interest.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Forseth:</B> You are making the Liberals squirm now.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Schmidt:</B> I quote clause 19(5) of the bill:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>For the purposes of paragraph 2(b), ``community of interest'' includes such 
factors as the economy, existing or traditional boundaries of electoral districts, 
the urban or rural characteristics of a territory, the boundaries of municipalities 
and Indian reserves, natural boundaries and access to means of communication 
and transport.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>(1200) </B>
<P>
	That is a good phrase. That is a good section. That means the 
interests of the people should be paramount.
<P>
	However, there are other provisions in the bill which make us 
wonder whether they really mean that. When it gets into the 
business of consulting with people there seems almost to be a 
blockage. The boundaries commissions which are asked to do the 
redrawing of the boundaries are required to hold at least one 
hearing per province.
<P>
	That is an insult to the large provinces like Quebec, Ontario and 
British Columbia. One hearing will actually determine the 
boundaries of the municipalities, look at the economic interests, 
look at the differences between rural and urban ridings? Somebody 
in downtown Vancouver will say what the characteristics are of 
Vermilion in Alberta, in Kamloops or in Prince George? It is 
ludicrous.
<P>
	There have to be some real directions given to the commissions 
which will mean they will actually consult with the people.
<P>
	There are some interesting technicalities in the bill. In section 
21(6) there is the provision as to how one goes about making a 
presentation to the commission. This is for ordinary people, people 
who apparently do not understand anything about boundaries, 
people who do not know how they will be affected. That is an insult 
of the first order.
<P>
	There is a greater insult in here which says a commission shall, 
before completing a report, hold at least one hearing in the 
province for which the commission is established for 
representation by interested persons. Notice of that commission 
hearing must be given 60 days before the actual hearing is to take 
place and the application to appear before the commission must be 
in writing. The application must be not more than 57 days before 
the hearing. Let us examine that. The notice must be given 60 days 
before the hearing and the person may make application up to 57 
days before that date.
<P>
	Let us look at another section to see what happens. Section 22(6) 
states:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>No representation by an interested person shall be heard by a commission at a 
hearing held under this section unless notice in writing is received by the 
commission not later than seven days before the hearing is held,</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Which section will apply? In one instance it can be three days 
before the hearing but in the other it cannot happen unless it has 
been at least seven days. That is an inconsistency.
<P>
	We have a person who wants to make a representation and he 
reads one of those sections of the bill. He has to read more than one 
section to find out how he goes about actually notifying the 
commission that he wants to make a presentation.
<P>
	Another principle of democracy has been violated. There were 
amendments to the bill presented by the Senate. The Senate is not 
an elected body. It is an appointed body by none other than the 
Prime Minister. The Senate in this case has stopped the legislation. 
It has made some amendments to legislation which was created by 
people who were elected to represent the people. This is wrong in 
principle. It is a violation of what I have learned democracy should 
be. Our tradition and our Constitution says the Senate has this kind 
of power. Does that make it right? Does that make it just? I submit 
it does not.
<P>
<B>(1205) </B>
<P>
	The Reform Party wants to reform the democratic system. One 
of those reformations is to have an elected Senate, to make sure 
those persons in the second Chamber do represent the people.
<P>
	There is a very valuable service and function for the second 
Chamber to perform in this House, to provide sober second thought 
which it did in this case. It did make some amendments that were 
very useful and that we can support. That is good and shows the 
upper house can be an important part of the democratic process but 
it ought to be elected, just like the House of Commons. I certainly 
hope it will be.
<P>
	The upper house ought to balance the representation that exists 
in this House. It ought to make sure the very highly and densely 
populated centres of the country are balanced against those not as 
well populated and therefore the interests of both parties can be 
served in a balanced fashion. A major reformation needs to take 
place here.
<P>
	People have said they want smaller government and also less 
intrusion in their lives. A bill will be coming before the House very 
shortly, Bill C-88. It provides in section 9 for the cabinet to 
suspend, modify or extend the application of a federal law or 
provincial law. The House and provincial legislators have the right 
to make laws. It is their responsibility. The people have elected 
them to do that.
<P>
	Within a bill coming before the House that power on certain 
issues will be taken away from the House, and deposited with the 
cabinet. That is a miscarriage of misrepresentation, a miscarriage 
of responsibility, a miscarriage of anything that I believe and 
understand about a democratic system.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13899"> 13899 </A></B>
<P>
	On the matter of fiscal responsibility, a point was made here 
recently about tradition. It seems that practice has developed 
a certain kind of tradition in the House over a number of years. 
We have had an increase in the number of MPs in the House 
and parallel with it has been an increase in the debt of the 
country.
<P>
	That kind of tradition must be broken. Other people have said we 
are a lean and mean government. I suggest they understand what 
most of those words mean. Lean, no; mean, yes but not fiscally.
<P>
	What does it mean to have a balanced budget? I came here to 
find out how we got into this deep debt. I want for the benefit of 
everybody in the House to recognize the reason we are in debt is we 
spend more than we take in. That is why we have a debt. Let us not 
have any doubt that if we are to get our fiscal house in order we 
have to get to the point of cutting and controlling our spending.
<P>
	To increase the number of representatives in the House will not 
reduce our costs. It will increase them. We can talk about the 
physical things, the everyday things like salaries, personnel, office 
space and so on but we need to look at MP pensions. This is in the 
craw of virtually every Canadian.
<P>
	We need to illustrate exactly what happens with the C twins, 
Charest and Copps, the member for Sherbrooke and the Deputy 
Prime Minister. Between these two alone-
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> I am sure the hon. member 
is well aware we do not use members' names. Rather, we use their 
title or district.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Schmidt:</B> The C twins, the member for Sherbrooke and the 
Deputy Prime Minister, between these two alone there will be a 
payout of more than $6 million if they retire and live to age 75, 
with an inflation rate of approximately 5 per cent.
<P>
	There is nothing in this bill that will in any way come to grips 
with these things. We have seen the opposite. We have seen debate 
on certain bills stopped. There is another way this new bill negates 
the work of fiscal responsibility. It will do away with the work that 
has already been done if it is passed, and the $6 million already 
spent will be gone.
<P>
<B>(1210) </B>
<P>
	Fiscally the attitude seems to be to spend, don't worry, be happy. 
We have seen how democracy works in the country with closure on 
Bill C-41, closure on Bill C-85 concerning MP pensions, closure 
on Bill C-68, the firearms legislation. In each case the government 
has stopped the debate. In each case the government has ignored 
the wishes of a large proportion of our country. Worst of all, MPs 
are being warned that not toeing the line could put their opportunity 
to stand for election on the line and it definitely puts into jeopardy 
advancement in their political careers.
<P>
	The people have told them what to stand for and they have been 
told to stand for what the Prime Minister says. In my opinion that is 
completely backward and is not the way it ought to go.
<P>
	Probably the most difficult thing for me to stomach is the 
message this is sending to our young people. The message that 
seems to be coming from the House as exhibited by a bill like Bill 
C-41 is families are old-fashioned. I know as do many members in 
the House that families are the social institution best suited for the 
transmission of values from one generation to another. They are 
where we learn such things as accountability, that freedom has a 
price and that we must be responsible for our actions, that there is 
such a thing as common decency, that there is such a thing as 
respect for another person without fear.
<P>
	It is necessary to develop courage, to have the guts to stand up to 
say what we believe and to be honest and true representatives of the 
people who have elected us to stand in their stead in this place to 
govern the affairs of the nation in a manner best suited to their 
interests, to look after their interests and not our interests.
<P>
	The government did-
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> I am sorry, the hon. 
member's time has expired. Questions and comments, the hon. 
member for Waterloo.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Andrew Telegdi (Waterloo, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, I heard 
the hon. member talk about deficit, pensions, an elected Senate, et 
cetera. He spoke very little on the bill before us. I feel compelled to 
make a few comments.
<P>
	I will say this often because I feel voters have a right to be 
reminded. Members of the third party mentioned they were to do 
politics differently and instead of mindlessly opposing all 
government legislation they would actually contribute to make it 
better. We in the Liberal Party, both new and veteran members, 
really appreciated those promises. Instead we have the sanctimony 
of previous parties replaced by the Reform Party which reminds me 
of the rise of the right wing parties in the United States.
<P>
	We have a virtual attack on every institution in the country as 
well as on every bill we put forth. I still recall the hypocrisy of the 
leader of the third party who turns in a government car and then we 
find out he has-
<P>
	<B>Mr. Morrison:</B> Madam Speaker, on a point of order, has the 
word hypocrisy when applied to an individual in the House become 
parliamentary language when I was not looking?
<P>
<B>(1215 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> This took place during the 
debate. I agree the comment could be on the iffy side. I would 
request that the member be a little more careful and that all 
members be more careful in the future.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13900"> 13900 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Telegdi:</B> Madam Speaker, I was not referring to a 
member with that word. I was referring to an action.
<P>
	Let me expand on it a bit. The Reform leader promises to do 
things differently. He makes a great show by taking the keys to a 
five-year government car and turning them back in. Then we find 
out about the situation where that party is providing the individual 
with a $30,000 suit allowance.
<P>
	We are told that on this side we are ruled by a dictatorial Prime 
Minister. Let us not forget the code of ethics the leader of the 
Reform Party was going to impose upon members of the Reform 
Party dealing with how many drinks they could have, whom they 
could have dinner with-of course not with members of the 
opposite sex-and on and on.
<P>
	Let me say that the Reform has shown itself to be a warmed up 
version of the social credit which has a long illustrious history. Let 
the Reformers say, when they attack appointments by prime 
ministers to the Senate, that the father of the present leader of the 
third party was appointed to the Senate. I have not heard criticisms 
on that.
<P>
	Be that as it may, let us look at the policies. Gun registration was 
mentioned. The fact of the matter is that this party supported gun 
registration because the people of Canada wanted it and it was good 
public policy. We are not captives of the religious right in the 
country.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Morrison:</B> Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of order. I 
wonder if the hon. member would classify a non-believer as I am 
as being part of the religious right.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> I am sorry but that is a 
matter for debate.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Telegdi:</B> Madam Speaker, much was made about doing what 
our constituents want us to do. Members of the third party repeat 
that as their mantra. That is what they are going to do. They are 
going to represent their constituents. They have 1-900 numbers 
where they encourage the public to call in to voice their views so 
they can be represented.
<P>
	Then we had some members of the Reform Party standing during 
the gun debate and saying that they did not believe in polls. The 
leader of the Reform Party said that he would not take a poll on the 
issue because it was too difficult for the public to understand. He 
made references to how support was changing but he was not going 
to listen to the constituents.
<P>
	Another bill we dealt with mentioned by the member was Bill 
C-41. It deals with trying to make sure that hate crimes are dealt 
with harshly. Of course there was no support on that.
<P>
	Let me just relate a very small incident regarding the present bill 
before us.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> I am sorry to interrupt the 
hon. member but the time for questions and comments has almost 
expired. Perhaps he would like to give the member time to respond.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Telegdi:</B> The hon. member of the Reform Party who took 
my seat on Waterloo council moved a motion that the proposed 
redistribution debate should not stand. Not only did that person do 
it, the former Reform candidate, but every municipal councillor of 
every political stripe in the regional municipality of Waterloo 
unanimously said that. That community unanimously opposed the 
proposal. That is what the bill is all about. I am glad it is addressing 
that.
<P>
<B>(1220) </B>
<P>
	How can the Reform argue against listening to communities 
representing all political stripes and being unanimous in their 
stance?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Schmidt:</B> Madam Speaker, there are three responses. First, 
it would be very beneficial for the member who has just spoken to 
read the code of ethics of Reform Party MPs. He would be rather 
severely chastised by the content of that ethics statement for the 
words he used. He needs to examine very carefully his facts before 
he makes statements such as the ones he made.
<P>
	Second, with regard to representing the people of Okanagan 
Centre, I stand here as I stand there to represent all of them whether 
or not they voted for me. The issue is not one of representing 
Reform Party members only. It never was. It is not now and it will 
not be. I was elected by the community. The member ought to be 
very careful about the kinds of statements he is making.
<P>
	With regard to the third aspect of being captive of the religious 
right, there has not been a more irresponsible statement than that 
one in the House since I was elected as a member. No religious 
right has the dominant power within or without or in support of the 
Reform Party of Canada. It represents all people to the degree that 
they identify with the principles the Reform Party stands for.
<P>
	It is for virtue and truth that the House ought to stand. That is 
what the Reform Party stands for and that is where we need to put 
our mark.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary North, Ref.):</B> Madam Speaker, 
we are debating today the amendments that have been made by the 
Senate to the boundaries redistribution bill.
<P>
	Boundaries redistribution is a way of redrawing the federal 
ridings or constituencies that we belong to as voters and in which 
we vote. We elect representatives from these ridings to the 
Canadian Parliament to represent our wishes, our interests and our 
concerns and to be our liaison with what is happening in the federal 
government. Because population shifts and growth take place from 
time to time, the boundaries of our constituencies from which we 
democratically elect representatives to govern us have to change.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13901"> 13901 </A></B>
<P>
	Politicians, especially those in government, seem to be very 
nervous about the process. The previous government delayed 
the process more than once because it did not want to put its 
members at any disadvantage by having shifts in the 
boundaries, different voters from time and time, and perhaps 
even a loss of seats if the boundaries showed there should not 
be as many seats in a province as there were. Governments have 
shown themselves to be quite reluctant to let the process go 
forward. The last redistribution was about 10 years ago, even 
though populations had grown and shifted considerably during 
that time.
<P>
	What happened when this government was elected? There was a 
process to redistribute the boundaries that had been ongoing for 
some considerable period of time. It had reached the point where 
the new boundaries had actually been pretty well drawn up by the 
commissions in each province.
<P>
	Lo and behold, government members found to their horror and 
dismay that they were disadvantaged by this democratic process. 
Their boundaries were to change. In some cases a lot of their 
ridings would disappear. The support basis they had built up would 
be interfered with. A nervous hue and cry arose from government 
members about the process that had been put into place.
<P>
	Even though the process had already consumed over five million 
tax dollars, had been properly carried out, and had pretty well been 
finished for public hearings on the recommendations, the 
government decided to do it all over again. Therefore it introduced 
Bill C-69 to start the process all over again. The process is not 
substantially different from the one that it interfered with. 
Independent commissions looked at various factors to redraw the 
riding boundaries. They will have to do that all over again if the bill 
passes. We are not quite sure why because the result will be about 
the same.
<P>
<B>(1225) </B>
<P>
	There are four problems with the bill that Canadians should 
know about and they are the reasons we are not supporting the bill.
<P>
	The first problem and the biggest problem is that the bill and the 
process that it endorses would increase the number of members of 
Parliament by six. Instead of the 295 members that we have today 
there would be 301. The growth under the bill would continue so 
that for every Parliament there would be more and more 
parliamentarians. We will be putting people in the galleries who are 
supposed to be representing constituents because there is not 
enough room down here.
<P>
	This is simply nonsense. It shows a shocking lack of sensible 
leadership by the government. It had a perfect opportunity to cap or 
diminish the number of members of Parliament. A number of my 
colleagues have spoken at length about the fact that the country is 
overgoverned and has far more representatives per capita than 
almost any other democracy. Yet somehow the Liberals are  telling 
Canadian people, with straight faces, that they need more MPs.
<P>
	For goodness' sake, why? Already government members have 
been told by the Prime Minister how they are to vote on pain of 
being expelled from the party and not being allowed to do their job 
as a representative next time around. Why do we need more 
members to be whipped into line and to stand like trained seals to 
do as they are told? How will that benefit the people of the country?
<P>
	The Reform Party put forward a very sensible proposal to 
modestly reduce the number of MPs from 295 to 273. This would 
be done on a very fair and equitable basis. I am willing to bet any 
province that loses MPs will not have a great revolt and say: ``Give 
us more MPs; we must have more MPs''. That simply will not 
happen. The country is tired of being overgoverned. It is looking 
for a little leadership, a little sensibility in the way we put together 
the House of Commons.
<P>
	As other members of my party have done, I point out that every 
member of Parliament costs at least $500,000 and probably more 
per year, not to mention the pension that is in place for these 
individuals which they collect after only six years of service until 
the date of their death.
<P>
	When seniors' pensions are being cut back, when health care 
services are being lost daily, and when unemployment insurance 
benefits are being cut back by a minimum of 10 per cent in the last 
budget, why on earth would we spend scarce dollars on more 
representatives in the House, if the 295 members we have now 
cannot get their act together and get the country into good shape?
<P>
	It simply does not make sense. I am ashamed to be part of a 
House of Commons-and I would certainly be ashamed to be part 
of a government; thank goodness I am not-that cannot do better 
than that for the people of Canada. On that basis alone this is a bad 
bill.
<P>
	The government lost a tremendous opportunity to get some sense 
and some balance back into the number of representatives and to 
spend money wisely. We need enough people to do the job but not 
ever increasing or ever expanding numbers.
<P>
	The second problem with the bill is the Liberal insistence that 
there can be a variance between the number of people in each 
riding of up to 25 per cent.

	Even the Senate was aghast at this kind of variance. That means 
some ridings will have fewer people represented than other ridings, 
up to 25 per cent. If there were twice as many people in one riding 
as another, every voter in that riding would have twice the 
democratic clout as people in the next riding which only had half 
that number of members. Here we have it almost as bad. It can be 
25 per cent more members.

	The basic principle of democracy is representation by 
population, a basic tenet of democracy.

	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> Question and comments.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Ablonczy:</B> Madam Speaker, I do not believe you were 
listening to what I said.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> I do not think it is 
necessary to accuse the Chair. I was being consulted on another 
issue.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Ablonczy:</B> I am very sorry, Madam Speaker.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> Would you please repeat 
what you said.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Ablonczy:</B> I asked for unanimous consent to delete 
Standing Orders 56 and 78.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> Is there unanimous 
consent?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> No.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> Resuming debate.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Ablonczy:</B> The third reason this bill is not a good bill and 
why we oppose it is the appointments on the commissions that 
redraw the boundaries are now not being made accountable to 
Parliament. Commissions are appointed in each province to draw 
up new boundaries as population shifts happen in each of the 
provinces. This is a very good process, one which has pretty well 
stopped the old and odious practice of gerrymandering, a problem 
in the past in a number of countries. This was even in the 1800s a 
difficulty in our democracy.
<P>
	In the 1960s the electoral boundaries redistribution commission 
was set up. It is independent of government so that the 
self-interested fingers of politicians cannot be making decisions 
about how the boundaries of our ridings and constituencies are put 
together. Since that time the political interference in the process 
has been pretty well looked after.
<P>
	The appointments to these commissions are made by the Speaker 
of the House. They can be challenged by members of Parliament if 
it is felt those appointments are not objective, if they include 
people who lack independence from government. That is a healthy 
check and balance.
<P>
	There is a real difficulty in ensuring the process is fair and 
objective and that it is seen to be fair and objective. We want to 
keep that accountability to Parliament. We  have every respect for 
the Speaker of the House of Commons but there needs to be a 
certainty the appointments can be scrutinized and challenged if 
necessary. We would like the process to be totally above board and 
accountable to Parliament. There is a move in the bill to diminish 
and remove that accountability, which is the third reason we oppose 
it.
<P>
	The fourth reason Canadians should be concerned about the bill 
is that if it goes forward the whole process of redrawing boundaries 
will have to start all over again. Canadians will not know what 
riding they are in until six months before the election. Many 
Canadians who are becoming more involved in the democratic 
process will have to get ready for an election and nominate 
representatives they feel will do the job properly in the next 
election, and they will be guessing. How are constituency 
associations supposed to nominate candidates for an election when 
they will not even know the area from which they might be drawing 
voters? They will be trying to sell memberships and get people 
involved in the democratic process but the people will not know 
what street or what avenue the candidate will represent.
<P>
<B>(1235) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Silye:</B> Madam Speaker, on a point of order, there does not 
appear to be a quorum in the House.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> I do not see a quorum in 
the House. Call in the members.
<P>
	<I>And the bells having rung and the count having been taken:</I>
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> There is a quorum.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Ablonczy:</B> Madam Speaker, it is an honour to see so many 
members opposite coming in to listen to the words of wisdom I am 
adding to the debate.
<P>
	We now have a bill before us which is very badly flawed, which 
does not serve the interests of Canadians appropriately for four 
reasons. It increases and will continue to increase the number of 
members in every Parliament. It allows a very wide variance in the 
number of voters in each riding, thereby violating the basic 
democratic principle of representation by population since some 
voters will have greater weight than others depending on how many 
voters are in the riding.
<P>
	The appointments of the commissions which will draw up the 
boundaries of our ridings will have an important check and balance 
to their objectivity removed. There will be real uncertainty, 
unnecessary disruptive uncertainty, because new boundaries would 
not be finalized until a few weeks before an election would take 
place, very much interfering with the ability of Canadians to 
participate properly and freely and effectively in the democratic 
process.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13903"> 13903 </A></B>
<P>
	For those reasons which are substantial and very clear I urge 
members of the House to reconsider support for the bill, which 
is not serving the interests of Canadians as it ought to and has 
not been put together with appropriate measures.
<P>
	I move:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That the amendment be amended by deleting the numbers 1, 4(a), 6(a) and

<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> The amendment is in 
order. Resuming debate.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Ablonczy:</B> Madam Speaker, on a point of order, I was 
wondering whether there were questions and comments following 
my presentation.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> There were two minutes 
remaining. That is why I did not call questions and comments. 
Questions and comments.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Lee Morrison (Swift Current-Maple 
Creek-Assiniboia, Ref.):</B> Madam Speaker, since the 
reapportionment commission was holding hearings quite actively 
at the time the government heavy handedly intervened, and since in 
my riding there were no complaints about the way the 
redistribution had been planned nobody went to a hearing, 
including me.
<P>
	I would like a little information. I would like to be informed as to 
how these things work. I wonder if the hon. member did have 
hearings in her riding and if she did if she would enlighten those of 
us who were not involved in that.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Ablonczy:</B> Madam Speaker, there was some confusion 
about the hearings relating to the redistribution process that as I 
said was nearly finished when the government interrupted it.
<P>
	Because of the government's decision to introduce legislation to 
start the process all over again, some of the commissions were not 
sure whether they ought to hold hearings. Some held them and 
some delayed them.
<P>
	The notice of those hearings was in come cases very short. There 
were hearings held in my area and there were representations made. 
In some cases there were some recommendations for a better 
redrawing or a less disruptive redrawing of the boundaries in 
Calgary, where my riding is.
<P>
	I also had feedback from other hearings that there was no 
substantial concern with the way the commissions had been 
proposing to redraw. It did vary across the country.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ray Speaker (Lethbridge, Ref.):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
certainly appreciated the comments from my colleague.
<P>
	On this legislation, one of the major concerns I have, and I will 
speak to it in a moment or two as the seconder of this amendment, 
is that the government is behind in a time line. This legislation will 
impose a lot of restrictions on the commission in terms of its 
fulfilling its function in a very proper way. Would the member 
comment on the  government's ability to deal with this 
circumstance under the current legislation?
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Ablonczy:</B> Madam Speaker, there will be a substantial 
difficulty put in the way of all of the players in this new drama that 
has been launched on us as far as redistribution is concerned.
<P>
<B>(1245 ) </B>
<P>
	All of the steps in this process need to be done thoughtfully and 
with good administration, good recording, good consultation. 
There is going to be tremendous pressure on all of the people 
involved to get the documents together and make the studies and 
findings. It is not going to be a process done with as much time and 
thoughtfulness as could be done because there will be tremendous 
stress on the process to get it done in time for the next election. It is 
particularly unfortunate that is going to be done in light of the fact 
that it had already been done at some length two years previously. 
There was really no reason to have this thing started up again in a 
hurry.
<P>
	I do think the hon. member has pinpointed another difficulty 
with this whole process.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ray Speaker (Lethbridge, Ref.):</B> Madam Speaker, it is 
certainly my pleasure to second the amendment that was moved by 
my colleague. We have done that for a very important reason.
<P>
	The amendment that is before the House at the present time on 
clause 6 indicates that the commission will only recommend 
changes to the existing electoral district boundaries where the 
factors set out are significant enough for changes. That clause put a 
rather rigid parameter for the commission to follow. When one 
examines the motives behind that kind of a directive to the 
commission, what it really does is tell the commission not to touch 
the existing boundaries unless they really have to. In a sense, it is a 
partisan intervention that controls what the commission can and 
cannot do. It does not allow for an objective look at the boundaries 
as such, which is wrong. Therefore, the Reform Party has moved 
this amendment to deal with that issue and try in every way 
possible to allow the commission to have flexibility in boundary 
determinations.
<P>
	We have also added, in support of this, a substitute amendment, 
clause 4.(a), which adds the requirement for the two non-judicial 
commission members to be residents in the province for which the 
commission is established.

	<B>Mr. Morrison:</B> Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
My hon. colleague for Lethbridge has some very important 
remarks to make. Could we not have some Liberals in the House

<P>
	<B>Mr. Speaker (Lethbridge):</B> Madam Speaker, I would like to 
speak to this amendment that is before us and as well to Bill C-69 
and the recommendations that come from the Senate.
<P>
<B>(1250 ) </B>
<P>
	I want to say something about the process this bill has gone 
through between the fall of 1993, when this Parliament began, and 
today. One of the most disappointing things I have found about this 
Liberal government is it came to this assembly ill-prepared. This 
bill is another item that demonstrates the ill-prepared way in which 
they took on the responsibilities.
<P>
	The Liberal Party spent 10 years in opposition. One of the basic 
functions and purposes of the loyal opposition is to be a 
government in waiting. That is the basic purpose, to prepare itself 
for government. The Liberals were to know what kind of a budget 
they would bring to Canadians. They were to know what kind of a 
social program they would bring to Canadians. They had to know 
what kind of a redistribution bill would be brought before this 
House of Commons in 1993.
<P>
	When this government came here it was not prepared in any way. 
We spent one year with nothing but procrastination, with studies, 
with no answers to questions. It was not a government in waiting.
<P>
	What did the Liberals do in opposition? What did they do on this 
side of the House? They are doing about the same thing today.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Volpe:</B> Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of order. I realize 
we are all here to debate the truth so the public will be informed on 
everything. But I think it is important that when a member stands 
up he knows that of which he proposes to speak.
<P>
	There is no way an opposition party under the old system could 
possibly have intervened in the system; it is an arm's length 
system-
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Ringuette-Maltais):</B> Please 
continue.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Speaker (Lethbridge):</B> Madam Speaker, I appreciate your 
ruling that is not a point of order but a sensitivity of the hon. 
member to the irresponsibility that went on in this House for 10 
years where the Liberal Party members sat on this side of the House 
and did nothing but play politics and attempt to get into the 
powerful position of being government. But they did not know why 
they really wanted to get into government, other than getting the 
perks, being ministers and having powers. Supposedly they were 
going to run the country with those terms of reference. There was 
no preparation at all.
<P>
	Since coming to this House in the fall of 1993 I have observed 
what has gone on over and over again, whether the budget, the 
social policy, the health policy, which is delayed until this fall. The 
government still does not know what kind of a health policy 
Canadians are going to have or what kind of a-
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Terrana:</B> Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of order. We 
are here to discuss Bill C-69 and not the performance of one party 
or another.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Ringuette-Maltais):</B> Resuming 
debate.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Speaker (Lethbridge):</B> Madam Speaker, I am discussing 
the process relative to Bill C-69. I prefaced my remarks to that. My 
preface was that Bill C-69 is in a process that was ill conceived, 
that was based on a lack of preparation by this government, and 
was basically incompetent.
<P>
	At this time we are faced with trying to design the ground rules 
by which a commission is going to establish the constituency 
boundaries across this nation. We are going to put them under a 
terrible time constraint to do a good, competent job.
<P>
	There are a couple of other arguments with regard to Bill C-69. 
My colleague from Calgary Centre outlined very clearly to us a 
concern that we are going to expand the number of seats in this 
House from the current 295 to 301. The Reform Party has taken a 
very clear position, saying we are prepared to reduce the number of 
seats in this House, which is responsible. It is a response to the 
Canadian public at the present time, who recognize that we must be 
frugal and respond to their direction at this time. The Reform Party 
is prepared to do just that.
<P>
<B>(1255) </B>
<P>
	We have to ask a question, which relates to my first comments: 
Why does the government not do that? My colleagues have said 
very clearly in their debate that the government does not listen and 
has not listened to the Canadian people and what it is they want.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13905"> 13905 </A></B>
<P>
	Another point I want to make, which I feel is different, is 
the reason the government is not doing it is because it does not 
have the political will. It is playing the old political games of 
the 1970s and the early 1980s, when government had more 
money and was not afraid to go into debt and the public was 
not holding it accountable. The object was to not get into any 
political problems, not make any difficult decisions. Just 
expand the House of Commons and no one will know the 
difference. Just add on and play the old political game.
<P>
	The Liberals have not changed. They do not realize that society 
has changed, the political system has changed. The demand on the 
public purse and the leadership of the country and the leadership in 
the provinces is saying be more frugal and adjust your cloth 
according to the budget of the country. That means we have to start 
here.
<P>
	I give the Minister of Finance some marks for bringing about 
approximately an $8 billion expenditure reduction in the budget. 
He has brought about reductions, which his Liberal friends resisted 
for a long time. It took months before the cabinet could turn it 
around and say they were going to support the Minister of Finance 
in these expenditure reductions. They just said they would not do it. 
Finally somebody told them the public wanted expenditure 
reductions and it was done in the last budget. That took some 
political will. As Liberals they are still afraid to make some major 
decisions for the country, and that concerns me very much.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Volpe:</B> We are making this one.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Speaker (Lethbridge):</B> In Bill C-69, again we see a lack of 
political will to make a major important decision.
<P>
	I think I should leave it at that, because the government wants to 
defend its position, which is indefensible and unacceptable at this 
time.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> Is the House ready for the 
question?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Question.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> The question is on the 
amendment to the amendment.
<P>
	Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the amendment?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.

<P>
<B>(1300) </B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> Pursuant to Standing 
Order 45(6), the division on the question now before the House 
stands deferred, and I will get back to you after consulting the 
parties to inform you of the time agreed upon.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Don Boudria (Glengarry-Prescott-Russell, Lib.):</B> 
Madam Speaker, I would urge the Chair to consider scheduling the 
vote for 1.30 p.m. for the following reason. If this bill is not passed 
by the House of Commons later today in its final version, it may 
well die as, under one of its provisions, the bill must be passed by 
the other House and receive royal assent no later than the 20th day 
of the current month. This means that if the bill with all its 
provisions is not passed today at the latest, we will be unable to 
deal with this matter, and the bill will die.
<P>
	I suggest that, when considering the submissions of the two 
political parties in this House allowed to present proposals to the 
Chair regarding the timing of the vote, the Chair should keep in 
mind that the bill must be voted on not only at the amendment stage 
but also at final reading later today. Otherwise, this would be an 
academic exercise.
<P>
	This concludes my submission to the Chair. I hope that this bill, 
which was drafted by a parliamentary committee after the 
committee reached a consensus, will clear all stages. I think that 
the loss of this bill would be very unfortunate and prejudicial to all.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, our 
Standing Orders are very clear on this issue, and I am going to take 
the liberty of reading you an excerpt to refresh everyone's memory.
<P>
	Our Standing Orders very clearly state that the Chief 
Government Whip or the Chief Opposition Whip may approach the 
Speaker, while the bells to call in the members are being sounded, 
to request that the division be deferred. The Speaker can defer the 
division until a specified time, but, in any case, no later than the 
normal time of adjournment for the following day, etc.
<P>
	But, it has been the custom and actually the practice in this 
House, certainly since this Standing Order was put in place, that in 
cases where the request to defer the vote is presented for the 
following sitting day, only one request is made and it is made 
immediately, the Speaker automatically grants the request. Even if, 
subsequently, a second request is made by another political party, 
never has it been decided to grant the second request.

Therefore, I ask you to grant my colleague's request.
<P>

<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Silye (Calgary Centre, Ref.):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
concur with the previous speaker. I support that decision. Those are 
the rules of the House. They are well established. They are clear. 
They are meant to benefit all the members of the House. I believe 
whoever is first should be recognized.
<P>
	Second, the government whip has put extra pressure on you to 
consider it, a 30 second consideration. However, the extra pressure 
that was placed on you by the government whip failed to outline 
and acknowledge the fact that the other place has all of next week 
to do its work as well. It is sufficient time for its members to get the 
job done and, therefore, I would support the opposition's request.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> I have already said that I 
will take it under consideration. We will come back to the House

	<B>The Speaker:</B> I declare the motion carried. When shall the bill 
be read a third time? Now?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Herb Gray (for the Minister of Finance)</B> moved that the 
bill be read the third time and passed.
<P>
	<B>Mr. David Walker (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to again rise in support 
of speedy passage of Bill C-70, an act to amend the Income Tax 
Act.
<P>
	As the House is aware, the bill will implement a number of 
measures relating to taxation that were introduced in the 1994 
budget, along with certain others announced by the government 
over the last year.
<P>
	In moving to third reading, it is again appropriate to remind 
ourselves of the context of this legislation. The fiscal challenge 
facing the country is familiar to us all. Few dispute the need for 
tough action and that difficult choices face us all. Surely we will all 
agree that fairness and effectiveness must be essential guiding 
principles of the steps we have to overcome in our challenge in 
dealing with the deficit.
<P>
	These principles have guided the government as we have worked 
to restrain spending. They have guided the minister in crafting the 
budgets of 1994 and again in 1995. In both cases, spending cuts 
alone could not deliver the deficit reductions that Canada needs. 
Rigorous government restraint needed to be complemented with 
some measures on the tax side.
<P>
	Doing so for us was simply a question of fairness. It was our 
vision of fairness that guided us as we looked at the tax system, 
addressing unsustainable tax preferences instead of imposing 
general tax hikes on Canadian taxpayers.
<P>
	In looking at the corporate tax regime we sought to ensure that 
corporations paid their fair share of the tax revenues needed to fund 
government programs and to prevent certain businesses or sectors 
from taking undue advantage of certain tax provisions.
<P>
	With this in mind, the 1994 budget proposed a number of 
measures to the rules governing the taxation of business income. 
Our goal, and let me stress this, was not to penalize the business 
sector or to impede the competitiveness of Canadian corporations. 
In fact, we believe that it is essential to maintain a competitive tax 
system in today's global economy.
<P>
	I would like to now outline some of the specific measures from 
the 1994 budget which have been reflected in Bill C-70.
<P>
	One fairness issue this legislation addresses is the tax rules 
dealing with debt forgiveness and foreclosures. Under the old 
provisions of the Income Tax Act many transactions involving the 
settlement of debt were not recognized in any meaningful way for 
income tax purposes.
<P>
	The new rules provide a comprehensive basis to deal with debt 
settlement. In general, they provide that forgiven debt amounts will 
be applied to a loss carried forward and expenses are partially 
included in the debtor's income. I should point out, however, there 
are special relieving rules to minimize undue hardship from these 
new rules.
<P>
	Let me now turn to the tax treatment of securities held by 
financial institutions. Until now the Income Tax Act has not 
provided specific rules regarding the tax treatment of such 
securities. The measures under Bill  C-70 seek to reduce 
uncertainty in this regard and also to ensure that the income derived 
from such securities is measured appropriately. The amendments 
provide that certain securities will be marked to market, meaning 
that the 
<P>

<B><A NAME="13908"> 13908 </A></B>
<P>
appreciation or depreciation in their value each year must be 
recognized in that year.
<P>
	In keeping with our goal of fairness, the amendments include a 
transitional rule that allow increases in income resulting from the 
new rules to be spread over five years. These new measures have 
been generally effective after February 21, 1994.
<P>
<B>(1355) </B>
<P>
	In addition, new rules are provided for debt securities that are 
not required to be marked to market. These rules deal with the 
measurement of income while the securities are-

amendments made by the Senate to Bill C-69, an act to provide for 
the establishment of electoral boundaries commissions and the 
readjustment of electoral boundaries; and of the amendment.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> Earlier today the Chair had a request for the 
deferral on the division of the amendment to the amendment 
relating to Bill C-69.
<P>

<P>
	I would ask the whips to consult with each other and I hope they 
manage to agree or at least produce a recommendation for the

<P>
	I hope the whips would consult with each other. If the whips 
have not reached a decision, I will return to the House at 4 p.m. and 
I will set a time for the vote at that time.
<P>
	There was a request for a vote at 1.30 p.m. That is a moot point. 
We are past 1.30 p.m. and now I would like the whips to discuss it 
and if they cannot arrive at a decision I will decide at 4 p.m.

<P>
	The hon. member for Roberval, on a point of order.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise on a 
point of order which concerns the procedure in this House. When a 
whip asks for a division to be deferred-and I looked up a number 
of precedents-the Chair always defers the division at the request 
of the whip who rises in the House, when there is just one.
<P>
	Perhaps you could tell us why you are now asking the whips to 
consult with each other, since there is only one valid request before 
the Chair and, in our opinion, the Chair must consider that request?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> I asked for a little more time, since question 
period will start in a few minutes, to review what happened. I 
would like some time to do that.
<P>
	Furthermore, I would ask the whips to consult with each other. If 
they are willing, perhaps it would be unnecessary to have a 
decision from the Chair.
<P>
	However, should it be necessary, I will announce my decision at 
4 p.m.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Silye (Calgary Centre, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, with all due 
respect, Standing Order 45(5)(a)(ii) clearly states:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>During the sounding of the bells, either the Chief Government Whip or the 
Chief Opposition Whip may ask the Speaker to defer the division.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	That is what happened.
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The Speaker then defers it to a specific time, which must be no later than the 
ordinary hour of daily adjournment on the next sitting day that is not a Friday.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	That occurred. The opposition whip asked for a deferral. Five 
minutes later the government whip stood up and gave a speech 
asking not to defer it. He asked for a time of 1.30. Two different 
times were asked: deferral of the vote until the next sitting day 
which would be tomorrow and subsequently would have to wait 
until Monday or 1.30 p.m. today. The 1.30 p.m. today has expired 
so there has been no valid request by the government whip. The 
request of the opposition whip must be respected and accepted.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> I thank the whip of the Reform Party for his 
opinions. I will surely take them under advisement when I make 
my decision at 4.00 p.m.
<P>
	It being 2.00 p.m., the House will now proceed to Statements by 
Members.

	<B>Mr. Andy Scott (Fredericton-York-Sunbury, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, a group of co-op students from the University of New 
Brunswick are visiting the capital today. They are here to 
encourage development of new and exciting co-operative 
education programs in Canada. These programs are made up of six 
work terms for two years in total of valuable work experience for 
every participant.

<P>
	Students, especially those who work away from school and 
home, develop personal skills such as independence and time 
management. Co-op students are also given the opportunity to 
acquire vital contacts with employers. Out of 37 co-ops graduating 
from UNB this year, only five are still searching for a job.
<P>
	Most non co-op students only begin the job hunt on graduation. 
The most immediate and tangible benefit from the co-op program 
is financial. The program funds the students' educations with little 
or no assistance required. The students of UNB ask our government 
to encourage the development of co-op programs.

	<B>Mr. Yves Rocheleau (Trois-Rivières, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
Liberals' insistence at the beginning of this session on amending 
the legislation on patented drugs is hard to explain from an 
economic point of view. In fact, the Patented Medicine Prices 
Review Board announced this week that patented drug prices fell 
by nearly 0.5 per cent in 1994.
<P>
	Since 1987, when the legislation came into force, patented drug 
prices have risen an average of only 2.1 per cent, below the rate of 
inflation, while drug prices generally rose an average of 7.5 per 
cent. In other words, generic drugs were the ones to increase 
significantly in price.
<P>
	In addition to containing their prices, manufacturers of patented 
drugs invested $561 million in research and development last year, 
which is more than they are committed to do. The Liberals should 
stop harassing a major industry that has a considerable impact on 
the economies of Quebec and Canada.

	<B>Mrs. Daphne Jennings (Mission-Coquitlam, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, after the 1993 election, my party asked if I would take on 
the responsibility of dealing with the issue of parliamentary 
reform. I quickly came to the conclusion that the main issue was 
freer voting. It is not just the situation where the leaders of the 
government side would declare a particular bill the subject of a free 
vote, but the situation where parties allow dissent to occur, true 
dissent on particular government bills, bills that form part of the 
government program.
<P>
	It was the opinion of those involved in the writing of the 
McGrath report in 1985 and those who sat on the House 
management committee in 1993 that dissent should be allowed to 
be expressed without fear of retaliation by the leadership of the 
political party concerned. Both groups believe the expression of 
dissent would make the House a healthier place.
<P>
	I am pleased to see that members on both sides of this House are 
beginning to express themselves in dissent. However, in order for 
freer voting to occur, the fear of reprisals by party leadership must 
disappear. I hope the leadership on the government side will 
respect the dissent that has been expressed as a healthy part of our 
democratic system and that no reprisals will come to those 
expressing dissent.

	<B>Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg Transcona, NDP):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
would like to draw the attention of the government to the fact that a 
ruling from Revenue Canada is being sought with respect to the 
deal that has been arranged to save the Winnipeg Jets.
<P>
	What has been sought from Revenue Canada and which may not 
have been received yet is a ruling which would have the effect of 
making the millions of dollars that are being donated toward the 
purchase and the saving of the team for Winnipeg as a charitable 
donation.
<P>
	It seems to me given all the other things that are happening in 
this country that hockey, particularly professional NHL hockey, is 
not a charity. I would like to see the team stay in Winnipeg, but I do 
not want to see a precedent set whereby professional hockey is 
regarded as a charity for tax purposes. I think that would be an 
awful precedent and an awful injustice.

since its inception 50 years ago, the Federal Business Development

businesses. This institution has continually adapted its operations 
to meet constantly changing political, social and economic 
climates. However, once again the time for significant change has 
come.

<P>
	That is why the business leaders of London-Middlesex are 
applauding the business development bank of Canada act which 
was recently tabled. The proposed act would not only allow the 
present bank to change its name, it would also allow it to evolve 
and to expand its programs and services to meet today's 
requirements.
<P>
	At present, we must adapt to the realities of the new global 
economy, an economy which in large part sees entrepreneurs along 
with small and medium sized businesses charged with the 
responsibility of promoting economic growth and job creation.

Speaker, on June 8 and 9, Acadia University, Chrysler Canada, the 
Nova Scotia Department of Education and the Department of 
Economic Development hosted ``Forging the Link'', an 
international symposium on education and the economy. This 
conference as a preamble to the Halifax summit brought business 
leaders, educators and youth together to discuss new partnerships 
between education and the economy.
<P>
	For young Canadians the chances of finding that first job in a 
chosen field are a lot better with relevant training and work 
experience. Whether it is post-secondary education or an 
internship that helps get a foot in the door, available jobs are going 
more than ever before to people with more schooling and more 
skills.
<P>
	It is crucial therefore that we as a government forge closer links 
between educators and business. Through important forums such as 
this, more young Canadians will gain an understanding of the ties 
between good education and good jobs.

<P>
	There were ceremonies, plays, concerts and workshops.

change the role, nature and even the mandate of the corporation 
entirely.
<P>
	As a result of the latest budget, the SRC and the CBC will have 
to cut 1,000 employees. However, Tony Manera, the former 
president had indicated that between 3,000 and 4,000 jobs would 
have to be cut in the next three years. In this context, it is therefore 
surprising that the Minister of Cultural Heritage continues to refuse 
to reveal the budget cuts he has imposed on the corporation.

<P>
	It was not so long ago we had a Prime Minister promising fair 
representation for all Canadians who elected Liberal members of 
Parliament. Not only has it become blatantly obvious that he has 
reneged on one of his iron clad red book promises, he has taken it a 
step further by threatening his caucus members to toe the party line 
or he will use the ultimate weapon of refusing to sign nomination 
papers for those members prior to the next election. This in turn 
could deny access to their beloved gold plated pension plan which 
is the worst possible catastrophe for a Liberal to experience.
<P>
	I want to inform members opposite that our constituents have 
their wishes followed on a day to day basis. They have the power to 
nominate their own representatives. As well, our leader will sign 
nomination papers based on constituents' wishes. With these three 
policies alone, our constituents know that we are the only truly

	<B>Mr. Raymond Lavigne (Verdun-Saint-Paul, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, yesterday, Quebec's Minister Responsible for 
Restructuring released the 8th report on Quebec's sovereignty. One 
of the first conclusions drawn by the author is that the Outaouais 
region would lose at least 3,500 jobs if Quebec declared its 
independence. These 3,500 well paid jobs coupled with the 5,000 
others the minister says will also disappear in the head offices of 
big companies in Montreal already puts the separatist's balance 
sheet for job creation in a debit position of 8,500.
<P>
	Quebec's Minister Responsible for Restructuring should devote 
his efforts without delay to putting an end to these reports and start 
using the funds at his disposal to create jobs instead of to announce 
they are going to disappear. This is what Quebecers want and this is 
the goal towards which the Government of Canada is working.

	<B>Mrs. Pauline Picard (Drummond, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, a study 
done by Statistics Canada which was released yesterday revealed 
that the after-tax income of families dropped 2.1 per cent in 1993. 
Compared to 1989, Quebec and Canadian families have on the 
average $3,025 less money to spend per year. All levels of society 
have been hit by this drop which started in 1989 and which has 
carried us back to income levels we have not been seeing since the 
early 1970s. Even the poorest families have seen their after-tax 
income drop since 1989.
<P>
	Economists predict that this decline could very well continue 
over the next few years, all the more so because the federal 
government's unemployment insurance reforms are having a 
negative impact on workers at the lower end of the pay scale. The 
dignity of working is above all the dignity of being able to earn a 
living at it. That is what the government should have realized 
before it started blindly cutting its support to those in need.

slaughter in the next election just like a Mulroney caucus.

<P>
	Mr. Speaker, today at 4 p.m. the Inuit Tapirisat of Canada will be 
holding a news conference on Parliament Hill to unveil Iliqqusivut, 
the Inuit Spirit of the Arctic Pavilion which will be showcased at 
this year's Canadian National Exhibition in Toronto.
<P>
	For 18 days in August the Inuit will bring a piece of the Arctic to 
Toronto's CNE. The pavilion will feature Inuit businesses, artists 
and cultural performers. Visitors will be able to hear and see the 
famous Inuit throat singers and drum dancers, participate in 
traditional Inuit Arctic games, enjoy northern food of char and 
caribou, and purchase Inuit carvings, prints, jewellery and clothing.
<P>
	I encourage all members of Parliament, their staff and all other 
Canadians to experience the Inuit way of life at the CNE this 
summer and, for a foretaste, to join us on the front lawn of 
Parliament Hill later this afternoon.

	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the Group 
of Seven summit opened this morning in Halifax, while 12 
Canadian peacekeepers and observers are still being held hostage 
by the Serb forces. They are literally being used as a shield, as 
Bosnian government troops launch an offensive on the outskirts of 
Sarajevo to break the Serb siege of the Bosnian capital.
<P>
	Could the Minister of National Defence tell us what specific 
steps have been taken to provide a safer environment for some 850 
Canadian peacekeepers deployed in Visoko who are now caught 
between the two sides in a confrontation between Bosnian 
government troops and Serb troops north of Sarajevo?
<P>
	<B>Hon. David Michael Collenette (Minister of National Defence 
and Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, I appreciate 
the hon. member's question. I can inform him that at the base in 
Visoko, because of the build-up of Muslim forces, certain 
precautions have been taken to be ready in the event of an attack. 
The situation is very disturbing but, so far, our troops are in good 
shape and not in any immediate danger.
<P>
	As for the 11 members of the Canadian forces in Ilijas, this is a 
real problem because of the start of hostilities in this region. So far, 
they are in good shape and are not in danger.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, during a 
previous question period, the Minister of National Defence said 
they were in a very delicate situation.
<P>
	I wish the Minister of National Defence would explain what he 
meant by this very delicate situation and why these peacekeepers 
still have not been released? Could he be a little more specific?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of National Defence and 
Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, we are very 
concerned that our people have not been released. Yesterday I 
called in the chargé d'affaires of the Yugoslavian government to 
lodge a formal protest with the authorities in Belgrade.
<P>
	Although we appreciate very much the efforts of President 
Milosevic and the Yugoslavian government in Belgrade so far in 
getting the release of the hostages and working with the Bosnian 
Serbs, we have demanded they intercede immediately to release the 
11 Canadians at Ilijas and Captain Rechner who is still in Pale, the 
Bosnian Serb headquarters.
<P>
	There is no reason for these people to be detained other than the 
fact that perhaps these forces are being held as some kind of a 
shield to try to prevent the Bosnian Muslims who are amassing for 
an attack apparently to liberate Sarajevo from Serb control in the 
suburbs.
<P>
<B>(1420) </B>
<P>
	It is totally unacceptable to have United Nations personnel, 
especially Canadians, used as pawns in the middle of a conflict 
between those two parties.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, since the 
Prime Minister is now at the G-7 summit, together with some very 
important players in this unfortunate series of events, could the 
Minister of National Defence tell us whether today, the Prime 
Minister intended to make it clear to the G-7 heads of state that 
quick action is urgently needed to save our troops, to save Canadian 
soldiers who are now in the worst possible situation in that part of 
the world?
<P>
	<B>Hon. David Michael Collenette (Minister of National Defence 
and Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, I am sure 
our Prime Minister intends to raise the matter in Halifax with his 
G-7 colleagues, because he knows perfectly well this is a bad 
situation and everyone wants to see the liberation of all hostages 
and prisoners.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	I am sure the Prime Minister will be talking about this with his 
colleagues in Halifax. All members of the G-7 are as concerned as 
everyone about the deteriorating situation in the former 
Yugoslavia.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13913"> 13913 </A></B>
<P>
	As to whether or not Canada will take part in the rapid reaction 
force, again that will be the Prime Minister's decision. He will 
announce that in due course.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean-Marc Jacob (Charlesbourg, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the Minister of National Defence.
<P>
	As the minister mentioned, the heads of state at the G-7 Summit 
will be discussing the situation in Bosnia. However, yesterday in 
Washington, French President Jacques Chirac expressed his regret 
at the length of time it was taking to set up the rapid reaction force 
in Bosnia. Here, on the other hand, we still do not know whether 
Canada will be part of the force or not.
<P>
	Would the Minister of National Defence tell us whether or not 
Canada will participate directly in the establishment of the rapid 
reaction force as France and Great Britain have proposed?
<P>
	<B>Hon. David Michael Collenette (Minister of National Defence 
and Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, I have 
already answered that question.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean-Marc Jacob (Charlesbourg, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I do 
not think either the minister or the Prime Minister have ever 
answered this question. They have said they will discuss the matter 
at the G-7 summit, and again we have the same response.
<P>
	How can the government not commit to participating in the rapid 
reaction force-because we have still not had an answer-and thus 
abdicate its responsibility to further protect the safety of the 
peacekeepers in Bosnia at a time when many members of the large 
contingent of Canadian peacekeepers are in very precarious 
situations?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of National Defence and 
Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the Canadian 
government is certainly not abdicating its responsibilities.
<P>
	We have taken measures in the last number of months to ensure 
that our forces take all necessary precautions, as I described in 
reply to the earlier question, especially increased fortifications at 
our base in Visoko, especially increased protection for our troops, 
and a number of other things that will help them do their duties.
<P>
	The question of the rapid reaction force was an initiative that we 
support. It is an initiative that will largely be manned by British and 
French forces. Certainly it is the desire of the NATO allies that 
Canada participate. We want to make sure before we give our 
concurrence that we are fully satisfied with the way the force will 
be deployed. Those answers will be coming shortly.
<P>
<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="MINISTEROFCANADIANHERITAGE">MINISTER OF CANADIAN HERITAGE</A></H3>
	<B>Miss Deborah Grey (Beaver River, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
yesterday the government House leader said that he did  not accept 
the premise of our questions about the heritage minister's violation 
of the federal code of ethics. We are not dealing with assumptions, 
conjectures and speculation here. We are dealing with the facts.
<P>
	It is a fact that the heritage minister targeted departmental clients 
for political donations. It is a fact that everyone who attended that 
dinner received a government contract or appointment. It is a fact 
that the minister blatantly broke section 23 of the government's 
own code of conduct.
<P>
	What does it take for the Prime Minister to remove a minister 
guilty of unethical behaviour? A criminal conviction?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Herb Gray (Leader of the Government in the House of 
Commons and Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
there is a fundamental flaw in the hon. member's question because 
on the public face of information available it is not based on fact. 
There is no information I am aware of to say that the minister 
personally invited people to the dinner but rather that he simply 
attended the dinner. It is quite proper for ministers and members of 
all parties to attend fundraising dinners. It is part of the normal 
political process in the country and I am informed that the 
donations were properly recorded.
<P>
<B>(1425) </B>
<P>
	I can ask the hon. member a question. Why is she asking 
questions that do not appear to be based on facts?
<P>
	<B>Miss Deborah Grey (Beaver River, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is 
clear the minister attended and he is personally responsible for the 
contracts that go out under his signature.
<P>
	The government's excuses and its carefully crafted damage 
control lines are certainly wearing thin. The heritage minister was 
clearly in the wrong. The government is making matters worse by 
refusing to release the full list of all the people who were invited to 
the minister's dinner, the full list of those who actually sent 
contributions, and the full list of donors who have received heritage 
contracts or appointments, not just giving donations. Trying to bury 
this information in Elections Canada documents will not make it go 
away.
<P>
	I have a supplementary question. If the government does not 
have anything to hide, why is it hiding behind these ludicrous 
answers? When will it make all the list public?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Herb Gray (Leader of the Government in the House of 
Commons and Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
it is clear from public information that this dinner was not 
organized by the government and the invitations were not sent by 
the minister or the government. These are not materials within the 
control of the government, except to the extent that they are 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13914"> 13914 </A></B>
<P>
recorded in the Elections Canada returns. To have information 
disclosed in the Elections Canada returns is  not hiding the matter. 
It is carrying out the requirements of the law.
<P>
	I again ask the hon. member why she is asking questions like this 
rather than about matters of real concern to most Canadians.
<P>
	<B>Miss Deborah Grey (Beaver River, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, in the 
red book in the last campaign I thought integrity was a fairly major 
issue in the country.
<P>
	The Prime Minister has said that the heritage minister was not at 
fault because receipts were issued for all donations. Selling access 
to a minister of the crown cannot be justified by a handful of 
receipts. The heritage minister has violated the federal code of 
ethics by placing himself in a conflict of interest, but instead of 
doing the honourable thing and demanding his resignation the 
Prime Minister continues to stubbornly defend the indefensible.
<P>
	The government has put politics ahead of principles and it is 
making a mockery of the code of ethics. Enough is enough. Will the 
heritage minister resign now?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Herb Gray (Leader of the Government in the House of 
Commons and Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the hon. member has made what I consider to be a totally 
unwarranted accusation by saying that access to the minister of 
heritage was being sold. Ministers generally come in contact with 
the public in a whole range of acceptable ways, including attending 
fundraising dinners.
<P>
	It is clear if anybody is putting politics ahead of principles it is 
that member and her party.

	<B>Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Témiscouata, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, only a few weeks ago, the Prime Minister stated that the 
G-7 summit would be held in Halifax rather than Quebec City, 
because the Canadian flag did not fly above the city hall occupied 
by the separatist mayor of Quebec City. Now that the G-7 summit 
has just opened in Halifax, <I>La Presse</I> reports that, ``those who do 
not speak English are lost''.
<P>
	How can the Acting Prime Minister, whose government defends 
a vision of Canada as a supposedly bilingual country ``from coast 
to coast to coast'' not be embarrassed by the almost total lack of 
French on the very site of the G-7 summit in Halifax?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Herb Gray (Leader of the Government in the House of 
Commons and Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, 
since this summit is being attended by spokespersons for the G-7 
countries, including France and Canada, it is obvious that both 
official languages are represented at the summit site.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Témiscouata, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, we see the faces of francophones, but the image being 
projected is English. How can the federal  government explain that 
Canada continues as always to project a unilingual English image 
at the G-7 summit, while federal representatives in Quebec seize 
every opportunity to emphasize the merits of a bilingual Canada?
<P>
<B>(1430) </B>
<P>
	<B>Hon. Herb Gray (Leader of the Government in the House of 
Commons and Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, 
I totally reject the premise of the hon. member's question. The face 
we are showing at the summit is that of a bilingual, proud and 
united country. The hon. member's attempt to tarnish this image of 
unity is regrettable.

	<B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley East, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the Acting Prime Minister.
<P>
	It has been revealed that both the director general and the 
director of the public works contracting branch have doled out 
contracts to close family members without competition. One 
director hired his wife to do his office work. Mr. Hugues 
Bureau-St. Pierre has received close to $50,000 from his generous 
Aunt Lillian since September 1993.
<P>
	Is the government investigating this matter? If so, will he punish 
those responsible for unethical conduct?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Réginald Bélair (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Public Works and Government Services, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, in 
the last election the government made a commitment to govern 
with integrity. We intend to honour this practice.
<P>
	We are aware of the situation that the member has brought to our 
attention. To this end, the Minister of Public Works and 
Government Services has directed his deputy minister to give 
instructions that guidelines should be respected.
<P>
	It is not standard practice to hire family members. This 
particular group that the member mentioned is now the subject of 
an internal audit. If the allegations are substantiated as a result of 
this audit we will direct the department to bring in corrective 
measures.
<P>

<HR>
<B><A NAME="13915"> 13915 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley East, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
am encouraged at the government's show of concern for ethics in 
the public service, but is it not ironic that it will investigate the 
public service for unethical conduct while the unethical conduct of 
the heritage minister and the public works minister goes 
uninvestigated altogether.
<P>
	It is no wonder that the auditor general says there is confusion in 
the public service about ethics. It is examples from the top that 
prove the old adage that the fish is rotting from the head down in 
this case.
<P>
	My supplementary question is for the Acting Prime Minister. 
Since the federal code of conduct does not seem to apply to the 
cabinet, how does the government expect to enforce ethical 
standards in the public service?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Herb Gray (Leader of the Government in the House of 
Commons and Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
ethics are very important to the government. We show this in many 
ways every day when it comes to the cabinet and when it comes to 
the public service.
<P>

fish, obviously things have stretched quite a way down to the 
bottom of that party judging by his question.

	<B>Mr. Michel Daviault (Ahuntsic, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the Minister of Health.
<P>
	Health Canada officials revealed today that the synthetic 
hormone somatotropin can legally be imported and used in Canada. 
Yet, the Minister of Health has tried to reassure the public by 
saying repeatedly in this House that the use of somatotropin is 
illegal in Canada and that cheaters would be punished.
<P>
	How could the Minister of Health let us believe in the House that 
Health Canada had the situation under control when she knew that, 
through a loophole in the Food and Drugs Act, synthetic 
somatotropin could legally be used in Canada?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Diane Marleau (Minister of Health, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, 
in our opinion, the current regulatory framework adequately blocks 
the use of bovine somatotropin in Canada. The example mentioned 
by the hon. member is a minor exception.
<P>
	I am aware of the hon. member's concerns, but, up to now, they 
have been unfounded. We will continue investigating and, if we 
detect any problems, we will take the appropriate action.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Daviault (Ahuntsic, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like 
to point out to the minister that all of the members of the Standing 
Committee on Agriculture, which met this morning, share this 
concern about this minor exception. If she talks to the 
Parliamentary  Secretary to the Minister of Agriculture, she will 
realize that he is of exactly the same opinion.
<P>
<B>(1435) </B>
<P>
	How can the minister explain why, in the past year, she has taken 
no steps to plug this important legal loophole, now that the 
voluntary moratorium imposed by her agriculture colleague has 
expired?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Diane Marleau (Minister of Health, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
for the vast majority of people in Canada other than pharmacists or 
veterinarians it is illegal to import, to sell, or to distribute rBST.

that was put in place was effective in preventing the use of rBST in 
the country. If that is not the case we will take appropriate action.

The Canadian commander says they are ``frozen in place''.
<P>
	In response, the Minister of Foreign Affairs said this morning 
that if our peacekeepers ``are no longer able to accomplish their 
raison d'être then they will have to be evacuated''.
<P>
	Given the minister's statement, is the government now preparing 
the evacuation of Canadian troops from Bosnia?
<P>
	<B>Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of National Defence and 
Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> No.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bob Mills (Red Deer, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, we found out 
today that the government will be joining the Bosnia strike force. 
The presence of such a force is not in keeping with the 
peacekeeping mandate and has only two purposes: one, to join an 
escalating conflict as a combatant; or two, to facilitate the 
withdrawal of UN troops from the region.
<P>
	Since the government is contributing troops to the strike force, 
does this mean it is abandoning its professed resolve for neutrality 
or is it preparing for withdrawal as we have proposed for the last 
six months?
<P>
	<B>Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of National Defence and 
Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the hon. 
member should know by reading reports from the NATO meeting a 
couple of weeks ago that the establishment of the rapid reaction 
force is a measure designed purely to assist UN personnel in 
danger. That is why it is being put together.

	Whether a country is part of that or not does not lessen the fact

leading the search of peace. That is Canada's position. We intend to 
stay and finish the mandate unless it becomes absolutely 
impossible for us to continue. The Prime Minister has made that 
clear in the House many times.

five per cent of all consumers are against the hormone 
somatotropin. The dairy industry is demanding that the moratorium 
on its use be extended, and, this morning, the Standing Committee 
on Health passed a resolution for the renewal of the moratorium for 
at least two years. With 15 days left to go before the end of the 
moratorium, the Minister of Agriculture is still undecided 
regarding the issue.
<P>
	Will the minister admit that we are talking about something 
bigger than the minor exception that the Minister of Health would 
have us believe, something which more closely resembles a gaping 
legal loophole which permits somatotropin to be used in Canada, 
and will he admit that, in the short term, the only thing that will 
protect consumers who want to drink milk that was not produced 
using somatotropin will be an extension of the moratorium?

	<B>Hon. Ralph E. Goodale (Minister of Agriculture and

to the provisions in the Food and Drugs Act and the regulations 
promulgated under that act which is legislation under her 
jurisdiction. She has indicated quite clearly what the provisions of 
the law and the regulations provide. She is quite correct to indicate 
that the possibilities of importation are exceedingly limited to 
certain specific individuals and certain specific cases. The answer 
given by the Minister of Health is completely accurate as to the 
facts.

right of citizens to drink natural milk that was not produced using 
hormones, and if so, what is he waiting for to announce that he will

consumers that they will be able to drink unadulterated milk, in

	<B>Hon. Ralph E. Goodale (Minister of Agriculture and

many in the private sector, a task force investigation of a variety of 
facts surrounding rBST. We did that following the advice of the

issue.

and provided is a critical piece, which is the scientific regulatory 
review of the health aspects with respect to rBST. That is presently

<P>
	Fichenberg was murdered by Paul Butler, a federal inmate who 
was on day parole at the time of the murder. At the time of

the report of the investigation into this matter says that the parole 
board applied the criterion of the protection of the public as its 
main guideline.
<P>
	I am not in a position to comment on the RCMP's involvement 
or non-involvement in the matter.
<P>
	At the same time, this happened before the government took 
office. I want to ensure, in so far as I am able to do so, that the 
circumstances which led to this tragic occurrence do not happen 
again. I am glad to have the hon. member's concurrence in this

	<B>Mr. Harold Culbert (Carleton-Charlotte, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Agriculture and 
Agri-Food.
<P>
	As the minister knows, for more than a year now the whole farm 
safety net program has been studied and reviewed. Can the minister 
tell the House, the hundreds of farmers across Carleton-Charlotte 
and the thousands of farmers across Canada what the status is of the 
study and when we can expect to see its results?
<P>
<B>(1445) </B>
<P>
	<B>Hon. Ralph E. Goodale (Minister of Agriculture and 
Agri-Food, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, through most of 1994 we were 
discussing the future shape of agricultural safety nets with farm 
organizations and with provincial governments.
<P>
	In December 1994 we achieved unanimous agreement among 
the federal government and all of the provinces with respect to the 
principles to underpin the future design of safety programming in 
Canada.
<P>
	At the moment our officials are working on the drafting of an 
omnibus memorandum of understanding hopefully to be signed in 
due course between the federal government and all of the provinces 
outlining the basic components of the safety net structure for the 
future, indicating the necessity for trade compatibility and 
production and market neutrality.
<P>
	We want to ensure interprovincial fairness and balance. We want 
to achieve a cost sharing ratio of about 60 per cent federal, 40 per 
cent provincial. We want to achieve national consistency across the 
country with sufficient provincial flexibility to meet local and 
regional objectives.
<P>
	We think we will get there. The memorandum of understanding 
is very well advanced.

	<B>Mr. Réal Ménard (Hochelaga-Maisonneuve, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the Minister of Industry has consistently refused to set up 
a genuine defence conversion program and has cut the few 
resources remaining in the budget for the defence industry 
productivity program, which has had serious consequences for 
Montreal. In fact, Pratt &amp; Whitney, a leader in Canada's aerospace 
industry, is planning to move its research centre.
<P>
	Does the Minister of Industry realize that by refusing to set up a 
genuine defence conversion program, he is denying the Quebec 
aerospace industry an opportunity to develop its technological 
capability and thus undermining its ability to compete?
<P>
	<B>Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, 
first of all, I want to commend the hon. member on the interest he 
has shown in the broader issues of technological development here 
in Canada. I am very much aware of the problem concerning Pratt 
&amp; Whitney, which has been discussed in the media.
<P>
	I want to say to the hon. member that in the budget, which of 
course reduced the funding available for this program, we 
promised to review it. Cabinet intends to discuss the broader issues 
of technological development, and I am looking forward to hearing 
what the hon. member has to say about these programs.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Réal Ménard (Hochelaga-Maisonneuve, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, despite the almost British phrasing of his reply, the 
minister did not answer my question.
<P>
	My question is: Since Ottawa funded 18 per cent of Pratt &amp; 
Whitney's R and D investments over the past ten years, mainly for 
military applications, why does the minister now refuse to support 
civilian applications of the company's research? Why does the 
minister refuse to help a Quebec company? That is the question.
<P>
	<B>Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry, Lib.): </B>First of all, 
Mr. Speaker, I may remind the hon. member that Pratt &amp; Whitney 
is not exactly a Quebec company. It is a multinational that also has 
plants in Halifax and Lethbridge, Alberta. The issue is one that is 
important to all regions in Canada.

Speaker, the road blockade beside Adams Lake still remains in 
place today.
<P>
	Eighty-six days after it was started by the three native bands 
involved there have been at least two episodes of violence 
involving criminal charges. Last week a bridge into a provincial 
park was burned.
<P>
	Does the minister of Indian affairs still insist he must be 
specifically invited by the parties involved before he will take 
action?
<P>
<B>(1450 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Hon. Ron Irwin (Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern 
Development, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, as has been indicated in the 
House on several occasions both by me and by the solicitor general, 
policing in the province of B.C. is in the jurisdiction of the RCMP 
under contract to the province of B.C.
<P>
	On this specific road there are three scenarios. The best case 
scenario is that it is a public road to the reserve. The second case is 
that the owners on the other side have the right of way and then 
they can sue. The worst case scenario which my hon. friend seems 
to be moving toward is this land is owned totally by the First 
Nations. If that is the scenario they are entitled to close off the road 
on their land like any owner in Canada.
<P>
	I am hoping we can work out an arrangement with them so 
people can get to their premises. We are prepared to work with the 
province of B.C. which fortunately we do in many situations. We 
will help out in the facilitation. Those are the facts and all the 
rhetoric in the House will not change those facts.
<P>
	The problem was it was an archaeological dig. The person who 
did it was supposed to comply with the mandate from the province. 
That person did not. That person has been written to and still has 
not complied.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Darrel Stinson (Okanagan-Shuswap, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the problem goes beyond that. The federal government 
was supposed to have been involved a long time ago on the signing 
of that road, as the minister knows.
<P>
	He has also been contacted by the B.C. aboriginal affairs 
minister, Mr. Cashore. He was informed on April 13 this should be 
treated as a top priority by this minister. He has also had that 
request from aboriginals and from the property owners.
<P>
	I know nothing comes easy to this minister. Unfortunately that is 
the only thing he is good at. When will he acknowledge his 
responsibility under the Indian act and get involved?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Ron Irwin (Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern 
Development, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, all that happens is I get the same 
question and I give the same response. I will respond again.
<P>
	The province is negotiating with the band. Hopefully a deal will 
be made but enforcement is a provincial responsibility. Does the 
hon. member want us to take the RCMP back and go into B.C. and 
enforce that?

	At the same time, however, the government is in the process of

Speaker, Canadian families are right; Statistics Canada has made it 
official. Family incomes after taxes have fallen 6.5 per cent in real 
terms since 1989; 2.1 per cent in the last year surveyed. Canadians 
are fed up with the performance of the economy and rightly blame 
the federal government.

income and change the policies responsible?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Peters (Secretary of State (International

member for his question.
<P>
	The statistics he refers to ended in 1993. There was an election 
that year and since that time there have been some half million new 
jobs created in the country. The statistics for 1994, the first year of 
our mandate, will show a substantial rise in family incomes in 
Canada.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Herb Grubel (Capilano-Howe Sound, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, since 1981 tax freedom day, the day when people's annual 
incomes go into their pockets, has  advanced 73 days. The Fraser 
Institute announced that this year it is on July 5. The tragedy is that 
the ever higher taxes we all pay do not get us more services, they 
pay interest on our staggering debt.
<P>
	When will the government close the bottomless hole for our tax 
dollars by cutting the debt and getting Canadian families once more 
to enjoy increases in after tax incomes as they had for decades 
before the deficit became out of control?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Peters (Secretary of State (International 
Financial Institutions), Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I really appreciate that 
question because that is exactly what the government is doing. It is 
reducing the deficit, bringing it to 3 per cent of GDP in the third 
year of our mandate, on the way to a balanced budget. That means a 
falling debtload and lower taxes will follow when the time comes.

	Canada has maintained broken diplomatic relations with Cuba 
for 50 years and has established very important trade and 
investment links. In contrast, the United States has maintained an 
inhumane embargo that has had disastrous implications for the 
people of Cuba.
<P>

companies with trade links to Cuba with blacklisting. I ask the 
acting Prime Minister if he can tell this House whether the Prime 
Minister will be raising this issue at the G-7 meeting this week and

<P>
	Southern Alberta has recently suffered the most devastating 
flood damage in decades. The cost of restoring this part of my 
home province to a pre-disaster condition will be considerable. 
Has the Province of Alberta asked the minister for assistance? If so, 
has the minister directed Emergency Preparedness Canada to offer 
its help as Alberta tries to recover from this disaster?
<P>
	<B>Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of National Defence and 
Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the federal 
government does provide assistance through a program called 
financial assistance arrangements. The province of Alberta this 
morning did apply for assistance with respect to the very serious 
problems it has had in that province in the last few days. That 
application will be considered in the normal way according to the 
normal formula. I do not anticipate any problems in complying 
with the government's request.
<P>
	The financial assistance is usually directed toward the cost of 
replacing public infrastructure, but also does have application for 
individuals, farms, and businesses for the essential parts of their 
homes or businesses that have been destroyed by floods in this

<P>
	In my nearly 30 years in Parliament I have never met with 
anything as vicious and low as what I am about to quote to this

These statements undermine my good relations with all members

<P>
	In today's Toronto <I>Star</I> the following quote appeared: ``When 
Hopkins sat down at lunch at the Liberal table in the parliamentary 
restaurant yesterday following the caucus meeting, the other MPs 
sitting there left within minutes''.
<P>
	Secondly, from the <I>Globe and Mail</I> is the following quote: ``The 
bitterness among Liberals could be seen even at the parliamentary 
restaurant when Liberal MPs  started moving away from a table 
after gun-control dissident Leonard Hopkins sat among them''.
<P>
	The truth is that I did not have lunch in the parliamentary 
restaurant at all yesterday. I did not sit in a single chair in the 
parliamentary restaurant yesterday morning, noon, or night. 
Obviously the Toronto <I>Star</I> and the <I>Globe and Mail</I> did not either.

	These articles are completely inaccurate and are nothing but 
fabricated stories with no truth or foundation whatsoever. Not even 
<I>Frank</I> magazine has treated me like this. These kinds of fabricated 
stories originating from whatever cheap source are obviously 
designed for despicable undermining purposes.

Criminal Code (sentencing) and other acts in consequence thereof, 
be read the third time and passed.
<P>
	He said: Mr. Speaker, Bill C-41, which we debate today at third 
reading, represents a culmination of 14 years of effort to achieve 
comprehensive reform in the sentencing process as part of 
Canadian criminal law.
<P>
	Since 1983 we have had recommendations for substantial reform 
in the area of sentencing from a royal commission, from the Law 
Reform Commission of Canada, from the Canadian Sentencing 
Commission, and from an all party committee of this House, which 
as long ago as 1988 unanimously recommended many of the 
measures that are reflected in the bill that is before Parliament 
today.
<P>
	At long last, in Bill C-41 we have action to implement practical 
changes to reflect the recommendations of such long standing from 
broad areas of Canadian society, meaningful reform, meaningful 
improvement in the process of sentencing in the criminal law.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The bill states, for the first time, the purpose and principles of 
sentencing to be used by the courts in sentencing an offender.
<P>
	Its statement includes the fundamental purposes of sentencing 
and the principles the courts are to apply in setting the sentence of 
adult offenders.
<P>
	The bill provides for a number of changes to procedure and 
evidence at the time of sentencing. These changes will make it 
possible to include in the Criminal Code the practices sought by 
courts of appeal, proposals set out in previous legislation and the 
suggestions by the Law Reform Commission.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13922"> 13922 </A></B>
<P>
	The bill includes provisions that allow the provinces to establish 
programs of alternative measures for individuals charged with an 
offence. Included in the bill at the express request of the provinces, 
these provisions are based on similar provisions in the Young 
Offenders Act and are intended to draw on the provinces' 
experience in developing and administering programs of this type.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Among the fundamental purposes of this bill is to codify and 
legislate for the first time in Canadian law a statement of the 
purposes and principles of sentencing.
<P>
<B>(1515 ) </B>
<P>
	Until now, as hon. members know, the sentencing process has 
been guided and determined by principles developed only by the 
courts. While the common law system has produced cogent 
statements of those principles by judges across the country, the 
commissions, the committees and the authorities to which I 
referred at the outset have all recommended for years that those 
purposes be legislated by Parliament for the purpose of uniformity.
<P>
	In this bill Parliament is given the opportunity to declare the key 
purposes of sentencing, to put before judges a list of factors to be 
taken into account, to provide direction to encourage uniformity so 
that the purpose of the process can be properly understood and so 
that it might be rendered more predictable than it is at present.
<P>
	What are those purposes and principles? They are spelled out 
clearly and in plain language in the statute. The sentence would 
reflect the seriousness of the offence. There would be similar 
sentences for comparable crimes. Those who contravene the 
criminal law must face punishment. They should be separated from 
society where appropriate. Rehabilitation should be one of the 
objectives to be achieved. Similarly in passing sentence the court 
should take into account factors that either aggravate or mitigate 
the sentence such that they are fairly considered in the process.
<P>
	Let me touch briefly on some of the main elements of Bill C-41 
as I believe it improves the sentencing process in place at present.
<P>
	First of all, let me touch upon the perspective of the victims of 
crime. In relation to victims, I refer to the changes to section 745 of 
the code, a section which has achieved some fame in this Chamber 
as a result of challenges to its continued existence.
<P>
	That section provides that where someone is serving a sentence 
with a period of parole ineligibility longer than 15 years, after that 
period they can ask a court to permit them to apply for parole 
notwithstanding the extended parole ineligibility. The change in 
that section contemplated by C-41 would obligate the court on 
such an application to hear from the family of the victim so  that 
they have an opportunity to have an impact on that process.
<P>
	Bill C-41 also broadens considerably the rights to restitution in 
the criminal law so that victims and the rights of victims to 
compensation become a regular part of the sentencing process. 
Compensation for victims will now be dealt with as part of the 
normal process of sentencing rather than requiring special 
application.
<P>
	The restitution provisions in Bill C-41 would allow the 
enforcement of a restitution order for the benefit of the victim in 
the regular civil courts. The making of a restitution order would in 
no way limit the right of the victim to sue for damages.
<P>
	Bill C-41 also improves the present process with respect to the 
payment of fines when fines are imposed as a penalty in the 
criminal process. The fact is that today there are too many people 
taking up space in jails and prisons because of the non-payment of 
fines. It simply does not make sense to spend more to keep them 
there than the state would have gained upon the payment of the fine 
imposed.
<P>
	This bill ensures that the court will determine in advance of 
imposing a fine the ability of the offender to pay. It provides that if 
the person cannot pay, alternatives such as requirements to perform 
community service will be considered and imposed. It also 
provides for the use by the provinces of their own mechanisms, 
since each of them have them in place, to collect fines that the court 
assesses. It provides that instead of jailing someone for not paying 
a fine. Provinces may exercise powers to withhold licences or 
privileges to encourage or require the person to pay what the court 
has ordered. As a result of all of the measures which I have just 
summarized, prison will be a last resort for the non-payment of a 
fine.
<P>
<B>(1520) </B>
<P>
	Another of the areas in which Bill C-41 achieves improvement 
has to do with probation as a sentence, a very common sentence in 
Canadian criminal law. Bill C-41 lays out a process to ensure that 
the courts have access to more and better information at the time 
when they are imposing that sentence, information by way of 
pre-sentence reports which will tell the judges and the courts more 
about the offender.
<P>
	Bill C-41 provides for an increase in the penalties for breach of a 
probation order. It provides for greater clarity and cogency in the 
conditions which apply to probation.
<P>
	Another innovation in the bill is the introduction for the first 
time in the context of adult sentencing of alternative measures. By 
providing for this instrument, the federal government is responding 
to requests made by the provinces themselves. Each province will 
have the right to set up and administer its own process of 
alternative measures.
<P>
	For offenders who are before the court for the first time, never 
before having committed an offence and are  facing charges of a 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13923"> 13923 </A></B>
<P>
less serious, non-violent nature, the system will provide for taking 
that person out of the court stream. As long as they acknowledge 
their wrongdoing, alternative ways of ensuring that they learn the 
lesson will be established. These measures will free up scarce and 
valuable court time for the more serious offences where the need is 
greater.
<P>
	A separate and different innovation which Bill C-41 introduces 
is the concept of the conditional sentence. It is a new form of 
sanction available where the court imposes a jail term of less than 
two years. It permits the jail term in effect to be served in the 
community rather than in a prison. This would be done under strict 
conditions which the court can impose and under close supervision 
if necessary. In a manner which is less costly to the state and more 
likely to result in a positive outcome, the court can impose strict 
conditions. Breach of these will require the offender to show cause 
and effect why the offender should not then be brought to prison to 
serve the balance of the sentence in custody.
<P>
	Finally, Bill C-41 provides for a comprehensive and cogent 
statement of the rules of evidence and procedure for the sentencing 
hearing itself. It collects for the first time in one place in a readable 
and usable fashion, the rules of the sentencing hearing: the burden 
of proof; the powers of the court to obtain additional information 
pertinent to the sentencing process; a requirement that judges give 
reasons for their sentence. In every case society will know what 
logic or rationale lay behind the penalty imposed. There is also a 
provision so that we know plainly and clearly what the rules are 
governing the sentencing process to add greater fairness and 
greater consistency in the way courts go about doing their business.
<P>
	Bill C-41 is a broad and comprehensive measure to introduce 
progressive, sensible and sound changes to the criminal law, to act 
upon longstanding recommendations made for many years by 
independent bodies and by a committee of the House, effecting real 
improvement to this vital part of the criminal justice system.
<P>
	I commend the House committee for its careful work on the bill. 
The committee heard from many witnesses. It worked very hard 
clause by clause examining the bill and all of its measures. I 
believe the bill was improved considerably as a result of the effort 
and the care which was taken by the committee.
<P>
<B>(1525 ) </B>
<P>
	Just as was the case when I appeared before the committee and 
as was the case when I spoke in the House at second reading, there 
is one feature of the bill which dwarfs the others in terms of the 
attention it has received and the controversy it has created. It is 
section 718.2 of the bill which deals with aggravating 
circumstances that the court should take into account in 
determining the appropriate sentence.
<P>
	Section 718.2 of the Criminal Code as contemplated by Bill 
C-41 would provide that one of the principles that  govern the 
sentencing process in the criminal courts should be that a court that 
imposes a sentence shall also take into consideration the principle 
that the sentence should be increased or reduced to account for 
relevant aggravating or mitigating circumstances. Those 
circumstances may relate to the offence or to the offender. For 
example, if someone was a first time offender or if someone was a 
repeat offender, those circumstances would respectively either 
mitigate or aggravate the sentence the court gives.
<P>
	The section goes on from that general statement upon which I 
just elaborated to provide more specifically. It says, without 
limiting the generality of the statement to which I have just 
referred, that certain factors shall be deemed to be aggravating 
circumstances and the court therefore shall take them into 
consideration. The section provides that evidence that the offence 
was motivated by bias, prejudice or hate based upon the race, 
national or ethnic origin, language, colour, religion, sex, age, 
mental or physical disability, sexual orientation, or any other 
similar factor shall be deemed to be an aggravating circumstance.
<P>
	Of course this is the section that has attracted the attention of 
those who criticize the approach. It is important for us first of all to 
bear in mind just what the section does and how it operates. This 
has nothing to do with policing or punishing the way people think 
or the views they hold. It has nothing to do with the freedom of 
thought or the creation of thought police to govern the attitudes of 
individuals.
<P>
	The section is part of a sentencing bill in the Criminal Code to 
assist the court in determining what the punishment should be 
when it has already been established in the court that a crime has 
been committed. All it says is that after it has been proven that a 
crime has been committed the court should consider aggravating 
and mitigating circumstances. Where it is proven that the person 
was motivated in committing the crime by hatred, bias or 
prejudice, then that shall be taken into account as an aggravating 
factor.
<P>
	Among other things the inclusion of this provision in the bill 
complies with a commitment made by the Liberal Party during the 
1993 election campaign. On page 84 of the red book, in a promise 
that was elaborated upon in specific statements made by the Prime 
Minister to equality seeking groups, the Liberal Party undertook to 
amend the criminal law to provide this kind of protection to 
vulnerable groups who are typically the victims of hate motivated 
crime.
<P>
	Beyond that, if one needs further justification for the statement 
of what one would have thought was simply a sensible proposition, 
one need only look to the increased incidents of crimes of this type. 
Every major group among identifiable minorities reports in recent 
years a troubling and significant increase in hate motivated crime, 
among them B'nai Brith which has told the Department of Justice 
that there are now over 40  organized hate groups in Canada. 
Religious groups and minorities are clearly worried, as well they 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13924"> 13924 </A></B>
<P>
might be, that the existence and the activities of these hate groups 
are undermining the social fabric of Canadian society.
<P>
<B>(1530 ) </B>
<P>
	There is further evidence of the rise in such crimes. Police 
departments across the country have established hate crime units 
devoted exclusively to investigating and acting on crimes of this 
nature.
<P>
	In testimony before the Quebec Human Rights Commission one 
group referred to the American experience where one in five gay 
men and one in ten lesbians reported being the victim of aggression 
and one-third of all respondents said that they had received threats 
of violence.
<P>
	Police forces in Toronto and in Ottawa have recently reported 
that hate crimes based on sexual orientation represent the third 
largest category of hate related offences.
<P>
	I suggest to the House that the need for this legislative 
intervention is clear. We have drafted the section to provide for 
specific reference to characteristics that are commonly targeted in 
crimes of this type, specifically referring to race, national or ethnic 
origin, language, colour, religion, sex, age, mental or physical 
disability, and sexual orientation.
<P>
	Why do we include the list? It has been alleged by some that we 
have selected certain groups or certain characteristics in order to 
give special treatment or special protection, that we are conferring 
special status upon specific groups. It is not the government that 
has selected these groups for special status. It is not this Minister of 
Justice who has identified these groups for special treatment. It is 
the hoodlums and the thugs who have identified them for special 
treatment. It is the criminals and the punks who go out to find them 
to beat them up who have selected them for special treatment. It is 
this Parliament that has the opportunity today to respond to those 
hoodlums and those thugs by showing maturity and by showing a 
preparedness to be logical and to do what is required.
<P>
	The rigour of logic leads us to this approach. The evidence in 
front of us compels us to act. Common decency requires that we 
furnish through the criminal law a means of dealing with this 
thuggery.
<P>
	If we are speaking of special status perhaps we should remember 
that if gays and lesbians, for example, have a special status they 
have a special status to be targeted, to be beaten up. If there are 
members who care to share that special status I am sure it could be 
discussed. The only special status that is on that list is 
vulnerability. The only special rights we are talking about here are 
the rights to be targeted. The very purpose of this legalisation is to 
redress that unfairness.
<P>
	As long ago as 1977 in the Ingram case in the Ontario Court of 
Appeal the senior appellant courts of the  country recognized that 
targeting someone, attacking them, victimizing them in crime 
based on a characteristic such as sexual orientation was an 
aggravating factor to be taken into account in the determination of 
sentence. This provision merely codifies that altogether sensible 
rationale and introduces it into the Criminal Code that we might 
achieve uniformity across the country.
<P>
	When criminals target another and commit a crime against a 
person or a person's property based upon race, national or ethnic 
origin, language, colour, religion, sex, age, mental or physical 
disability, or sexual orientation, they have committed a crime not 
only against the individual. They have committed a crime that has 
an effect on the entire group.
<P>
<B>(1535 ) </B>
<P>
	American laws in states of the United States where such laws 
exist are commonly called laws against crimes of intimidation 
because the offender knows that the effect of the act is not only to 
harm, to frighten or to affect the person who is at the end of the 
punch or the kick. It is to intimidate every member of that group 
who is intended to feel more vulnerable the next time they walk 
down the street. That feature of such a crime distinguishes it and 
justifies the approach contained in Bill C-41.
<P>
	We have referred to sexual orientation. We have not found it 
necessary to define the term because its meaning is clear. Since 
1977 the term has been included in human rights legislation in 
eight provinces and territories in Canada. There has never been any 
difficulty in interpreting or defining or applying that term as it is 
found in those provincial and territorial statutes. No question has 
ever been raised about what it means.
<P>
	In the gay bashing crimes about which we have heard too much 
in recent years, the offenders, the thugs and the hoodlums who 
target people because of their sexual orientation, have no difficulty 
knowing what they are looking for when they drive downtown on 
Saturday night hunting for someone to beat up because they think 
they are gay or they are lesbian.
<P>
	It should be stressed that the responsibility of parliamentarians 
in dealing with legislation is to use logic and reason in assessing 
the legislation's merit. I earnestly hope that we will be spared the 
observations that Bill C-41 is a gay rights bill, that Bill C-41 has to 
do with traditional family values in Canada, and that Bill C-41 
confers special status for purposes of benefits or any other purpose.
<P>
	Bill C-41 is a criminal law bill which amends the Criminal 
Code. It deals not at all with human rights, access to benefits, the 
right to marry or adopt. It has to do with the sentencing of people 
who have been proven to have committed crimes. It has to do with 
determining the nature and extent of the sentence having regard to 
the societal value of discouraging hate motivated attacks. It 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13925"> 13925 </A></B>
<P>
provides an opportunity for Parliament to make a statement that 
that kind of attack will not be tolerated  and that we stand together 
in condemning hate motivated crime.
<P>
	I commend the bill to my colleagues and ask them to support it. 
In the last several days we have received expressions of support for 
this exact provision from the United Church of Canada, B'nai Brith 
Canada, the Canadian Jewish Congress, the Federation of Canadian 
Municipalities, the chief of the Ottawa police force, the chair of the 
Ottawa-Carleton Regional Police Services Board, the Centre for 
Research Action on Race Relations, the Urban Alliance on Race 
Relations, the chief of the metropolitan Toronto police force, the 
Canadian Association of Chiefs of Police, the mayor of the city of 
Toronto, and on and on.
<P>
	These responsible participants in Canadian society perceive the 
problem that the bill is intended to address and agree on the 
efficacy of the approach taken in section 718.2. I urge my 
colleagues to see past the smoke and the disguise of false 
characterizations, to look at what the bill does and at what the 
section achieves, and to support the government in these 
meaningful and important measures to deal with a rising social 
problem in the country.
<P>
	As we approach third reading let reason prevail. I ask members 
of the House in all parties to join with the government in doing 
something to improve the criminal law in general and in particular 
to demonstrate a resolve no longer to tolerate hate motivated crime 
in the country.
<P>
<B>(1540) </B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Pierrette Venne (Saint-Hubert, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, talk 
about sentencing reform is nothing new. The consultation process 
that started 10 years ago has finally led to today's third reading 
debate on Bill C-41, which deals with sentencing. This outcome 
was preceded by acrimonious debate.
<P>
	The statement of principle underlying the bill is a step in the 
right direction. The maintenance of a just, peaceful and safe society 
by imposing just sanctions, together with other crime prevention 
and law enforcement initiatives, fully deserves my support. In 
addition, innovative measures aimed at decriminalizing some 
minor infractions, alternatives to incarceration, and suspended 
conditional sentences will reduce prison overcrowding and focus 
sentencing on rehabilitation rather than incarceration.
<P>
	That said, I think it is essential to stress that the bill will have a 
major impact not only on the accused before the court but also on 
the general public.
<P>
	Sentencing is one of the most important steps in the criminal 
justice process. Contrary to what many people believe, most people 
charged with crimes do not go on trial. The vast majority of them 
plead guilty as charged. Their only experience of our criminal 
system is often limited to a brief appearance before the court for 
sentencing. Most charges laid are settled out of court as a  result of 
plea bargaining. Without this process, the judicial system would 
clog up to such an extent that, the way things currently stand, it 
would cease to function to all practical purposes.
<P>
	As a result, the accused pleads guilty, hoping that his lawyer will 
negotiate a reasonable sentence with the Crown. Any agreement 
reached between both parties is submitted to the judge. The judge is 
then free to approve or reject the suggestion made jointly by the 
defence and the Crown. The defense may also ask for a presentence 
report that the judge will take into consideration before handing 
down his sentence.
<P>
	The public pays attention to two things: the verdict and the 
sentence. The majority are not concerned about the technical side 
of what lawyers do. They want to know whether or not an 
individual is guilty, and what the sentence is. The sentence does not 
just involve the accused, but the public in general. The appearance 
of justice, the setting of an example, clemency and the dissuasive 
effect of the sentence are all important aspects in the determination 
of the sentence.
<P>
	Despite the importance of sentencing, the Criminal Code has 
never given any exhaustive direction to judges. They exercise 
complete discretion and have full powers as to the nature and the 
severity of a sentence. The applicable law in sentencing is written 
by judges and not by the legislator. This is the classic example of 
the judge-made law that is part of our Anglo-Saxon heritage.
<P>
	Through their interpretation of the law and the moral authority 
they wield, judges help to shape and develop the fundamental 
values underpinning society. Unfortunately, and I will go on 
condemning it, women are chronically under-represented in the 
judiciary. Lynn Smith, the dean of the University of British 
Columbia's faculty of law laid out the problem clearly in an article 
entitled ``A system that is changing''.
<P>
<B>(1545) </B>
<P>
	It contains the following eloquent passage, and I quote: ``The 
roots of the legal system were put down by men. They were 
developed in an era when women were not allowed to vote, to stand 
for office, to be lawyers or to sit on juries. The law was there to 
protect interests that men held important, that were consistent with 
the realities of their lives as men. Although the law may be said to 
take the situation of women into account, nonetheless an entirely 
masculine perspective underlies our legislation''.
<P>
	The majority of the approximately 1,400 judges handing out 
sentences are men. The overwhelming majority of federally 
appointed judges, those sitting in the provincial higher courts or in 
the Federal Court, are men. Of a total of 950 federal judges, only 
134 are women. All come from a privileged socio-economic 
background. The accused appearing before them are rarely as well 
connected: they are not always men.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13926"> 13926 </A></B>
<P>
	The majority of women who find themselves before the bench 
are unemployed, on welfare, or possibly working part time. Most 
judges are unfamiliar with the conditions in which the women 
appearing before them live. Ninety per cent of women serving a 
prison sentence have been found guilty of minor property offences, 
such as shoplifting. They are also sent to jail for non-payment of 
fines.
<P>
	It is clear that women in the prison system are a particular 
clientele. They are not usually there for violent crimes, which 
brings me to one of the great weaknesses in this bill. Clause 718 
identifies one of the main purposes of sentencing as the 
maintenance of a just, peaceful and safe society. This is a very 
worthy goal but may be difficult to achieve. And in order to achieve 
it, we will have to get rid of the gender and class bias of some of 
our judges. Our magistrates will need some very clear guidelines.
<P>
	It is surprising that those who drafted the bill did not bother to 
consider the characteristics of the accused at the time of 
sentencing. In fact, except in the case of aggravating circumstances 
associated with crimes motivated by hate or involving abuse of 
trust, nowhere does Bill C-41 oblige the judge to consider the 
degree of indigence or the gender of the accused.
<P>
	Women who come before the courts tend to be different as a 
group from male offenders, one factor being the type of offences 
women commit. Their behaviour is not the same and their goals are 
different as well.
<P>
	If, at the time of sentencing, the judge makes no allowance for 
these differences, his decision will inevitably be unfair. Equity 
does not mean equal treatment. Two identical sentences for the 
same offences do not carry the same stigma for men and women.
<P>
	Many women who have been in trouble with the police have 
already experienced very serious problems as a result of poverty, 
spousal abuse, family breakup and the fact that in most cases, 
women end up with the responsibility for a family.
<P>
	Judges must be made aware of these factors. This problem will 
be solved when we have as many women as men on the benches of 
our courts of justice. It is up to the Minister of Justice to administer 
the remedy.
<P>
<B>(1550) </B>
<P>
	One of the cornerstones of the bill is the alternative measures for 
adult offenders. If the province provides for a system of alternative 
measures, instead of being prosecuted, the adult offender would be 
ordered to participate in a training program or authorized 
community services. The conditions and restrictions that apply to 
the alternative measures program proposed in the bill are almost 
identical to those in section 4 of the Young Offenders Act.
<P>
	For instance, offenders will have to accept responsibility for the 
act or omission and fully and freely  consent to participate in such a 
program. The Crown has full discretion to proceed with 
prosecution of the offence if it feels there is sufficient evidence and 
the interests of society so justify.
<P>
	However, and as usual in the case of federal legislation, it will be 
up to the provinces to implement these alternative measures. In 
fact, it will be up to the attorney general of the province to set up a 
system of alternative measures. Provincial legislation from coast to 
coast does not necessarily guarantee uniform implementation 
across the country.
<P>
	There is no provision for implementation in this bill. Because the 
federal government conveniently chooses to ignore the need for 
mechanisms to implement its own legislation, the onus will be on 
the provinces to implement the system, and they will have to deal 
with all the start up problems.
<P>
	This kind of implementation will create provincial and territorial 
disparities which may cause other provisions of the bill as well as 
the bill's philosophy to be ignored. In fact, how can we expect to 
have sentencing parity across the country, if some regions have no 
alternative sentencing system or are unable to put one in place? 
Someone who commits an offence in a region where there is no 
alternative sentencing will not be able to use it, and this part of the 
bill then becomes ineffective.
<P>
	Offenders who happen to be in the wrong province will have 
different sentences. For similar offences committed in similar 
circumstances, some people will get different sentences, which 
goes against the principle set forth in clause 718.2.
<P>
	The range of sentencing available to the judge includes the 
suspended sentence. Under this system, it is possible to grant 
individuals a stay of sentence and to allow them to do their time 
within the community, provided they respect the conditions 
imposed by the court. Such a stay will only be available to 
individuals declared guilty of a crime for which no minimum 
prison sentence is set and sentenced to less than two years.
<P>
	Suspended sentences only confuse matters more. Judges already 
have the discretion to suspend the passing of a sentence and to put 
someone on probation for a specific period. A suspended sentence 
will have the same effect as suspending the passing of a sentence 
and putting someone on probation. Same difference. The Minister 
of Justice would have been better advised not to waste his time 
reinventing the wheel.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13927"> 13927 </A></B>
<P>
	Bill C-41 does, however, innovate in the area of victims' rights. 
Under clause 722, the judge is obligated to take into account the 
victim impact statement at the sentencing hearing stage. Hearsay 
will be acceptable under oath, and, if the victim is deceased or is 
unable to make a declaration, his or her spouse, relative or anyone 
who has taken responsibility for the person, may make a statement 
for the victim.
<P>
	This important development has made up for all the times that I 
denounced the minor role that the victim played in legal 
proceedings until I was blue in the face. But, this should only be the 
beginning.
<P>
<B>(1555) </B>
<P>
	Victims must take their rightful place in the courts and not just 
be regarded as crown witnesses. The Daviault case is a sad example 
of the foibles of our system. Henri Daviault was recently acquitted, 
for lack of evidence. The case made quite a stir and prompted the 
Minister of Justice to table his bill on drunk defence. But the victim 
died in 1993. Despite the order for a retrial, the crown no longer 
had a witness and the judge was obliged to acquit Daviault.
<P>
	Was justice served? The victim cannot give testimony from the 
grave and the victim's statement cannot be used as evidence now. 
Daviault is now a free man and we will never know what really 
happened. The victims of criminal acts must be included in the 
criminal court proceedings. They should no longer simply be 
crown witnesses. They should be entitled to representation by 
counsel and be able to cross-examine the accused, if the individual 
decides to testify. Victims should be able to call their own 
witnesses.
<P>
	The rules on hearsay evidence in a trial should be relaxed in 
favour of the victim. In short, the system should not further 
traumatize the victim, who has already been subjected to the 
violence. Twenty years after the first shelters were opened in 
Quebec, violence continues to be perpetrated against women. Our 
society's biggest challenge is to put an end to this scourge.
<P>
	This violence is not only physical; it can be psychological, 
emotional, economic and social as well. Spousal abuse is another 
scourge that must absolutely be stopped. Although the reason is 
obvious, the problem remains. Most of the members of this House 
continue to turn a deaf ear, unfortunately. They simply reflect the 
attitude of a society that indulges spousal violence.
<P>
	Obviously, most say they are sensitive to violence and do not 
approve of deviant behaviour. A number also say that spousal 
violence is reprehensible, but look for an excuse for the disturbing 
attitude of the aggressor. He was drunk, for example. This approach 
fosters social acceptance of spousal violence. There are always two 
sides to the coin in our mind. We try to understand the aggressor 
and we blame the victim. The implication is, generally, that a man 
has reasons for abusing his wife, and that the victim's reaction does 
not meet our expectations.
<P>
	In criminal law, when the courts have to deal with spousal 
violence, the sentence is too often lenient when the aggressor is 
found guilty. And for good reason. The pre-sentence report, which 
significantly affects the judge's decision, contains a distorted 
analysis of the problem. The report is limited primarily to 
analyzing the personality or the history of the aggressor. With this 
sort of analysis, the system is playing the aggressor's game.
<P>
	The individual is relieved of responsibility, and the sentences 
such behaviour deserves are avoided. I contend, therefore, that, in 
all cases of spousal violence, however serious, the fact that the 
victim is a spouse or a former spouse should be considered an 
aggravating circumstance thus requiring a stiffer sentence. Former 
spouses are all too often the victim of both physical and 
psychological aggression.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, I realize you must intervene at 4.00 p.m. I will 
therefore turn the floor over to you and perhaps continue afterward.

	<B>The Speaker:</B> My colleagues, I asked a little earlier if the whips 
would confer on the deferral of this vote. The Chair would always 
prefer that these decisions be made in harmony after consultation. 
To my knowledge no decision has been made by the whips of any 
of the parties.
<P>
	I saw the video tapes earlier today of exactly what took place. I 
have satisfied myself that the acting whip of the Bloc Quebecois 
proceeded in the normal and accepted fashion. I have reviewed 
what the government whip had to say with regard to this point and I 
have taken into consideration what the whip of the Reform Party 
said in the House.
<P>
	I want to make one thing clear to all hon. members. It is the 
purview of the Speaker to make this decision. I will tell you how I 
am not making it. I am not making it on first past the post. It would 
be unseemly, in my view, to have the whips running up to the table 
and knocking each other down. This is, after all, the House of 
Commons and we should have some decorum. Because the 
decision has been placed on my plate, I have decided and I order 
that the vote on this particular amendment take place at 11.30 p.m., 
Monday, June 19.

	The House resumed consideration of the motion that Bill C-41, 
an act to amend the Criminal Code (sentencing) and other acts, be 
read the third time and passed.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Pierrette Venne (Saint-Hubert, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I was 
saying that the former spouse is too often the victim of both 
physical and psychological abuse. When couples break up, the 
built-up tension too often degenerates into violence. The former 
spouse is a special case, because the abuser often blames his victim 
for the failure of the relationship.
<P>
	With respect to spousal homicide, which is an extreme form of 
violence, the probability that a woman will be killed by her 
husband is nine times higher than the probability that she will be 
killed by a stranger. Separated spouses, however, are much more at 
risk.
<P>
	In the case of couples living together at the time of the murder, 
four times more women than men are killed. This 4:1 ratio goes up 
to more than 10:1 for separated couples. These statistics are 
inescapable and alarming: for every man killed by his ex-wife, 10 
times as many women are killed by their ex-husbands.
<P>
	The results of this Canada-wide survey on spousal abuse, in 
which over 12,300 women participated, were published in March 
1994. This survey gives a picture of spousal violence that is 
troubling, to say the least. Because violence against current or 
former wives is disturbing, we prefer to ignore it instead of facing 
reality. It is high time that this House sent a clear message to 
violent spouses, the vast majority of whom are men. The message 
to the judges looking at the circumstances surrounding violent 
crimes against spouses must be just as clear.
<P>
	I am talking not only about physical abuse but also about 
psychological abuse, which produces lasting, detrimental effects. 
Put-downs and insults are as devastating a weapon as slaps and 
punches. They inflict deep wounds that never completely heal.
<P>
<B>(1605) </B>
<P>
	The national survey published last year was aimed at testing 
theories on the links between physical and psychological abuse. 
About a third of the women who were or had been married at the 
time of the survey said that their spouses or former spouses had 
been psychologically abusive. Fifty-nine per cent of former 
partners were considered psychologically abusive, compared with 
17 per cent of current partners.
<P>
	Although physical abuse does not necessarily go hand in hand 
with psychological abuse, both types were used in most cases. 
Three quarters of the women who described themselves as victims 
of physical or sexual abuse said that they were also victims of 
psychological abuse. Eighteen per cent of women not experiencing 
physical violence at  the hands of their spouses said they were the 
victims of psychological violence.
<P>
	The principle forms of violence described by the women 
surveyed were pushing, grabbing, shoving, followed by threats to 
hit, slapping, having objects thrown at them, being kicked, bitten 
and punched. A good number of women were also battered, 
sexually assaulted, strangled, hit with an object and threatened with 
a gun or a knife. Rarely was only one form of violence reported.
<P>
	The Bloc Quebecois proposed an amendment that covered all 
these forms of violence. In fact, by defining assault as it is defined 
in section 265 of the Criminal Code, we have included the 
application of force against a spouse, the attempt and the threat to 
apply force. The definition applies to all forms of assault, including 
sexual assault, sexual assault with a weapon, threats to a third 
party, causing bodily harm and aggravated sexual assault. 
Unfortunately, our amendment was not accepted.
<P>
	Almost half of women victims of violence have been injured. 
The most frequent injuries were bruises, in 90 per cent of cases, 
followed by cuts, scratches, burns, and various degrees of fracture. 
Almost 10 per cent of injured women said they had suffered 
internal injuries and miscarried.
<P>
	I would like to quote Mr. Justice Jean-Guy Boilard of the 
Superior Court of Quebec. When sentencing the accused Fouad 
Ghazal last Thursday in the district of Hull, the judge, speaking to 
the accused who had murdered his wife, said the following, and I 
quote: ``Spousal violence is a repugnant crime that has become one 
of the major concerns of our society. It would be utopian to think 
we can eradicate it. However, the sentence must reflect society's 
reprobation of this crime''.
<P>
	I hope all members of the bench agree with Mr. Justice Boilard.
<P>
	To get back to the sentencing bill, the debate, as I pointed out the 
day before yesterday, was distorted from the outset. Most speakers 
zeroed in on the expression ``sexual orientation'' which appears in 
clause 718.2 of the bill. This clause deals only with the 
circumstances the judge should consider at the time of sentencing. 
As I said before, this is not a new charter of rights.
<P>
	There is no justification for the concern expressed by some 
members that an individual will be punished more severely. All 
forms of violence must be punished. If the victim is attacked as a 
member of an easily identifiable group or as an apparent member 
of such a group, this is clearly an aggravating circumstance and the 
punishment should be severe.

<HR>
<B><A NAME="13929"> 13929 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1610) </B>
<P>
	At the insistence of the Bloc Quebecois, clause 718.2 now 
contains two additional factors, so that national or ethnic origin as 
well as language are now part of the list.
<P>
	We felt it was imperative to send a clear message to the courts to 
punish crimes motivated by prejudice based on language. A person 
has no right to abuse a francophone because he speaks French, and 
this applies to all language minorities in Canada. I hate violence in 
any form, and I particularly hate violence motivated by prejudice, 
the most damaging of all.
<P>
	Violence against women is the most obvious example. I 
therefore support unreservedly a bill that identifies the 
gender-based bias of the aggressor as an extreme example of a 
morally reprehensible attitude. We have every right to disagree 
with some of the provisions of the bill, and we have the right to 
express our opinions. However, some opinions make me fear the 
worst.
<P>
	Not so long ago, the debate centred on discrimination against 
Blacks and visible minorities in general. Bill C-41 is an indication 
that our society is moving in the right direction, towards civic 
responsibility and tolerance. Violence in any form must be 
condemned. The consequences of crimes motivated by hate are 
profound. There is not just one victim. There are many. Every 
member of these groups becomes a victim.
<P>
	This is a situation that cannot be tolerated. We each have to 
choose the kind of society we want. And I have chosen to live in a 
society that condemns violence.

	The House resumed consideration of the motion that Bill C-41, 
an act to amend the Criminal Code (sentencing) and other acts, be 
read the third time and passed.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jack Ramsay (Crowfoot, Ref.):</B> Mr Speaker, I am glad to 
speak for the last time on this bill in the House. No doubt I will be 
speaking about it in many places across the country as people 
contact me by phone, letter and fax to express their concerns and 
ask questions about the form it has taken as it leaves the House on 
its way to the Senate for final approval or amendment.
<P>
	I would like to touch on three areas in Bill C-41. I want to look 
at the alternative measures. I want to look at that part which deals 
with section 745. And of course I want  to touch briefly on section 
718.2. Perhaps I could start there.
<P>
	The justice minister took considerable time to dwell on what has 
been known as the hate category. It is unfortunate that many parts 
of the bill have been overshadowed by concern for what is in this 
particular part. We have to examine the bill from the viewpoint of 
whether it is a good bill or whether it is a bad bill, whether it is 
good legislation or whether it is bad legislation.
<P>
	I submit with respect that this is not a good bill and that it is bad 
legislation. I will attempt to justify my concerns in my address and 
intervention this afternoon.
<P>
<B>(1615) </B>
<P>
	The bill does not deal with the cause of hatred. It does not deal 
with the cause of prejudice or with the cause of bias. It does not 
deal with those issues which give rise to frustration, anger, stress 
and fear which I submit humbly is the mother of hatred.
<P>
	We see the government passing legislation that creates anger, 
fear and frustration. All we have to do is read the letters we receive 
on Bill C-68, on Bill C-41 and on the MP pension bill. That is all 
we have to do to see what the government is doing to contribute to 
the degree of anger and frustration across the country.
<P>
	The bill is not attacking the cause. It is not alleviating those 
fundamental feelings that result in bias, prejudice, hatred which 
eventually express themselves in human acts, one human against 
another.
<P>
	When I was growing up and going to school in Saskatchewan in 
our community there were people from all ethnic groups. There 
were ethnic jokes, Ukrainian jokes and jokes against the English 
and the Scottish and the French. Almost every one of those jokes 
was a putdown. Although they were humourous they were still 
putdowns and yet they did not bother any of us because we all knew 
we stood equal before the law.
<P>
	After all was said and done we all stood equal before the law and 
that is what is being destroyed. At least the sense of that is being 
destroyed; that the government is introducing legislation creating 
special rights for special status for some citizens. That is what will 
create a bias. If one grants special rights and special privileges to 
individuals, one will see other individuals resenting that. They will 
see the bias and the prejudice occur.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13930"> 13930 </A></B>
<P>
	I go back to the example that comes out of the United States 
where a school teacher went into her classroom Monday morning 
and said to her students that all the brown eyed children in her class 
are special, they have a higher IQ and they are smarter. She saw the 
result. She saw the friendships drop off between the blue eyed 
children, the brown eyed children and the others. A week later she 
came in and said she made a mistake. It is not the brown eyed 
children who are the smart ones, it is the blue eyed children. She sat 
back and watched what happened.
<P>
	She saw the prejudice. She saw feelings that produce bias, 
prejudice, anger and frustration develop within that classroom. I 
am saying this bill is not eliminating those feelings. It is aiding and 
abetting those feelings.
<P>
	If it is creating the impression in the minds of people across the 
country that people are being granted a special category or a special 
right, we must all feel we stand equal before the law regardless of 
our race, our colour, our language and regardless of our chosen 
style. We must all feel we have the protection of the law and we 
stand equal before that law, that those who administer the law, and 
the political forces will recognize that and never deviate from that 
principle.
<P>
	When we look at the alternative measures, what do we have? 
What do they mean? Alternative measures in the bill suggest we 
will segregate violent offenders and non-violent offenders from the 
court system and from the penal system. That gives me great 
concern. There are many cases which ought to be handled outside 
the criminal justice industry, as I refer to it, and the penal system. I 
was a peace officer for 14 years and most of the minor incidents 
which I came in contact with never reached the courtroom because 
I considered the court to be the last resort.
<P>
<B>(1620) </B>
<P>
	I am not unmindful of the principle contained here and the power 
and the strength of it which is expressed in what we call alternative 
measures. However, it should be directed. There should be a 
division between non-violent and violent offenders.
<P>
	The bill does not create that division. One of our hon. colleagues 
from across the way discussed during report stage that this will 
allow violent offenders to receive the treatment provided for under 
the alternative measures. We will see the state, those who 
administer the law, given the right to allow violent offenders, those 
who have attacked others, not to be subjected to the court system or 
to the penal system.
<P>
	When it comes to non-violent offences such as theft of property 
or wilful damage of private property or public property where there 
is no threat to the life or safety of individuals, I can understand 
looking at the possibility of dealing with that individual, 
particularly a youth, in a manner as outlined under alternative 
measures.
<P>
	When we entered an amendment at committee stage to segregate 
violent offenders from this alternative, of  course there was no 
consideration given to our amendment and it was defeated by the 
Liberal side. That is wrong.
<P>
	This is a bad bill, poorly drafted. I do not think it will achieve the 
results and provide for a safer society. To me, with respect, it is 
more of a political statement, a politically correct statement, than 
an effective piece of legislation.
<P>
	When the Canadian Police Association appeared before the 
standing committee this is what it said about the bill:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Bill C-41, with few exceptions, is unwieldy, complicated, internally 
self-contradictory, duplicitous and, what is worse, in almost all of it completely 
unnecessary for anyone with any knowledge of it or use for the common law 
heritage of Canada.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>While it would attempt to codify basic sentencing principles, eliminating this 
most basic judicial discretion, at the same time it would bestow huge new 
discretionary powers to a whole range of persons within the justice system. The 
common thread in those new powers is that all are to the benefit of the offender in 
the sense of non-custodial consequence for criminal actions.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>While sentencing reform calls for protection, this bill offers platitudes. 
Where it calls for clarity it offers confusion and outright hypocrisy. It will 
almost certainly cause the already skyrocketing criminal justice budget to 
expand further still.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	To continue with this theme, I received a letter from the 
executive director of the Canadian Police Association, Mr. 
Newark, dated June 13, 1995. In part, Mr. Newark wrote:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>I have taken the liberty of writing to you in the last hope that practicality 
might intrude on what appears to be a predetermined decision to see this 
legislation passed. I should add, at the outset as some of you may know, that the 
perspective of this letter comes from rank and file police officers who work in 
our nation's courtrooms on a daily basis, and my own personal experience as a 
trial prosecutor for 12 years.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>This bill attempts to codify some, and I emphasize only some, of the basic 
principles of sentencing which evolved in our courts over the last hundred years 
or so. It is a classic example of bureaucratic arrogance which assumes that using 
a particular phrase or sentence will somehow make everything constant and in 
accordance with ``principles'' determined as valid within the federal 
Department of Justice.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>When I first saw this bill, which was in 1992 as Bill C-90 from the Tory 
regime, I was convinced that it must have been drafted by people who had never 
seen the inside of a court room other than as an academic observer. My 
subsequent investigation has proved that to be correct which is far from 
comforting. No matter what one's view of how sentencing should occur, this 
bill's approach of attempting to redefine principles will result in endless 
litigation which will add millions of wasted dollars of expense to a system that is 
now struggling to make more efficient use of existing resources.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Even the much publicized sexual orientation clause is an example of how 
unnecessary this bill is. Section 718.2 merely directs that an offence motivated by any 
of the listed factors, including sexual orientation, shall be viewed as an aggravating 
factor by the sentencing court. Has anyone, ever, cited a case where a court said it was 
not an aggravating factor? Any such judicial position would be an error of law and it is 
so obvious that in my time in court I never encountered or heard of such a  suggestion </BLOCKQUOTE>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13931"> 13931 </A></B>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>and indeed, to the contrary, all sentencing texts or digests dealing with current 
practice recognize such motivation as an aggravating factor.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>In short this controversial section is completely unnecessary. It has always 
been my observation that while unnecessary legislation is generally unwise, it is 
especially so when dealing in criminal law-I would ask that you keep in mind 
that both our association and the chiefs of police (and, by the way, every crown 
attorney I've spoken with) opposed the passage of this bill.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Bill C-41 is a badly drafted, inconsistent, self-contradictory bill which is truly 
the creation of a bureaucracy which unlike elected representatives has no 
constituency or ultimate accountability.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>(1625) </B>
<P>
	This letter was written by the executive director of the Canadian 
Police Association and those are his comments and opinions about 
the bill.
<P>
	Also within the letter he indicates this viewpoint is shared by the 
chiefs of police and the crown attorneys he knows and has talked to 
and also the peace officers. I find it very strange the justice minister 
embraces the opinion of the chiefs of police and the Canadian 
Police Association with regard to Bill C-68, the gun control bill.
<P>
	The minister has regularly and repeatedly used them as support 
for pushing through the gun control legislation. However, when it 
comes to Bill C-41 their opinion is no good. Why is their opinion 
fine and sound and wise on support of Bill C-68 or portions of it 
and unwise and unacceptable on Bill C-41? There is an 
inconsistency here that escapes me. It simply escapes me that the 
justice minister would use these organizations, their opinions and 
their support to justify one bill but would completely ignore their 
scathing denunciation of Bill C-41. I would like to place that on the 
record.
<P>
<B>(1630) </B>
<P>
	This bill also relates to section 745 of the Criminal Code. 
Section 745 of the Criminal Code allows first degree murderers or 
those who have been sentenced to over 15 years imprisonment the 
opportunity for early parole or at least to apply for a reduction of 
their parole ineligibility after serving 15 years. Of course it applies 
mostly to first degree murderers.
<P>
	I ask: What is a human life worth? What is a fair and just penalty 
for someone who has premeditated and deliberately taken the life 
of an innocent person? What is a fair and just penalty for that?
<P>
	When the government removed the death penalty from the 
Criminal Code we received the assurance that society would be 
protected by a term of life imprisonment for those convicted of first 
degree murder and that they would have no eligibility for parole for 
25 years. However, at the time I suggest 99 per cent of Canadians 
were unaware that section 745 was created and placed in the 
Criminal Code.
<P>
	Yes, hon. members can say that it was debated here in the House 
but it was debated before the proceedings were televised. I suggest 
that very few people were aware that section 745 was placed in the 
Criminal Code and what it  meant. I suggest it was a betrayal if not 
a deception on the part of the government of the day against the 
people of this country. My office has received calls and letters from 
people indicating clearly they were not aware of what the 
government intended when it introduced section 745 into the 
Criminal Code.
<P>
	We introduced an amendment to this bill that would strike 
section 745 from the Criminal Code entirely so that a life sentence 
would mean a life sentence. At least that would place a greater 
sense of worth on a human life and when someone deliberately 
with premeditation and intent took a human life there would be a 
penalty to pay. Regardless of whether there is rehabilitation, 
regardless of whether there is remorse of any sort, the penalty must 
be paid. We are saying it ought to be exactly what the government 
promised in the seventies when this change was being considered. 
We moved to strike that. I oppose Bill C-41 on that basis as well.
<P>
	In summing up I would like to go back to the business of 
violence in society which has led to a categorizing of individuals. 
This bill would have the courts impose a greater penalty for certain 
crimes. If I am assaulted because someone hates me and if I fit 
within the categorization in this bill, my attacker will receive a 
greater penalty. If I do not fit within that category, then my attacker 
may not receive a greater penalty. That is the crux of this whole 
concern as far as I am concerned. It is creating status by 
categorizing groups of people. I think it is wrong.
<P>
<B>(1635) </B>
<P>
	As I said before, what will create bias and prejudice quicker than 
anything else is for example by my telling you, Mr. Speaker, that 
because you have brown eyes you are not as good as I am because I 
have blue eyes and I do have blue eyes. We must avoid that at all 
cost. This bill does not avoid that. We are moving to the edge of a 
slippery slope when we begin by statute to create special rights for 
groups of people.
<P>
	If we want to reduce the degree of hate crimes within our 
country, this bill does not contain the power to do it. How do we 
eliminate those emotions that give rise to hate and to hate crimes? 
In all of my lifetime the only way I have found to do that is by 
understanding and love. Only one thing will replace hate in the 
mind and heart of an individual from my experience.
<P>
	I grew up in my family of seven brothers, my mother and my 
father. I have raised a family of four with my wife. We have gone 
through the gamut of feelings and emotions, including frustration, 
anger, bitterness, all of those negative feelings every human being 
is subjected to. I know that if I do not sit by a warm heater when I 
am cold I am not going to get warm. If I do not open my mind and 
heart to the feelings of love from my family, my neighbours and 
my colleagues, the bitterness even of this place that comes to me 
from time to time will get the better of me. I see traces of this.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13932"> 13932 </A></B>
<P>
	The hon. member from the Bloc spoke about psychological 
violence. I hope I am not out of place, but I have to ask what kind of 
psychological violence occurred in the Liberal caucus when their 
leader, the Prime Minister of this country, used words to say: ``You 
must do as I say and if you do not this is what is going to happen to 
you''. This was said to grown men and women who were freely 
elected in a democratic election by the people of this country. What 
happens?
<P>
	There are two types of violence. There is the physical violence, 
which this bill attempts to address and I think fails miserably, and 
there is the mental violence. I often think the mental violence is far 
worse because it precedes the physical violence. Unless we look as 
a Parliament at the causative factors that lead to bias, prejudice and 
hatred, we as elected officials are not going to be successful in 
dealing with the problem. If we begin to create those things that 
will frustrate me and frustrate my children by saying that they are 
not equal in the law with all other Canadians, we are on a slippery 
slope.
<P>
	I go back to my childhood days when yes, the ethnic jokes were 
there and the put downs were there, but we did not mind. Why? 
Because we knew we stood equal before the law. As soon as that 
changes-and we can look at countries that do not have laws which 
allow people to stand equal before the law, where there is special 
status and special rights and privileges-we will see the anger, the 
frustration and the hate.
<P>
	With respect this bill does not address those factors. If the justice 
minister feels that by introducing a category of groups of people 
who will receive special treatment at the hands of the court over 
people who are not categorized within those groups, I think it is 
wrong. I am also absolutely amazed that the justice minister, who 
portrays a great degree of intelligence, could bring forward this 
kind of a document. I cannot support it.
<P>
<B>(1640) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Allmand:</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. I am 
wondering, with unanimous consent, whether I could put a question 
to the hon. member with respect to his speech. I know that for his 
speech there is no provision for questions, but I am wondering if 
we could have unanimous agreement to put a question to him.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> The House has heard the 
request from the hon. member for Notre-Dame-de-Grâce. Is there 
unanimous consent?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Warren Allmand (Notre-Dame-de-Grâce, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I want to pay tribute to the hon. member who worked very 
hard in the committee. In his speech he suggested that there were 
provisions in the bill that would give priority to people with brown 
eyes and blue eyes. He said that the bill might favour people with 
blue eyes as opposed to those with brown eyes or brown eyes as 
opposed to blue eyes, that one would be in a more favoured 
position than the other. That is not correct. I would ask the member 
to look at this once again.
<P>
	The bill states, for example, hate based on race. It does not state 
that any one race would have precedence over another. They are all 
equal. In other words, if the violence was committed against whites 
it would be subject to the provisions of this bill, as would violence 
committed against blacks or against people with yellow skin. No 
group is given priority over the other.
<P>
	With respect to nationalities, it states nationality. It does not 
state English over French or English over Polish. It states religion. 
It does not state Jewish before Catholics or Catholics before 
Presbyterians. In other words, there is no prioritizing of any of the 
groups. They are all equal.
<P>
	All races, all nationalities, all colours, all religions, all sexes, all 
ages, all mental or physical disabilities are equal and all sexual 
orientations are equal. If people were to attack heterosexuals they 
would be protected by the provisions of this bill as would gays and 
lesbians.
<P>
	The member was in the committee when the Canadian Bar 
Association and the Barreau du Québec, very eminent lawyers, 
made that very exact submission. How can he say that the bill 
favours one group over another when it obviously does not? It is in 
very general terms and no one group is favoured over another. That 
was the evidence presented to us by the eminent lawyers who 
appeared before the committee.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ramsay:</B> Mr. Speaker, the intervention from the hon. 
member is appreciated but he misses the point.
<P>
	My point is that there are categories. He has mentioned the 
categories. Inasmuch as I fit into that category, then I am protected. 
What happens if I do not fit into that category and I am assaulted? 
The member for Wild Rose asked that if he is attacked by someone 
who hates fat people, what category does he fit into? That category 
is not there. If I am attacked and assaulted because I am a member 
of a particular political party, which I am, where in the bill am I 
protected? I am not because that is an excluded category.
<P>
	I understand what the hon. member is saying but that was not the 
point I was making. The point I am making is that as soon as we 
start to make categories we had better not stop because there is an 
unlimited number of reasons that people are angry and hate other 
people. Whether they are fat, or ugly or just simply irritable for 
some reason or another-
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> Or rich.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ramsay:</B> Yes, rich or poor perhaps. That is the point I am 
making. I thought my point was clear, but if it was not then I hope 
that the intervention made by my hon. colleague will help clarify it.
<P>

<P>
	<B>Mr. Harris:</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. On this 
important debate, I just wanted to ask the Speaker to check and 
determine whether quorum is present in the House.
<P>
<B>(1645 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> I see a quorum. We will 
resume debate. We will go to the next stage of debate where 
members will have 20 minutes for their interventions subject to 10 
minutes of questions or comments.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Hedy Fry (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Health, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I will be sharing my time. I am glad of 
the opportunity to speak to this bill. I am excited about what Bill 
C-41 means and seeks to accomplish for all Canadians.
<P>
	This follows years of law reform commissions that have spoken 
clearly on the need to find a purpose and principle for sentencing. 
This justice minister and this government is finally doing 
something about it.
<P>
	I do not understand why it is that third party members of the 
House oppose the bill with such vitriol and emotion. What do they 
disagree with? That is what I would like to know. Do they disagree 
that sentences should denounce unlawful conduct and deter others? 
Do they disagree that sentencing where appropriate should separate 
the offender and safeguard society? Do they disagree with 
rehabilitation and accepting responsibility for one's crime?
<P>
	Surely they must agree that reparation to the victim as a first 
priority is important. What is there to disagree with? Is it that the 
punishment must be proportional to the severity of the crime and to 
the degree of responsibility of the offender? Would the third party 
have us give generic sentencing regardless of age of offender or 
gravity of crime?
<P>
	Should a nine-year old be as culpable as a 25-year old? Should 
traffic violations be punished in the same way as second degree 
murder?
<P>
	Excuse me if I wax sarcastic here but the purpose and principle 
of sentencing in the bill are so logical, so common sense, that I 
have a hard time understanding what the opposition is about.
<P>
	There are three other provisions of the bill that I would like to 
address today: first, the section of the bill which provides for 
measures that are alternative to incarceration; second, those aspects 
that address victim's rights in the sentencing process; and third and 
most important, I will speak to section 718 of the bill that lists 
among other things aggravating factors that would lead to an 
increase in the severity of the sentence.
<P>
	Alternative to incarceration is logical. It is sensible and it says in 
a nutshell in language that even I, who am not a lawyer, can 
understand that one ties sentencing to the severity of the crime.
<P>
	It simply says that people who present no threat to society should 
not be incarcerated and should be offered  an option for conditional 
sentencing, that they should pay their dues within the community 
with due supervision, to do community and victim restitution.
<P>
	If a fine is involved-one-third of people in provincial jails are 
there purely because they could not afford to pay their fines-and 
they cannot pay, the provinces can revoke licences or permits or 
they can set up a formula for repaying the fine in hours of 
restitution to the community.
<P>
	If third party members do not believe in the common sense and 
fairness of this, surely they must agree with the economic logic. It 
saves the taxpayer the expense of incarceration.
<P>
	The second part of the bill that I want to talk about, section 745, 
deals with the victim and sentencing. The impact of crime on the 
victim, the family and the caregiver is going to be important and it 
is going to be held and taken into consideration in sentencing.
<P>
	It helps the offender to see the real effects that the impact of the 
crime had on real people. Surely that fulfils the principle of 
responsibility of the offender because it makes an offender directly 
responsible to the victim, to pay restitution to the victim or family. 
It places this as a priority above all else.
<P>
	I do not understand what it is that a third party whose members 
sit in the House and tout themselves as the advocates of the victim 
over and over could disagree with this part of the bill.
<P>
	Finally, I want to speak to section 718.2 of the bill. It is the most 
controversial part and the third party members really oppose it if 
we want to get down to brass tacks. It takes into account the 
aggravating factors in sentencing. These are simple and clear. They 
are: crimes of abuse, of position, of trust or authority. These would 
be seen as an aggravating factor. I will read this. ``Evidence of the 
offence was motivated by bias, prejudice or hate based on race, 
national ethnic origin, language, colour, religion, sex, age, mental 
or physical disability, sexual orientation or any other similar 
factor''.
<P>
<B>(1650) </B>
<P>
	I want to pick up on two terms: evidence, and any other similar 
factor. I have heard it said in the House by third party members that 
we are on a witch hunt. We are paranoid. We are going to charge 
anyone who beats up on anyone because we are going to think it is 
done because of hate. However there has to be evidence after the 
person has been found guilty that it was done because of hate. That 
is clear.
<P>
	We just heard the previous speaker mention the fact that he felt 
we were setting up separate lists of people and giving certain 
people special status over others. He mentioned fat people. There is 
a part of section 718.2 which says similar factor. Similar factor 
takes into consideration anything which is missing from the list. 
The hon. member should really wonder about the whole thing. I 
wonder if he has read the complete bill.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13934"> 13934 </A></B>
<P>
	I want to talk about why the members of the third party are 
concerned about this. If we want to take away the red herring of 
whether we include everybody or whether we do not include 
everybody, the clear fact is that what hon. members opposite 
oppose is the inclusion of sexual orientation. That is what they 
oppose. I want them to know that I applaud the inclusion of that 
term.
<P>
	When I was a physician I saw many young men come into the 
emergency room with injuries from beatings inflicted because they 
were gay. Gay bashing in my riding is a favourite Friday and 
Saturday night sport when brave, macho males drive into town and 
identify men who are gay, or even worse, who they think are gay, 
and in bullying, frightened, drunken bravado afflict brutal harm on 
these people.
<P>
	My son, when he was 17 years old, was coming home one night 
with a friend. He was waiting at a bus stop. Because he was with a 
male colleague who was in his class they were beaten badly. They 
were called faggots. Were it not for the fact that six people came 
down the street and stopped it, my son and his friend would have 
probably been brought into the emergency room dead. That is what 
I talk about when I talk about crimes inflicted on people because of 
hate. When a person commits a crime on another because of who 
they think they are, they inflict it on all the people who fit into that 
group.
<P>
	I am sorry if I am getting a little emotional. This stuff happens. It 
is real. We can talk in the House about what the law says, about the 
fine points, about dotting the <I>i</I>'s and crossing the <I>t</I>'s and fiddling 
around with every word. But in real life, in the real world, that is 
happening every single day.
<P>
	It is not limited to men in my riding. Lesbians have been the 
target of these night time cruises purely because of their sexual 
orientation, purely for that reason and for no other.
<P>
	Have we learned nothing from history? In the very beginning the 
crusades were religious wars. More recently in Nazi Germany 
people were targeted and beaten because they were Jews. Those 
acts of violence, which were sanctioned by governments, did not 
begin as a war; they began as individual acts of violence, which 
escalated to group violence, which finally reached genocide.
<P>
	Have we learned absolutely nothing from the past? Do we sit 
here in these seats in the House of Commons confident that because 
we are living in a diverse and tolerant society, because we have 
people in the House who are of different colours and religions, that 
we have progressed?
<P>
	I sat here and I listened to the member who spoke very piously 
about setting up special status for people and giving them special 
rights. The gays, the lesbians and the bisexuals in my riding and in 
Canada have special rights all right. They have the right to be 
beaten up every Friday and Saturday night, to be denied the right to 
work, the right to live, the right to walk down a street, to  go to a 
movie and to enjoy the things which members in the House take for 
granted.
<P>
<B>(1655 ) </B>
<P>
	What does the member who spoke so glibly know about hate and 
prejudice? The member is one person of a majority group in the 
House. He has status. He does not ever have to know what it is like 
to be vilified or discriminated against. I know what it is like. Just 
because my group is now accepted does not mean that I cannot 
speak for the groups that are not accepted.
<P>
	Every day members of the third party get up in the House and 
bleat about how they are advocates for victims across Canada and 
how they speak for the rights of victims. Well shame on them for 
not supporting the bill. In doing so, they have abandoned the gays 
and lesbians of the country who are the daily victims of violence.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dick Harris (Prince George-Bulkley Valley, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I come from a city in central British Columbia where we 
have a tremendous problem right now. Some young people that 
hang around together think it is fun to walk down the street and 
beat people. They do not take time to discriminate and find out 
what colour the person is. They do not take time to determine if the 
person happens to be a homosexual or take the time to check out 
the religion of their victim. They just beat people up.
<P>
	Members of the Reform Party have been trying to say that the 
assaults they are committing are of no less severity than if they take 
the time to find out what religion their victims are, whether it is a 
homosexual or some other little group the government wants to put 
people into.
<P>
	The member is trying to tell us that indiscriminate beating on 
someone just for the sake of beating, because they happen to like 
beating someone up, is not as severe an action if it had been 
someone who fits conveniently into some Liberal category. This is 
absolute nonsense.
<P>
	I am led to believe that the member is apparently an intelligent 
person. How on earth can the member stand and tell us because a 
victim fits into some category the Liberal government wants to 
dream up because special interest groups got to it, that an assault in 
that category can be any more severe than an assault on any other 
category?
<P>
	The problem is, when the Liberals were on their so-called fact 
finding mission, they took the time to invite every special interest 
group they could possibly think of to come and talk to them about 
the criminal justice system. They forgot one thing. They forgot to 
talk about Canadians as a whole. I use the word Canadian proudly. 
Everyone who lives in this country is a Canadian and is entitled to 
equal justice under the law no matter what colour or religion, 
whether they are homosexual, a Protestant or a Catholic.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13935"> 13935 </A></B>
<P>
	For the government to suggest that because of a person's 
preference or religion or whatever, that a crime committed against 
them should be more severe than a crime committed against 
someone who is an ordinary Canadian is absolutely ludicrous and 
serves only to garner favour with special interest groups that put 
the government in power. Average Canadians are going to throw 
the government out in the next election.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Colleagues, I would like to 
take a moment to make an observation at this point. We are very 
early in a debate that has a maximum six hour limit. Usually there 
is an indication to the Chair when members are going to split their 
time. I do not have any indication yet of what the other parties 
might be doing, only that a large number of members want to 
participate in the debate.
<P>
<B>(1700) </B>
<P>
	When members are splitting their time they only get five 
minutes for questions or comments. To facilitate the participation 
of as many members as possible the Chair will try to maintain those 
time slots. If a member takes four minutes, ultimately the answer 
will be very brief. It is certainly up to each and every member. If he 
or she wishes to use the entire five minutes for questions or 
comments, so be it.
<P>
	In this instance regrettably I will set the tone. I will ask the 
parliamentary secretary to use no more than one minute in her 
response because ultimately I should go on to the next speaker.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Fry:</B> Mr. Speaker, I wondered for a while whether it was a 
question or a speech. The member asked how would I know it was 
an indiscriminate beating. My son has gone with girlfriends down 
those same streets at that same time in the city of Vancouver and 
has never been touched. He was called a faggot. That was the word 
used. That is a term used by the people who cruise. Its called going 
into town to gay bash. That is hate directed at a group.
<P>
	I do not know if the member knows what he means by special 
interest groups. The bill deals with women, children, elders and 
victims. Now we are being told by members of the third party that 
women are a special interest group. Actually they have said that 
already. Now children are special interests and victims are special 
interests. Everyone is a special interest as far as members of the 
third party are concerned. They do not speak for Canadians. I do 
not know who they speak for.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bill Graham (Rosedale, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is a great 
privilege to speak on the important piece of legislation before the 
House today.
<P>
	We have heard a lot about the legislation. I asked myself three 
questions when I looked at the nature of the legislation. First, what 
does the legislation do? Second, is it necessary? Third, are there 
any unintended or unfortunate consequences arising out of the 
legislation? We have heard a lot of talk about some unfortunate 
things that might arise out of the legislation.
<P>
	What does the legislation do? It is a comprehensive revision of 
the nature of sentencing, something that has been advocated by law 
reform commissions, jurists and criminologists for the last 20 
years. We have called out for a comprehensive, important revision 
of the standard under which sentencing will be conducted. This is 
an omnibus bill that addresses those issues. It is an extremely 
important bill that results from studies to grasp the nature of 
punishment that will prevent crime and at the same time 
rehabilitate. The bill is directed to that.
<P>
	It is most unfortunate that discussion in the House has turned 
around section 718.2 which requires the court to take into 
consideration whether a crime was motivated by bias, prejudice or 
hate based on national origin, language, colour, race, religion, 
physical disabilities, sexual orientation or any other similar factor. 
Since third party members have spent their whole time talking 
about nothing but this and accenting it, let me turn to that question 
and deal with it.
<P>
	Is there a need for this provision? Yes, there is. We have heard 
the parliamentary secretary speak. We live in the century of World 
War II and of the Holocaust. We can look at the former Yugoslavia 
about which we have debated in the House. What is taking place in 
Bosnia today is based on years of hatred brought on by sectarian 
strife, by people hating one another and holding one another in 
contempt. In the foreign affairs committee we heard from the B'nai 
Brith that knows something about this matter. You might listen to 
this, over there in the third party.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Order. I caution members 
that this debate has a great deal of sensitivity. It is a debate where 
there are some very strongly held views, and I know we want to 
conduct it in a respectful fashion. All interventions must be made 
through the Chair, through the Speaker, and not directly from one 
member across the floor to another.
<P>
<B>(1705) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Graham:</B> Mr. Speaker, our committee received a report 
from the B'nai Brith called ``The Extreme Right: International 
Peace and Security at Risk''. The report of some 350 pages shows 
that there are still virulent strains of anti-Semitism and racism 
present in the world which need attention. The report also draws a 
link between racism, anti-Semitism and homophobia. They are in 
accordance with the report one and the same thing. The report 
makes clear that they are the same voices that call for the 
elimination of people who are different.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13936"> 13936 </A></B>
<P>
	When speaking of extremism in respect of the United States, the 
report indicated:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>A major focus of extremism is on homosexuality. Believers have every right to 
maintain that homosexuality is inconsistent with their theology, but when 
anti-homosexual campaigns move outside the church and in the public arena 
characterize gays as sick, disease ridden, perverted by choice, and unfit comrades 
for clean living solider boys then this is clear extremism. Gay Americans have 
become the major new scapegoat in their country, perhaps to an extent unknown 
in other democratic nations, and just as surely as Julius Steicher's <I>Der Sturmer</I> 
was a direct contributor to Nazi anti-Semitism with all that it led to, so arguably 
the homophobic outpouring from religious extremists leads to gay bashing and 
murder.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	When I hear comments from members of the House about 
relativism and about characterizing one group as being outside the 
bounds of protection afforded by civilized society and refer to 
natural law, I think of that quote and I shudder. My natural law is 
found in the Supreme Court of Canada in Egan v. Nesbitt which 
holds that discrimination is outlawed in the country.
<P>
	When members on the other side of the House talk about 
extremism and the problem of violent incidents, I could cite dozens 
of violent incidents in urban ridings in the country. In my own 
riding of Rosedale, like the member for Vancouver Centre, I know 
of people walking down Church Street and having had cars pull up 
and people jump out who have beaten them up, crying that they 
were gay.
<P>
	In August 1989 Alain Brosseau, a young man who was perceived 
to be gay, was thrown to his death from the Interprovincial Bridge 
between Ottawa and Hull, which we can see from this building. His 
attackers testified in court that they were just out to roll a queer. 
One of the attackers stated that he had put an imitation gun ``to the 
gay's head and he freaked out-I started laughing''. Another of the 
youths dangled him upside down from the bridge, said: ``Oh, I like 
your shoes'', and then let go.
<P>
	In this same city two strangers approached a man returning to 
Ottawa from Hull and asked him where he had been. When he gave 
the name of a local gay bar they remarked: ``Oh, you are a fag'' and 
beat him so badly that he was in the hospital for two days.
<P>
	I heard cries from across the House as the former speaker was 
saying: ``Give me a break''. Nobody gave those people a break. 
One of the reasons they did not get a break was the sense that they 
were fair game as put out in speeches such as we have heard here 
that allow people to be attacked for their comportment, their 
religion or their race because they fall outside a tolerated group by 
certain groups in our society.
<P>
	This is no longer tolerable conduct in a civilized society. We 
must not allow it to continue. We must address it in the criminal 
law. We must frame a criminal law that has as its source a notion of 
what civilized behaviour is about, which tells our citizens that if 
they go down this road they will be going into the dark hole that  
led Nazi Germany into the wars of the past that have ruined Europe. 
We live in a tolerant society. We live in a pluralistic society. Let us 
not be fooled by the suggestions put forward that the bill will 
somehow lead to unintended consequences like condoning 
pedophilia and other crimes.
<P>
	The minister has agreed to an amendment which was legally not 
necessary but one which addressed the issue by saying that it would 
not make lawful any previously unlawful conduct. This was never a 
real suggestion. How could it conceivably be said when a judge is 
considering the appropriate sentence to hand down on a given case, 
the weight to be given to the surrounding circumstances to prevent 
further like crimes, that it is relevant? We must not forget that the 
bill deals with sentencing and how to prevent anti-social conduct. 
The judge takes these circumstances into account.
<P>
<B>(1710 ) </B>
<P>
	How could that conceivably ever lead to an increase in 
pedophilia, which is a criminal offence known to every judge? It is 
a total red herring. It has been raised by those who want to discredit 
the notion of a modern, compassionate, intelligent criminal law 
that seeks to root out or extirpate evils in society: hatred, racism, 
homophobia and other forms of intolerable civil behaviour.
<P>
	We live in a land in which we have had the privilege of peaceful 
enjoyment as citizens of the country. We are fortunate. We can 
walk down every street generally free from fear. That is not to say, 
as members opposite have said, that if we walk around in the 
middle of the night we too might never be the subject of an attack. I 
do not deny that. It is a possibility.
<P>
	However, I am asking members opposite and other members of 
the House to think of what the bill is doing for people who walk, 
every day of their lives, down the city streets and are targets of 
attacks that go to the nature of their humanity and the nature of 
their being. It is not because they happen to be a haphazard article 
of attack. The member for Wild Rose said he might be attacked 
because he was fat.
<P>
	The member is quite right. I have been accused of looking too 
English and might one day be attacked for that. However that is not 
a risk that the member for Wild Rose or I take every day of our 
waking lives, knowing that we could be the specific targets of 
people's abuse just because of our human nature, our race or our 
religion.
<P>
	This comprehensive sentencing bill was the result of years of 
study. Sociologists, criminologists and the most learned jurists of 
the country are trying to come to grips with how we can have a 
modern Criminal Code that will ensure that all Canadians will be 
able to live in this blessed land and be able to move into the 21st 
century in a pluralistic and tolerant society, one in which all of us 
can be proud to live with as much ease and security as possible in 
the modern, civilized society of today.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13937"> 13937 </A></B>
<P>
	That is the reason I am proud to speak on the bill and I am proud 
to be a member of the government that has introduced it.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Warren Allmand (Notre-Dame-de-Grâce, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I have two questions I should like to put to the hon. 
member who is known to be an eminent lawyer.
<P>
	Members of the Reform Party have suggested that in section 
718.2 certain groups are favoured over others. For example, if 
people are attacked or a crime is committed against them because 
of their race, national ethnic origin, language, et cetera, they are 
favoured in sentencing over people who do not belong to the groups 
listed. In committee we amended that section to add the words ``or 
any other similar factor'' so that there would now be no limitation 
on the groups to be considered under the hate crime provisions.
<P>
	Now, with that amendment made in committee, if people were 
attacked because they were bald, fat, Liberals, or Reformers, they 
would be taken up in the new wording added in committee ``or any 
other similar factor''. I would ask the hon. member to comment on 
that.
<P>
	Second, it has been suggested that even if we were to include all 
other groups, why should we have a harsher sentence for a hate 
crime against a group than for a hate crime against an individual. Is 
it not true that if in the Criminal Code the maximum penalty for a 
crime is 10 years, 15 years or life-and I give the example of the 
Reform Party member of people in his town going down the street 
and beating up people because they are hateful, not because they 
are hateful against the group-the judge can give the maximum 
sentence? If it is 10 years he can give 10 years.
<P>
	This clause states that if he was to give five years rather than the 
maximum he might give two more years; he might give seven 
years. If it is a crime against an individual, could the judge not give 
the full maximum sentence even though no hate under this section 
was allowed?
<P>
	I will put those two questions to the hon. member.
<P>
<B>(1715 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Graham:</B> Mr. Speaker, I think those are two very good 
questions from the learned chairman of the justice committee.
<P>
	We are struggling here trying to understand our role as 
parliamentarians with respect to giving instructions to courts and 
judges on how to review these cases. The hypothetical case the 
member has put illustrates clearly that what the judge is being 
called upon to do is weigh this in his or her mind to determine the 
social evil there and be able to add to the sentence that would 
otherwise be handed down. There is no question that if the assault 
is particularly vicious and if the assault calls for the maximum 
penalty, the judge is perfectly at liberty to give that penalty to 
anyone who commits an assault.
<P>
	We are seeking to give our judiciary the opportunity to send a 
signal to society. The purpose of sentencing is to send signals to 
society; it is not just retributive justice. The purpose of sentencing 
is to send signals to society as to what conduct is tolerable in a 
civilized society and to enable the court to give extra time for such 
behaviour to indicate to people that this type of behaviour will not 
be tolerated. That is precisely what the member's question 
illustrates, that we have here an opportunity that will enable our 
courts to speak to the issues and deal with them. In that sense, it is a 
very intelligent addition to the rest of the sentencing bill.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Myron Thompson (Wild Rose, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
connection I cannot get from the hon. member is when he says that 
when they do these things we are going to get tough and we are 
going to do this, and that will deter it. Well, for two years I have 
been saying that we have to get tough on people who murder or 
sexually assault people.
<P>
	My friends from the Bloc say I want to throw everybody in jail, 
lock them up and throw away the key. My friends from the Liberal 
Party say no, that is not the answer. And now all of a sudden it is? 
What has changed? Why is it not applied to everybody when these 
laws are being made? Why say that this particular situation was 
motivated by that, therefore we are going to sock it to them, and 
this situation was motivated by nothing, so we are going to take it 
easy? One is just as dead as the other. The whole thing has to stop.
<P>
	When are we going to address the whole picture and quit picking 
on little areas?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Graham:</B> Mr. Speaker, I have some sympathy with the 
member's position. There is no question that we do not want to 
tolerate the type of anti-social behaviour he referred to. But the 
member is totally ignoring the incredible importance in this of 
being able to deal with other social causes.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Thompson:</B> They do it now. They already do it.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Graham:</B> We have provisions in our Criminal Code that 
make it illegal, for example, to preach hatred against others. These 
are issues that go to the root causes in society.
<P>
	Earlier I referred the member to the problems in the former 
Yugoslavia. We are looking at problems in the world today that he 
and I lived through as we watched a world war evolve and watched 
the hatreds in sectarian areas around the globe evolve. This bill is 
seeking to deal in an intelligent and I would suggest a very well 
thought out way the root causes of those evils, which extend 
beyond the consideration of the mere issue of violence to which the 
member is referring.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="13938"> 13938 </A></B>
<P>
	Criminal acts can be differentiated as one type of criminal act or 
another in terms of their anti-social consequences. This bill is 
telling our judges that is what they should look to. In that sense, I 
support it. It is intelligent and it is needed in the country at this 
time. The police in my riding are telling us that these types of 
crimes are on the rise and that this bill is needed.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Thompson:</B> The police are telling you this bill is no good.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Graham:</B> Believe me, the police in Toronto are telling us it 
is needed. The member is fooling himself if he does not understand 
that.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Réal Ménard (Hochelaga-Maisonneuve, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I understand that, because of what is yet to come, I will 
not be able to talk for 20 minutes consecutively and that you are 
going to interrupt me to allow those who so desire to go to the 
Senate for Royal Assent.
<P>
<B>(1720) </B>
<P>
	Allow me to begin by saying that no party line or differences in 
parties could prevent me from thanking the minister in all sincerity 
today for his show of courage, firstly for having persevered, 
because we all know that if any bill raised controversy or stirred up 
heated debate, the bill that is now before us did.
<P>
	I am very aware that the minister showed great courage, great 
compassion. Allow me to thank him, despite the fact that we 
belong to different parties. I thank him on three levels. First, as a 
parliamentarian, second, as a citizen, and third, as a homosexual.
<P>
	I believe, and I hope that all of the terms I will use are 
parliamentary, yes, I believe that one would really have to be 
obtuse, stubborn or live on another planet to not realize that some 
people in our society are the victims of violence. Some people in 
our society are the victims of violence because they are 
homosexuals.
<P>
	Some people may turn a blind eye to this fact, but that does not 
take away from our duty as parliamentarians not to do as they do. 
Therefore, I simply reiterate my thanks to the Minister of Justice. 
My sincere thanks for his courage. Obviously, I will not make a 
habit of it, but this is a case where sincere thanks are due.
<P>
	I would also like to say, for the benefit of our Reform friends, 
that-we all must admit that they are actually quite clumsy in their 
efforts to understand this reality-it would be interesting for them 
to come spend a day with the gay community. I would also be 
tempted to say, if it is parliamentary, that they have actually been 
rather abrasive in their attempts to remodel Quebec's and Canada's 
democratic institutions.
<P>
	It would be quite informative for our Reform colleagues to come 
and spend a day in the company of a number of spokespersons of 
the gay community, to cross their white picket fences and come to 
the gay part of town. I am giving them an open invitation.
<P>
	I am the hon. member for Hochelaga-Maisonneuve, but just 
beside it, there is the riding of our Bloc Quebecois whip, a nice guy. 
His riding includes Montreal's gay neighbourhood. I invite them to 
drop in, if any of them wish to do the utterly logical thing, which is 
to try to really understand what it is all about.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> We will continue this debate 
after our visit to the Senate.

<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That Bill C-317, an act to amend the Canada Labour Code and the Public 
Service Staff Relations Act (scabs and essential services), be read a second time 
and referred to the Standing Committee on Human Resources Development.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	He said: Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to be able to rise in this 
House today to speak on Bill C-317, anti-scab legislation. This 
bill, which will amend the Canada Labour Code and the Public 
Service Staff Relations Act is aimed at preventing the hiring of 
scabs to replace employees on strike against or locked out by an 
employer covered by the Canada Labour Code and employees on 
strike in the federal public service.
<P>
<B>(1740) </B>
<P>
	The bill is also aimed at maintaining essential services during a 
strike or lockout at a crown corporation or in the public service.
<P>
	As you know, the workers' cause is very important to me. That is 
why I tabled this bill in this House on behalf of the Bloc Quebecois. 
This bill would provide adequate protection to workers currently 
victimized by their employers' disloyal practices.
<P>
	In Canada, more than 10 per cent of the labour force is subject to 
the provisions of the Canada Labour Code. This amounts to 
217,600 workers in Quebec and over 1,083,000 in Canada.
<P>
	The debate on the adoption by the federal Parliament of 
anti-scab legislation that would apply to organizations under its 
jurisdiction is nothing new. In 1980, the hon. Ed Broadbent, then 
leader of the NDP, tabled a private member's bill aimed at banning 
replacement workers. From 1981 to 1992, several unions called 
one after the other on the federal government to introduce an 
anti-scab bill.
<P>
	Finally, in 1990, the Bloc Quebecois tabled, through my 
colleague, the hon. member for Richelieu, a bill aimed at 
prohibiting the hiring of persons to replace Crown corporation 
employees who are on strike or locked out. Unfortunately, this bill 
was defeated at second reading by only 18 votes.
<P>
	In 1977, Quebec legislators passed what is commonly referred to 
as the Quebec anti-scab bill, which went into effect on February 1, 
1978.
<P>
	To understand the reasons behind this bill, we must go back to 
the early 1960s. In that era of great reforms, relations between the 
federal government and unions  made possible a review of labour 
laws that led to a sharp rise in union membership. Unions gradually 
hardened their positions. In the early 1970s, in reaction to the 
Liberals' election and the imposition of their War Measures 
Act-as you will recall-, unions openly dissociated themselves 
from government actions. A strike by the coalition of public sector 
workers gave rise to a new union solidarity. Within a very short 
time, this solidarity moved into the private sector.
<P>
	Afterwards, around the mid-seventies, there were some 
extremely turbulent strikes. I would point out the Firestone strike, 
the Canadian Gypsum strike and, particularly, the infamous United 
Aircraft strike.
<P>
	It is the Parti Quebecois which introduced the concept of 
prohibiting the use of scabs.
<P>
	A significant event happened a week before the bill was passed. 
During a strike at Robin Hood, a federally regulated company in 
Montreal, security guards opened fire on strikers and injured eight 
of them. The person who gave the order to fire was Robert 
Grynszpan. I am giving his name because, later, he suddenly 
reappears in the news.
<P>
	In Quebec, since the anti-scab provisions were adopted, studies 
have revealed that disputes have indeed been shorter.
<P>
	It is obvious that the Quebec legislation was not well received by 
employers. The Conseil du patronat, which was vehemently 
opposed to this legislation, received in 1991 permission to 
challenge it before the Supreme Court. However, it later decided to 
drop proceedings, considering that the climate of labour relations 
had changed since the provisions of the legislation had been 
applied. And this last part should really dictate the conduct of the 
present federal government.
<P>
	The aim of this bill is not to impose on the rest of Canada 
legislation that is essentially Quebec's.
<P>
<B>(1745) </B>
<P>
	In Canada, the tendency seems to be to integrate the principle of 
prohibition of strikebreakers in labour relations practices.
<P>
	Recent laws in Ontario, British-Columbia and at the federal 
level confirm that tendency. These two provinces and Quebec total 
more de 75 per cent of the population of Canada. Therefore, the 
majority of workers and employers are regulated by laws which 
prohibit the use of strikebreakers. Of course, the level of 
prohibition can vary but the principle remains the same and seems 
to be accepted by management as well as by labour unions.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13940"> 13940 </A></B>
<P>
	In Quebec, a number of unions and employers agree that anti 
strikebreaker legislation has significantly reduced the number and 
length of labour disputes. They also recognize it has contributed to 
lowering the risks of violence on picket lines, which is good for 
both parties.
<P>
	Conversely, the use of strikebreakers in recent years has only 
contributed to extending the duration of labour disputes. Statistics 
show that the more important labour disputes in terms of the 
number of workers involved are generally those where 
strike-breakers are used. It was also noticed that the longer a 
dispute lasts the higher the proportion of strikebreakers tends to 
get.
<P>
	The strike of the Ogilvie flour mill in Montreal, which is still not 
resolved, is a good example. If I may, I would like to briefly remind 
my colleagues of a labour dispute that has dragged on and on for 
over a year now, and which could still last a rather long time if we 
do not act soon.
<P>
	In January 1992, the collective agreement between the workers 
of Ogilvie Mills of Montreal and their employer, Labatt, came to an 
end.
<P>
	In June of the same year, the Labatt's Brewery, then the owner of 
the mill, sold it to ADM Archers-Daniels-Midland Co., a U.S. 
multinational corporation.
<P>
	From 1992 to 1993, negotiations to renew the collective 
agreement were unsuccessful, since the employer was presenting 
demands based on the working conditions that are common 
practice in the United States. Can you imagine?
<P>
	From October 1993 to February 1994, the employer unilaterally 
imposed working conditions as established in its own proposal.
<P>
	In February 1994, the union filed a complaint with the Canada 
Labour Relations Board on grounds that the employer was 
negotiating in bad faith. In fact, it was simply refusing to negotiate.
<P>
	On June 6, 1994, a general strike broke out, involving 116 
workers-I should add 116 families.
<P>
	Only four days later, the employer hired scabs to replace these 
workers. Members should note that it did so through a federal 
employment centre. Can you imagine that?
<P>
	I have here in my hands a copy of the ad that was posted in the 
Employment Centre of Verdun. I will take the time to briefly read 
some details that were given. It is really unusual.
<P>
	Date: December 5, 1994, 2.18 p.m., Verdun employment centre. 
Job offer: forklift operator; $10 an hour; temporary; 40 hours a 
week, possible overtime. Where? Ogilvie flour mill. They even 
have the gall to request three to five years experience. But it does 
not mention whether its is three to five years experience as a fork 
lift operator or as a scab. There is a hidden anachronism. Further 
down, it reads: Attention, ongoing labour dispute. One cannot 
claim ignorance. Then comes  the employer's address: 
Archer-Daniels-Midland Co. (Ogilvie Montreal), 950 Mills, 
Montreal, Quebec, H3C 1Y4. I will even give a phone number: 
514-847-8522, and a contact: Francine Farmer. Attention, 
company on strike.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, this takes the cake. This is blatant proof that the 
government was in cahoots with a company which was hiring scabs 
during a labour dispute.
<P>
<B>(1750) </B>
<P>
	The Ogilvie flour mill is still operating, thanks to scabs, since 
this is not prohibited under the Canadian Labour Code. It continues 
to post profits and is using unusual security devices, including 
surveillance cameras, fences, security guards, to monitor strikers 
and bring scabs inside the plant.
<P>
	What is at stake in the negotiations can be summed up as 
follows: the union's demands are quite simple-there are none. 
They are not trying to obtain additional jobs, to enhance job 
security in any way or to obtain any salary increases. The union's 
demand can be summed up in one sentence: to keep jobs the way 
they are and salaries at current levels, period.
<P>
	We could not ask for a better employee attitude in today's 
climate. They have been very, very understanding. However, here 
are but a few of management's demands: first, the right to 
unilaterally modify hours. To put it in simple terms, this means: we 
will make you work when we want, how we want, how long we 
want, where we want.	Second, the abolition of seniority as a consideration in promotions and layoffs. In plain and simple language, the better you are at sucking up, the better your job advancement possibilities. I know no other term for it.
<P>
	Loss of job security still means the same thing, so I will not 
repeat it. Elimination of notice prior to layoff. That means that 
when you leave for work in the morning, give your wife and 
children a big kiss, because when you come home that night, you 
may no longer be working for the same company and you will have 
nothing to say about it.
<P>
	More contracting out: this means that you should not forget to 
tell your wife that it is possible that some guy from out of the blue 
will get hired to do the same job as you.
<P>
	More term employees: this means that the possibility that some 
guy from out of the blue will come in to do your job is even more 
likely.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13941"> 13941 </A></B>
<P>
	Fewer union rights: go back to my first scenario, which was the 
more you suck up, the better the chances of keeping your job.
<P>
	Lastly, the meetings with a conciliator were fruitless. Just to 
make the discussion even more interesting, I would like to add that 
the famous name that I mentioned earlier, the current manager of 
the Ogilvie mill, is none other than Robert Grynszpan, the one who 
gave the order to shoot in the 1977 conflict in which eight strikers 
were wounded in Montreal. In 1977, in a democratic country which 
was not in a state of war, one man gave the order to shoot. Today, 
that same man is the manager of one of Ogilvie's factories in 
Montreal. He is free to walk the streets, like you and me.
<P>
	Because they work in an industry which is covered by the 
Canada Labour Code, the unionized workers of the mill have been 
made to pay for the failure to prohibit the use of strikebreakers 
during a labour conflict under that same code. The mill's 
employees have often demanded that an anti-strikebreaker law be 
brought in for companies falling under the federal government's 
jurisdiction. Despite the promise he made in October 1994, the 
Minister of Human Resources Development put off tabling such a 
law in the House of Commons, as you will recall, until spring 1995. 
Also, the Minister of Labour, when she first took office, stated she 
would make it a priority.
<P>
<B>(1755) </B>
<P>
	This must have been left out of the red book. In other words, it is 
high time the government took steps to stop the kind of labour 
dispute where workers on the picket lines watch strikebreakers get 
their wages because the federal government is doing nothing to 
stop this blatant injustice.
<P>
	Everyone has a right to be respected, and this applies to workers 
as well. They are entitled to a decent standard of living and to be 
respected as individuals who have certain rights. When an 
employer uses pressure tactics like hiring scabs during a legal 
strike, this puts an undue stress on the employees, increases the 
likelihood of violence and undermines the bargaining process.
<P>
	The use of scabs merely leads to dictatorial and disloyal 
practices, collective bargaining unworthy of the name and poor 
labour relations that will have the effect of reducing the quality of 
service, while probably also adding to the ranks of the unemployed.
<P>
	The use of scabs during a labour dispute automatically gives the 
employer an advantage. No wonder that employers who resort to 
this practice are in no hurry to sit down and bargain in good faith.
<P>
	The case for introducing anti-scab provisions very similar to 
those in the Quebec Labour Code is quite straightforward. In 
Quebec, these provisions, introduced in 1978, have stood the test of 
time. After 17 years, they still hold true. Legislation in Ontario and 
British Columbia is in fact based on the provisions in effect in 
Quebec.
<P>
	The purpose of this bill is to introduce a number of democratic 
principles that are now accepted in many countries, including ours, 
principles that we apply every day and which have repeatedly 
proved beneficial to the settlement of labour disputes.
<P>
	The statistics show that since anti-scab legislation was passed in 
Quebec, the duration of labour disputes has decreased by 35 per 
cent, on average. That is something to consider.
<P>
	The Canada Labour Code is certainly not perfectly equipped to 
settle disputes under its jurisdiction. One only has to remember the 
1986-87 Voyageur bus strike; the postal strike a few years ago; the 
strike at the Port of Montreal, which is still fresh in our minds; the 
three month strike at QNS&amp;L in Sept-îles last year; and, must I 
remind you, the infamous strike that has been going on for a year at 
Ogilvie Mills in Montreal.
<P>
	Today, we are at the second reading stage. The members 
participating in the debate, who will have to vote later, must tell us 
whether or not they agree in principle with making social relations, 
labour relations in Canada more civilized. Then, if they want to 
make amendments, they can appear before the legislative 
committee and suggest all kinds of amendments they deem 
relevant or necessary. But, for the time being, we must look at the 
principle-I repeat, principle-of the bill.
<P>
	We must wonder if Quebec, Ontario and British Columbia were 
justified in introducing a civilized labour relations system, which 
restored the real balance of power in negotiations resulting from 
labour disputes.
<P>
	A strike broken by scabs is no strike but a right to strike 
hypocritically denied. Either we are for the right to strike, a basic 
right won by workers after many years of fighting, or we are 
against. If we are in favour, we will not undermine, either directly 
or indirectly, the workers' sacred right to strike, with which 
Canadian employers have learned to live.
<P>
	Employers learned a long time ago about strikes, lockouts and 
the bargaining process. In Quebec, we have lived for 17 years with 
anti-scab provisions, and I submit to you that it would be a shame 
if this House refused to move with the times and bring its labour 
legislation into the 20th century, on the eve of the third millennium.
<P>
	The Canada Labour Code must be updated and improved to meet 
today's needs and realities.
<P>
<B>(1800) </B>
<P>
	And the reality today is that there still are honest workers out 
there who, after having worked 15, 20 or more years for the same 
company, find themselves hitting the pavement on the strike lines 
simply to protect the benefits they have acquired over the years for 
themselves, it goes without saying, and for their families, or quite 
simply to protect their jobs. Every day, they see strikebreakers, 
scabs, take their place and take home their pay. This is 
unacceptable.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13942"> 13942 </A></B>
<P>
	I would like to conclude by saying that this problem has already 
been resolved in three provinces which together represent 70 per 
cent of Canada's population. As this bill targets a small portion of 
this country's labour force, it is obvious, in my opinion, that the 
federal legislation must take into consideration provincial 
legislation and fill in the gaps between the existing laws. It is high 
time, in my opinion, that federal legislation take a step forward and 
restore pride in work and dignity to workers.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Maurizio Bevilacqua (Parliamentary Secretary to 
Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
I rise today to join the debate on Bill C-317, a bill to amend the 
Canada Labour Code and the Public Service Staff Relations Act 
which, if enacted, would prohibit the hiring of replacement workers 
by employers during a legal strike. The bill also contains 
provisions which are intended to ensure that essential services are 
maintained in the event of a strike or a lockout in a crown 
corporation and in the public service.
<P>
	While this bill proposes changes to both the Canada Labour 
Code and the Public Service Staff Relations Act, my comments on 
this bill are confined to those changes which would affect the 
Canada Labour Code.
<P>
	The two specific proposals advanced by the hon. member pertain 
to the institution of collective bargaining. If I may, I would like to 
spend a few moments outlining my views on this institution. In a 
nutshell, I believe in collective bargaining because it works and 
because it is an institution that promotes democratic decision 
making.
<P>
	If one were to go through a copy of the Canada Labour Code, one 
would find at the beginning a preamble to part I, the section that 
deals with labour management relations. In my view, this preamble 
articulates in a very eloquent way why we need and why we have a 
system of free collective bargaining in this country.
<P>
	The preamble refers to the promotion of the common well-being 
through the encouragement of free collective bargaining. It speaks 
of the freedom of association and of free collective bargaining as 
constituting the way to determine good working conditions and to 
promote sound labour management relations. It expresses the 
desire of the Parliament of Canada to extend its support to labour 
and management in their efforts to develop constructive collective 
bargaining practices. In other words, the preamble to part I of the 
Canada Labour Code conveys in no uncertain terms the federal 
government's commitment to the preservation and encouragement 
of collective bargaining.
<P>
	Political parties of all stripes adhere to this belief in collective 
bargaining. Not surprisingly, labour unions also support free 
collective bargaining. Indeed, over the years they have resisted 
with all the resources at their command any effort to restrict worker 
access to free  collective bargaining or to replace it with 
government regulations or other mechanisms.
<P>
	Maintaining that integrity of the collective bargaining process is 
probably the most important concern of the majority of trade 
unionists. For many employers collective bargaining provides an 
efficient way of promoting stability in the workplace, for securing 
the consent of the workforce and for obtaining innovative solutions 
to a variety of workplace issues. Employers who value partnerships 
with labour realize that they can lead to a competitive advantage.
<P>
	Paul Weiler, distinguished Canadian labour lawyer, author and 
Harvard professor, describes it best. He states that collective 
bargaining is a mode of employee representation which serves two 
vital social functions. First, it obtains for workers a measure of 
protection from the employer and the vicissitudes of the labour 
market, protection from substandard wages and benefits and from 
arbitrary and unfair treatment on the job. Second, it affords workers 
a degree of participation in an organization's decision making. It 
requires employees to take responsibility for defining, asserting 
and if necessary, compromising their concerns.
<P>
<B>(1805) </B>
<P>
	As Professor Weiler has written: ``Collective bargaining is as 
intrinsically valuable as an experience in self-government. If one 
believes as I do that self-determination and self-discipline are 
inherently worthwhile, indeed, that they are the mark of a truly 
human community, then it is difficult to see how the law can be 
neutral about whether that type of economic democracy is to 
emerge in the workplace''.
<P>
	As I mentioned, I support our system of collective bargaining not 
only because of its democratic nature, but also because of its 
effectiveness. Something like 95 per cent of all collective 
bargaining disputes in federal jurisdiction governed by the Canada 
Labour Code are resolved without resort to a work stoppage.
<P>
	When a third party is needed and the mediation and conciliation 
service provides assistance, about 90 per cent of disputes are 
settled without work stoppage. Time lost due to strikes and 
lockouts is but a fraction of a per cent, far less than the time lost 
due to workplace accidents.
<P>
	The system works because it places the responsibility for the 
settlement of workplace conflict on the shoulders of those directly 
involved. It acknowledges that labour and management know best 
what their needs are and it calls upon them to take ownership of the 
terms and conditions that govern their employment setting.
<P>

<P>
	By looking south of the border we can get some idea as to what 
would happen in this country if our system of collective bargaining 
were allowed to deteriorate. In the U.S. trade unions and collective 
bargaining are on the ropes and the consequences are starting to be 
noticed. According to the Commission on the Future of 
Worker-Management Relations, the decline of unions has 
contributed to the rise in inequality.
<P>
	The commission reported among other things that the U.S. 
earnings distribution among workers is the most unequal among 
developed countries. Lower paid workers in the U.S. earn markedly 
less than comparable workers in western Europe. U.S. workers 
work about 200 hours more during the year than workers in Europe. 
While occupational accident rates in the U.S. showed little 
improvement over the past decade, they declined significantly in 
Canada over the same period. So distressed were the 
commissioners by what they found that they were moved to 
declare: ``A healthy society cannot long continue along the path the 
U.S. is moving with rising bifurcation of the labour market''.
<P>
	Of course, our industrial relations system is not noiseless. Work 
stoppages do occur and people are inconvenienced. But in the vast 
majority of cases, both labour unions and employers recognize that 
a work stoppage is far more costly than a peaceful settlement. It is 
in the interests of both parties to resolve their differences through 
negotiation rather than through the display of raw power.
<P>
	It should be emphasized that collective bargaining works for 
business as well as labour. The majority of respondents in a survey 
of large employers reported that they are successful in reaching 
their bargaining goals, that they are able to work together with the 
union during the life of a collective agreement and that they have 
the ability to adjust to changes in technology.
<P>
	It seems to me that what employers and managers value above 
all else is stability. Generally speaking, stability is what they get 
through the collective bargaining process.
<P>
<B>(1810) </B>
<P>
	The private member's bill the hon. member has put forward for 
discussion would significantly change collective bargaining for 
enterprises regulated by the Canada Labour Code. It seems to me 
therefore that such reforms ought to be considered within the 
context of a comprehensive review of part I of the Canada Labour 
Code.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dale Johnston (Wetaskiwin, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to participate in the debate today on the bill sponsored by 
the hon. member for Manicouagan.
<P>
	The summary of the bill found on page 1a states that the purpose 
of the bill is to prohibit hiring of persons to replace employees of 
an employer under the Canada Labour Code or of the public service 
who are on strike or locked out.
<P>
	In fact this bill goes much further than just prohibiting hiring of 
new workers. Modelled after labour legislation in Quebec, this bill 
proposes that government prohibit anyone from performing the 
work of a person who is on strike or locked out by companies 
falling under federal jurisdiction, crown corporations and the 
public service. It also includes provisions for the maintenance of 
essential services in the event of a strike or lockout in the public 
service or a crown corporation if public health and safety are at risk 
and it gives increased powers to the Governor in Council.
<P>
	The Public Service Staff Relations Act contains a mechanism for 
providing essential services in strike situations. To replace the 
designated employee category of the act with these provisions 
cannot be viewed as a progressive step.
<P>
	We know that one of the reasons the member is sponsoring this 
bill is that he is concerned over the effects of the year long labour 
dispute at the Ogilvie flour mills in Montreal. Members from all 
sides of this House have expressed concern over the Ogilvie 
situation and we are all anxious to see a speedy resolution. I was 
pleased to hear that progress was made at the mediation meetings 
held on May 25 and 26. There was an agreement to reconvene the 
talks on June 20 and 21.
<P>
	If the hon. member for Manicouagan really wanted to help settle 
that dispute, he should have supported Bill C-262 authored by my 
colleague, the member for Lethbridge. If the government and the 
hon. member and his colleagues were really concerned about the 
workers at Ogilvie Mills and other workers under federal 
jurisdiction, they could have got on the ball and voted for Bill 
C-262 on March 20 and supported the hon. member for Lethbridge 
on his final offer arbitration bill.
<P>
	If the hon. member and his colleagues wanted to protect both 
sides of labour disputes they would advocate final offer arbitration 
as a sure fire solution to settling labour strife.
<P>
	When workers at the west coast ports were legislated back to 
work last year, the Minister of Human Resources Development 
endorsed the use of final offer arbitration as the settlement 
mechanism. The transport committee in its recently released 
national marine strategy recommended a final offer selection 
mechanism for settlement of all disputes between pilots and their 
customers.
<P>
	As I stated in this House on previous occasions there seems to be 
a growing popularity for final offer arbitration. The transport 
committee also recommended that the new Marine Transportation 
Act would provide for final offer selection for the settlement of all 
disputes between the new not for profit seaway corporation and its 
employees.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13944"> 13944 </A></B>
<P>
	I would like to confirm once again that the Reform Party 
believes in the bargaining process and we do not want to interfere 
in the course of two parties coming to an agreement. We see final 
offer arbitration as a tool that is useful to both sides, labour and 
management.
<P>
	There are three provinces in Canada that ban the use of 
replacement workers in strike or lockout situations: Quebec, 
British Columbia and Ontario. Just last week voters elected a 
Progressive Conservative government whose leader promised to 
repeal Bill 40, the NDP's labour legislation and put an end to the 
ban on replacement workers in Ontario. Perhaps my hon. colleague 
would do well to find out if there is public support for anti-worker 
legislation.
<P>
<B>(1815 ) </B>
<P>
	We in the Reform Party are concerned about the impact that 
strikes and lockouts have on workers, employers, and Canadians, 
who most often have to bear the brunt of the cost and 
inconvenience of services withdrawn by monopolistic industries.
<P>
	The recent strikes in the railway emphasize the weakness in the 
Canada Labour Code for preventing a shutdown of essential 
services. I commend the member for attempting to deal with the 
contentious issue of maintaining essential services. However, this 
bill does not contain any provision for the continuation of essential 
services in the private sector.
<P>
	We would all agree the federal government has a responsibility 
to act in the best interest of Canadians, but I am surprised the hon. 
member would increase the powers of the governor in council.
<P>
	In an interdependent world, economic security is threatened by 
major strikes involving services that provide linkage on an 
interprovincial and an international basis. Transportation and 
communication services, for example, are essential to the daily 
movement of people, goods, and services. A shutdown for any 
duration always has significant economic impacts.
<P>
	Canada's competitive advantage is determined by the efficiency 
and reliability of the transportation and communication network it 
relies upon. We simply cannot afford any major shutdowns in the 
networks that link the country together.
<P>
	The Canadian economy was hard hit by the $3 billion railway 
strike in March. The effects of this strike are now seen as 
contributing factors in the lower than predicted gross domestic 
product and the fall of the leading economic indicators. This was a 
hit the Canadian economy could not afford to take.
<P>
	I believe that if final offer arbitration had been in place it could 
have defused the problems that faced the parties in this dispute. It is 
by far the most effective and impartial means of obtaining a 
solution to the concerns of labour and management where an 
impasse occurs that inflicts significant damage on Canadians.
<P>
	There is nothing to prevent both sides from achieving a deal, 
providing they are being fair and open with each other. In fact, the 
presence of an arbitrator who is in a position to adopt either side's 
proposal in entirety exerts a tremendous pressure on both sides to 
reach an agreement. I believe this would preserve and strengthen 
the process by which the parties negotiate a contract.
<P>
	In cases where fundamental issues are at stake, such as 
employment security, an agreement might never occur through 
collective bargaining, and a strike or lockout may only make 
matters worse. The best solution is for someone respected by both 
sides to make a decision on the fairness of one proposal and for the 
process to be viewed as legitimate by both sides. Section 57 of the 
Canada Labour Code which contains provisions for final offer 
settlement by an arbitrator for disputes that occur during the life of 
a collective agreement should be amended to include final offer 
selection in disputes where collective agreements have expired.
<P>
	I want to assure the House that I believe in the collective 
agreement process, but in the area of essential services the 
Canadian people should be protected from costly and disruptive 
work stoppages. Part I of the Canada Labour Code is under review 
at the moment. I urge the Minister of Labour to bring the code into 
line with today's economic realities by expanding the definition of 
essential services and by providing for final offer arbitration in 
work stoppages in essential services when the agreements expire.
<P>
	The end result of a strike or lockout is that the side that is able to 
withstand the damage longest is considered to be the winner. In 
reality, we know that neither side wins. Both parties sustain 
significant losses in relationships and dollars. In the long run, no 
one benefits from a strike, not the workers, not the employers, and 
not the Canadian people. I believe this legislation would inflame 
already strained relations and drive a deeper wedge between labour 
and management.
<P>
<B>(1820) </B>
<P>
	The Canada Labour Code is out of date. As legislators, we must 
find and implement solutions that will best serve the needs of all 
involved.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Osvaldo Nunez (Bourassa, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise in the 
House today to speak to Bill C-317 whose purpose is to add 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13945"> 13945 </A></B>
<P>
anti-scab provisions to the Canada Labour Code and the Public 
Service Staff Relations Act.
<P>
	I want to commend my Bloc Quebecois colleague, the hon. 
member for Manicouagan, on his worthy initiative which I support 
with vigour and enthusiasm, and especially on the excellent speech 
he just made.
<P>
	The purpose of this bill is to ensure there is no undue advantage 
to either party during negotiations, in order to reduce the duration 
of strikes and lockouts. Its objective is also to prevent violence 
during labour disputes.
<P>
	The gist of this bill is as follows: To prohibit the hiring of 
persons to replace the employees of a federally-regulated 
employer who are on strike or locked out and employees of the 
Public Service who are on strike; and to ensure that essential 
services are maintained in the event of a strike or lockout in a 
Crown corporation and in the Public Service.
<P>
	This bill takes its cue from similar provisions introduced in 1977 
by the Parti Quebecois government at the time to amend the 
Quebec Labour Code. Since then, Ontario and British Columbia 
have also passed anti-scab legislation. Today, 75 per cent of 
Canadian workers are covered by these provisions.
<P>
	The legislation passed by the Quebec National Assembly on 
December 22, 1977, prohibiting the use of strike breakers during a 
labour dispute, was the first legislation of its kind in Canada. It was 
passed following some very violent strikes in the seventies, 
including the strike at Firestone and Canadian Gypsum and 
especially the long and difficult dispute at United Aircraft, now 
Pratt &amp; Whitney. The strikers were members of my former union, 
the CAW, the Canadian Auto Workers.
<P>
	Strikes are based on the principle that a work stoppage should be 
an incentive for the employer to agree to and offer better working 
conditions. If the employer can hire replacements for the strikers, 
the strike becomes useless, a costly burden to those who exercise 
this right recognized by the Canada Labour Code, the International 
Labour Organization and all democratic countries.
<P>
	When workers involved in a labour dispute see they are replaced 
by other people who are often escorted by security guards, they 
become exasperated, frustrated and may even resort to violence. 
They are reacting to provocation, and the consequences are 
disastrous.
<P>
	Quebec's adoption of anti-scab legislation was in response to 
strong pressure from the labour movement, and in particular from 
the FTQ. However, the unions criticized the weakness of the 
measures approved in 1977 and demanded the use of personnel to 
replace an employee locked out or on strike be absolutely 
prohibited.
<P>
	In fact, the text of the legislation contained errors, which moved 
the Government of Quebec to propose new amendments to the 
Labour Code in 1983 in order to correct the discrepancies that 
appeared through its use and legal interpretation by the labour 
court, the superior court and the court of appeal.
<P>
	Approximately 114,000 Quebec bank, federal public service, 
federal ports, telecommunications and transportation workers 
come under the Canada Labour Code.
<P>
<B>(1825) </B>
<P>
	This number includes the 116 employees of the Ogilvie-ADM 
mills in Montreal, who are members of the CNTU and for whom 
June 6 marked the anniversary of their first year on strike. This 
dispute has gone on for over a year because of this American 
employer's use of scabs. These workers along with the entire 
labour movement in Quebec and Canada have long called for 
anti-scab legislation federally.
<P>
	This afternoon, I met a group of strikers on Parliament Hill, who 
are currently in the gallery. I would like to salute them and all the 
workers of Ogilvie-ADM, show them my support and express the 
hope that a reasonable solution may be found quickly.
<P>
	I understand their frustrations, because I worked for 19 years at 
the FTQ, where I witnessed and experienced similar disputes. This 
dispute is deteriorating because of a skewed balance of power. I 
also support the campaign waged by the CNTU and the FTQ for the 
inclusion of anti-scab provisions in the Canada Labour Code.
<P>
	On September 18, 1992, an explosion at the Giant Gold mine in 
Yellowknife killed nine miners during a strike in which the 
employer had hired scabs. This tragedy could have been avoided 
with anti-scab legislation. This conflict lasted 18 months, ending 
only in December 1993. Last January, an individual was convicted 
of causing that explosion.
<P>
	An anti-scab law would, of course, significantly reduce the risks 
of violence on picket lines. Under the previous, Tory government, 
the Liberals supported such legislation. Since they came to power 
in 1993, they have moved to the right and changed their position. 
The Minister of Human Resources Development had promised to 
table an anti-scab bill in December 1994. He did not keep his word.
<P>
	The new Minister of Labour now uses the excuse that she intends 
to propose a more extensive reform of the Canada Labour Code, 
arguing that this legislation has not been amended in 20 years. The 
Minister of Labour, who is the hon. member for the wealthy riding 
of Westmount, is even more insensitive than her predecessor in this 
regard.
<P>
	She is probably afraid of hurting the interests of her wealthy 
constituents. Yet, the Ogilvie workers, whose plant is located at the 
boundary of the minister's riding, are still waiting for her to help 
resolve this dispute as she promised.
<P>
	Once again, I ask the government to be consistent with the 
positions defended by its members when they were in opposition 
and to table an anti-scab bill to prevent labour disputes from 
deteriorating and dragging on needlessly. We already know that the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13946"> 13946 </A></B>
<P>
bill tabled by my  colleague from Manicouagan will probably not 
pass without government support, but we will not give up.
<P>
	The government must share the three largest provinces' positive 
experiences and realize that anti-scab measures are needed to 
reduce the risks of sometimes violent confrontation during a strike 
or lockout.
<P>
	In Quebec, as my colleague from Manicouagan said, studies 
point to a significant reduction in the duration of labour disputes 
since these provisions went into effect. The same phenomenon 
occurred in Ontario and British Columbia.
<P>
	We must correct the inequities suffered by the 680,000 workers 
subject to Part I of the Canada Labour Code. Sometimes, a strike is 
the workers' only recourse. Adopting legislation in this area would 
eliminate the inequities suffered by unionized federal workers as 
opposed to their provincial colleagues, who are protected by an 
anti-scab law.
<P>
<B>(1830) </B>
<P>
	In conclusion, I call on the Minister of Labour not to hide behind 
the comprehensive review of the Canada Labour Code and to 
immediately table a bill to this effect. I am asking her to act as 
quickly as she did last March to trample the rights of workers by 
tabling a special back-to-work bill aimed at rail workers.
<P>
	For all these reasons, I strongly support Bill C-317.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. John English (Parliamentary Secretary to President of 
the Queen's Privy Council for Canada and Minister of 
Intergovernmental Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I welcome the 
opportunity to address the House on an issue of concern to the 
government, essential services.
<P>
	There has been much debate on this topic in other jurisdictions 
as it applies to their labour environment. I am sure that everyone 
here appreciates that the federal government is a unique employer, 
one which has a trusted mandate to ensure that Canadians can be 
confident in the delivery of government services.
<P>
	The Public Service Staff Relations Act is a balanced piece of 
legislation, one which has assisted the parties involved in complex 
labour disputes for over one-quarter of a century. It should be 
remembered that it was due to the leadership of a Liberal 
government that federal workers gained the right to collective 
bargaining.
<P>
	However, it was also recognized at that time, and still holds true 
today, that the right to collective bargaining in the federal public 
service cannot be to the detriment of the health, safety and security 
of the Canadian public.
<P>
	Over the years most labour disputes have been resolved 
satisfactorily without the need for back to work legislation. It 
should be noted that the government, as a matter of practice, 
discourages the hiring of outside workers to do the work of striking 
employees. In fact, the current policy of the employer on this 
matter is to rely on managers and staff excluded from the 
bargaining unit.
<P>
	It is also important to recognize that the government has never 
denied the right of individual employees to voluntarily come to 
work during a strike.
<P>
	As I have already indicated, the federal government cannot be 
compared to employers in other sectors. The business of providing 
government services to Canadian citizens can never be considered 
in a similar context to the private sector company, one which 
provides shoes or soap or flour.
<P>
	There are many services provided by the federal government for 
which there is no viable alternative. There is a wide range of 
services which many of us take for granted until that moment when 
they become delayed or are not forthcoming. For example, we 
depend on and have confidence in our meat inspectors and officers 
involved in numerous other federally inspected consumer goods. 
Moreover, we rely on the transportation systems, the patrolling of 
offshore and coastal fisheries and the vigilance of officers at border 
crossings. Individuals on fixed incomes, the unemployed and 
senior citizens depend on the uninterrupted delivery of social 
programs.
<P>
	Without the careful analysis of the effects of new drugs and 
medications being produced for human and animal use, the health 
of Canadians could be at risk. I am sure that each of you here could 
add other areas that I have not mentioned.
<P>
	As members can see, government services are vital to the health 
and security of the public. The present language of the Public 
Service Staff Relations Act ensures that areas essential to the health 
and safety of Canadians are safeguarded by designating positions 
which by law cannot strike before any legal strike activity begins.
<P>
	What this means is that the employer must identify the positions 
that are essential to the health and safety of the public three months 
prior to the notice to bargain and three months prior to the 
expiration of the collective agreement. Therefore, there is at least a 
six month advance notice as to the positions that are to be 
designated.
<P>
	The current process has worked since 1967. As recently as 1993, 
when reviewing proposed changes to the Public Service Staff 
Relations Act, the House in its wisdom saw fit to allow this process 
to continue.
<P>
	All of this reinforces the fact that the federal government 
requires a unique legislated labour framework that is different from 
<P>

<B><A NAME="13947"> 13947 </A></B>
<P>
other employers in order to ensure delivery of services regardless 
of labour difficulties that must eventually be overcome.
<P>
	In addition, it should be realized by all concerned members of 
the House that the legislation must be reviewed in its totality. It is 
not advisable to tinker piecemeal with individual sections of an act. 
Many portions of the Public Service Staff Relations Act were 
drafted for a specific purpose and for special reasons and must be 
viewed in balance with each other.
<P>
<B>(1835) </B>
<P>
	The designation of essential services, for example, which is at 
issue here, was specifically developed to permit the notion of the 
right for federal government employees to strike. It also served to 
allow the government as the employer to cede the right to lock out 
employees.
<P>
	In closing, I must caution my colleagues on the wisdom of 
proceeding with the bill as it relates to the Public Service Staff 
Relations Act without fully appreciating the history and the 
experience behind this important existing legislation.

	The House resumed consideration of the motion that Bill C-41, 
an act to amend the Criminal Code (sentencing) and other acts, be 
read the third time and passed.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Réal Ménard (Hochelaga-Maisonneuve, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, my apologies. I was in committee and I thank you for your 
patience. Before being interrupted to go up to the other Chamber, I 
was extending a friendly invitation to members of the Reform Party 
that would help them understand how terribly important this bill is 
for the gay community.
<P>
	With courage and conviction, I am going to be daring and stand 
by the invitation. Therefore, I turn to the Reform Party, with your 
permission, and I say to them that if, as parliamentarians, they are 
interested in expanding on their knowledge of the reality of the gay 
experience and the potential ill treatment to which gays are 
exposed, I am available to introduce them to spokespersons and 
leaders of these groups, because if their positions and statements 
are any indication, I venture to think that although the members of 
the Reform Party are very knowledgeable in certain areas, they are 
somewhat less so in this particular area.
<P>
	I think that, here as elsewhere, a closer look at reality would 
undoubtedly help them to modify their behaviour and certainly to 
improve their understanding. I therefore  cordially extend to each 
member of the Reform Party an invitation to come and spend a day 
with me in the gay village, so that they can meet with the 
spokespersons and be in-
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Order. I remind my 
colleagues that they must always address the Chair, particularly 
when rather diverging views are being expressed. We are dealing 
with very emotional and sensitive issues. Consequently, we must 
show a great deal of respect in order to carry on the debate in the 
usual parliamentary fashion. Again, I remind hon. members that 
they must address the Chair, and not each other directly.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ménard: </B>Mr. Speaker, I always try to abide by that 
principle, but I thank you for this reminder. So, through the good 
offices of the Chair, I reiterate my invitation to Reform members.
<P>
	It may be in order to remind the House of a number of facts. On 
several occasions during the debate, some members claimed that it 
might be detrimental to the public interest to recognize, in clause 
718.2, the principle and the concept of sexual orientation. What is 
rather surprising with this position is that it implies that the concept 
of sexual orientation is something new and that it sets a precedent.
<P>
	Yet, if you look at the Canadian case law, you will see that the 
administrative courts, as well as the ordinary courts of law, have 
had to deal with the concept of sexual orientation on a number of 
instances. In fact, the whole issue started exactly 18 years ago, with 
the Quebec charter of rights. Quebec, ever the leader in the social 
sector, was the first province to legislate and provide, in its human 
rights code, specific protection based on sexual orientation.
<P>
<B>(1845) </B>
<P>
	If you were to ask every opponent of the legislation to mention 
one case where an ordinary court of law, or an administrative 
tribunal, established a link between the concept of sexual 
orientation, which the legislator seeks to protect by including it as a 
ground for illicit discrimination, and any of the perversions to 
which some members of this House referred, you would not find 
any such example. This is why such an attitude is so deplorable.
<P>
	Let it not be forgotten that what the Minister of Justice and his 
government wish to offer is very explicit protection, so that when 
the courts are faced with the situation where a person has been the 
victim of violence because of sexual orientation, whether 
homosexual or heterosexual, they shall, in determining the 
sentence for homicide, cruelty or assault, take into consideration 
any aggravating circumstances, based on legislative principles that 
are very, very clear.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13948"> 13948 </A></B>
<P>
	In other words, a person found guilty of such offences will 
receive a stiffer sentence. That is the main focus of Bill C-41.
<P>
	This has led to all sorts of comments which, out of respect for 
you, I will not dignify with a response. People said, yes, but there is 
a problem. There is a problem of a legal nature. Members of the 
Reform Party in particular kept saying that sexual orientation had 
not been defined. They said that there was a danger that the courts 
would not be able to properly enforce the law without a definition 
of sexual orientation.
<P>
	And yet, none of the detractors of the bill has stopped to wonder 
why it also does not define freedom of worship or religious 
freedom. And what about national origin? Somehow we have 
managed. After all, we live in a society where, in the past, people 
have set themselves ablaze in the name of religious freedom, in the 
name of freedom of conscience. There are also people who have 
committed acts of cruelty, as well you know, in the name of 
religious freedom.
<P>
	If I may say so, Mr. Speaker, there are even colleagues who have 
made remarks that, in my opinion, are certainly pushing the limits 
of politeness, as well as the limits of democracy, in this House, in 
the name of religious freedom. None of the bill's detractors rose 
and asked that religious freedom, or national origin be defined.
<P>
	Why this unhealthy obsession with one of the explicit motives of 
discrimination, as if it could open the door to recognition of what is 
obviously in the realm of perversion? Some not so great minds 
even went so far as to make a connection with paedophilia. You 
really have to be pretty ignorant and pretty far removed from any 
understanding of the term sexual orientation to make that kind of 
connection.
<P>
	Anyone who has some concept of psychology or psychiatry 
knows perfectly well that homosexuality has no connection with 
paedophilia. Homosexuality has no connection at all with 
paedophilia, and it is comparisons like these that tarnish 
reputations and they are also most unfortunate from a legislative 
point of view.
<P>
	Let me quote a few facts that truly demonstrate that the decision 
of the Minister of Justice to introduce this legislation was, without 
a doubt, a most fortunate, responsible and democratic decision.
<P>
<B>(1850) </B>
<P>
	The National Gay and Lesbian Task Force in the United States 
says that according to a study they carried out three years ago, so 
this is a relatively recent study, one gay out of five-one gay out of 
five, Mr. Speaker, and perhaps I may glance briefly towards the 
other side, one gay out of five, and one lesbian out of ten were 
physically assaulted. We are not talking about empirical research. 
This is a study conducted by an authorized group in the United 
States, often used as a point of reference by our Reform Party 
colleagues, and they have  information that has helped us 
understand statements made by people belonging to the gay 
community.
<P>
	We are told that one gay out of five, so this means we are talking 
about 20 per cent, one gay out of five, and one lesbian out of ten say 
they were physically assaulted.
<P>
	We also have information on the situation in Canada. The study 
was made in New Brunswick, and if I am not mistaken, New 
Brunswick is not very far from Nova Scotia, and in Nova Scotia 
there are a number of parliamentarians who are very concerned 
about the gay community. I will not name names.
<P>
	In any case, in this study, which was carried in New Brunswick, 
which is not very far from Nova Scotia, we read the following: 82 
per cent of gays and lesbians who responded to this study were at 
some time in their lives victims of physical violence.
<P>
	At 82 per cent, we should start to be alarmed. There is absolutely 
no way anyone could call that a fringe movement or an isolated 
incident. I do not know whether our Reform colleagues are aware 
of this study. I do know that it would behoove them to take a gander 
at it. Then maybe they would even understand why there is a need 
for this legislation. Once again I ask what is the basic principle? 
The basic principle is that we are still living in a society that does 
not accept these realities, in Quebec and in Canada, but I must say 
more so in English Canada. Permit me to demonstrate how we, in 
Quebec, have a real head start on the rest of Canada when it comes 
to this issue.
<P>
	The crux of the matter-and I would have hoped that my Reform 
colleagues would have been more concerned with this issue-the 
crux of the matter is that the very fact of being gay or recognized as 
such by a certain number of people in society makes people the 
targets of violence. If one makes the effort to read the studies which 
have been done, it is obvious that this is not a mere coincidence; it 
is not a figment of imagination; it is not an oddball occurrence.
<P>
	You all know as well as I do that there is no doubt that this law 
will be passed; the official opposition is going to help it along. I 
would even say that we are going to contribute to its passage-I am 
choosing my words carefully-, I believe every last one of us will 
be behind it. However I do not want to go too far.
<P>
	It still remains that a lawmaker is sending a very clear message 
to the Canadian public with such a law. What it is saying to the 
Canadian and Quebec public is that we will not tolerate that any 
people in our society are molested or attacked, because we are a 
democratic society, a society which believes in the equality of 
individuals. Our belief in the equality of individuals goes so far that 
we even accept that this equality encompasses the expression of 
different sexual orientations. We believe in this so strongly as a 
society that we will not tolerate that some people are attacked or 
molested because of this difference.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13949"> 13949 </A></B>
<P>
	Whenever this happens, we will take deterrent measures. To 
deter people from doing this, the lawmakers must demand that the 
courts impose much more severe sanctions against those who do 
promote repression. Do you have to be a genius to understand that? 
Is this beyond comprehension? Does one need a Ph.D. to 
understand this kind of thing? I do not think so, but it takes two 
things some members of this House may lack. The first is an open 
mind, a simple and solid openness to difference. Unfortunately, this 
is too much to ask of some parliamentarians.
<P>
	The second is tolerance, tolerance permitting the understanding 
that there are people, who-for all sorts of reasons, something 
innate or something in their personality- nevertheless differ in the 
way they experience their sexuality. We are asking 
parliamentarians, who are legislators and who must set the tone, to 
be open to this. Unfortunately, it is asking too much of certain 
colleagues, and, I imagine, that they would have to justify their 
position to their electors.
<P>
<B>(1855) </B>
<P>
	I said earlier that I thought there was an openmindedness in 
Quebec that is not always found elsewhere. If I had to explain it, I 
would say there are two reasons for it. The first is that, on the 
whole, as a society, we condemn violence. I think that, on the 
whole, as a society in Quebec, we recognize that there are gays and 
that they continue to be victims of violence. There is no attempt to 
beat about the bush or to hide behind this reality, which means 
acknowledging the facts.
<P>
	Why then can Quebec claim, take pride in, a certain 
openmindedness not to be found throughout English Canada, 
although I know very well that parts of the country are very open to 
this. The reasons are twofold. The first is that members from 
Quebec, in dealing with this issue, do not ask their electors to take a 
moral stand. When Quebecers deal with these questions, they see 
that violence is committed against members of a certain group, 
known among other things as gays, they take a stand on rights. 
They take a civic stand.
<P>
	They do not ask a majority or a minority to impose morals. As 
you know, the foul-ups that occurred during debate on this issue in 
this House came from members who, in my opinion, rose in this 
House to talk about moral values, as though there was only one set 
of universal moral values that must be instilled in everyone.
<P>
	We as parliamentarians know, from travelling a little here and 
abroad, reading a little, watching television and taking the trouble 
of talking with people, that there is no single set of moral values, no 
single religion. There are numerous sets of moral and ethical values 
guiding individuals. This is a good thing, and not only in Quebec 
and Canada.
<P>
	If we as parliamentarians want to successfully navigate this 
debate without questioning anyone's motives and with a minimum 
of good faith, we must stay away from moral judgments. We must 
restrict ourselves to legal  matters, because our first duty is to make 
laws, to legislate. Mr. Speaker, since you are indicating to me that 
my time is up, I will conclude by asking all members to make a 
highly democratic and tolerant gesture by supporting this 
government and the Minister of Justice, whose courage I 
commend, and voting unanimously in favour of Bill C-41.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Sue Barnes (London West, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
congratulate the member for very clearly stating that we are not 
debating morality in the House. We are debating criminal law and 
how we want our sentencing bills to be now and for the future.
<P>
	He has clearly expressed the views that have been a consensus 
across the country. It is not just the gay, lesbian and bisexual groups 
that are in favour of this legislation. It is the United Church of 
Canada, B'nai Brith, the Federation of Canadian Municipalities, 
the Canadian Jewish Congress, the Centre for Research-Action on 
Race Relations and the Urban Alliance on Race Relations.
<P>
	I know the member is from Quebec so I will rely on some of the 
material that has been forwarded by Quebec. I specifically rely on 
the Quebec human rights commission, November 1993, which 
convened the first public inquiry into discrimination on violence 
against gays and lesbians. The hearings received a fair profile in 
that province and across the country. They acquired that profile 
because 15 homosexual men in Montreal between 1989 and 1993 
were murdered. That was the trigger which started the debate in 
that province.
<P>
	Other debates went on in Vancouver, Toronto and across the 
country with the police forces.
<P>
<B>(1900 ) </B>
<P>
	We have the Ottawa police chief saying he is in favour of this 
legislation, we have the metropolitan police force. We need this 
legislation everywhere. What I want to know from this member is 
what other experiences does he know about that go on every day in 
the lives of gays and lesbians for the hate motivated section of this 
bill to be necessary for all of Canada?
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ménard:</B> Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the hon. member for 
her question and, more importantly, for actively supporting this 
bill. I know that she sits on the committee which reviewed this 
legislation. The hon. member very appropriately mentioned that, 
two years ago, the Quebec government appointed, through the 
Quebec human rights commission, a travelling commission of 
inquiry which came to the following conclusions.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13950"> 13950 </A></B>
<P>
	First, it found that some 20 people had been killed because of 
their sexual orientation. Moreover, about one hundred of those 
people who testified before the commission had been victims of 
physical abuse.
<P>
	The hon. member is also right when she says that, ultimately, all 
this takes place in everyday life. As a member of Parliament, I 
often meet people who are homosexuals and who tell me that they 
were intimidated.
<P>
	These cases do not all involved physical abuse or death, but the 
hon. member is quite right when she says that there is still this 
widespread idea that you can bash people who are gay, because 
they may look effeminate, or because they openly show their 
orientation.
<P>
	The only reasonable way to change that attitude is to provide 
some deterrent, through bills such as this one.
<P>
	Again, as parliamentarians, we should ask ourselves this 
question, which I direct in particular to our Reform Party friends, 
through the good offices of the Chair, of course: What is so 
upsetting about our Canadian society saying that it will not tolerate 
reprisals against homosexuals, against the expression of one 
difference, among others?
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, I think you will agree with me that when a person is 
comfortable with his or her own identity, with his or her own 
sexuality, that person will accept the fact that there may be 
differences. With all due respect, I think that we must question the 
well-being-and I choose my words carefully-of some members 
of this House who show no tolerance toward the expression of that 
difference.
<P>
	If I were in the shoes of some Reform members, I would ask 
myself some questions.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like to 
begin in my comments to the member by simply stating that as an 
individual person, as a member of Parliament, as a member of the 
population of Quebec, and as a Canadian, I have more than ample 
respect for him. I wish him no ill. I honestly do.
<P>
	I am going to make a statement that is going to sound as though 
it is very ridiculous. I am going to say-and I am with my friend 
from Wild Rose on this-that I want to have fat people included in 
that list. I really do. I could tell members experiences of how when 
I was a youngster I was attacked and beat up because I was fat. I 
have been like this all my life. So I want to be on that list. I want to 
make sure that people cannot attack me because they have this 
prejudice against fat people.
<P>
	Of course members are going to say no, that is not necessary. 
Then I am going to ask why they hate me so and why they are so 
fatophobic. Now I have just said something that everyone in this 
House recognizes as being quite a ludicrous statement simply 
because it is not based on fact.
<P>
	Number one, yes, I did get beat up. That does not mean that my 
being beat up was any more important than another kid who was 
beat up because he had an even funnier face than mine.
<P>
<B>(1905) </B>
<P>
	I remember another time being quite vilified because I was a 
farm kid and I attended a city school. We have differences, and 
sometimes kids can be cruel. That does not mean that we now have 
to start specifying this person, this group; that person, that group. 
What we need to do in order to reduce those differences is to start 
treating everyone the same.
<P>
	When I say to my hon. colleague opposite that I have respect for 
him as an individual, I certainly have no intention of checking out 
what he does after he leaves this place. That is his choice. I neither 
fear him nor do I wish him any harm. However, I want to say that 
not one member of the Reform Party in the country will say that 
because of the choice he made he is now fair game for being beaten 
up. I am totally opposed to that. When I hear of individuals being 
beaten up because they are homosexuals I decry that as loudly and 
as vigorously as I would when anyone else is beaten up, for 
whatever reason.
<P>
	It is time that we as Canadians started applying the rules of 
justice and the protection of law equally to everyone across the 
board. I want to assure the hon. member that I do not dislike him. I 
am not picking on him. I am simply saying that he stands together 
with all of us on an equal ground.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ménard:</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like to say to my colleague 
that among all of my Reform colleagues, he is by far my favourite. 
However, I do not know whether I should be jumping for joy or 
crying after what he just said because, with all due respect, my 
colleague rose in this House and said: ``I do not dislike the hon. 
member'', all the better. However, he also said: ``What we need to 
do is to start treating everyone the same''.
<P>
	You will understand that at face value, such a statement betrays a 
lack of sensitivity, because, if we acknowledge that in Canadian 
and Quebec society people are being molested solely on the basis 
of their sexual orientation, there is no way we can agree with our 
colleague's conclusion that we have to treat everyone the same.
<P>
	This is like the kind of reasoning that used to be widespread a 
few years back, and I am choosing my words carefully. You will 
nonetheless understand to what point this example, regardless of 
how absurd it was, is worth calling to mind. I remember very 
clearly the debate that was raging in our society a few years back in 
which some people used to say: ``Whenever a person, in general a 
woman, is raped, we must take into consideration whether she 
provoked the attack''. And they said, some very sensible people 
included, even men of law, that the punishment for raping a woman 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13951"> 13951 </A></B>
<P>
should  vary, depending on how provocative she was, for example, 
if she was wearing a short skirt.
<P>
	I never subscribed to this point of view. What our colleague is 
saying, is: ``I am ready to accept homosexuality only if these 
people are treated the same as everybody else and only if we do not 
acknowledge, at this moment in time, that they are being 
systematically discriminated against and are being targeted for 
violence''. This is contradictory, this is a paradox, this is illogical 
and cannot be. That is why we have a bill before us like the one that 
is before us today.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Ms. Jean Augustine (Parliamentary Secretary to Prime 
Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am sharing my time with the hon. 
member for St. Catharines.
<P>
<B>(1910 ) </B>
<P>
	I am very pleased to have the opportunity to participate in the 
debate at third reading of Bill C-41, an act to amend the Criminal 
Code, sentencing, and other acts in consequence thereof. It is a 
criminal law bill directed at hate motivated crime.
<P>
	First, I want to commend the work of the Minister of Justice, 
who has responded to the call of Canadians for the need to reform 
our sentencing process by establishing a clear framework of 
provisions to guide the courts in our country.
<P>
	We have before us a criminal law bill directed at hate motivated 
crime. We have before us comprehensive legislation that for the 
very first time gives Canadians a say in the purpose and principles 
of criminal sentencing.
<P>
	In these very challenging times, it is now necessary to provide 
clear guidelines for the courts to protect society to assist in 
rehabilitating offenders, to promote their sense of responsibility, 
and to provide reparation for sometimes irreparable damage, both 
physical and emotional, done to victims and the community.
<P>
	Rules of evidence and procedure have now been set out in this 
bill, along with alternative measures to prisons and conditional 
sentences to be served in the community under strict compliance 
with conditions ordered by the court.
<P>
	This bill works in partnership with the community to rehabilitate 
offenders while at the same time protecting the public from those 
criminals who have committed serious and violent crimes.
<P>
	The strength of this bill is clearly evident from the support it has 
garnered across the country, despite what we might hear in the 
House.
<P>
	I represent an urban riding in the greater Toronto area where 
people want only to live in peace and safety. In 
Etobicoke-Lakeshore we are firm believers in crime prevention 
measures as a method of improving safety in our community. As a 
community we are working very hard to eliminate crime. I give as 
an example the hard work of the Etobicoke Crime Prevention 
Association, which has succeeded in making our community more  
aware of crime prevention. I would like to read to the House the tip 
of the month published in its May 1995 newsletter. It reads: ``A key 
element in preventing crime is public education through a variety 
of means. Let the public know that prevention is possible. They are 
capable and it is worth their while''.
<P>
	The sentencing reforms contained within Bill C-41 will indeed 
make the efforts of all Canadian communities worth their while. 
Our government is committed to restoring safety to our homes, our 
streets, and our communities. Bill C-41 is a clear indication of this 
commitment. We want to give Canadians back their sense of 
security by working hard to implement policies that will reduce and 
help to prevent crime in Canadian communities.
<P>
	Canadians have asked for changes to the criminal justice system 
and we have responded with reforms that enhance the rights of 
victims and encourage respect for the law.
<P>
	When we talk about public education we want to make sure that 
people have all the facts. What has been happening across the way 
today has not been all the facts.
<P>
	I will now proceed to give what I perceive to be the clear facts in 
this legislation and emphasize the benefits these reforms will mean 
to the protection of all Canadians.
<P>
	With the passage of this bill judges will henceforth be required to 
give clear reasons for sentencing in all cases. This clarity will 
benefit the public and will assist later in potential appeals trials.
<P>
	The bill also gives consideration to offences committed in 
breach of trust, usually against children and increasingly in cases of 
violence against women. These vulnerable individuals who lost 
this essential and assumed protection in society will now find it in 
the courts.
<P>
	This legislation will also benefit and consider the victims of 
crime, whose suffering and anxieties for so long have been pushed 
aside.
<P>
<B>(1915 ) </B>
<P>
	The statement of purpose and principles will allow for reparation 
to the victim or the community while at the same time forcing the 
offenders to take responsibility for their actions.
<P>
	This means first of all that financial restitution can now be 
audited to compensate for loss of property or damage inflicted on 
an individual. I know that many seniors in my community who 
have been victimized by theft will be very pleased with the 
introduction of this provision.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13952"> 13952 </A></B>
<P>
	Financial compensation by the offender in the case of less 
serious crimes often encourages rehabilitation of the offender. In 
the legislation, amendments to section 745 of the Criminal Code 
will give victims of violence the chance to voice the effects the 
offender's crime has had on their lives during their hearing for 
early parole.
<P>
	It is about time the victim's experience is given greater 
emphasis. The statement will play a key role in the determination 
of the release of violent offenders back into society. Fines will now 
be officially recognized as part of the sentencing process. The fact 
is that many offenders are in prison for non-violent crimes simply 
because they are not able to pay the fine levelled on them.
<P>
	Consideration will now be given to these individuals and fines 
will be imposed based on the offender's ability to pay. Inability to 
repay will result in other penalties such as probation or community 
service.
<P>
	For those who have the ability to pay, fines will be strictly 
enforced. The system of fines will result in decreased costs of 
running our institutions. The community plays an important role in 
this bill, especially under the provision that allows for alternative 
incarceration.
<P>
	Under strict supervision, a less serious non-violent offender who 
has been determined to pose no danger to society could serve the 
sentence within the community in some way. Counselling, 
probation, fines and community service will be part of a more 
effective rehabilitative approach to minor and first time offenders.
<P>
	Limited funds could be spent protecting the public from more 
serious and violent offenders. Prison will be reserved for their 
rehabilitation. This legislation will prove beneficial to 
communities because it contains measures that will ensure the 
culture of hate is not permitted to flourish in this country.
<P>
	Hate crimes are an unfortunate and insufferable reality in our 
society. The fact that people are specifically targeted because of 
their race, their religion, their ethnicity, their sexual orientation 
cannot be ignored or purposely be swept under the carpet.
<P>
	Police bias crime units have reported that crimes motivated by 
hate are on the increase. We must also keep in mind that this 
probably does not include the many hate crimes that go unreported 
because of an individual's fear or historic mistrust of authorities.
<P>
	Have you ever stopped to think, Mr. Speaker, about how 
traumatizing it is to victims, knowing that they have been 
specifically attacked because of who they are and what they look 
like? This is a very personal attack because you cannot change 
these aspects of yourself.
<P>
	Canadians have expressed their alarm at the intolerable increase 
in this type of violence. The government has responded by 
introducing these amendments that will allow judges to impose 
stiffer sentences on those who have been convicted of a crime 
motivated by hate based  on race, nationality, colour, religion, sex, 
mental or physical disability or sexual orientation.
<P>
	Working with the community to improve education in 
combination with stiffer sentencing measures will result in a better 
co-ordinating response to hate. Section 718 which got much 
discussion across the way specifically comes into play after a 
person is convicted of a crime motivated by hate toward a specific 
group.
<P>
	The government recognizes the need to replace the vagueness 
that currently exists in the sentencing process to protect the groups 
that are being senselessly and violently targeted.
<P>
	History has taught us that we will only suffer as a society if 
violence, intimidation and fearmongering toward any group is 
tolerated. Ours is a society of equality and Bill C-41 will offer a 
solid deterrence to all people who threaten human life.
<P>
	Sentencing practices should be a reflection of Canadian values 
and this legislation mirrors the values of equality and democracy 
quite clearly.
<P>
<B>(1920 ) </B>
<P>
	There is great support for this bill because the people of Canada 
know that in combination with other elements of our crime 
prevention package, change will come and the risk toward safety 
will lessen.
<P>
	Sentencing reform, amendments to the Young Offenders Act, 
parole and corrections reform, the creation of a crime prevention 
council, greater control of firearms will go a long way toward 
making our communities safer places to live.
<P>
	In addition to all this we will continue our efforts to reform the 
social programs, implementing more effective measures to combat 
poverty, lack of education, unemployment, illiteracy. We are 
making progress toward a safer, less violent and more progressive 
society.
<P>
	Bill C-41 will guide us in that direction. Let us show tolerance 
and support this bill.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Philip Mayfield (Cariboo-Chilcotin, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
I was pleased that the hon. parliamentary secretary had a wide 
ranging look at this bill in her speech.
<P>
	There are some comparisons that I might make to the comments 
she has made. I have in my hand a report from the Canadian Police 
Association, a group that was lauded by the justice minister for its 
support of Bill C-68.
<P>
	In the introduction to the report, the association says this:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Bill C-41 with a few exceptions is unwieldly, complicated, internally 
self-contradictory, duplicitous and what is worse, almost all of it completely 
unnecessary for anyone with any knowledge of or use for the common law 
heritage of Canada. While it would attempt to codify basic sentencing 
principles, eliminating this most basic judicial discretion, at the same time it 
would bestow huge new discretionary powers to a whole range of persons 
within the justice system.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13953"> 13953 </A></B>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The common thread in these new powers is that all are to the benefit of the 
offender in the sense of non-custodial consequence for criminal actions.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Where sentencing reform calls for protection, this bill offers platitudes. Where 
it calls for clarity, it offers confusion and outright hypocrisy. Given its previous 
life as Bill C-90, [from the Tory administration] it is in no way a creature of this 
government yet if passed, it will certainly be identified as just that. It will almost 
certainly cause the already skyrocketing criminal justice budget to expand 
further still, in particular, the fastest growing component of that, namely legal 
aid.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>When all is said and done and when one considers the truly great challenges the 
justice system faces in real crime prevention and protection of the public, it is 
tragic that this bill occupies debate while other legitimate issues are ignored. 
This, too, will be the legacy for the government should this bill be passed into law.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	In concluding this report, the Canadian Police Association says 
that:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Bill C-41 is confused, contradictory and in large part wholly unnecessary. It is 
a blatant example of what a former Liberal member of the justice committee 
described as smoke and mirrors legislation. It is put forward as meaningful 
sentence reform but it is only that in the sense that it will generate endless 
litigation with huge attendant costs for little or no purpose. It is a blatant example 
of our worst tendencies in criminal law amendment in that it is impractical, badly 
drafted and will produce results wholly inconsistent with the overwhelming 
majority of Canadian sense of what needs to be done.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>It is a bill that was not created or refined in any sense by the political response 
of elected members of the government who will be responsible to their 
constituents once its results are made clear as they will be.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>In these days when so much needs to be done to prevent crime from occurring 
in the first place and to provide protection to society from those chronic violent 
offenders, Bill C-41 is and will be an embarrassment.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	As I think about why the government is putting forward Bill 
C-41, I am compelled to ask the Parliamentary Secretary to the 
Prime Minister what is the justification for this bill. I can only 
assume that it is to assuage the interests and the demands of the 
politically correct movement that you so capably represent.
<P>
<B>(1925 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Order. Once again I remind 
the House not to refer to one another as you. Interventions should 
be made through the Chair.
<P>
	I also remind the House that the hon. parliamentary secretary has 
only one minute left to respond.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mayfield:</B> I do apologize.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Augustine:</B> First of all, Mr. Speaker, I accept his apology 
because that is the kind of person I am and this is the kind of debate 
that brings out the worst in members as we address those issues that 
face society.
<P>
	We are talking about the kind of society where there is respect 
for diversity, where there is respect for the individual. We are 
talking about measures that have within them preventive, 
rehabilitative and other measures.
<P>
	The bill before us would ensure the function of our communities, 
as I said in my remarks, and would ensure the safety of every 
individual within society regardless of race, colour, creed, 
nationality, age, sex or sexual orientation.
<P>
	I think the member has difficulty with this. I can quote from 
other sources that speak in very positive terms to the bill.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Walt Lastewka (St. Catharines, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to speak on Bill C-41, first because I believe this bill is 
very important in protecting and promoting the rights of victims 
and second, because there are many misconceptions about this bill. 
Yes, the inclusion of the term sexual orientation in the bill has 
caused some people concern. Some of my constituents are 
concerned. They fear this may somehow promote a homosexual 
lifestyle or it may result in restrictions on religious speech or 
change the Criminal Code to make things such as pedophelia 
acceptable.
<P>
	First I would like to address those questions. Bill C-41 is a 
sentencing bill. Its aim is to deal harshly with offenders who 
commit serious crimes and to provide educational or community 
service programs for non-violent offenders.
<P>
	Section 718 of the bill proposes that aggravating circumstances 
should be taken into account in sentencing. The bill outlines that if 
the crime is committed because of hatred or where an offender 
abuses a position of trust, this hate or abuse of power shall be 
considered an aggravating circumstance and therefore will be dealt 
with more harshly.
<P>
	The bill outlines that hate crimes can be committed based on 
hatred for someone's race, nationality, colour, religion, sex, age, 
mental or physical disability or sexual orientation.
<P>
	I want to state clearly that I believe hate crime is intolerable in 
any form and we must take proactive measures to remove hate 
from our society. I strongly support measures which will send a 
clear message that crimes based on hatred will not be tolerated but 
will be punished harshly.
<P>
	However I am a strong believer in the family and I am also 
concerned about the potential erosion of family values through the 
use of the term of sexual orientation. Based on these concerns and 
those of some of my constituents I wrote to the Minister of Justice 
and asked these questions very clearly: Does the bill have any 
effect on the issue of same sex benefits or adoptions? Could the 
courts interpret sexual orientation to include pedophelia or other 
deviant forms of sexuality? In regard to same sex benefits and 
adoption the minister has clearly stated the bill is not relevant to 
those items. Cases have recently been before the courts on these 
issues but Bill C-41 has no affect on same sex benefits.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13954"> 13954 </A></B>
<P>
	There is also concern over setting a precedent by using the term 
sexual orientation in legislation and opening the door to future 
extension of many other items, those promoted by some of the 
members opposite.
<P>
	I want to reassure my constituents that the use of the term of 
sexual orientation is not new in our justice system. In fact it has 
been around since 1977 and presently is included in the human 
rights legislation of eight provinces.
<P>
<B>(1930 ) </B>
<P>
	The second question I addressed to the minister was whether 
pedophilia and other sexual behaviour could be defined as sexual 
orientation. Again the minister replied in the negative. The 
Criminal Code clearly describes and provides for offenders.
<P>
	The minister pointed out this is not new legislation; it is not 
ambiguous and does not include criminal acts such as pedophilia. I 
heard some of my church congregations in St. Catharines 
expressing some fear that freedom of speech might be removed. 
Again I was assured by the minister, quoting from his letter: ``The 
provisions of the bill do not and cannot prohibit people from 
holding beliefs or from talking about them within their churches, 
congregations or communities. The bill deals with people who act 
on certain bias or hatred to commit crimes. It will not affect 
freedom of expression''.
<P>
	Recently one of the congregations wrote to the minister to 
express its concern and support concerning Bill C-41. I am 
reminded the church believes it is obligated to struggle against 
injustice. Its letter to the minister:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Our mandate is to support the church in God's mission of bringing about an 
inclusive and participatory church and society, striving to protect the rights and 
meet the needs of all, including those who are marginalized on grounds of race, 
culture, sex, family and economic status, age, belief, sexual orientation, and 
disability.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	The focus of Bill C-41 is to improve our sentencing laws and 
define their purpose. The bill deals with victims, crimes motivated 
by hate, other rehabilitative provisions for some offenders like 
community service, and probation, fines and updating the rules of 
evidence and procedure.
<P>
	Bill C-41 is particularly important to me because it deals with 
the rights of victims of violence. It is unfortunate but our justice 
system often seems to protect the offender while ignoring the 
victim. The bill takes important steps to outline the importance of 
respecting and protecting victims, one small step forward.
<P>
	The bill deals with the protection and promotion of the rights of 
victims. The bill contains a statement of sentencing purposes. The 
present Criminal Code does not contain a statement outlining the 
purpose and principles behind sentencing. The new bill would fill 
this void by including a statement providing direction to the courts 
on the fundamental purpose of sentencing.
<P>
	The statement would include as part of the objectives of 
sentencing providing restitution to victims or the community. In 
addition, sentences should promote a sense of responsibility for 
offenders and include encouraging acknowledgement by offenders 
of the harm done to victims or to the community. The statement 
would outline the importance of maintaining a peaceful, safe 
society.
<P>
	The second way the bill provides for the victims of violence is 
through victim impact statements. The bill allows victims the 
opportunity to speak of the harm done to them or the loss they have 
suffered because of the offender. These statements will impact the 
sentencing of offenders and in deciding whether an offender should 
be discharged in a section 745 parole hearing.
<P>
	In the past the parole board has refused to allow victims to put 
forward information. This is important to me because as I am sure 
all will agree the information on harm done to a victim by the 
offender is relevant to the offender's parole. The victim's 
experience will be taken into account and they will have a chance 
to speak, which will have an important impact.
<P>
	The third way the bill deals with the protection and promotion of 
the rights of victims is in the area of restitution. The bill helps to 
provide compensation in cases where there is family abuse. Costs 
for moving, temporary housing or child support may be awarded 
when the victim is a wife or family which must move from their 
place, for example when the father is the offender.
<P>
<B>(1935 ) </B>
<P>
	I would be remiss if I did not speak on this bill today. I 
understand and have experience with hate and discrimination and 
what it can do to an individual. It is a devastating, destructive force 
that must be dealt with very harshly. I have seen and lived through 
periods when a name like mine was something excluded, 
something different and dealt with differently. I understand what 
can happen in society as a result of having a name like mine.
<P>
	We must start making the rights of victims a priority. I hope in 
the future the justice minister brings additional bills to the House to 
improve the consequences of what victims have to suffer in society 
as a result of violence taken.
<P>
	I have noted that the chief of police in Ottawa-Carleton, this 
area, strongly supports it. The Federation of Canadian 
Municipalities have written in support of the bill.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13955"> 13955 </A></B>
<P>
	A vote for this bill is a vote against discrimination and hate 
toward individuals and groups. Expressions of hate should have no 
place in Canadian society and the bill sets out a commitment to 
fighting hate motivated crimes.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Garry Breitkreuz (Yorkton-Melville, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, my question is very simple. If a woman is sexually 
assaulted that is a terrible crime. If she is violated because she is a 
lesbian why should that crime be treated more seriously? That is 
the key question here which we have not had answered by any of 
the debate from that side of the House. That has to be answered. If 
that is not answered this legislation should not be put in place.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Lastewka:</B> Mr. Speaker, the bill talks about sex and the 
various areas the judges can rule on. Too often I have seen in court 
cases in which the law is not defined. There is a wide discrepancy 
from one coast to the other in Canada.
<P>
	The bill puts more into the system so judges can make the 
decisions. When there is a sentence they will be guided as to 
whether it was hate motivated, yes or no. That is what is important. 
We are trying to get the message out to people that the government 
will put in stiffer laws whenever there is hate motivated crime. 
That should be pretty clear.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Breitkreuz (Yorkton-Melville):</B> Mr. Speaker, with all due 
respect, he has not answered my question. Why is the one crime 
more serious than the other?
<P>
	What I can see happening in our court cases is that this will 
simply be another make work program for lawyers. It will add a 
dimension to trials. They will be able to argue a crime was 
motivated by bias, prejudice or hate. Rather than focusing on the 
facts of the case, that a crime was committed and that the behaviour 
was not acceptable, they will have another dimension added to all 
of these court cases. What drives this legislation? Was it possibly 
designed by lawyers? Was it designed by people like that who may 
benefit?
<P>
<B>(1940) </B>
<P>
	Our court trials are already expensive enough. We do not need 
another dimension added which this legislation will add.
<P>
	The question that needs to be answered is if a woman is sexually 
assaulted is that not as serious as if she is violated because she 
belongs to some category?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Lastewka:</B> Mr. Speaker, anywhere there is discrimination or 
motivated or planned hatred it does not underscore what the 
member opposite has put in as an example. If it is a motivated hate 
crime, sentencing should be dealt accordingly.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Val Meredith (Surrey-White Rock-South Langley, 
Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, once again I find myself debating a bill 
restricted by time allocation brought in by the government and its 
cohorts in the Bloc Quebecois.
<P>
	When time allocation was introduced for Bill C-41, Bill C-68 
and Bill C-85, the Secretary of State for  Parliamentary Affairs said 
the government was forced to do so because the Reform Party had 
introduced hundreds of amendments aimed solely at stalling the 
passage of the bill.
<P>
	When we look at the amendments introduced at report stage on 
Bill C-41, we see there are a total of 25. Of those 25 amendments 
only five were Reform Party amendments. How can the secretary 
of state possibly claim that by submitting five of the 25 
amendments the Reform Party was trying to stall Bill C-41?
<P>
	How can the government possibly claim time allocation was 
necessary to get the bill passed when it was tabled at report stage on 
March 22? The government has had almost three months to get the 
legislation passed.
<P>
	It is not the Reform Party causing problems for the government 
on the bill, it is a few Liberal backbenchers causing the government 
so much anxiety it had to invoke time allocation to get the bill 
passed with as little debate as possible.
<P>
	On the quality of debate, I raise some comments made by the 
member for Vancouver Centre. I am glad to see she has rejoined us 
so she can hear me. I am bothered that the member for Vancouver 
Centre had the audacity to question the member for Crowfoot 
whether he had read the entire bill. I do not recall seeing the 
member for Vancouver Centre sitting in the justice committee for 
months and months listening to witnesses or going through the bill 
clause by clause, trying to make it into something better.
<P>
	The member for Etobicoke-Lakeshore said this bill is a law of 
hate motivated crime and that was the sole intent and purpose of it. 
Maybe these individuals should take a few minutes off and actually 
read the bill and find out it is about a lot more than hate motivated 
crime. The member from the Bloc who spoke should do so as well. 
This bill is about sentencing. It is about alternative measures. It is 
about breach of trust by public officials and section 745, so much 
more than hate motivated crime. Having sat through months of 
testimony on Bill C-41 in the justice committee, it is a shame that 
many of the aspects of the bill about which I have spoken have been 
overlooked because of the words sexual orientation being brought 
into section 718.2 of the Criminal Code and of having an 
enumerated list of qualifiers.
<P>
<B>(1945) </B>
<P>
	The hon. member for Rosedale and the hon. member for 
Vancouver Centre raised the fact that the police were fully behind 
the bill. As other members have said, the police association is not 
behind the bill. When the justice minister was promoting his 
infamous Bill C-68, the gun control legislation, he held up the 
chiefs of police and the Canadian Police Association as institutions 
that supported the gun legislation and asked how Canadians could 
not support it. I will tell government members that the chiefs of 
police and the Canadian Police Association do not support Bill 
C-41. I quote the Canadian Police Association which stated:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13956"> 13956 </A></B>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Our criminal justice system is based on both a defining statute (the Criminal 
Code) and the case law which has been built up over years in its interpretation and 
application. Both aspects are cornerstones of our system.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>This bill attempts to codify some, and I emphasize only some, of the basic 
principles of sentencing which evolved in our courts over the last hundred years 
or so-This bill's approach of attempting to redefine principles will result in 
endless litigation which will add millions of wasted dollars of expense to a system 
that is now struggling to make more efficient use of existing resources.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	The Canadian Police Association represents police across the 
country, not just in Ottawa. It went on to say that it was compelled 
to articulate just how ill advised the bill was and to say:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The sentencing is far too important to be saddled with as poor an effort as this 
and it should be sent back to the drafting table with instructions to start again. At 
this late date we urge you to do the same thing and do whatever is necessary to not 
proceed any further on this bill.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Those are pretty strong statements from the police community 
that was so important to the government's support of Bill C-68 but 
is being totally ignored on Bill C-41. Why is its support so 
important on one bill and totally ignored on the other?
<P>
	When Parliament passes amendments to current legislation it is 
usually done because it wishes to change the direction of the 
legislation or to make up for some deficiency in law. As was 
pointed out by the Canadian Police Association, the bill falls far 
short of that.
<P>
	The amendment about which everyone has been talking this 
evening with respect to section 718.2 does not do it either. The 
amendment calls for crimes motivated by bias, prejudice or hate to 
be deemed aggravating circumstances. Therefore a greater 
sentence would be applied. We have heard impassioned speeches 
from the government benches about the personal injustices and 
experiences they have had with respect to discrimination. I do not 
doubt that. I do not doubt there are many Canadians who have been 
faced with that.
<P>
	The justice committee heard extensive evidence about what the 
courts have been doing for years. Before passing sentence the 
courts take into consideration all the aggravating and mitigating 
circumstances. The courts are already giving stronger sentences 
when they are based on hate or prejudice.
<P>
	The motivation of the offender has always been an issue. Courts 
today frequently hand out more severe penalties for crimes 
committed on the basis of hate, prejudice or bias. If that is already 
the case, why do we need this section in Bill C-41? Are we in effect 
telling the courts that we are passing new legislation because we 
want them to maintain the status quo? There is one difference, 
which is that section 718.2 lists nine issues to be considered.
<P>
	The justice committee attempted to determine if the list was 
exclusionary, that is if the basis for hate crime is not listed in the 
section can the court consider it to be an aggravating factor?
<P>
<B>(1950 ) </B>
<P>
	The hon. member across the way brought forward the fact that an 
amendment was made to it. Yes, there was an amendment made to 
it that added the similar factor. As is usual, in cases where lawyers 
appeared as witnesses some said that the list would not be 
exclusionary and others said that the list would be considered 
exclusionary. If it was not meant to be exclusive why would the 
government include a list?
<P>
	It is obvious that people charged under this section will be 
arguing as to whether or not the list is exclusive. It is equally likely 
that in leaving the section as it is we as parliamentarians are 
leaving it up to the courts to decide whether something belongs to 
the similar factor. That is why the section should be deleted in its 
entirety. I have not heard one individual state that the courts as a 
whole have not been effective in taking aggravating factors into 
consideration for crimes based on hate, prejudice or bias.
<P>
	As I said earlier, section 718.2 received the most attention but 
other areas deserve further scrutiny. One such issue is alternative 
measures. The concept of alternative measures is valid. I do not 
think there is anyone in the Reform Party who does not support the 
concept of alternative measures.
<P>
	However the bill has left far too many unanswered questions. 
What is an alternative measure? We cannot answer that question 
because there is no definition. There are not even guidelines on 
what the provinces can decide is an alternative measure. Who 
qualifies for alternative measures? That is another question that we 
cannot answer. The bill just states that the person who makes the 
decision must consider it appropriate. Who is this person who is to 
decide if the penalty is appropriate or not? Again we do not have an 
answer. The bill does not stipulate who should be making these 
decisions. In fact the bill does not even state what type of crimes 
are appropriate for alternative measures.
<P>
	One would think that the alternative measures would not be 
available to people who have previously been dealt with by 
alternative measures. The bill does not say that. It may be 
extremely difficult to determine if an offender was previously dealt 
with by way of alternative measures because there is no need for 
mandatory reporting of alternative measures. Nor is there a central 
repository to determine if alternative measures have been 
previously used. The sections dealing with alternative measures are 
just too vague to support.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13957"> 13957 </A></B>
<P>
	Another serious issue that Bill C-41 fails to address is that of 
individuals in public positions losing their positions if convicted 
and sentenced to a term of incarceration. Previously a member of 
Parliament who was convicted of a criminal offence could only 
lose his or her position if sentenced to a term in excess of five 
years.
<P>
	The justice committee accepted a Liberal amendment to this 
clause that reduces the necessary term of incarceration from five 
years to two years. However the committee rejected a Reform 
amendment that elected officials should be removed from their 
positions if they are sentenced to any period of incarceration. 
Perhaps it was a little too severe for the Liberals' liking but the zero 
tolerance was based on reality. Members of the RCMP who are 
convicted of a criminal offence lose their jobs if they spend even 
one day in jail. How could Parliament permit such a double 
standard?
<P>
	We expect members of the national police force to have such a 
high standard of conduct that any incarceration would 
automatically result in the loss of their jobs. Yet when it comes to 
the standard of conduct of our own, the lawmakers of the country, 
we say that only incarceration in a federal institution for two years 
or more will disqualify an elected official. How can the 
government justify this contradiction?
<P>
	However the biggest problem with Bill C-41 is not necessarily 
what is there but rather what is not there. Bill C-41 is tinkering 
when what is really needed is a major overhaul.
<P>
<B>(1955) </B>
<P>
	I go back to the CPA letter which says that it should be sent back 
to the drafting table with instructions to start again. It is not just 
Reformers who feel that it needs to be scrapped; that is also 
supported by the CPA.
<P>
	We need a sentencing bill that will lock up violent high risk 
offenders and keep them incarcerated until they are no longer a 
threat to the public. We need a sentencing bill that will provide 
offenders with a sentence that is a specific deterrent to them and a 
general deterrent to others. We need a sentencing bill that provides 
sentences that are commensurate with the severity of the crime, 
sentences that are applied consistently and with a high degree of 
certainty.
<P>
	The justice system is suffering from a major lack of public 
support. If we are ever to regain the public's faith in the justice 
system, we must provide Canadians with laws that will really keep 
our streets and communities safe.
<P>
	Bill C-41 is not the answer. I ask my colleagues on the 
opposition side and on the government side how they could 
possibly support such a poorly written document that will infringe 
on justice in Canada.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Hedy Fry (Vancouver Centre, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, since 
the hon. member personally addressed me in her speech I think I 
should not only respond but ask her a question.
<P>
	The hon. member said that I was not present at all the hours and 
hours of committee meetings and I did not listen to the witnesses. 
One does not have to be there to comprehend, to be able to read the 
bill from cover to cover. That is very simple to do. It is also quite 
easy to get transcripts of the committees and understand them.
<P>
	I did not only deal with them to get my knowledge. As a family 
practitioner for 23 years I have knowledge of what hate crimes do 
to people. I worked in emergency rooms and know about people 
who had come in beaten up because of their sexual orientation or 
because of their race in the city of Vancouver. I have a very valid 
reason for speaking the way I did.
<P>
	If you discuss the abstracts of the bill, look at the fine points of 
clause by clause consideration and dot the <I>i</I>'s and cross the <I>t</I>'s but 
fail to understand the principles behind the bill or the very real part 
of the bill that will affect Canadians where they live, that will affect 
their lives in a very real and meaningful way, you have missed the 
whole issue completely.
<P>
	Does the member understand the principles?
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Before I go to the next 
member, by and large debate has been conducted in a very 
parliamentary way, but I remind members that because it is an issue 
about which there are some very strong feelings it is important for 
the interventions to be made through the Chair.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Fry:</B> Mr. Speaker, I have a question for the hon. member. 
Does she fully understand why hate crimes should have 
aggravating factors? Hate crimes do not only hurt physically. Nor 
do they only hurt psychologically. Hate crimes leave a lasting 
effect on the individual. Hate crimes cause the continuing erosion 
of the self-esteem of a group that feels rejected by society. 
Members of that group have no sense of self-worth. It haunts them 
throughout the rest of their lives.
<P>
	Does the hon. member fully understand that aspect of hate 
crime?
<P>
	<B>Ms. Meredith:</B> Mr. Speaker, I can honestly say that I fully 
understand the intent of the bill and the impact that hate crime can 
have on an individual. That is why I am pleased that the courts 
already take that into consideration.
<P>
<B>(2000 ) </B>
<P>
	I appreciate the fact that the hon. member is a medical doctor 
and not a lawyer, but perhaps if she looked through transcripts of 
trials and sentencing she would find that the courts now take that 
into consideration in sentencing. They already take into 
consideration that a beating might have been because a person was 
homosexual or because they were of another race. They already 
give more severe sentences based on that aggravating factor.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13958"> 13958 </A></B>
<P>
	I appreciate that, but I recognize that this is already happening 
now and we do not need to codify it so there is more debate as to 
whether or not another group should belong to that list, that 
enumeration. And that will happen.
<P>
	We had a case in Vancouver, which she is very much aware of, 
where it was the profession of an individual that caused him to be 
the victim of a shooting. He may or may not fall into this list. We 
will have lawyers debating back and forth and wasting court time 
when right now the courts would take that into consideration 
because there is not an exclusionary list.
<P>
	I would suggest to the hon. member that already the courts take it 
into consideration, the judges take it into consideration. There is 
absolutely no need to put a law together to specify a list. I repeat 
that it is only one part of this legislation.
<P>
	In case the hon. members in this House missed the point, this is 
also about alternative measures that are not defined, that are not 
specified as to who makes decisions, that are not specified on what 
crimes or what offenders qualify or whether they get alternative 
measures one, two, three, ten, or fifteen times. I think those things 
have to be addressed. We cannot pass a law for one clause; we have 
to look at the entirety. If the entirety of it is bad, we as legislators 
have a moral obligation to see it does not become law.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jesse Flis (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Foreign Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have a brief comment.
<P>
	The hon. member for Surrey-White Rock-South Langley 
complained in her opening remarks about time allocation, saying 
that it is not her party that is stalling and delaying.
<P>
	I believe the hon. member was here yesterday when Canadians 
saw the Reform Party members wasting time deliberately with the 
way they were voting in slow motion and making a mockery of this 
Parliament. I call that a contempt of this Parliament. This is why 
we have to bring in time allocation. We have not brought in closure. 
They can complain about closure.
<P>
	When we are dealing with members like this, I call time 
allocation good time management.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Meredith:</B> Mr. Speaker, in response to the allegations from 
across the floor, it is interesting that an individual on the 
government side could comment about needing time allocation 
when this particular legislation has been at report stage since 
March 22. If the government moves so slowly that it takes it over 
three months to get something from report stage to dealing with it, 
from introduction to dealing with it, I do not take any responsibility 
for that.
<P>
	What we went through last night was giving every single 
individual in this House the opportunity to make their recorded 
vote, which is the parliamentary right of every member in this 
House. I will not apologize to the  House or to anybody else for 
forcing the situation last night so that every member had the ability 
to be registered as voting for or against the amendments on this 
important legislation.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gordon Kirkby (Prince Albert-Churchill River, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I wanted to point out that in the statement of the hon. 
member she did point out that right now the criminal law is 
composed of the Criminal Code and the common law. All that is 
sought to be done by this amendment is to simply codify the 
existing common law-it is not changing the law-so the judges 
and lawyers will all be aware of exactly what the law is in a very 
succinct form so that-
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The member has the same amount of time 
to reply.
<P>
<B>(2005 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Ms. Meredith:</B> Mr. Speaker, I will be very quick.
<P>
	They already have the flexibility, not looking just at a list but 
looking at all factors, whether they fall under a list of enumeration 
or not. The list of six or seven items is not just bias, hate, and 
prejudice. There are far more areas. This is an exclusionary list that 
is being put into law that will give lawyers more and more 
opportunities to suck money out of the economy.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stan Dromisky (Thunder Bay-Atikokan, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it is my pleasure to rise today to speak to Bill C-41. In 
particular, I would like to address the proposed change to section 
718.2 of the revised Criminal Code, which deals with crimes that 
are motivated by hate, hate being deemed an aggravating factor for 
the purpose of sentencing.
<P>
	More specifically, this section of the Criminal Code looks to 
criminalize those who commit an offence that was motivated by 
bias, prejudice, or hate based on race, national or ethnic origin, 
language, colour, religion, sex, age, mental or physical disability, 
or sexual orientation.
<P>
	This section takes into consideration that there are crimes 
against individuals and then there are crimes against a group. The 
latter crimes have the potential to hurt and hurt deeply and injure a 
collective group of people. Hate crimes put a group at 
psychological unease, deteriorating their psychological quality of 
life and inducing mental injury. As we all know, mental injuries 
and traumas can lead to physical illnesses, commonly referred to as 
psychosomatic illnesses. However, everyone within the designated 
group will be affected to some degree, some more than others. 
Above all, practically every single one will feel a deterioration of 
self-concept and eventually feel themselves second class citizens.
<P>

<P>
	It is important to take note of the fact that all of the groups 
specified in the proposed legislation are afforded equal protection. 
I reiterate: equal protection. For example, hate crimes against 
males are treated in the same manner as hate crimes against 
females. Caucasians are afforded the same protection as Orientals; 
Christians the same as Muslims; anglophones the same as 
francophones; heterosexuals the same as homosexuals; and 
Ukrainian Canadians the same as Iranian Canadians and native 
Canadians.
<P>
	Each of these mentioned groups at some time or other can be 
potential victims of hate crimes. All of them have been singled out 
for excessive negative treatment by someone for some reason. 
Why? It is ignorance, pure and simple. Ignorance is the foundation 
of this negative form of behaviour. It is nurtured by someone for 
someone's advantage, whether it is for control of a group, greed, or 
to keep people in a state of ignorance so that they will never know 
there is something better around the corner.
<P>
	Fear is another controlling factor. This points out to me and to 
everyone else that there is a desperate need for education, 
education that will enhance the image of every single Canadian to 
the point where they will feel secure in the decision making and the 
choices they make and someone else who is trying to manipulate 
them for some unknown reason will not degrade them, debase 
them, and humiliate them to the point where their self-concept is 
practically destroyed.
<P>
	Remember that most people who attack other people and hate 
other people have very poor self-concepts. Because of the poor 
self-concept they have, they are trying their very best to knock 
someone else down to a much lower level of esteem.
<P>
<B>(2010 ) </B>
<P>
	Given the above realities, one is astounded as to how opponents 
of the bill can possibly come to the conclusion that any particular 
group is being granted special protection. The above clearly 
indicates that in fact everyone is treated equally. Yes, every hate 
crime as well is treated equally.
<P>
	Bill C-41 does not give special rights to anyone. It protects all 
Canadians. Every Canadian has a nationality, a race, an age, a 
gender, a sexual orientation, and a religious belief. If there is a 
member in the House who believes he or she is an exception to this 
rule, please let them stand and be counted.
<P>
	Since no one has risen, I will assume I was correct in my 
assumption.
<P>
	Another misguided criticism regards that claim that inclusion of 
the term sexual orientation would somehow serve to promote 
homosexuality. This allegation hardly deserves a response. I cannot 
for one moment think of a way in which this bill would serve to 
promote a certain sexual orientation, or any other group protected 
by Bill C-41 for that matter.
<P>
	Some opponents of this bill have been misled into believing that 
Bill C-41 involves changes that would include the recognition of 
same sex marriages and even same sex benefits. This is absolutely 
ludicrous. This bill deals with crimes in the Criminal Code, not 
with same sex issues.
<P>
	The civil and political rights of gays and lesbians will be debated 
in a completely different context, that being within the context of 
national and international human rights. Those civil and political 
rights are completely unrelated to the bill that is being discussed 
today. Some members in the House have been able to make the 
distinction. In fact, judging from the debate I heard today and 
yesterday in the House, some members have been having a terribly 
difficult time in doing so.
<P>
	Furthermore, I fear that some have utilized this debate as an 
opportunity to voice their dislike for certain lifestyles. Although I 
do agree that they are privy to their own opinions in this respect, I 
most certainly believe that today's debate is not the forum for them 
to voice these opinions. We must deal with this area of concern in a 
rational manner and not emotionally.
<P>
	Today's debate is concerned with the pressing need to prevent 
offences of hate motivated violence in Canada. This distinction we 
must keep in mind.
<P>
	It is quite apparent that the allegations and criticisms aimed at 
Bill C-41 are entirely unfounded and misleading. These criticisms 
are based upon half-truths and misconceptions as well as 
misperceptions.
<P>
	For those who are opposed to the listing of the various 
characteristics of the individual in this clause, please remember 
that the hate crime section is meaningless without the list. In 
several rulings the Supreme Court of Canada has warned that any 
hate related legislation must be very, very precise and identify 
target groups it intends to protect.
<P>
	I urge all members in the House to objectively analyse the debate 
surrounding this bill and make a decision based upon the principles 
of justice, equity, and fairness.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Lee Morrison (Swift Current-Maple 
Creek-Assiniboia, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank the 
hon. member for Thunder Bay-Atikokan for lowering the 
tensions in the room and debating on a somewhat lighter level than 
we have been getting. Of course I think that is only just, because we 
are dealing with a very frivolous bill.
<P>
	All the members opposite who have spoken seemed to zero in on 
one section of the bill. No one remembers that the bill is thick and 
includes a great number of clauses many of which are as equally 
bad as the one all of them seem to want to debate.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13960"> 13960 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(2015) </B>
<P>
	However, the gauntlet has been thrown down on that one issue 
which lists and categorizes people and says that only they and no 
others are entitled to protection against hate. It was a bit frivolous 
when he started saying everybody has a race, a religion and so on. 
The hon. member knows it goes much deeper than that. In any 
event I will play on his turf and by his rules.
<P>
	This is not a very hypothetical question, but if a man who 
happens to be Jewish goes into the bad section of town and is 
beaten half to death by somebody who wants to take his wallet, 
does that man suffer any less than he would have suffered had his 
assailant known he was Jewish when he was beating him? I would 
like a straight answer to that question.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dromisky:</B> Mr. Speaker, the victim in this case has been 
robbed and in the process has received a physical form of abuse 
that could be very devastating. In both cases we have laws to cover 
them. I do not think the attack was perpetrated by the attacker 
knowing the gentleman was a Jew. Therefore I think the law covers 
it and states very clearly exactly what type of treatment the 
criminal must receive in this case.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Myron Thompson (Wild Rose, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
police commission has written a letter. It opposes this bill very 
strongly. If the hon. member has not seen the letter, I suggest he get 
a copy. It is stated loud and clear in the letter that in the courts 
today there are numerous texts, illustrations and periodicals and 
case law. All of that has been put together and they have been using 
it for a number of years to address hate crimes. They have been 
doing it very effectively I might add.
<P>
	If the Liberal government thinks this is not being done, then 
someone should talk to one of the Liberal members on the justice 
committee who stated statistics from court trials where it was 
shown that the homosexual community is third on the list behind 
racial and possibly religious hate crimes. There are records of all 
these things that are happening. It is presently being done. That is 
why the police commission opposes this section. It is simple 
duplication and is unnecessary. They know what they are doing and 
they are doing a good job.
<P>
	What is the real reason for section 718.2 if it is already being 
done?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dromisky:</B> Mr. Speaker, the arguments and challenge being 
presented right now are the very kind of questions that were 
probably asked in the 1930s in this Chamber. In the 1930s the very 
same principles were being advocated by opponents to changes in 
our laws.
<P>
	We have identified various groups in our society in the history of 
this country who have been victimized by hate. Various individuals 
have been attacking specific groups. The need arose. The need was 
identified and a responsible Parliament of the day made a change in 
the Criminal Code to make sure that we could protect that segment 
of Canadian society from various ignorant people, as I would like 
to call them.
<P>
	We have reached a point in the history of this country where for 
some reason or other a group of individuals is being attacked, 
hatred being the main motivating factor. As a result we are taking 
into consideration the need to protect this segment of our society. 
That is why a change has taken place in that section.
<P>
<B>(2020 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the member 
seems so convinced that logically the bill is defensible. Why then is 
it necessary to tell all of the members on the government side how 
to vote on it? Why can they not figure it out for themselves if it is 
so convincingly logical?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dromisky:</B> Mr. Speaker, I do not think I have to convince 
anybody on the government side as to how they should vote on this 
bill. I know that members of the government are extremely rational 
individuals who are very very concerned about the safety of their 
compatriots, their constituents and the citizens of this country.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Resuming debate. The hon. member for 
York-Simcoe. Perhaps it could be put on the record that by an 
understanding the hon. member for York-Simcoe is sharing the 
slot with the hon. member who just spoke on debate.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Karen Kraft Sloan (York-Simcoe, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it 
is a privilege to rise in the House to debate an issue that is of 
importance to all Canadians. I would like to take this opportunity to 
express my strong support for Bill C-41.
<P>
	In particular, I would like to address the sentencing provisions of 
crimes motivated by hate. There has been an incredible amount of 
misinformation surrounding these amendments. I appreciate this 
opportunity to relay the facts and clarify any misconceptions that 
may have arisen over the course of this debate.
<P>
	Bill C-41 is a general bill that proposes amendments to the 
sentencing provisions of the Criminal Code. One of these 
amendments proposes harsher sentences for those already 
convicted of crimes motivated by hate on a number of grounds, 
including race, nationality, colour, religion, sex, age, mental or 
physical disability, or sexual orientation of the victim.
<P>
	Currently there are certain hate crimes that are not covered by 
Canada's anti-hate laws. These include Criminal Code offences 
motivated by hatred against a targeted group which do not involve 
hate propaganda such as physical attacks or murder. In the past the 
law has viewed synagogue desecration as simple mischief without 
acknowledging the intense pain and fear suffered by members of 
the entire targeted community. Therefore, it is imperative that hate 
motivated crimes be included in this bill.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13961"> 13961 </A></B>
<P>
	Unfortunately hate crimes have become alarmingly prevalent in 
our society. Expressions of hate are numerous and range from 
attacks by skinheads on gays to the desecration of synagogues to 
the killing of a native Cree. These attacks target virtually all 
minority groups and most of the time are violent and malicious. 
This can no longer be tolerated.
<P>
	Statistics have made it apparent that hate motivated crimes are 
drastically increasing in our country. B'nai Brith has identified 
over 40 hate groups in Canada. Crimes targeting specific 
populations are on the rise. Hate crimes make many Canadians feel 
vulnerable and afraid. We must not tolerate this any longer in 
Canadian society. It is time that Canada recognized hate crimes as a 
particularly serious category of crime which attacks our diverse 
society. Bill C-41 sends a clear message that these hate motivated 
offences will not be acceptable.
<P>
	This rise in hate motivated crimes has also been recognized 
across the country by police. As a result hate crime units have been 
established to address the changing nature of crime. The 
Ottawa-Carleton Regional Police bias crime unit has already had 
an effect on hate motivated crimes in the national capital region. It 
has been credited with contributing to a significant decrease in all 
hate motivated crimes in Ottawa. As a first of its kind it will act as 
a model for other cities seeking to address this problem.
<P>
	Canadian authorities have had their hands full trying to monitor 
and contain the hate movement. Bill C-41 is an important measure 
to help them protect innocent Canadians from persecution and 
harm. Section 718, 718.1 and 718.2 of Bill C-41 reform the 
sentencing provisions for hate crimes. These amendments are 
welcomed and endorsed by police units across the country.
<P>
	In the past, court rulings have recognized the underlying 
principle that hate motivation should be taken into consideration in 
sentencing. These sections will ensure through legislative means 
this principle is applied uniformly across the country.
<P>
	I firmly believe that specific legislation is required to address 
hate motivated crimes in Canada. These crimes are more serious 
than those committed against individuals and therefore should be 
treated more harshly under the Criminal Code.
<P>
<B>(2025) </B>
<P>
	For example, it is horrible that a young man walking home 
would be attacked because he was targeted as a member and 
therefore a representative of a specific group. This indicates that 
the crime is premeditated and committed with the specific 
intention of bringing deliberate harm and persecution to a targeted 
group.
<P>
	Not only do hate motivated crimes make all members of a 
targeted group feel vulnerable or afraid, but unfortunately by their 
very nature they are often repeated crimes. Therefore, it is 
imperative that we punish these crimes more harshly.
<P>
	Those committing the crimes must realize that their prejudice 
and hatred must not be tolerated by Canadian society and their 
sentence must reflect Canadians' collective condemnation of the 
crime. Only by recognizing the seriousness of these acts of 
aggression and punishing them accordingly under the Criminal 
Code can Canada combat this wave of hate propaganda.
<P>
	Many of us assume that Canada is an open, tolerant and inclusive 
society. We must not take that for granted any longer. Canada has 
been changing over the past few decades. Unfortunately, some 
people do not like the changes and stubbornly resist them. That in 
turn creates more problems. People begin to scapegoat certain 
groups as instigating the problem. This is not right.
<P>
	We must not blame groups for our problems in society. It is 
much easier to blame others than to seek solutions for our complex 
problems. We must not fall prey to this. We must work together to 
build consensus and effectively manage changes occurring in our 
society. However, we must also feel that it is crucial to protect 
individuals and groups from hate motivated crimes.
<P>
	Hate crimes are almost invariably based upon these 
characteristics: race, nationality, colour, religion, sex, age, mental 
or physical disability or sexual orientation. Therefore, it is 
necessary to spell out these characteristics in order to ensure 
sentencing provisions in the legislation are upheld in court.
<P>
	I have received letters from constituents regarding Bill C-41. In 
particular, they are concerned with the inclusion of the term sexual 
orientation. First, the bill does not confer any special rights, but 
rather protects all Canadians. Every Canadian has a nationality, a 
race, an age, a gender and a sexual orientation.
<P>
	The bill will not grant special rights to homosexuals, nor will it 
in any way affect the traditional family. I have assured my 
constituents of these facts, but I will also take advantage of the 
chance to reiterate that this is a sentencing and crime bill which 
will protect all victims of hate crimes. It has absolutely nothing to 
do with the recognition of same sex marriages, nor will it destroy 
the traditional family.
<P>
	I firmly believe that all Canadians should be protected from 
vicious, targeted acts of aggression. I certainly support the 
inclusion of sexual orientation as a ground for hate motivation in 
the legislation. The inclusion of sexual orientation as a ground for 
hate motivation recognizes the fact that criminal acts which are 
intended to terrorize the gay and lesbian community are on the rise 
and unfortunately have become a problem in Canadian society.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13962"> 13962 </A></B>
<P>
	The term sexual orientation has been adequately defined. In fact, 
it has been used in a number of statutes in Canada, including the 
human rights legislation of eight Canadian provinces. This term 
has been consistently interpreted by the courts to include 
heterosexual, homosexual or bisexual. It does not include 
pedophilia. As a matter of fact, pedophilia is an offence under the 
Criminal Code of Canada.
<P>
	I have also heard concerns from constituents that Bill C-41 will 
endanger freedom of speech. This legislation is applicable to 
offences indictable only under the Criminal Code. Bill C-41 is a 
sentencing bill and will be applicable once a person is found guilty 
of a crime. Church sermons are not crimes, nor is moral opposition 
to homosexuality. However, gay bashing is a crime. No one, 
regardless of their beliefs, will be affected by the legislation unless 
they commit and are convicted of an offence which is indictable 
under the Criminal Code. In addition, freedom of religious 
expression is guaranteed in the charter of rights.
<P>
	We cannot ignore the fact that hate crimes are on the rise. We 
must not tolerate hate crimes in our society any longer. The Liberal 
commitment has been very clear from the beginning. Bill C-41 
merely fulfils yet another of our promises outlined in the red book. 
I have always been opposed to hate crimes of any kind. I 
campaigned on this election promise and I fully support the bill at 
final reading.
<P>
	I firmly believe that Bill C-41 is a crucial measure to send the 
strong message that hate crimes will not be tolerated in Canadian 
society. I strongly urge all parliamentarians to support the bill so 
that we may work together to protect all Canadians.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Williams (St. Albert, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I certainly 
noticed the strong emotion of the previous speaker. She is 
committed to ensuring that hate crimes, as she talked about them, 
are vigorously punished by the courts.
<P>
<B>(2030 ) </B>
<P>
	You and I, Mr. Speaker, both represent ridings in Edmonton. 
There is a problem in Edmonton and other cities with the 
Vietnamese gangs who have assaulted other people, white people, 
because they are of a different origin. If white people were to set 
upon the Vietnamese section 718.2 would certainly suggest 
because of their national ethnic origin the court should look on that 
quite seriously.
<P>
	However, when the shoe is on the other foot and the Vietnamese 
gangs are pillaging and terrorizing the neighbourhoods I wonder if 
the member can explain how the bill will show the same respect 
and have the courts apply the same type of punishment.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Kraft Sloan:</B> Mr. Speaker, as parliamentarians we come 
into the House and operate under certain parliamentary rules and 
procedures. One of the rules of the House is that we leave bigotry 
and narrow mindedness at the door before we come in.
<P>
	I suggest to you that your-
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Hon. members should address their 
remarks to the Chair.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Kraft Sloan:</B> To Canadians watching tonight, this is 
another example of bogus, reverse discrimination consistently used 
by members of the third party.
<P>
	This legislation refers to sentencing based on race and ethnicity. 
It does not specify the race of the ethnicity of the individual. If an 
individual is convicted of a crime motivated by hate based on race 
or ethnicity it has nothing to do with whether they are black, white, 
red, yellow, green or purple.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Leon E. Benoit (Vegreville, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the hon. 
member who just spoke pointed out one of the problems with this 
legislation.
<P>
	When my colleague asked about different treatments that might 
be in place when Vietnamese committed crimes against whites 
because of race and when whites committed crimes against 
Vietnamese, she did not consider both to be discrimination. She 
considered one to be reverse discrimination.
<P>
	I ask the member why that is. If one is discrimination, why is the 
other one not pure and simple discrimination?
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Kraft Sloan:</B> Mr. Speaker, what I said was this is a typical 
example members on the other side use to illustrate what they refer 
to as reverse discrimination. I do not refer to reverse 
discrimination. I refer only to discrimination. I am referring to the 
things members opposite have used particularly in debates on 
employment equity when they are constantly screaming about 
reverse discrimination.
<P>
	What I said, if the member opposite had been listening, was if a 
person is convicted of a hate crime based on race or ethnicity it 
does not matter about skin colour.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Lee Morrison (Swift Current-Maple 
Creek-Assiniboia, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the hon. member for 
York-Simcoe seems to suffer from the same misapprehension as 
her colleagues in that she believes Bill C-41 is a bill with only one 
clause. We hear nothing except the so-called hate clause over and 
over again.
<P>
<B>(2035 ) </B>
<P>
	The member from Thunder Bay-Atikokan wants to play on that 
field. I will join her there.
<P>
	My mythical Jewish gentleman wanders into a bad section of 
town and is beaten half to death by someone who does not know he 
is Jewish in order to steal his wallet. On another occasion he suffers 
the same type of treatment from someone who knows he is Jewish 
and decides that for his daily kicks he will beat up on Jews. As an 
afterthought he steals the wallet. The gentleman in both 
circumstances is equally damaged and ends up in the hospital. Why 
in the name of justice and common sense should one thug get a 
stiffer sentence than the other one?
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13963"> 13963 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Kraft Sloan:</B> Mr. Speaker, one of my colleagues on this 
side spoke about different aspects, about victim impact and other 
aspects of the legislation. Other members on this side have spoken 
about many different aspects of the legislation. However, some of 
us have been choosing to speak to the hate crime aspect of it simply 
because members opposite are not getting the point. We thought we 
would like to do it again and again until perhaps-
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Resuming debate with the 
hon. member for Prince George-Bulkley Valley.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dick Harris (Prince George-Bulkley Valley, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, one of the things that becomes abundantly clear in this 
whole debate is the Liberal Party appears to be very uncomfortable 
with section 718.2.
<P>
	We on this side know the bill is some 75 pages long. Some of the 
Liberal members have pointed out the bill is some 75 pages long. 
However, invariably every one of the Liberal speakers tonight has 
zeroed in on 718.2. Why is that? The reason is they are 
uncomfortable with it. They are finding themselves being put into a 
position of having to defend it over and over again and their case is 
getting weaker and weaker.
<P>
	Now we find in this debate, which has been happening since the 
bill was first introduced, the speakers becoming proactive in 
jumping into 718.2 in order to fend off some questions from the 
other side. If I were not comfortable with 718.2 had I presented it 
as part of the government I would probably be doing the same 
thing.
<P>
	Tens of thousands of letters, cards and names on petitions have 
come into Parliament, to members, by people who have taken the 
time to read Bill C-41. They have taken the time to get an 
understanding of what section 718.2 really means, what kind of 
precedent it can set and what it may lead to in the future when we 
come to defining some of the categories mentioned in it.
<P>
	Let us not forget if this legislation passes, the term sexual 
orientation will appear for the first time in any Canadian legislation 
ever passed in the House. People are very concerned about that.
<P>
	I understand the Liberals' current proactiveness in zeroing in on 
718.2 because they want to deflect some of the questions over here.
<P>
<B>(2040) </B>
<P>
	They are uncomfortable with it. They know it is flawed. They 
know there has been a huge uprising of concern from the Canadian 
people, not from the special interest groups they have been talking 
to, but from rank and file Canadians across the country concerned 
about this clause in the bill as well.
<P>
	They all have the letters. They have the cards. They have seen 
the petitions. Our Criminal Code tries to demonstrate the things we 
hold dear and what penalties should be dealt should these things be 
violated.
<P>
	The government of the day and parliamentarians have an 
obligation to listen to the Canadian people, to a broad range of 
Canadian people to get the feel of the average person so when 
amendments are made to the Criminal Code they will best 
represent society's perception or views on what direction we 
should be going in when we deal with changes to the Criminal 
Code.
<P>
	Bill C-41 does not reflect the views of the average Canadian 
because the Liberals did not pursue a broad sampling of the views 
of average Canadians. That is not their style. Instead they selected 
people to attend the committees, to submit briefs from groups and 
organizations, not individual views, so they could mould them into 
the real Liberal agenda in the bill, something politically expedient 
for that party.
<P>
	This is one of the many bills the Liberals have introduced this 
session that do not address the real views of the Canadian people. I 
want to talk about criminal justice for a moment and tell members 
about a survey so there is no mistake on some of the things I may 
say tonight as to whether I am representing the views of my 
constituents. Above all, unlike the views of the leader of the 
Liberal Party, I am here to represent the constituents who voted and 
sent me here to represent them.
<P>
	I did a survey on criminal justice and I wanted to get a broad 
range of views from right across my constituency. I asked 30,000 
households about their views on the death penalty. Eighty-eight per 
cent of the people who returned the questionnaire said they wanted 
to have the death penalty returned for first degree murder. Of those 
88 per cent affirming the return of the death penalty, 58 per cent 
suggested it should be extended to child molesters. Fifty-four per 
cent said it should be extended to rapists. Forty-five per cent said it 
should be extended to drug dealers. I think members are getting an 
idea of the views of the people I represent. They are my views as 
well.
<P>
	The point is we have a Criminal Code which our courts are 
obligated to operate under. In the sentencing provisions judges are 
given sentencing latitudes. The penalties, quite frankly, with the 
exception of capital punishment which is not in there, thanks to the 
member for Notre-Dame-de-Grâce a few years ago, are in the 
criminal justice system already. It is not the problem of the 
penalties. It is a problem with the administration of the penalties by 
the judges. It is the sentencing that is the problem. The judges have 
latitude and they are not giving out the penalties.
<P>
<B>(2045) </B>
<P>
	An assault is an assault is an assault, whether it is against one 
person or another person, regardless of what people's differences 
may be. A physical assault is a vicious crime. A sexual assault is a 
more vicious crime. An assault that causes a lifetime injury, a 
disability, is a very vicious crime. There are penalties on the books 
to deal with these crimes. But a government like this one does not 
have the guts to encourage the judges to deal with them in a manner 
that rationalizes the sentences  they should be giving. That is the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13964"> 13964 </A></B>
<P>
problem. We do not need changes to sentencing provisions. They 
are already there but they are not being used. This is frustrating 
Canadians all across the country.
<P>
	A section in the bill deals with the treatment of offenders of 
aboriginal descent. About two weeks ago a native Indian was 
convicted of sexual assault. At the same time he issued a death 
threat against his victim. The fellow went to court and was found 
guilty. That is a very serious crime in my book and would be 
considered so by most Canadians.
<P>
	Even some of the bleeding heart Liberals across the way would 
agree with me that sexual assault is a very serious crime. Saying: 
``If you do not co-operate, I am going to kill you'', is a very serious 
offence as well.
<P>
	The person was found guilty. The evidence in court showed that 
the person had prior arrest and convictions for armed robbery. 
However, the judge with his creative thinking or because of 
political pressure or the influencing forces to make politically 
correct decisions, decided that instead of dealing with the crime as 
one that has a specified punishment in the Criminal Code, to have a 
sentencing circle. That is something new that is coming into the 
country when dealing with aboriginals.
<P>
	The sentencing circle of elders determined that this man who 
was convicted of sexual assault and while assaulting his victim 
said: ``If you do not co-operate with me, I will kill you'', who had 
previous sentences for armed robberies which is a serious crime, 
whether your gun is registered or not, was given a sentence of one 
year banishment.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Thompson:</B> Shame. Shame.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Harris:</B> He was given one year banishment. He was to go 
out into a remote area for a year and be counselled by some elders.
<P>
	I saw an article on that in a Halifax newspaper while going 
home. By the time I reached Prince George, B.C. it had hit the 
Prince George <I>Citizen</I> the next day. My phone started ringing off 
the hook and people were asking me: ``Is everyone crazy out 
there?'' I said to them: ``No, just the Liberals''.
<P>
<B>(2050) </B>
<P>
	This is the type of justice that Liberals seem to embrace. An 
individual is responsible for a crime which he or she commits. But 
Liberals do not believe in placing the responsibility on the 
individual who commits the crime. No. The Liberal philosophy 
says that it is society which is to blame. Let us penalize society. 
Society turned this person that way. They are not to blame.
<P>
	The fact is there are provisions in the Criminal Code to deal with 
serious crimes, even the hate crimes which are pointed out in 
section 718.2. We have penalties on the books now.
<P>
	I want to get back to sentencing. Section 718.2(c) states:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>where consecutive sentences are imposed, the combined sentence should not 
be unduly long or harsh;</BLOCKQUOTE>
	When I read that I see Pierre Elliott Trudeau and I see his former 
justice minister, the one responsible for section 745. It is the 
rallying cry of bleeding heart liberalism personified in the bill. Far 
be it for the courts to suggest that criminals should be punished for 
a crime.
<P>
	Many Canadians are wondering about the existence of 
concurrent sentences. Why should a criminal convicted of several 
crimes serve his sentences concurrently so that he ends up serving a 
sentence for only one of the crimes?
<P>
	This fashion of sentencing, consecutive and concurrent, is the 
number one contributor to plea bargaining, to deal making outside 
the courts. The lawyers get together, have a cup of coffee and say: 
``If you want to play golf this afternoon let's cop a plea and we will 
get this thing over with''.
<P>
	People read in the paper about someone who has been convicted 
of a serious crime and got a slap on the wrist. Most times the judge 
takes a bad rap for that because the lawyers had made the deal 
outside the courtroom before it even got to the judge. I have a 
decent enough regard for lawyers. They have to make a living too. 
We took the bounty off them in our party, Mr. Speaker.
<P>
	The Liberals have it all wrong in Bill C-41. They are simply 
reacting to pressure from the interest groups which supported them 
during the election. The Liberals are famous for that. Mr. Trudeau 
probably did the best job at gathering together people from 
different categories and from different groups so that when the 
election came along they did not have to start talking to people 
individually, they just talked to the leaders and the rest of the 
people followed behind.
<P>
	Our country is on a dangerous path. We would be negligent as 
parliamentarians if we dared to forget that the people of Canada 
have a right to decide what kind of society they want to live in. As 
long as the government refuses to listen to a broad spectrum of the 
Canadian people to hear their ideas and concerns, then anything it 
attempts to do with the criminal justice system is going to serve 
only the people who support it.
<P>
<B>(2055 ) </B>
<P>
	This is the underlying purpose of the bill. It is not to try to 
address crime in a meaningful way, but rather to placate the special 
interest groups that are giving the government a lot of problems 
right now.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13965"> 13965 </A></B>
<P>
	I cannot in any way support a bill like this. I have had probably 
in excess of 15,000 pieces of mail from my riding all saying: ``You 
are our member of Parliament for Prince George-Bulkley Valley. 
We implore you to vote against Bill C-41 particularly against 
section 718.2'' which attempts to categorize certain types of crime 
based on the categories that the Liberal Party wants there.
<P>
	In response to the people who sent me here to represent them I 
will most assuredly vote against Bill C-41 and comply with the 
wishes of my constituents, something that the party opposite is not 
able to do.
<P>
	Let me rephrase that. In all fairness there are members of the 
party opposite, and I apologize to them publicly now, who have had 
the guts to stand up and say, I am going to represent my 
constituency. That is what I was sent here to do. That is what I am 
going to do. I congratulate them and I condemn the whip. I 
condemn the Prime Minister for the things he has said about the 
people who have had the guts to stand up and vote in a democratic 
fashion representing their constituents.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Tom Wappel (Scarborough West, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
a lawyer. They may have taken the bounty off lawyers in the 
Reform Party but I have to rise to debate the comments that my 
hon. friend has made. I want to make three or four comments. I ask 
my friend to have a pen and paper handy to copy down some 
sections. Then perhaps he would make a comment or two.
<P>
	I have a great interest in this bill, having studied it in the justice 
committee. I have been watching the debate. I note that the debate 
is going back and forth. Where is Her Majesty's loyal opposition in 
this debate?
<P>
	The last person I saw speak was from the Reform Party, then 
back to my own party, then back over to the Reform Party and back 
to my own party. I do not see the Bloc Quebecois members 
standing up and talking about what they think is right, whether they 
are supporting this bill or whether they are not.
<P>
	The justice critic stood up and said a few words. One Bloc 
member addressed one of the many sections of this bill. I say 
shame on a party that does not take its responsibility seriously as 
Her Majesty's loyal opposition.
<P>
	I want to say something about the witnesses that appeared before 
the justice committee. I was a member of the justice committee that 
studied this bill. It is very true that what we would call the ordinary 
citizen, in other words, the person who might live on Grenoble 
Street in my riding did not have an opportunity to come.
<P>
	The groups that appeared before the justice committee and gave 
evidence were in my view representative of all of the interests that 
were concerned with this bill and in my judgment at least put 
forward the arguments for and against various sections of the bill.
<P>
	I do not think the Canadian people were deprived because each 
and every one of the members on that committee of all the parties 
took a certain approach at the justice committee and were able to 
ask the questions  they felt were required based on how they want 
to represent their constituents.
<P>
<B>(2100 ) </B>
<P>
	I know a lot of the debate has centred on section 718.2. However, 
this bill has a lot of interesting principles in it and it deals with a 
number of things. We have had history lessons about Prime 
Minister Trudeau and who was the justice minister here and there. 
Let us find out a little bit about the Reform Party.
<P>
	Section 730 deals with absolute and conditional discharges, 
which may be granted by the courts in certain circumstances. Does 
the Reform Party support absolute and conditional discharges, yes 
or no?
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> Yes.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Wappel:</B> Section 731 deals with probation. Does the 
Reform Party support section 731 and the concept of probation?
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> Yes.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Wappel:</B> Section 734 deals with fines. Does the Reform 
Party support the concept of fines as outlined in section 734?
<P>
	What about section 738, dealing with restitution to victims of 
crime and in particular a proposal made that people who abuse their 
spouses should be ordered to make restitution?
<P>
	I would like to know what the Reform Party's policies are in 
response to the very things that are in this bill on these points.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Harris:</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like to answer the hon. 
member. The answer to his last questions are yes, yes, yes, and yes.
<P>
	However, here we have a bill that has a lot of similarities to Bill 
C-68 where it has some perfectly good legislation in it. At the same 
time, because of the way the Liberals operate, it has some terribly 
bad legislation in it.
<P>
	This is just like Bill C-68, when we said: ``Listen, why do you 
not split the bill. We will be glad to support you on the part dealing 
with stiffer penalties, but we cannot support you on the 
registration''. We made amendments to this bill to try to delete 
some of the bad legislation that we thought was going to cause a lot 
of problems. It is interesting that so did some of the members over 
here. The government whip and the justice minister said no, it has 
to go through.
<P>
	What is happening is that we are permitted to try to take out bad 
legislation here, which we have done. The member for Crowfoot 
made a ton of amendments to try to get this thing so it was 
acceptable by leaving the good parts and getting rid of the bad 
parts. I know the hon. member made a lot of amendments himself 
trying to do exactly the same thing.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13966"> 13966 </A></B>
<P>
	However, the fact is that the justice minister, cheered on by the 
Prime Minister, had an agenda and just tried to ram this thing 
through and God help anyone in this party who votes against it, 
because they are going to answer to the whip over the summer.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Monique Guay (Laurentides, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, when I 
hear Reform members call the bill frivolous and say we are giving 
people with a different sexual orientation unnecessary powers 
when there is already flexibility, I say yes, judges have some 
flexibility, but they are under no obligation to consider the sexual 
orientation, race or gender of the victim. This flexibility applies to 
all human beings. There is no obligation.
<P>
	In Quebec, we have a Charter of Rights and Freedoms and we 
have been using it for 17 years. We never had a problem. People 
never said we were giving more power to some people on the basis 
of their sexual orientation, race or gender. On the contrary. I 
believe this is a very democratic exercise.
<P>
	Reform members today are trying to appear holier than thou. 
Today they are calling for the death sentence, and maybe tomorrow 
they will call for corporal punishment for children to make them 
more obedient. I think this bill is nothing out of the ordinary. It is a 
good bill. I think it should be supported, and we will do that. In 
Quebec, we have operated this way for a long time.
<P>
<B>(2105) </B>
<P>
	I would ask Reform members to stop playing holier than thou in 
this House. I would ask them to be logical and look at the bill as it 
is, and especially to read it, because they did not read it. I have a 
feeling they do not understand it very well. Maybe we should 
translate it for them. I would also ask them to try to understand and 
further the cause of democracy.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Harris:</B> Mr. Speaker, there was a lot of talk there.
<P>
	I want to address the first thing the member said. She said that 
the judges do not have an obligation. Judges are put in a position to 
preside over criminal cases. They are in fact entrusted with the 
responsibility and with the obligation to deal in the sentencing of 
people who are found guilty of committing crimes in this country. 
They do have the obligation. They clearly have an obligation. The 
problem is when we get politicians who do not allow them to do 
their job and want to try to influence them for politically correct 
reasons or for politically expedient reasons. They interfere with the 
justice system.
<P>
	If judges were left alone to do their job without the outside 
influence from politicians and political parties who believe that 
people who commit crimes should not be convicted, we would have 
a safer society.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ron MacDonald (Dartmouth, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I will be 
very brief.
<P>
	I have to say that I do not think this debate is good for the 
Canadian public. This is the highest court in the land.  Quite 
frankly, I am fed up with members of the Reform Party getting up 
and either intentionally or unintentionally in their debates on their 
points-they have every right to debate points here, but it seems 
that each and every time they use an example about what is wrong 
they use the example of a native Canadian, an Indian, as he just 
said, to show that the whole sentencing structure in Canada is 
wrong.
<P>
	Did he use the example of an adult white male from Alberta? No. 
He used the example of a native. It is the same thing when there is a 
crisis in the fisheries on the west coast: they get up and talk about 
native poaching.
<P>
	Every single thing I have heard from this bunch opposite since 
they got elected smacks of racism. It smacks of the very type of 
thing I fought most of my adult life to stamp out. To hear it 
repeated over and over again in the highest court in the land I think 
is condemnable.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Harris:</B> Mr. Speaker, I do not know, was that a question?
<P>
	I would like to make a point of order, Mr. Speaker. This hon. 
member appears to be under the understanding that I created this 
story. I did not. It happened. I read it in the newspaper. I read the 
report. I did not create the idea that-
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Order. The hon. member for Dartmouth 
very clearly called the other member stupid. I do not think it 
contributes to the demeanour of this House one bit to have one 
member calling another in a loud voice stupid.
<P>
	There are very few of us who were in the last Parliament here, 
and I can assure colleagues that the Canadian people thought we 
behaved abominably in the last Parliament.
<P>
	I would ask the hon. member for Dartmouth whether he wishes 
to reconsider that comment.
<P>
	<B>Mr. MacDonald:</B> Mr. Speaker, I was a member in the last 
Parliament, and I do not often use language that strong. I am sorry, 
but the member's comments incited me to strong language. If it is 
the wish of the Chair, I will withdraw it.
<P>
	I will speak later in this debate and I will clarify my comments 
so that anybody who is listening will fully understand the intent of 
what I just said to the hon. member.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> I would thank the hon. member for 
Dartmouth very much for that. Resuming debate, the hon. member 
for Wild Rose.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13967"> 13967 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Myron Thompson (Wild Rose, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
pursuant to Standing Order 43(2), our members are to be dividing 
their time from this time on.
<P>
	When I go to a store and buy a box of apples, if they are half 
rotten I am not going to buy the whole box. That is why I cannot 
buy this bill. There are some good points in it, but it is too bad that 
the merits are plumb spoiled by a number of items that are 
absolutely wrong.
<P>
<B>(2110) </B>
<P>
	I want to quickly mention alternative measures. Maybe it will 
help my lawyer friend across the way to know that I agree with the 
lawyers in their issue of the <I>Law Times</I> when they ask a question I 
asked. An editorial in the <I>Law Times</I> asks the question: Is the 
minister dispensing justice, or are his attempts at change another 
failed attempt at social engineering? I could not agree more with 
that law book. The minister has spent two years here trying to be a 
social engineer, not a Minister of Justice. I think he needs to 
straighten up his act.
<P>
	I object to the alternative measures for the reasons I have 
mentioned. I object to the idea that we have come up with C-37, 
the tough legislation that is supposed to deal with young offenders, 
and then turn around and come out with a sentencing bill that puts 
in a clause that says 16 and 17 year olds who go to adult court are 
still going to be treated at sentencing as if they were juveniles. If 
they are going into adult court, they should be prepared to take 
adult sentencing. Even children in schools have told me that is the 
way it ought to be.
<P>
	I want to make another quick comment with regard to something 
I read in <I>Hansard</I>. The hon. government whip dared to say that I am 
painting all teenagers with the same brush because I mentioned 16 
and 17 year old hooligans. I did mention that, but I resent that 
comment. Thirty years of working in a school certainly ought to 
command a little respect for what I have done and how I treated 
students.
<P>
	I can assure the government that 95 per cent of the time I spent 
with about 5 per cent of the youth, about 4 per cent of them were 
disciplined and about 1 per cent were serious problems. I do not 
paint them with the same brush. I reject that kind of thing.
<P>
	I swear to goodness that if I were walking down the street and 
there were two people beating up on another person, had him down 
and were really working him over, I for one guarantee that I would 
make an effort to stop it. I would not stop to ask if the victim was 
gay or see if he was black or what. It would not make any 
difference. I would stop it, because that is the way it ought to be. 
You do not allow it to go on.
<P>
	To hear these people talk, you would think I would lift him up 
and say: ``Oh, you are gay, well then carry on''. How stupid can 
you get? I resent those kinds of remarks and the implications.
<P>
	I would like to say that I have a brother-in-law who is black. I 
love that man just as much as I do any  brother-in-law. His 
children are also very black. I love every one of them, my nieces 
and nephews. I do. I happen to know a little bit about what it is to 
be involved with prejudice, because I have seen it happen to them. I 
know it can happen, and it should not happen. If we think for one 
moment that this kind of legislation is going to deal with it, we 
have to think again. It is not.
<P>
	I want to talk about one other thing that really amazes me. I 
would like to find out how many employers throughout the country 
hire their staff and tell them: ``You work for me, and if you go out 
and break the law make sure you do not go to jail for more than two 
years and I will keep you on the payroll''. That sounds pretty stupid 
to me. Good grief, we are telling the taxpayers of the country that it 
is okay if we go out and break the law as long as it does not cost 
more than two years incarceration and they have to keep paying us 
and keep us on the payroll, so we had better make sure that if we 
get sentenced it is for only 18 months. Good heavens. We are pretty 
good, though; we got it changed from five years to two years.
<P>
	The last thing I want to talk about is section 718.2. I did not even 
really want to address it. I firmly believe the courts are doing an 
excellent job of handling hate crimes now. I have seen numerous 
reports coming from the courts that verify that they are dealing 
with it effectively. They are doing a great job in that respect.
<P>
	I only wish they would do that much for every crime, so we 
would not have to have caveat and other groups joining up all over 
the nation crying for justice and not getting it.
<P>
<B>(2115 ) </B>
<P>
	In the nearly two years I have been in the House I have not seen 
one piece of legislation that will make one person in the country 
any safer, not one.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Augustine:</B> Bill C-68.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Thompson:</B> That one most of all. Let me consider section 
718.2. If they are doing their job then why are we including sexual 
orientation? That is a good question.
<P>
	My, my. I heard my colleague say a minute ago that if we 
included it in this legislation it would be the first time it has ever 
been included. I have heard comments from the commissioner of 
human rights who says that if this is put into legislation it will get 
into the human rights act; it will get into the charter; and it will get 
into many more things.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Thompson:</B> That is what they want and they are making it 
very clear. That is why they are cheering. That is what they want.
<P>
	I am speaking for myself; I am not speaking Reform policy. I 
want the whole world to know that I do not condone homosexuals. I 
do not condone their activity. I do not condemn homosexuals. I do 
not like what they do. I think it is wrong. I think it is unnatural and I 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13968"> 13968 </A></B>
<P>
think it is  totally immoral. I think that is the opinion of 85 per cent 
to 90 per cent of Canadians.
<P>
	Members of the House should take the time to find out how their 
people feel, wherever they are. They should read the petitions with 
the table with the names of people who are against that kind of 
legislation. They should read the letters they get in their offices 
about the legislation. Then they would have no choice but to stand 
up for the people of Canada and say: ``No, it is not going to be part 
of any legislation in the country as it condones immorality''. That 
is what it does.
<P>
	I will object to it forever whenever they attack the good, 
traditional Canadian family unit that built the country. I do not 
want any changes to that family unit, including this kind of 
legislation.
<P>
	I am very certain the reason that section 718.2 has been included 
is so that they can do it in the future. I know for a fact, having 
talked to a number of Liberal backbenchers, that they feel the same 
way. I know they do. I have talked to them personally.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> They do?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Thompson:</B> Yes, they do. I encourage them to stand for 
morality and not stand for immorality when the vote comes tonight. 
Listen to what the people have told you, read your mail and look at 
those petitions, one to ten or better. You must vote against this kind 
of legislation. Do not allow it to happen in this country. I beg of 
you, do not let it happen. Stand up for your convictions. Stand up 
for Canadians. I ask you to do that.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> I have never seen a bigger bigot in my life.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Thompson:</B> I rise on a point of order, Mr. Speaker. I would 
like the gentleman who just called me a bigot to come back in here 
and withdraw. Hamilton West, the member for Hamilton West.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Did the hon. member for Hamilton West 
call the hon. member a bigot?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Yes.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> I would like to hear the hon. member for 
Hamilton West if he will have the decency to come back in the 
House.
<P>
	The member for Hamilton West heard the point of order. Perhaps 
the member for Hamilton West would wish to reply.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Keyes:</B> Mr. Speaker, I will have something to say if the hon. 
Speaker withdraws the remark that I do not have any decency.
<P>
<B>(2120) </B>
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Colleagues, I realize this is a very, very 
controversial matter but there are rules, there are words that are 
unparliamentary. When one member calls another member a bigot 
and the member gets up and expresses offence at it, I would think 
that the member who has done it would be kind enough to  
withdraw the term. I would ask the hon. member for Hamilton West 
to withdraw the term.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Keyes:</B> Mr. Speaker, I will repeat. If Mr. Speaker rises and 
says will the member for Hamilton West have the decency to come 
back and apologize, then I have to question the Speaker.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Does the hon. Secretary of State for 
Parliamentary Affairs wish to speak to the point of order?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gagliano:</B> Yes, Mr. Speaker. I think as the Chair you have 
the right to keep order here, but the way you addressed the issue 
was as if you agreed and made your judgment but did not give a 
chance to the member to express himself on whether or not he 
made that statement. I think as a Speaker of this House you have to 
hear both sides before you make any judgments.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Does any other member wish to speak to 
the point of order? The hon. House leader of the Reform Party on 
the point of order.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hermanson:</B> Mr. Speaker, I recognize that the hon. member 
who made the comments has returned. Mr. Speaker, you did say, if 
I understood correctly, that you thought it would be the decent 
thing for the member to come back and state his case.
<P>
	I agree with the Secretary of State for Parliamentary Affairs that 
the hon. member for Hamilton West should be allowed to state 
whether or not he in fact used the word. He has been decent and has 
come back to the House. I would ask that he state whether he would 
withdraw the remarks he made to my hon. colleague from Wild 
Rose.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Milliken:</B> Mr. Speaker, I refer you to Beauchesne's 
<I>Parliamentary Rules and Forms</I>, citations 488, 489, 490 and 492. 
In none of them is the word bigot listed as a word that is 
unparliamentary.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Adams:</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like to say that I do not know 
about the member for Hamilton West, but I did call the member 
opposite a big bigot and I withdraw it as being unparliamentary.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> I would thank the hon. member for 
Peterborough for the courtesy to other members in the House. Does 
anyone else wish to speak to the point of order? I will call on the 
member for Hamilton West one further time.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13969"> 13969 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Keyes:</B> I am sorry, Mr. Speaker, one further time for what? I 
am not too clear on what you are asking.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Whether the member would be kind 
enough to withdraw the word bigot that was used earlier, I 
understand.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Keyes:</B> Mr. Speaker, in the interests I have of having a 
respect for this House-is Mr. Speaker paying attention?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Keyes:</B> In the interests I have for the respect of this House 
and the respect I have for a colleague of this House, I will withdraw 
the term bigot on the member because I too was in a heated state 
with the member in debate.
<P>
	But, Mr. Speaker, to ask for me to have the decency to come into 
the House, I had a lot of difficulty with your remark, Sir.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> I thank the member for doing that.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Keyes:</B> Thank you very much for your courtesy.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The hon. Parliamentary Secretary to the 
Minister of Foreign Affairs on questions or comments.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jesse Flis (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Foreign Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise so that I can 
compliment the hon. member for Wild Rose who is a former 
educator like myself. He told the House what he would do if he saw 
a fight on the street regardless of the colour of the people, the 
religion, et cetera. I compliment him for it.
<P>
	He like other speakers from the Reform Party complained that 
the only section the Liberals were addressing was section 718.2. 
The reason this side is addressing it is that-
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hermanson:</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. I would 
like to clarify whether the hon. member is on debate or on 
questions or comments.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The hon. member is on questions or 
comments.
<P>
<B>(2125 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Flis:</B> Mr. Speaker, the reason we were hung up on section 
718.2 is that it was all the Reform Party was addressing and we 
were trying to educate the Reform Party to the fact that it was not 
the only issue in the bill.
<P>
	I draw the hon. member's attention to section 718. I had trouble 
with some sections but I welcomed section 718 when I looked at 
the purpose and the principles of the bill because I also have a 
constituency where a lot of crime has crept in. Section 718 states:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The fundamental purpose of sentencing is to contribute, along with crime 
prevention initiatives, to respect for the law and the maintenance of a just, 
peaceful and safe society by imposing just sanctions that have one or more of 
the following objectives:</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(a) to denounce unlawful conduct;</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Unfortunately there are some Canadians who stoop to unlawful 
conduct. It continues:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
(b) to deter the offender and other persons from committing offences;</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(c) to separate offenders from society, where necessary;</BLOCKQUOTE>
	In question period the Reform Party has been pressing this point. 
Sections 718(e) and (f) are specifically important. They state:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(e) to provide reparations for harm done to victims or to the community;</BLOCKQUOTE>
	The judges in the past have had no direction and now the bill is 
giving them direction. If there is damage done to a community, 
hopefully in the sentencing the judge will take that into 
consideration. The criminal might be able to help the community 
more by restoring the damage rather than by sitting for two or five 
years behind bars.
<P>
	They continue:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(f) to promote a sense of responsibility in offenders, and acknowledgement of 
the harm done to victims and to the community.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	There is an organization called Parkdale Focus Community 
Watch in my constituency. That is exactly what it is focusing on. It 
wants to protect the safety of the streets and the homes of the 
community.
<P>
	Would the hon. member agree with what is stated in the purpose 
and principles in section 718?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Thompson:</B> Mr. Speaker, I too sat on the justice committee 
for a number of hours going through the bill. Like I said, there are a 
number of things which I really liked about it. There are some 
things in section 718 that I appreciate about the bill. I think there 
was some good intent.
<P>
	What I cannot understand is why we had to have an all-inclusive 
list. When we start making a list regarding hate we are going to 
leave somebody off of it. I do not see how we can help that. At the 
same time we did research on this and my hon. colleague provided 
statistics which said that homosexuals were third on the list of 
groups being targeted. The first was racism and I forget what the 
second one was. There are statistics showing that the courts today 
are dealing very effectively with those issues.
<P>
	The Minister of Justice has received a letter from the police 
commissions indicating that is the case. They objected to the entire 
section 718.2 based on the fact that they have been doing this for 
years, have built case law and have plenty of literature. They were 
very effectively doing the job.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13970"> 13970 </A></B>
<P>
	If they are doing it effectively, why does the minister not listen 
to the police commissions as he did on the gun bill and take that 
section out? I have to assume it is because of the inclusion of 
sexual orientation. I cannot figure any reason why they would 
include that if it is not to extend it much more. It bothers me when 
we get into legalizing adoption and spousal benefits. That is what 
bothers Canadians.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jack Iyerak Anawak (Parliamentary Secretary to 
Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development, Lib.):</B>
<P>
	[<I>Editor's Note: Member spoke in Inuktitut</I>]
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, I have one very simple question for the hon. 
member for Wild Rose. If a crime such as murder is committed 
against a person who is a homosexual, or a person is discriminated 
against because of their homosexuality, does the member condone 
that?
<P>
<B>(2130) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Thompson:</B> No, Mr. Speaker, I do not condone that. I 
thought I had made that perfectly clear. I do not believe that any 
human being in Canada should be treated in that fashion regardless 
of anything. I object when people say that a particular crime 
affected more people than another one.
<P>
	We have a number of crimes before the court right now. I am 
thinking of the Mahaffy family and the Fisher family which 
affected the entire nation, affected every province. Every human 
being in this country who knows has been affected.
<P>
	Whether people over there like to believe it or not, any time that 
happens to any human being, regardless of anything, it affects me. I 
do not want it to happen in Canada. I do not want my grandchildren 
to live with that threat. I am here because I want laws that will 
address those problems. It is not going to be done with Bill C-41 
regardless of what the clown from Kingston tries to tell us.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Philip Mayfield (Cariboo-Chilcotin, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
it is a pleasure for me to speak to Bill C-41, an act to amend the 
Criminal Code with regard to sentencing and other acts in 
consequence thereof.
<P>
	There are a number of positive aspects of this bill that I 
personally find encouraging. For example, it is good to see that 
victim impact statements will be allowed as testimony, though 
Reform members have voiced concerns over the decision that only 
written testimonies will be accepted.
<P>
	One of the principle concerns I hold though lies in this bill's 
further entrenching of the divisions between Canadians as outlined 
in section 718.2. This entrenching does nothing to pull Canadians 
together and reinforce the principles of fundamental justice. If 
anything, it stigmatizes Canadians, classifies Canadians, divides 
Canadians and raises suspicions between Canadians.
<P>
	In the last century, one of the most controversial thinkers ever 
proposed a radical view of history and society. Whether or not one 
agrees with these views and opinions, most people will agree that 
Karl Marx was one of the great philosophers of his age. The 
theories he put forward on society's changes and conflicts rested on 
one basic foundation, that our society is divided into identifiable 
groups. Changes came in Marx's model when groups polarized and 
fought against each other, landowners versus peasants, the 
proletariat versus the bourgeoisie, or the capitalists versus the 
communists. These groups would clash and fight and in the end, 
society would undergo dramatic changes, he proposed.
<P>
	Most Canadians today rightly refuse to have anything to do with 
Marx's principles of division and conflict. The people of this 
country want Canada to be a land of opportunity where anyone, 
rich or poor, man or woman, can reach for their dreams and strive 
for whatever goals their hearts desire. We strive for a country free 
of racism and discrimination so that when we look at each other we 
see nothing but fellow Canadians. Ironically, it is our governments, 
not the Canadian people, which are striving to retrench and 
reinforce these very divisions that Canadians are trying to erase.
<P>
	It was in 1982 that the government of Pierre Trudeau brought 
forward its controversial charter of rights and freedoms. This 
charter did not simply declare all individuals as equal under and 
before the law, it outlined the specific grounds under which people 
could not be discriminated. In other words, it spelled out the 
specific grounds under which Canadians could be considered equal 
or unequal.
<P>
	In section 15(2), much to the surprise of many Canadians, the 
charter gives our governments the power and the authority to 
discriminate. This charter by its language and intentions purposely 
divided Canadians into identifiable groups both before the courts 
and before their fellow Canadians.
<P>
	Since the passage of the charter, Canadians from coast to coast 
have fought against the entrenchment of these divisions in the quest 
to simply become Canadians above all else, not hyphenated 
Canadians, not divided Canadians. For example, Statistics Canada 
became extremely frustrated during the last census because many 
Canadians refused to identify their ethnic origin. They saw 
themselves only as Canadians and told StatsCan this by writing 
``Canadian'' on the form.
<P>
<B>(2135) </B>
<P>
	The message they were sending is: ``We are Canadians, not 
members of some identifiable group''. Despite this opposition 
StatsCan is continuing to compile these figures. Without a doubt 
even more questions on ethnic origins will be asked in future 
censuses.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13971"> 13971 </A></B>
<P>
	It is odd that my colleague from Calgary Centre presented a 
petition just last Monday calling on Statistics Canada to consider 
adding Canadian to its list of backgrounds and ethnicities. There is 
a message here. Canadians are tired of the divisions, tired of the 
classifications. They are seeking parity. They want equality.
<P>
	This brings me to Bill C-41 and the amendments to the Criminal 
Code under debate today. A great deal of debate has surrounded 
section 718.2 of the bill. No doubt each member of the House has 
received numerous letters asking that we, as members of 
Parliament, vote against this entire bill because of the section and 
particularly because of the inclusion of the words sexual 
orientation.
<P>
	Last week my counterpart from Port Moody-Coquitlam tried to 
give the justice minister over 10,000 letters from Canadians who 
oppose this inclusion. As well, over 70,000 Canadians have signed 
their names to over 600 petitions against this aspect of the bill. 
Reports have placed the number of letters to the minister opposing 
section 718.2 at over 70,000.
<P>
	The reasons for opposing this section are wide ranging. For some 
the reasons are based on their religious beliefs or ethical 
convictions. For others the opposition stems from legal concerns. 
For me the key concern is that this section once again enhances the 
notion that there are no real Canadians in this country, just 
identifiable groups that happen to share a plot of land on the 
northern part of the continent.
<P>
	I agree with the basic principle of this section, that those 
committing a violent act based on hatred or bias should be more 
severely punished. In Canada, after all, we oppose all forms of 
violence. We look south of the border and we are shocked at the 
rampant crime and brutality in many United States cities. Is it not 
ironic that the capital of the United States of America, Washington, 
D.C., also has the highest homicide rate in North America? It is a 
tragedy none of us want to see repeated north of the 49th parallel.
<P>
	More important though we are a people who from day one of our 
existence have opposed discrimination. Even before Confederation 
we willingly became the final stop along the underground railroad. 
We provided new homes and new opportunities to hundreds of 
American slaves who wanted nothing more than a taste of freedom. 
Since then we have welcomed people from every corner of the 
globe to taste and savour that same freedom enjoyed so many years 
ago. Many have come not only for our freedom but also to 
contribute to our society.
<P>
	My constituents oppose and I oppose how the government is 
setting aside these principles and using the bill to further entrench 
these legislated divisions. The bill outlines to Canadians what 
discrimination is from the federal government's point of view. 
Included in the list are a person's race, national origin or ethnic 
origin, someone's language, an individual's colour, sex or age, a  
person's mental or physical disability, someone's sexual 
orientation or finally some other similar factor.
<P>
	As I noted earlier a great deal of debate has surrounded the 
inclusion of the term sexual orientation. As the Canadian Bar 
Association, the Canadian Psychiatric Association and the Quebec 
Bar Association have noted, the lack of a definition of this term 
could open the door to the legal acceptance of such practices as 
pedophelia. These groups, I would like to add, are seeking a clear 
definition limiting the term sexual orientation to heterosexuality, 
homosexuality or bisexuality. It is a concern that has not been 
directly addressed by the government.
<P>
	I find it ironic that the government refuses to define the term 
sexual orientation yet insists on defining and limiting the term 
discrimination. Some characteristics it would appear are more 
worthy of protection than others. Those singled out for attack based 
on some characteristic outside of these grounds have no assurance 
that they will be protected by the full force of the law.
<P>
<B>(2140 ) </B>
<P>
	For example, would this section apply to the Canadian 
counterpart to the so-called unibomber, an individual well known 
throughout the United States for attacking academics with letter 
bombs? Would it apply in the case of people singled out for attack 
because of their size or lack of strength, their accent or any number 
of characteristics in this legal and legislative grey area? The fact is 
we do not know.
<P>
	I am encouraged that a number of members in this Chamber have 
seen this shortfall. Proposals have been brought forward to 
simplify this section and make additional measures apply to any 
instance where bias, prejudice or hate are involved. Sadly though, 
it appears that the justice minister is fully committed to appeasing 
the special interests and keeping his list of characteristics in place.
<P>
	To conclude, Canadians for many years have been trying to 
move beyond government defined categories in the hope of 
becoming one people. This bill defies this vision and tries to further 
entrench these categories to appease special interests.
<P>
	Canadians have clearly spoken out against these categories and 
want equal protection under the law. It is my intention therefore to 
oppose this bill when it comes up for final vote and I encourage 
other hon. members to do the same.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Sue Barnes (London West, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I want to 
comment about what has been said in this debate tonight. I want to 
compare that with a debate and question and answer session I had 
which I found extremely informative in two ways. It occurred in 
my riding and it concerned this bill. It occurred on a Sunday 
afternoon from four o'clock until around six o'clock at the London 
Salvation Army Citadel. It was about section 718.2.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13972"> 13972 </A></B>
<P>
	What was so interesting was all the misinformation that came 
into that room that day with those people who came to have a 
fellowship and information session. They were very concerned 
about the moral fibre and changing laws in Canada.
<P>
	The minister of that congregation came to see me in my 
constituency office. He was very concerned. He said: ``I think I 
cannot go to my pulpit any more and preach what I want to preach 
in my church and this disturbs me''. I asked whether his sermon 
was a criminal offence to which he replied: ``Of course not''. I told 
him not to be concerned because there is no offence created in this 
bill.
<P>
	When I asked him what else concerned him, he said: `` There is a 
slippery slope. If you do this we are going to end up over here and 
all of my beliefs I feel very strongly about will be gone''. I said: ``If 
that concerns you and if it concerns other constituents why don't I 
come to you in your forum?''
<P>
	That is what I did. We walked through this section step by step 
telling them what the bill said, outlining the abuses of positions of 
trust in this section that we are concerned about and the crimes that 
are going on in our communities across this country. It was a long 
discussion. I went through the section as it stood before the 
amendments which in my opinion have actually added to it and 
have made it even a better section. At the end of the day they were 
very satisfied that their concerns were addressed.
<P>
	I have offered that to other churches in my community. They 
have not accepted my invitation to go to them and explain this 
section. That concerns me. I think a lot of people think this section 
does something that it does not do.
<P>
	I want to comment on one other thing. When I practised law, part 
of my job was with the psychiatric Criminal Code review board in 
Ontario. In that part time position on many occasions I had to deal 
with situations where pedophiles were involved. I want to say very 
clearly it is my honest belief that pedophilia is not covered in this 
bill at all. I have had to deal with pedophiles. I have been there.
<P>
<B>(2145 ) </B>
<P>
	This is not a bill that sanctions pedophilia. Pedophilia is a crime 
in Canada, as I explained to the Salvation Army people that day in 
the church. Pedophilia is actually a mental disorder under 
DMS-IV. It was III when I was doing that type of work. 
Heterosexuals often commit the crime of pedophilia. It is more 
prevalent with heterosexuals.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Benoit:</B> How do you know that?
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Barnes:</B> Because the psychiatric evidence tells us that. 
Because it is common psychiatric evidence.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, I will speak through you because it is difficult to 
educate some members on the other side. It is not so difficult to go 
to people when they are concerned  about the real issue of this bill 
and explain to them in a calm manner when the decibel levels are 
not so high and say: ``This is what is really happening. We have a 
Criminal Code statute. We are not addressing morality in this bill''.
<P>
	It is easy to joke. I came here as a lawyer to become a politician. 
I guess in some people's books I have two strikes against me. I do 
not know what the third one is. Maybe it is becoming a Reformer.
<P>
	I think my comments have probably used up five minutes. There 
is no question to the member of the third party.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mayfield:</B> Mr. Speaker, I have mentioned the Canadian Bar 
Association, the Canadian Psychiatric Association, the Quebec Bar 
Association. They speak of their concern for opening the door to 
legal acceptance of such practices as pedophilia.
<P>
	While it may not be explicitly included in the legislation it 
certainly gives an indication, a hint, a clue, a direction to the courts 
that are already pushing well beyond the legislators. This has been 
indicated in Ontario where the legislators voted it down and the 
courts brought it back in. It has opened the door to question in 
Alberta.
<P>
	I believe we are setting precedents here that really take away the 
significance of Parliament being the high court of the land.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney General 
of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am listening with distress as I see 
this debate drift farther and farther away from what is really 
relevant. The members opposite are talking about creating 
divisions, conferring special rights, saying that government is 
singling people out for special status.
<P>
	It is not the government or the minister that is singling people 
out for special status. As I said this afternoon in the House, it is the 
hoods, it is the thugs, it is the criminals that are out there on the 
streets singling out gays and lesbians for special status. They are 
providing them with special status by hunting them down and 
beating them up. This legislation is an attempt to get the Parliament 
of Canada to do something about it.
<P>
	My hon. friends opposite tend to forget this is a bill which has to 
do with sentencing in the criminal law. The hon. member for Wild 
Rose would tell us that we are condoning immorality, we are 
breaking up the family unit. He does not approve of homosexuality. 
We are not inviting him to approve of homosexuality.
<P>
	Religion is on the list too. We are not inviting him to approve all 
the religions held by Canadians from coast to coast. This has 
nothing to do with social engineering, it is about the criminal law. 
This is about punishing criminals which is what I thought the 
Reform liked to do.
<P>

<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> I am reminded by the table the time has 
expired but I will give the member a chance to very briefly reply.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mayfield:</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like to reply because the 
hon. minister raises a valid point that what we are debating here is 
the legislation. As was said before, a thug is a thug and should be 
treated the same in every instance.
<P>
	I want to remind the minister of what the Canadian Police 
Association has said. It is an organization he lauded in the Bill 
C-68 debate:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Bill C-41 is confused, contradictory and in large part wholly unnecessary. It is 
a blatant example of what a former Liberal member of the justice committee 
described as smoke and mirrors legislation. It is put forward as meaningful 
sentencing reform but it is only that in the sense that it will generate endless 
litigation with huge attendant costs for little or no purpose.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>(2150 ) </B>
<P>
	That is the statement of the Canadian Police Association about 
the legislation without regard to the categories that have been 
defined in this legislation.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Boudria:</B> Mr. Speaker, a point of order. There have been 
consultations among members of the House to the effect that a 
word in the French text of the bill could be improved.
<P>
	This word has to do with the restitution provisions of the bill 
under clause 738. Therefore given that consultation, I would like to 
move:
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That Clause 138 of Bill C-41 be amended, in the French version, by replacing 
lines 40 and 41, on page 33, with the following:</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>``garde d'enfants, qu'une telle personne a réellement engagé pour demeurer 
ailleurs-''</BLOCKQUOTE>
	I ask the unanimous consent of the House to make this change in 
the French text, and I want to thank my colleagues from the Bloc, 
who mentioned the need to improve the text, for proposing this 
amendment. I welcome this opportunity to present it to the House.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The House has heard the request of the 
government whip. Is there unanimous consent?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
	(Motion agreed to.)
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Finlay (Oxford, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am happy to 
address the House on Bill C-41. I would like to extend my thanks 
to the Minister of Justice for bringing it to the House.
<P>
	I should also congratulate all members of the justice committee 
who reviewed the bill with a great deal of public attention focused 
on them. I would also like to extend congratulations to my 
colleague from Brant who has made a significant contribution to 
the bill through an amendment providing restitution to the victims 
of domestic violence. This amendment will make a good bill a 
better bill.
<P>
	My office has received many letters about this bill both for and 
against. Unfortunately the majority of letters are centred around 
two words found within one clause. Very few correspondents talk 
of the need for sentencing reform or the need to include a statement 
of the purpose and principles of sentencing.
<P>
	We have heard very few voices acknowledging the broad 
acceptance the bill has received from the legal community. It is 
very easy to get caught up in the emotion of an argument. We have 
seen that several times tonight. To argue fact and common sense 
takes more skill than courage. I support this bill for many reasons 
but the best of all is that our justice system and Canada as a whole 
will be better for it.
<P>
	Bill C-41 is very similar to Bill C-90 which was introduced 
during the last Parliament. Bill C-90 died on the Order Paper when 
then Prime Minister Campbell called the last federal election.
<P>
	In fact, the entire issue of sentencing reform has been the topic 
of study for both Liberal and Conservative governments for many 
years. The bill before us can trace its beginnings to a white paper 
on sentencing that was published in 1984.
<P>
	Perhaps what we should do is extend our apologies to our 
colleagues of the past, our proponents of sentencing reform for 
allowing it to wait this long.
<P>
	The Liberal version of sentencing reform contains an important 
difference from the previous version. This difference which I will 
discuss in detail later was in the Liberal Party red book during the 
last federal election and Liberal candidates across the country, 
myself included, were prepared to defend this policy throughout 
the election.
<P>
	I wonder why opposition members who are so vehemently 
opposed to this now did not lobby their party to make an issue of it 
during the election campaign.
<P>
	There are three specific areas of this bill that I would like to 
address. The first area deals with adding a statement of purpose and 
principles within the sentencing portion of the Criminal Code. Our 
role in regard to sentencing has been largely based on setting 
maximum penalties for offences rather than in dealing with the 
policy objectives of the sentencing process.
<P>
	It would seem that we have been putting the cart before the 
horse. When we create the sentencing procedure, it is right and just 
for us to put forward principles that represent Parliament's 
rationale behind sentencing. The statement of purpose and 
principles put forward in this bill describes the objectives of 
sentencing as: helping in the rehabilitation of offenders as 
law-abiding persons; separating offenders from society where 
necessary; providing restitution to individual victims or the 
community; promoting a sense of responsibility by offenders, 
including encouraging acknowledgement by offenders of the harm 
done to victims or to the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13974"> 13974 </A></B>
<P>
community; denouncing unlawful  conduct; and deterring the 
offender and other people from committing offences.
<P>
<B>(2155) </B>
<P>
	In the future when the government or a private member for that 
matter proposes a bill that involves a criminal sentence we will be 
able to compare it to the guiding principles that have been set out in 
Bill C-41. As well, criminal courts across Canada will have the 
same principles to follow rather than a patchwork of sentencing 
practices and principles that differ from province to province as is 
prevalent now.
<P>
	The second section of the bill I want to discuss deals with 
changes to early parole or section 745 hearings. Currently the 
Criminal Code allows victim impact statements to be read only at 
sentencing hearings. The bill would allow the victim's impact 
statement to be read at section 745 hearings, ensuring that a victim 
has the opportunity to outline the harm done by the offender.
<P>
	I should preface my remarks by saying that I was proud to 
support Bill C-226 proposed by the member for York 
South-Weston when it came to the House at second reading. It 
will be interesting to see the recommendations made by the justice 
committee when the bill comes back to the House in the near 
future.
<P>
	I would prefer to see section 745 repealed. If this cannot be 
accomplished, the amendments within the bill are the next best 
alternative. Victims should have a say in how the crime has 
affected and changed their lives. Early parole, if it remains within 
our criminal justice system, should be a rarity given only to 
prisoners who show little likelihood of offending again and who 
have served adequate retribution for their crimes.
<P>
	I do not want to see a Clifford Olsen walking the streets because 
of a 745 hearing. I think he would be even more unlikely to be 
released if the families of those killed were able to give evidence at 
the hearing. We often speak eloquently about the need to recognize 
victim's rights. This bill addresses that concern. All members 
should applaud the government for taking this necessary step.
<P>
	The third issue I want to address relates to sentencing in crimes 
motivated by hate. I worry when hatred causes people to commit a 
crime. Far too often people commit crimes motivated by prejudice 
and hate. In our country we have seen hatemongers spreading their 
untruths at our schools, on our streets and in our workplaces. Less 
than two years ago, white supremacists marched on Parliament Hill 
to tell the world about the hate they felt for those who were 
different from them based on race, religion, physical handicap or 
sexual orientation.
<P>
	After passage of this bill, a sentencing judge can use the 
aggravating circumstance of hate to decide what sentence should 
be handed down. This will only apply after a conviction has already 
been delivered. It will allow the sentencing judge to provide for a 
punishment that will make it very clear to groups that propagate 
hatred and to people who follow a philosophy of hate that their  
actions will not be tolerated in Canadian society. I applaud the 
government for including this section. If we can keep those who 
commit crimes motivated by hate in prison longer then we are all 
better for it.
<P>
	Unfortunately discrimination has been a constant throughout 
Canadian history. We only need to reflect on the inhuman way our 
native people have been treated or the citizens of Japanese ancestry 
or origin during the second world war. Only 80 years ago, women 
in Canada did not have the democratic right to vote because they 
were not considered persons.
<P>
	I took the time to look at the suffrage debate that took place in 
1918. Members argued that it was against natural law for women to 
have the right to vote. In this very institution members of 
Parliament declared that women did not want the vote. Now we 
know that view was wrong. We all realize the important role 
women play in our society and the invaluable role they play within 
this House. For someone to say it was against natural law to allow 
them to vote seems ludicrous to us today.
<P>
<B>(2200 ) </B>
<P>
	There are people who believe it is against natural law to give a 
segment of our society protection in this bill. It is quite possible 
that there are members within the House who feel this group should 
be denied protection. Respectfully, I have to disagree. When it can 
be proven that a group in our society is facing discrimination the 
law should move to protect that group. Can any of us say there are 
no incidents of gay bashing in Canada?
<P>
	I have heard the argument that one cannot identify someone's 
sexual orientation just by looking at them. I agree. Are we then to 
ask people to deny who they are? We could also say you cannot 
identify a person's religion just by looking at them. We have 
consistently seen religious groups persecuted throughout history. It 
would be humiliating and wrong to advise citizens to deny their 
differences in order to escape persecution. Instead the government 
should move to assure that all such groups-

<P>
	<B>Mr. Garry Breitkreuz (Yorkton-Melville, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, justice delayed is justice denied. This legislation will 
result in longer, more complex and more costly trials.
<P>
	Friends of mine in the RCMP are frustrated because they work 
very hard yet the courts do not mete out justice, often for some 
procedural technicality. Why not bring forth legislation that would 
close some of those loopholes rather than open up more of them, as 
this legislation does?
<P>
	The same Liberals that brought us the Young Offenders Act are 
now bringing us justice in another form. I wonder if we will have 
rallies about Bill C-41 in a few years.
<P>
	Does dividing people into groups enhance prejudice or decrease 
it? If I do not belong to an identifiable group, what if somebody 
hates my guts for some reason other than the physical, mental or 
behavioural characteristic that makes me part of a group? Why 
does hate have to fall into a certain category as defined by a Liberal 
in order for it to be more serious than some other kind of hate?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Finlay:</B> Mr. Speaker, I think people divide themselves into 
groups in a very natural way. They have been doing it for several 
thousand years. I do not think we will stop it.
<P>
	The society I want to live in and the society I want my 
grandchildren to live in is one based on love and understanding and 
acceptance of people for who and what they are. I want people who 
extend their hate to crime to be punished severely.
<P>
	I think all members of the House need to vote in favour of the 
bill. It is long overdue.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ray Speaker (Lethbridge, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, in the 
House it has been said Liberals want this law so there is an 
obligation on the courts or the judges to sentence in a certain way. 
We on this side of the House have said judges now have flexibility 
to apply and sentence. This tells me there is a lack of trust and 
confidence in judges. Why?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Finlay:</B> Mr. Speaker, in light of everything I have heard in 
the House today, the member's question is obviously backward. We 
do trust the judges but we have heard nothing but how they do not 
do this or that, or they let people out too soon or do not give 
sufficient sentences for this, that and the other thing.
<P>
<B>(2205 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Ms. Paddy Torsney (Burlington, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is my 
pleasure to speak on Bill C-41. This bill is important. It takes the 
necessary leadership role to set standards of fairness and equality 
for all Canadians in our criminal justice system.
<P>
	Perhaps because of the campaign or the crusade by the member 
for Central Nova we have missed some of the other principles of 
the bill. We have forgotten that it codifies the principles of 
sentencing, that it formalizes  victim impact statements and that it 
brings about changes which help to restore the balance in domestic 
disputes.
<P>
	Last summer I met with lawyers from my community and over 
the past year I have met with many people in Burlington about the 
bill. Their conclusion is that with the increased attention to the law 
by lay people we need to spell out clearly the goals in sentencing. 
The bill clearly codifies those principles.
<P>
	Sentencing should denounce unlawful conduct. It should deter 
offenders from committing crimes. It should work for 
rehabilitation. It should promote a sense of responsibility in 
offenders and it should make reparation to individual victims and 
families and acknowledge the harm done.
<P>
	This bill will work to make sure fewer Canadians will be 
imprisoned for non-payment of fines, fines which in many cases 
were assessed at a level prohibited to the individual.
<P>
	Section 718 formalizes the victim impact statement process. 
Victims groups such as CAVEAT have long supported this section.
<P>
	An exciting initiative out of the backbench of the government 
and from a member of the Liberal women's caucus is the change to 
section 738, the restitution section. I am pleased the amendment 
moved by the member of Parliament for Brant, which was accepted 
by the government, will allow for much broader consideration of 
the impact of domestic disputes when making restitution orders. In 
tabling her amendment my colleague stated that victims of 
domestic violence should not have to deal with economic hardship 
in addition to the obvious physical and emotional trauma that is the 
result of a violent situation.
<P>
	The amended section 738 of Bill C-41 will empower judges to 
order compensation to battered spouses forced to move out of their 
homes. This would cover costs such as temporary housing, food, 
child care and transportation as a result of the crime.
<P>
	On section 718.2, the hatred section, the debate on this has 
exposed some of the depths of hatred in Canada and I find that 
unfortunate. I think the support the bill has received from many 
church organizations and from many individual Canadians says 
something about the real value of Canadians. Although we like to 
believe we are a tolerant and moderate society, it is harrowing to 
find out that in Canada we have active groups whose philosophies 
are based on hatred of others.
<P>
	Names of groups which are recognizable to all of us, Aryan 
Nation, the Heritage Front, Church of the Creator and the Aryan 
Resistance Movement are actively recruiting today in Canada and 
they are particularly targeting young Canadians. There are over 40 
organized hate groups in Canada. They are using techniques they 
perfected in the United States and they are accessing Internet in the 
most evil way.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="13976"> 13976 </A></B>
<P>
	In 1993 youths were charged in Montreal for beating up a man. 
They admitted they were engaging in an activity called the game, 
seeking out homosexuals with the intent of beating them up.
<P>
	Police across the country are setting up crime units to deal 
specifically with hate crimes, responding to a concrete reality and 
need to end this violence. They adopt these units not because they 
approve of the gay lifestyle or they want to promote homosexuality 
but because in the exercise of their police functions they recognize 
there is violence and it is their job to protect and provide security 
for all in our community, particularly those who are members of 
groups most vulnerable to hatred.
<P>
	From B'nai Brith we learned that in 1993, 256 reported incidents 
of anti-Semitic harassment and vandalism occurred. That 
represents a 31 per cent increase since 1992, the most incidents 
ever reported by the league in the 12 years since it has kept 
statistics.
<P>
	In Ottawa-Carleton in the last two years there were 387 cases of 
hate based crime. There were 105 charges laid; 215 of the cases 
were based on race, 110 on religion and 45 on sexual orientation. 
We must use education, community action, intercultural coalitions. 
We must use all of these techniques, where hate crimes need to be 
addressed and where we can make a difference as well is in our 
legislation.
<P>
<B>(2210) </B>
<P>
	This bill has two goals: first, to send a strong message to 
persecuted communities that violence against any person or group 
is unacceptable and that our laws will take action in that regard; 
second, it encourages victims to come forward, allowing the police 
to get a true handle on the extent of the problem, work on educating 
people and work against this hatred.
<P>
	Committee members who were listening learned from B'nai 
Brith that at its base a hate crime is not like a robbery for the 
purpose of obtaining goods. Hate crimes target not only the 
physical victim but the entire group of persons who share the same 
skin colour, the same language or the same religion. These acts are 
intended to violate, intimidate or isolate. They are intended not 
against just the victims but against the entire group.
<P>
	When a rock comes crashing through someone's house in the 
middle of the night with a bomb threat simply because that person 
is a Muslim, other Muslims in the neighbourhood are terrorized. 
That is the goal of the hate monger, to terrorize whole 
communities. When survivors of the Holocaust see a swastika 
painted on a synagogue, and they thought they were safe in their 
Canadian community, suddenly those community members are 
fearful.
<P>
	Reform members need to remember that when hate groups target 
what they perceive to be minorities their intention is to divide those 
minorities and separate them from the rest of the community. They 
isolate them in order to make them easier targets for attack. Once 
they  have targeted one group they never stop with that group. They 
keep adding to them, to their targets. They never stop with Jews. 
They never stop with gays. They enlarge their sphere of activity.
<P>
	To allow hate motivated violence and hate propaganda to go 
unpunished or uncontrolled through personal or collective 
indifference on the part of community leaders or public officials is 
simply to allow hate discrimination and violence to become 
acceptable norms of behaviour and standards of contact. On page 
86 of the red book the Liberals campaigned on equality for all 
Canadians, including freedom from hatred and harassment.
<P>
	The list of characteristics in section 718.2 identifies those 
groups, those people most frequently targeted for hatred as per the 
information from the justice department. It does not confer special 
rights to any one group because every person in Canada is covered 
in this list.
<P>
	We all have a sex, we all have a race, we all have a nationality, 
we all have a religion and yes, we all have a sexual orientation. To 
say including sexual orientation in Bill C-41, particularly in this 
section, is encouraging a lifestyle is like saying that because we 
have included religion we are encouraging people to become 
Catholic or that including gender is to encourage members in the 
House to become women instead of men.
<P>
	Remember, Bill C-41 takes effect when a crime has been 
committed. The proposed section comes into full force only after a 
criminal conviction has been registered. The bill does not create 
new crimes. It only requires judges to consider it as an aggravating 
factor if the crime was motivated by hatred.
<P>
	I quote from Martin Niemöller, the German theologian: ``When 
Hitler attacked the Jews I was not a Jew and therefore I was not 
concerned. When Hitler attacked the Catholics, I was not a 
Catholic and therefore I was not concerned. When Hitler attacked 
the unions and the industrialists, I was not a member of the unions 
and I was not concerned. Then Hitler attacked me and the 
Protestant church, and there was nobody left to be concerned''.
<P>
	For the sake of all Canadians, for the sake of all children in 
Canada, based on the values of fairness, equity and justice taught to 
me and my family and in my church I encourage colleagues to 
enact Bill C-41 as soon as possible.

<P>
	<B>Mr. Herb Grubel (Capilano-Howe Sound, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I find this a very disturbing discussion. It is implied by the 
hon. members who were speaking-I heard the last three 
speakers-that somehow by opposing this bill one is in favour of 
crime, hate crimes, crimes of passion, whatever. We are not. 
Reform is not.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13977"> 13977 </A></B>
<P>
	The problem we face is that so much of what is being asked of us 
involves a curtailment of one of the most fundamental rights in a 
democracy. Some countries have established in their constitutions 
limits on government to pass legislation that restricts the freedom 
of speech. It is about the freedom of speech for people to say 
whatever they want to say. It is not possible to suppress this without 
going down a very slippery slope in the destruction of democracy.
<P>
	The problem is that when anyone takes words and transfers them 
into violent action, that is when we should come down on them 
with a ton of bricks, not when they are saying what they believe. 
Where does one draw the line?
<P>
	There have been Parliaments, there have been legislatures 
around the world, people with even greater indignity and 
self-righteousness than the speakers we have heard tonight, who 
say they have the solution to all the problems of mankind: all we 
have to do is shut down the ability of that person to speak.
<P>
	The founding fathers of the United States have said that this is 
one of the greatest dangers to democracy. Nobody is in favour of 
those crimes. But what we are talking about and what I have heard 
being said here is that we must go to thought control, to speech 
control, and that means the end of our freedom. That is why I will 
vote against this bill.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Torsney:</B> Mr. Speaker, it is troubling when we have sat in 
the House and debated a bill for many hours to find out that my 
colleagues do not even know what bill we are debating.
<P>
	Bill C-41 is a sentencing bill. The actions that are in here only 
come into effect when someone has committed a crime. First you 
have to assault somebody, and then the judge has to consider a 
sentence. This is what this bill uses.
<P>
	This bill specifically targets anti-hate. It is one of many tools we 
as leaders in our community can use. I call on the member not to be 
indifferent on hate crimes, to use every tool in his power and to 
vote for this bill. It is important to all Canadians, who do want 
freedom of speech. It is not about freedom of speech. It is about 
when people take action based on their hatred. When they assault 
somebody, then we look at this.
<P>
	I am sickened to hear that we have had this much debate and he 
has just figured out that it is a sentencing bill. Perhaps all of us 
need to go back to the books and do some reading.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary North, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
would like to applaud my hon. colleague who just spoke on her 
commitment to fairness, equity, and justice.
<P>
	In a recent issue of the student newspaper in Ottawa's Carleton 
University there was a cartoon depicting a smiling female carrying 
a large hunting knife and asking women whether their lives would 
be helped by the total  elimination of penises. Another cartoon 
showed her holding a dripping axe over the heading ``No guilt''.
<P>
	I would like to ask my colleague why she can support a bill that 
would consider hatred against some groups more serious than 
hatred against others. The group that was the object of these 
cartoons is not listed in Bill C-41.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Torsney:</B> Mr. Speaker, perhaps this is the most important 
reason why there are not definitions on gender, on sexual 
orientation, on race and on religion, because men have a gender. 
They are male.
<P>
<B>(2220 ) </B>
<P>
	If one of those women attacked a man on the basis that he was a 
man, they could use this bill in considering that an aggravating 
factor.
<P>
	If a group of homosexuals attacked somebody on the basis they 
were heterosexual, that person could use this section of the bill to 
get a tougher sentence against those people.
<P>
	If you are attacked on the basis you are a Jehovah's 
Witness-and unfortunately that has happened in Canada on many 
occasions-if it is perceived you are a Jehovah's Witness because 
you happen to be wearing a suit and carrying a briefcase, as many 
of us were during the campaign, the person could use that and the 
prosecutor could seek a tougher sentence and ask the judge for a 
tougher sentence because all people with those characteristics are 
at risk when people commit hate crimes in Canada.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Margaret Bridgman (Surrey North, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
am pleased to participate in this debate as well.
<P>
	Most of the debate has focused on the sexual orientation aspect 
of section 718.2. I too have received a strong response from my 
riding and from various Canadians across the country on this. Their 
main concern seems to be that the term is not defined and that the 
consequences of it being in the bill remain unknown.
<P>
	Arguments against including the phrase have been presented at 
great length. I would like to focus more on the effect of having 
greater sentences for some crimes versus others. In this bill it is 
based on hate, which is an emotional or human response.
<P>
	Another concern I have is the categorizing of conditions. I do not 
really think I have to be anything as far as religion or whatever is 
concerned. If someone assaults me I should have the right under 
law to extract a sentence on that.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13978"> 13978 </A></B>
<P>
	I would also like to look at the reason we are having such 
difficulty with crime in this country. We all agree that we have a 
crime problem and that we have various groups that are making life 
very difficult for us. I would like to try to figure out what has 
happened. What happened to our justice system that has turned 
things around?
<P>
	This brings me to a philosophical concept. Over the past 30-odd 
years we have seen a gradual erosion of the concept of law. In 
moral philosophy there are two opposing ways of looking at a 
situation. One school of thought is represented by the German 
philosopher Immanuel Kant in his <I>Grounding for the Metaphysics 
of Morals</I>. Kant argued that actions should be based on the intent of 
a person doing the action and not the consequences of the action. 
Kant himself said: ``An action done from duty has as its moral 
worth of that action not in the purpose that is to be attained by it but 
in the maxim according to which the action is determined''. Again 
that is an implication of intent. He is basically saying that it does 
not really matter what the result is of what you do; what matters is 
why you wanted to do it in the first place.
<P>
	The opposing view is presented by the British philosopher John 
Stuart Mill in his work <I>Utilitarianism</I>, where he argued that actions 
of individuals should be based on the consequences of the action. 
He was more concerned with the consequences of an individual's 
action than he was with the intent behind the action.
<P>
<B>(2225 ) </B>
<P>
	An easy way to get a better understanding of that concept would 
be the example of one person striking another one. Kant would 
want to know why that person struck another, what motivated him 
to take that action, whereas Mill would come up with the fact that 
the person was indeed struck and that in itself is the offence.
<P>
	One might ask what all this has to do with the bill today. I firmly 
believe that the intent of the Canadian justice system has changed 
from addressing the action involved and the result of the action to 
now trying to address intent and be psychologists and psychiatrists 
in the court system.
<P>
	We also have come into other problems that could very well 
relate to this switch in the philosophical approach to how we view 
our justice system. We talk about criminals getting more rights 
than victims, for example. Well that follows my argument that if 
we are looking at why somebody does something we are not 
looking at the person who is dead, the victim.
<P>
	There are a number of things that have happened in our system 
that bring me to think there has been a definite switch in 
philosophical views or actions in our society and we have switched 
from the Mill concept to the Kant concept and are stressing more 
and more the intent aspect.
<P>
	This first started to erode when we looked at the state of mind 
component from the point of view of mental  illness and people 
who were involved in some sort of crime who were mentally ill. We 
tended to forgive their crime to a certain degree because they knew 
not what they did. From there it gradually evolved to where we 
even got into debates involving drug abuse, for example: I take 
drugs or I drink and because I am in that state from the inducement 
of drugs I am not responsible for what I do.
<P>
	I see this intent business getting totally out of hand. The point is 
that it does not really matter what your emotional state of mind is, 
when you kill somebody they are dead and that is the end of it.
<P>
	We have to try to create situations where people who need help 
and who can be harmful to others or themselves can be treated 
before they end up in our courts so we do not have those kinds of 
situations.

[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Gouk (Kootenay West-Revelstoke, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I will say a few words with regard to the amendments I 
have submitted and then I will defer to my colleagues for debate.
<P>
	The first two motions deal with the restrictions the government 
has placed on the sale of CN shares dealing with the requirement 
for the head office to remain in a particular location. I would like to 
point out to my colleagues from the Bloc that this is not a Quebec 
issue. I do not care if it is Montreal, Toronto, Winnipeg, Vancouver 
or some obscure place no one has ever heard of, a company should 
not be tied down to any location. It should be free to choose.
<P>
	With regard to the 15 per cent shares, I feel that places 
restrictions. We heard in committee that it did not solve any 
problems but it could create some in the long term. Consequently, 
we have to view this as an unwarranted restriction.
<P>
	The third motion deals with if the government does not see fit to 
remove these then perhaps it would at least see fit to put a time 
limit on how long it requires the company to comply with this. It is 
an attempt to put in a five year sunset clause.
<P>
	The only comment I would make with regard to Motion No. 4 by 
the Bloc is that I understand why the Bloc is doing it but it is a bit 
overrestrictive in terms of creating more obstructions in the way of 
the sale. We believe this can be dealt with in other more appropriate 
ways. Beyond this, I defer to my colleagues for debate on this 
grouping.
<P>
<B>(2300) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Duncan (North Island-Powell River, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I rise to speak to Motions Nos. 1 to 4 in Group No. 1 on 
Bill C-89.
<P>
	Motion No. 1 calls for the deletion of the head office clause 
which stipulates that CN's headquarters must reside permanently in 
Montreal and calls for the deletion of the 15 per cent ownership 
restriction.
<P>
	In today's marketplace the stipulation of the permanent location 
of a head office is absurd and makes a mockery of a bill of serious 
intent. This whole question of permanence reminds me of a story of 
a fellow who applied for a job with a previous employer. When he 
was offered the job he asked whether it would be temporary or 
permanent. The response was in that company there were no 
permanent jobs. This stipulation would not occur in a free market 
and no private sector companies face these same restrictions. This 
is purely for political reasons and should be expunged from the bill.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13981"> 13981 </A></B>
<P>
	As well, restricting the percentage of shares any one individual, 
corporation or association may own is not sound. Where is the 
incentive for new investors to bring in a new management style to 
revitalize this dinosaur? To which latest investor advice fad is the 
government listening?
<P>
	This clause also restricts the best price CN could fetch in the 
marketplace. As one investor put it, the 15 per cent restriction 
circumscribes the deal. This restriction dampens investor 
confidence and freezes out the type of investor who looks for 
troubled, debt ridden companies that can be restructured and made 
profitable, generating dividends and capital gains. I support Motion 
No. 1.
<P>
	Under Motions Nos. 2 and 3 of Group No. 1, I support the 
introduction of a sunset clause of a five year time limit on the 
headquarters and ownership restrictions should Motion No. 1 not 
carry.
<P>
	Motion No. 4 calls for parliamentary approval on each offer 
made by the private sector for CN assets. This is redundant. If Bill 
C-89 passes Parliament has already given its approval for the sale 
of CN. I will not support Motion No. 4.
<P>
	If the government cannot attract a good offer it will have to 
answer for that later.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Guimond (Beauport-Montmorency-Orléans, 
BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to rise, despite the late hour, on our 
fourth amendment, which reads as follows:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That Bill C-89, in Clause 9, be amended;</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(b) by replacing line 31, on page 6, with the following: ``section 8(1); or (c) sell 
any subsidiary or part of the operations of CN unless CN and the purchaser have 
given the Minister written undertakings, in terms satisfactory to the Minister, 
that all reasonable steps have been taken to ensure that it will continue for a 
reasonable period as a viable operation and that the interests of the employees 
affected by the sale will, so far as is practicable, be maintained after the sale.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>9.1 The Minister shall, in respect of every sale mentioned in paragraph 9(c), 
cause to be laid before both Houses of Parliament the undertakings given 
pursuant to that paragraph.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>(2305) </B>
<P>
	You will have noted with the reading of the amendment that our 
party's principal aim was, despite the Liberal government's 
decision to privatize CN, to maintain and keep jobs, because 
behind privatization or the end of business, although economic 
aspects are certainly sometimes given consideration, the human 
element, the experiences of the people affected by changes in their 
working conditions or even the cutting of their position, must be 
considered.
<P>
	You will note that the aim of this amendment is to give this 
House a certain right over the selling of CN assets, not directly 
related to rail transportation.
<P>
	Our decision, in the Bloc Quebecois, to table this amendment 
was based on the statement made several times by the Minister of 
Transport that he intended to  sell off individually the assets of CN 
not directly related to rail transportation. Being familiar with CN 
operations, we know that one of the largest CN subsidiaries to be 
sold is AMF Techno Transport, located in Pointe-St-Charles, in 
Montreal. We are talking here about 1,300 jobs, 1,300 workers 
who, unfortunately, saw their company lose some $35 million last 
year.
<P>
	When the minister appeared before the Standing Committee on 
Transport, he told us that, in his opinion, AMF had a very 
precarious future and he refused, despite our questions, to 
guarantee its survival. As you can understand, the loss of this 
company would have disastrous consequences for the greater 
Montreal area.
<P>
	One European company, however, showed interest. Alsthom is a 
French company that can brag about its major contribution to the 
high speed train in France, in partnership with none other than the 
pride of the Quebec business community, Bombardier.
<P>
	Alsthom has no North American subsidiary that makes railway 
equipment. AMF Techno Transport, which is located in 
Pointe-St-Charles, could thus easily become its bridgehead in 
North America, which would have a very positive impact on AMF 
and the greater Montreal area.
<P>
	Before closing, I wish to add that perhaps if we gave Alsthom the 
possibility or the incentive to take over AMF-this is the purpose 
of our amendment- I am confident that Quebec would be in a very 
good position when the decision is finally made to build a high 
speed railway corridor between Quebec City and Windsor.
<P>
	Let us not forget that Alsthom Bombardier holds an exclusive 
licence for building a high speed train or HST in North America.
<P>
<B>(2310) </B>
<P>
	Let us not forget that about seven or eight HST projects are 
planned for the next 12 years, which would put the new Alsthom 
AMF consortium in an excellent position to bid on contracts to 
make railway equipment for future HST projects in the U.S. Or that 
economic benefits in the order of $200 billion are being mentioned. 
Again, a Quebec manufacturer could very well succeed on the 
international market.
<P>
	In closing, I will say to you that the purpose of the amendment is 
to ensure that, whoever the buyer is, precautions will be taken to 
keep AMF viable and to protect the jobs of the Montreal men and 
women who work there as well as those of the people in the greater 
Montreal area.

<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Silye (Calgary Centre, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the issue 
we are discussing today is the privatization of Canadian National 
rail.
<P>
	Although Reform supports the government in this endeavour 
there are still some problems with this legislation that must be 
addressed. The bill requires the headquarters of CN to be located in 
Montreal permanently. It includes the restriction that limits the 
percentage of shares any one individual can own to 15 per cent.
<P>
	CN Rail currently owes about $2.5 billion. Industry 
representatives say the debt must be reduced to $1.5 billion to 
achieve a BBB bond rating and sell. The minister has the power to 
reduce CN's debt to any amount he chooses, which could mean an 
amount well below the amount for which taxpayers would see a 
return.
<P>
	Let us take a look at crown corporations. In the auditor general's 
report of 1982 this is what was written: ``Crown corporations are 
like an enormous iceberg floating lazily in the foggy Atlantic, 
silent, majestic, awesome. The public tends to see only the upper 
portions consisting of giants like Petro-Canada, the CBC, the 
Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation. The great bulk of the 
iceberg below the surface is less spectacular, less likely to attract 
public interest, less likely to receive the attention of Parliament, yet 
costly to taxpayers''.
<P>
	That was 12 years ago and nothing has changed. In his 1994 
annual report to Parliament the president of the Treasury Board 
gave us a view of this iceberg below the water line when he listed 
the Government of Canada's holdings: 48 parent crown 
corporations, 64 wholly owned subsidiaries, 5 mixed enterprises, 3 
joint enterprises, 51 other entities, 8 corporations under the terms 
of the Bankruptcy Act.
<P>
	Reform Party policy on privatization and corporations indicates 
we support placing the ownership and control of corporations in the 
sector that can perform their function most cost effectively with the 
greatest accountability to owners and the least likelihood of 
incurring public debt. We believe this would be in most cases the 
private sector but not necessarily in all cases.
<P>
	The Liberal position which I had to try hard to read in the red 
book says that for the past decade the small and medium size 
business sector has been the engine of the Canadian economy. It 
says the Liberal government will focus on its growth. While 
debating Bill C-89 on May 2 the Minister of Transport stated: 
``This legislation is part of our government's intention to have the 
private sector operate in areas where it can do the job best''.
<P>
	The Minister of Finance said in the budget last February: ``Our 
view is straightforward. If government does not need to run 
something it should not and in the future will not''.
<P>
	Let us get to an analysis of what the government's role should be 
when it comes to privatization and/or crown corporations, some 
general points. The role of government should be to do what only 
the government can do, which is to keep peace, order and good 
government. It should regulate, administer, pass laws and defend 
borders but it should not enter the marketplace to create jobs. With 
regional development funds, grants, subsidies and crown 
corporations, governments distort the private sector, create 
temporary jobs and promote unfair competition within industry 
sectors. Governments are, in fact, part of the problem and not the 
solution.
<P>
<B>(2315) </B>
<P>
	There is a big difference between the spending of debt capital 
that is borrowed money and equity capital that does not have to be 
repaid. The private sector understands the difference and it is time 
politicians did too. At risk money motivates; government money 
wastes.
<P>
	In some concluding comments I would like to state that the 
government's role in today's world should be to develop an 
economic atmosphere, an environment and infrastructure that 
facilitates investment, not make the investment itself directly. The 
private sector will do that. The Reform Party believes in the 
principle of Bill C-89 and the privatization of CN Rail.
<P>
	We would like to see some of the roadblocks removed from the 
legislation and we hope the government will accept our 
suggestions.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Osvaldo Nunez (Bourassa, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise to 
support motion No. 4 amending Bill C-89. That motion, tabled by 
the hon. member for Beauport-Montmorency-Orléans, seeks to 
give the House a say in the sale of CN's assets which are not 
directly related to railway transport.
<P>
	The minister said on several occasions that he intends to sell off 
one by one those assets which are not directly related to railway 
transport. One of CN's major subsidiaries, AMF Technotransport, 
located in Montreal's Pointe-Saint-Charles, will be sold in that 
fashion. Last year, that company, which employs over 1,300 
workers, suffered losses of some $35 million.
<P>
	When he appeared before the committee, the minister said that 
AMF's future was precarious, but he refused to pledge to ensure the 
company's survival. Yet, should AMF close its doors, the 
consequences would be disastrous for the Montreal region. CN 
workers fear that privatization may deprive them of their job 
security and pensions. In fact, the process has already started.
<P>
	Today, the media announced that the arbitrator just imposed a 
new collective agreement which, among other setbacks, provides 
less job security. The CAW union, which represents some 12,500 
CN workers, made representations concerning the privatization 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13983"> 13983 </A></B>
<P>
process. The workers have already had bad experiences with the  
privatization of two sections of CN: Route Canada and AMF.
<P>
	In the case of Route Canada, the new owners bought the 
company and then shut it down, thus putting over 2,000 workers on 
the street. AMF, which is now a CN subsidiary, did not recognize 
the collective agreement. It took the courts over a year to restore 
the workers' rights. Several unions represent CN workers, 
particularly, as I just mentioned, the CAW. Overall, the unions are 
in favour of maintaining CN's Crown corporation status, but they 
want to be represented on the board of directors.
<P>
	It should be pointed out that these workers are very productive. 
Following very tough negotiations and sometimes long strikes, 
they managed to get acceptable and reasonable salaries and 
working conditions. However, CN's management obtained, and 
continues to demand, concessions from the unions, including on 
the issue of job security. However, job security, which is only one 
element, was gained in exchange for other concessions.
<P>
<B>(2320) </B>
<P>
	Therefore, unions are concerned about the future since there 
have been massive layoffs over the past few years. Moreover, 
management positions have not been affected to the same degree.
<P>
	I believe it to be urgent to improve labour relations at CN, a task 
which should be mainly the responsibility of the company's 
management. Unions, and the workers they represent, are worried 
about their jobs. This amendment seeks to maintain some degree of 
job protection for workers.
<P>
	The bill contains no provision protecting the CN workers' vested 
rights or maintaining the present level of employment. This is a 
very important issue for workers. They do not want to find 
themselves without a job in the new company. As I said, the 
problem is the same for the employees of the sister companies such 
as AMF Technotransport, in Montreal. The vast majority of CN 
employees have more than 20 years seniority.
<P>
	I will monitor the new company to make sure it abides 
scrupulously by the collective agreements in effect in this Crown 
corporation. I intend to monitor closely the transfer to the new 
employer of the rights and obligations under these agreements.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> Is the House ready for the question?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Joe Fontana (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Transport, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I wish to address the first grouping. 
I must apologize, I was told by the opposition that they had more 
than one speaker on the motion. If I could, I would like to deal with 
Motions Nos. 1 through 4, specifically on clause 8.
<P>
	Motions Nos. 1 to 3 propose either the removal or sunsetting 
after five years of the 15 per cent individual ownership restriction 
and the stipulation that CN's headquarters remain in Montreal.
<P>
	The government chose to include a 15 per cent individual 
ownership restriction in the bill for a very specific purpose. Since 
the public share issue of CN will be the largest in Canadian history 
and likely could not be absorbed wholly by Canadian investors, 
access to foreign markets will be essential for the success of this 
deal. Any form of foreign ownership restriction would be viewed 
negatively by foreign investors and could result in a significantly 
reduced demand for CN shares, even jeopardizing the 
government's ability to sell 100 per cent of the crown corporation.
<P>
	However, in order to ensure that no individual, Canadian or 
otherwise, would be able to attain control of CN, the government 
decided to include a 15 per cent individual ownership restriction. 
This is a balanced approach which would allow investors to buy a 
substantial piece of the company and have some influence over its 
future direction without enabling them to take it over. Since this is 
not expected to impact on the value of the CN shares, there is no 
call for either removing or sunsetting the stipulation.
<P>
	With respect to CN's headquarters, it has always been located in 
Montreal and there is no reason to expect that to change. Indicating 
that it will remain there sends a message of stability and 
consistency with past practice to the workforce and investors. It has 
absolutely nothing to do with politics but everything to do with 
good business.

	He said: Mr. Speaker, I would like to explain why I have put 
forward this motion. It addresses the very point that the 
parliamentary secretary addressed when giving his explanation of 
the 15 per cent under the former grouping.
<P>
	This will protect and give an opportunity to Canadians to buy 
shares and address the concerns that could only be dealt with by 
putting in another restriction. I would defer to my hon. colleague 
from Lethbridge for debate on this motion.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ray Speaker (Lethbridge, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like 
to make a few remarks. First of all, I would like to express my 
support for the privatization of CN. This is the proper move at this 
time.
<P>
	To put it in economic terms, for example, the Government of 
Canada at the present time has a $550 billion debt. That is of major 
concern to Canadians. Canadian National has an accumulated debt 
of $2.5 billion which is an encumbrance on the people of Canada. It 
is time to privatize and bring an operation like this one into the 
private sector so that it works under the rules of the private sector 
in terms of its financing and its efficiencies.
<P>
<B>(2330) </B>
<P>
	The amendment we are speaking on tonight, which puts the 
shares out to Canadians in the first 90 days, is a good one. If the 
capital is in Canada for individuals or corporations in order to buy 
Canadian National and to operate it as a Canadian entity, that 
would be a good thing. It would be divided among Canadians in a 
variety of ways.
<P>
	Let us give Canadians the first opportunity. After the 90 days we 
could open it up so those international people who wish to invest 
can do so and in a very proper and positive way participate in the 
economy of Canada.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Joe Fontana (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Transport, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, Motion No. 5 proposes that the 
shares of CN be sold only to Canadian individuals and corporations 
for the first 90 days that the shares are sold on the stock market. It 
would negatively affect both the value the government would 
receive for its shares in CN and its ability to sell 100 per cent of its 
shares.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13985"> 13985 </A></B>
<P>
	Given the size of the CN initial public offering it is unlikely that 
the Canadian equity markets could absorb the issue alone. 
Therefore, in order to sell 100 per cent of CN for a value which 
maximizes the return to Canadian taxpayers, foreign investors will 
need to participate in the share offering.
<P>
	Changing this clause, as suggested by the Reform Party in 
Motion No. 5, would be viewed as foreign ownership restriction. 
Any restriction on the ability of foreigners to participate in the sale 
of CN would affect value and the shares would have to be sold at a 
significant discount in order to sell them all exclusively to 
Canadians.
<P>
	Given the likely size of the share issue, all Canadians who so 
desire will have an opportunity to purchase CN shares, resulting in 
broad Canadian ownership of CN stock. An amendment such as 
suggested in Motion No. 5 is therefore unnecessary.

<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Gouk (Kootenay West-Revelstoke, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, again I would like to say a few words in explanation of my 
amendments.
<P>
	During the course of committee investigation the minister came 
before the committee and stated that it was his intention only to pay 
off enough debt after taking off the assets and resources of the 
company to allow the company to reach a BBB credit rating.
<P>
	I have accepted this but wish to restrict the minister to ensure 
that he will do no more than what he said. Given that he has made 
this statement, it is very reasonable to ask him to make that 
commitment by way of amendment to the legislation. However, if 
he is not prepared to do this, then I would suggest that we should 
take away the power for him to arbitrarily pay off any amount of 
debt he chooses.
<P>
	With regard to Motions Nos. 8, 9 and 10 I have looked at them 
but I have not been able to find my way clear to recommend that we 
support them. However I think Motion No. 11 by the Bloc 
Quebecois is a good motion. It deals with a sensitive subject. A lot 
of people will be reassured without causing any problems, and I 
recommend we support that motion.
<P>
	Beyond this I would defer to my colleague from North 
Island-Powell River on debate.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Duncan (North Island-Powell River, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I will not speak to Motions Nos. 8, 9 and 10. I am going to 
listen to the Bloc.
<P>
	However I rise to support Motions Nos. 6, 7 and 11. Motion No. 
6 deletes the possibility of government bailout of any CN debt. 
Current CN debt stands at $2.5 billion. Financial and industry 
experts agree that it will never reasonably sell with that debt level 
and must be reduced to an amount that would achieve an 
investment grade bond rating of BBB. A $1.5 billion debt would 
achieve this bond rating. The House should not give the minister 
the power to reduce CN's debt to any amount he chooses. This is 
risky and is not prudent.
<P>
	First, it allows the minister to reduce the debtload well below the 
amount for which taxpayers can get a return upon sale. This could 
cause higher share prices which would appear to be a better deal 
but return a lower yield for taxpayers. I am quite certain this is not 
the intent of the minister, but this is no excuse for putting it into the 
legislation or allowing that kind of free board.
<P>
	Second, excessive reduction of CN's debt would put CP Rail at a 
disadvantage similar to the disadvantage when Air Canada was 
privatized. It is not a simple matter of balancing the debt of two 
companies. CN has purchased many deluxe assets without normal 
private sector concerns for debt financing. The most recent 
example is the expensive buyout package for employees to help 
reduce CN's workforce. If CN is allowed this strategic advantage 
without any economic costs, it would have a tremendous and unfair 
market advantage.
<P>
	Motion No. 7 would limit the government's ability to reduce CN 
debt to only the amount necessary to achieve BBB bond rating 
status after first reducing it by utilizing company funds available 
and from the disposal of real estate assets; in other words utilize 
cash and start selling off some of the assets. If members agree to 
this reasonable motion we will not need Motion No. 6 which 
deletes all authority for government bailout.
<P>
	I also support Motion No. 11 which would provide for the 
continued existence of the CN pension plan to be administered by 
the CN pension board under current government rules. This is 
prudent and fair.
<P>
	All too often employees with little control over the situation end 
up on the short end of the stick just because of a change in 
ownership. In many respects this is the most important and 
considered motion of all to pass through the House. If we all dig 
deeply in our collective memories we can think of living examples 
of people who have been treated unfairly by the system.

<P>
	At this time I should like to move an amendment to Motion No. 
7. The amendment is to one small section of Motion No. 7 which I 
believe was in error. We want the motion to read that it should 
apply to all CN debt, not just the debt owed to the Government of 
Canada. Therefore I move:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That Motion No. 7 be amended by deleting the words ``owed to Her Majesty in 
right of Canada''.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> An amendment to Motion No. 7 has been moved. 
Now I will recognize the hon. member for 
Blainville-Deux-Montagnes on debate.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Mercier (Blainville-Deux-Montagnes, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, my comments will deal with Motions Nos. 8, 9 and 10. 
The Bloc Quebecois agrees with the principle underlying Bill C-89 
which provides for the transfer of the CN railway system to private 
interests, and the purchase of the company's remaining assets to 
dispose of them at a later date.
<P>
	However, we vigorously oppose the outrageous powers the 
Minister of Transport wants to assume, under this bill, to carry out 
these operations. The amendments I am defending here are aimed 
instead at giving these powers to the House of Commons or the 
auditor general.
<P>
	First, under clause 12, the Minister of Transport is assuming 
nothing less than the power to pay off the CN debts, not only from 
the proceeds of the sale of shares, but also out of the Consolidated 
Revenue Fund. This operation aimed at making the product more 
attractive to buyers actually amounts to giving taxpayers' money to 
buyers, potentially foreigners.
<P>
	This is untenable. It is strange, to use parliamentary language, 
that a government could be cynical enough to suggest to the 
people's representatives giving a minister the power to carry out 
such an operation.
<P>
	My amendment is aimed at seeking the approval of the House for 
any agreement with CN by having the minister lay the proposed 
agreement before the House which will then refer it to a committee 
of its choice. It seems to me that it would be totally irresponsible 
for the government to reject this amendment and accept clause 12 
as it is.
<P>
	Secondly, the transport minister's obsession with power is not 
limited to asking the House to pay CN's debts with the taxpayers' 
money. Under clause 6, he goes ahead and gives himself the power 
to have any CN asset which he would like transferred to him or to a 
third party in exchange for a consideration in an amount he will 
determine himself.
<P>
<B>(2345) </B>
<P>
	In opposition to this outrageous requirement, we offer motions 9 
or 10, at the discretion of the House. In Motion No. 9, we propose 
that no transaction be made by the Minister which would transfer to 
him a CN asset worth one million dollars or more, or transfer to a 
third  party a CN asset worth ten million or more, before fifty 
percent of the CN shares are sold and unless the minister tables the 
plan for such an operation in the House and the House approves of 
such a plan, upon favourable recommendation from the committee 
designated by the House.
<P>
	In Motion No. 10, since I said the House could pick No. 9 or No. 
10 at its discretion, we propose instead that the House approval be 
replaced by the obligation, for the minister, to refer the project to 
the auditor general, who must report within 15 days. His opinion 
must be favourable in order for the transaction to be made. Again, 
it seems unthinkable that members would not accept one or the 
other of these guarantees.
<P>
	Finally, the amendments I propose are aimed at preventing the 
Minister of Transport from acting as if CN were his own personal 
property and disposing of it the way he wants, buying the 
company's assets or paying its debts with our money. CN is a 
public asset, an asset that belongs to the people. We cannot, as the 
people's representatives, abdicate our responsibilities by 
conferring to a minister the power to dispose of it as he pleases.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Guimond (Beauport-Montmorency-Orléans, 
BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I will speak for a few minutes on Motion No. 11 
which deals with the pension plan. If we recall the history of 
Canada, railroads were supposed to be the catalyst for economic 
development throughout Canada. However, the problem over the 
years is that we had a company which was a crown corporation, to 
be privatized shortly.
<P>
	The problem is that if CN is privatized, as it will be, it will serve 
the interests of shareholders rather than those of Canadian 
communities. Canada is currently going through a difficult period, 
while some regions are fighting to recover from the recession and 
to adjust to free trade. We are somewhat concerned that this 
privatization could add to instability at the very moment where 
Canada needs a reliable transportation network.
<P>
	If CN were to be sold for an amount less than its book value, it 
has been estimated that the loss could be one billion dollars or 
more. We should ask ourselves if the liberal government across the 
way will forgive CN's debts or not. On the one hand, a privatized 
CN will need to be profitable to guarantee its long term growth. On 
the other hand, considering current fiscal restraints and the fact that 
this government constantly repeats that Canadians must accept cuts 
in social programs, one can hardly justify the decision to increase 
at public expense the value of shares which will be held by private 
interests.
<P>
	The privatization of CN will also be costly for another reason. It 
is almost certain that some workers will lose their jobs in the 
process. Besides the cost of severance pay, we will also have to 
take into account the cost of unemployment insurance benefits and 
various retraining programs. After having made this preamble, I 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13988"> 13988 </A></B>
<P>
would like  to say that this is the reason why I moved Motion No. 
11, which reads as follows:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>13.1 (1) The pension plan for employees of CN known as the CN Pension Plan 
shall continue to exist and be funded and be administered by the CN Pension 
Board in accordance with the rules in existence immediately prior to the coming 
into force of this Act.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(2) The CN Pension Plan shall not be amended without the agreement of the CN 
Pension Board.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>(2350) </B>
<P>
	You will understand, and I think it is clear, that the aim of this 
amendment is to protect the pension plan of CN employees.
<P>
	I would like to digress a little. I have never questioned the 
Translation and interpretation services of the House, I believe that 
we have excellent professionals, but I would like the service to look 
at the French version of my amendment. It seems to me that, 
instead of saying ``régime de pension''-I have already been in 
contact with linguists from the Office de la langue française, and 
apparently, ``régime de pension'' is a literal translation of ``pension 
plan''-we should say ``régime de retraite''. Not being one of those 
who know everything, I would like our interpretation services to 
tell me if my amendment is correctly written in French, as it refers 
repeatedly to ``régime de pension''.
<P>
	I have said it before, but the purpose of this amendment is to 
protect the CN employees' pension plan. Bill C-89 does not 
include any measure ensuring that no change will be made to the 
CN pension plan, after privatization.
<P>
	Finally, as has become clear to all Canadian workers, not only in 
railway companies, but all workers in Canada and Quebec, in spite 
of the NDP's traditional policy of fighting for Canadian workers' 
rights, the Bloc Quebecois has been the only party in this House 
speaking for Canadian workers' interests. For someone like me 
who has always worked on the side of employers, I am particularly 
proud to propose this amendment.
<P>
	<B>Mr. André Caron (Jonquière, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, like my 
colleague for Beauport-Montmorency-Orléans, I want to 
support Motion No. 11.
<P>
	This motion seeks to preserve the CN employees' pension plan. 
You will have noticed that Bill C-89 says nothing about the 
pension plan. I think it is important that provisions be made in the 
act itself so that the CN employees' pension plan can be preserved.
<P>
	Why? Because of the recent and also not quite so recent history 
of Canadian National. We have noticed, over these past few years, 
that CN has had a certain propensity for shifting the costs for the 
transformation and modernization of the system to its employees. 
It has streamlined its operations under the pretext of improving 
productivity, but it has nevertheless changed the working 
conditions of its employees.
<P>
	Especially during the last strike, which was a combination of 
strike and lockout, we saw that CN  developed a strategy to 
completely change the working conditions of its employees and to 
urge the Canadian Parliament to pass a special bill under which 
these conditions would be legislated.
<P>
	Yesterday, in the report released by the mediation-arbitration 
board, we saw that the worst concerns we, in the Bloc Quebecois, 
expressed during the debate on the legislation ordering CN and CP 
employees back to work, came true and the working conditions 
were unilaterally changed in favour of the employer.
<P>
	I think it is vitally important that the Canadian Parliament 
protect the interests of the CN employees in terms of their pension 
plan. The motion put forward by my colleague from 
Beauport-Montmorency-Orléans should be agreed on, because 
it would be very reasonable to ensure that, after the sale of CN, it 
would be impossible to change the CN pension plan without the 
consent of the CN Pension Board.
<P>
<B>(2355) </B>
<P>
	You know that the rules of the CN Pension Board are such that 
the employees can have some influence and some input on the way 
the funds are administered.
<P>
	I think that if such a motion is adopted-and I noted that my 
Reform colleague said something similar-, it would be entirely 
appropriate for the Parliament of Canada to ensure that justice is 
done for the workers who have given so much of themselves to this 
company and who, at the age of retirement, are entitled to enjoy the 
benefits they worked so long for, because people who worked for 
CN made a career there and were, in a way, employed by the 
government of Canada, by a crown corporation. I think that the 
House of Commons should not use privatization as an excuse for 
shirking its responsibilities.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Osvaldo Nunez (Bourassa, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I, too, rise in 
support of Motion No. 11, which is a very important motion.
<P>
	The workers and the union are very concerned about the future of 
their pension fund to which they have been contributing for many 
years. Unfortunately, Bill C-89 does not contain any provision to 
protect the pension fund after the company is privatized. It is a 
serious omission.
<P>
	This amendment is in response to a request by the unions, who 
do not trust either the employer or the government in this regard. 
There have been bad experiences there also. The employer has not 
always contributed to the fund in the way that was provided for in 
the agreements. This fund should not be used to buy shares. The 
risk is too great in a market that is too volatile.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13989"> 13989 </A></B>
<P>
	The pension plan is the only source of income for most 
pensioners. I think workers should have more control over their 
pension fund since it belongs to them.
<P>
	No change should be made to the pension plan without the 
consent of the CN Pension Board and the consent of both the 
workers and their unions. Workers have contributed a lot to the CN 
pension plan. For example, in 1989, employees traded a 1 per cent 
salary increase for a partial indexation of their pension plan. That 
goes to show the importance of this amendment, which I fully 
support.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Antoine Dubé (Lévis, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, in view of the late 
hour, I will be brief.
<P>
	Given the fact that, in my riding, there are 500 CN workers 
affected by this, I would like to support the proponent of the 
motion, our critic for transport, the member for 
Beauport-Montmorency-Orléans. I know, for having spoken 
with these workers, that people who have worked for CN have 
worked hard for that company. We are reminded of those who work 
there now, but that is a long story; for them, this is an historic 
moment. I think the least I can do is to support this motion.
<P>

regard to the amendment proposed by the Reform Party to its

technical amendment but we are opposed to its Motion No. 7 and I 
will deal with that now.
<P>
	Motions Nos. 6, 7 and 8 each propose amendments to clause 12 
which provides the minister with the ability to deal with CN's 
capital structure. In order for CN's share issue to be attractive to 
investors and for CN to affordably finance its operations into the 
future, CN's debt needs to achieve an investment grade bond rating 
prior to the sale. In order to achieve such a rating CN's debt will 
need to be reduced. The exact magnitude of the debt reduction will 
not be known until the bond rating agencies begin to familiarize 
themselves with CN and discourse between the agencies, the 
government, and CN addresses the issue.
<P>
<B>(2400) </B>
<P>
	Any debt reduction will have three parts. First, in order to reduce 
its debt CN has already undertaken to sell several of its non-rail 
assets, such as CN Exploration. The proceeds from such 
divestitures will go to debt reduction. Second, in the spirit of 
selling CN as a core rail operation the government has proposed 
that CN transfer its non-core real estate assets to the government 
for fairconsideration prior to the share offering. This will also help 
to reduce CN's debt.
<P>
	Any further debt reduction will be carefully considered by the 
government, taking into account the need to put CN on a level 
playing field with its competitors and ensure that it will remain 
viable in the future. However, the minister needs to retain 
maximum flexibility in making these decisions in consultation 
with the Minister of Finance. Any requirements to have such 
actions reviewed and approved by the House of Commons, a 
committee of the House, or the auditor general would limit the 
minister's flexibility and could therefore impede the transaction 
from proceeding in a timely and efficient manner, consequently 
affecting the value.
<P>
	Therefore, these motions cannot be supported.
<P>
	Motions Nos. 9 and 10 and the new clause 13.1 the opposition is 
proposing would remove from the Minister of Transport the 
flexibility he requires in dealing with the transfer of assets in the 
context of CN commercialization.
<P>
	The commercial nature of the transaction dictates that any 
transfer be efficient and timely. The requirement to report to the 
House or have the auditor general review any such transaction 
before the transfer can proceed would seriously impair the 
minister's ability to direct that such transfers be undertaken in a 
timely manner. By impairing the efficiency of the transfer process 
the value of the transaction may be affected.
<P>
	Moreover, to the extent that such assets are transferred to another 
crown corporation, they would be recorded in the crown 
corporation's corporate plan, a summary of which would be tabled 
in Parliament on an annual basis. This would allow all members to 
review the value of the assets in that crown corporation on a regular 
basis. In addition, the auditor general would have the opportunity 
to review such transfers in the normal course of events.
<P>
	In addition, the commercial nature of these assets in some cases 
calls for confidentiality, which could be jeopardized should the 
minister be required to report any such transaction to the House.
<P>
	Therefore, because of the need of timeliness, efficiency, and 
confidentiality, these amendments cannot be accepted.
<P>
	I want to take a little more time with respect to Motion No. 11, 
which deals with the CN employees and pensioners. We also agree 
that these men and women who have worked and continue to work 
for a great corporation need to understand and know how they are 
going to be treated with regard to their CN pension.
<P>
	The pensions of all CN employees and pensioners are protected 
in a number of ways, but first under the Pension Benefits Standards 
Act, 1985. They will continue to be protected following the 
commercialization of CN. The Pension Benefits Standards Act, 
1985, sets out the rules for pensions of all federally regulated 
companies. It therefore is a means by which to treat all those who 
are members of such pensions equally, including employees and 
pensioners of CN.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13990"> 13990 </A></B>
<P>
	Following the sale of Canadian National to private investors all 
the pension promises made under the CN pension plan will 
continue to be honoured. The CN pension plan will not participate 
in the share offering. The CN pension plan is a defined benefit, 
which means that regardless of the vagaries of the marketplace an 
employee is promised a pension. That pension is calculated 
according to a fixed formula and the only variables in the formula 
are average earnings and years of service. The plan is federally 
registered under the Pension Benefits Standards Act, as I 
mentioned before, which is administered by the Office of the 
Superintendent of Financial Institutions, and under the Income Tax 
Act, which is overseen by Revenue Canada.
<P>
	Pension promises are documented in the text of the CN pension 
plan, which describes the entitlements of the 50,000 pensioners and 
surviving spouses as well as the approximately 25,000 active 
members. These pension promises are supported by the assets of 
the CN pension trust fund, which do not form part of the assets and 
revenues of CN. Legal title to the assets of the fund is held by the 
trustee of the fund, the Montreal Trust Company of Canada.
<P>
<B>(2405 ) </B>
<P>
	The CN pension plan and fund, in addition to being regulated by 
the Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions and 
Revenue Canada, are audited by the company's internal auditors as 
well as by external auditors. The financial, actuarial, and 
administrative aspects of the CN pension plan are also reviewed by 
the CN pension board, which is composed of five company 
representatives, five union representatives, five pensioners, and 
one representative of CN non-scheduled employees. As well, the 
CN pension plan and fund are subject to periodic actuarial 
evaluations by the external actuary, whose reports are presented to 
the CN pension board, submitted to the board of directors, and filed 
with the regulatory authorities.
<P>
	The foregoing processes exist to safeguard the accrued pension 
entitlements of all members of the CN pension plan, pensioners, 
surviving spouses, and active members. A condensed version of 
this information was printed out on the April pension statement of 
all pensioners in answer to their most commonly asked question 
about the security of CN pensions. The April 1995 issue of 
``Keeping Track'', a monthly newsletter sent out to all active 
employees and pensioners, featured the chart.
<P>
	The government is committed to protecting the pensions of CN 
employees and the new corporation. This is our commitment. The 
amendments as proposed by the opposition would open it to 
employees of federally incorporated companies coming forward 
and seeking their own additional protection. This could potentially 
lead to a mixed bag of statutes protecting different players with 
different benefits for each group, rather than the consistent and 
clear protection currently found in the single piece of legislation. 
This inconsistency would  not serve Canadians as efficiently as 
keeping all provisions under a single act.
<P>
	Therefore, since CN employees and pensioners already have 
protection under the law, which would not be affected by 
commercialization of CN, the government does not support this 
amendment.

[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Gouk (Kootenay West-Revelstoke, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I will touch on my own motions by way of introduction. 
My colleague will deal further with those.
<P>
	I would just like to point out two things. First of all the Official 
Languages Act is not the subject of the motion. The subject is a 
restriction to a private company contrary to what the parliamentary 
secretary, the hon. member for London East said earlier with regard 
to the headquarters. He suggested that because it is in Montreal and 
it has always been in Montreal it probably always will be. That may 
be. If the company follows the official languages policy of the 
federal government and it works for it, I am sure it will continue to 
but if it does not work for the company, then it should not have a 
gun held to its head.
<P>
	I guess I should not use that expression. That would offend the 
Minister of Justice who is taking all those away. Instead I would 
say that we should not twist the company's arm and require it to 
remain there subject to this policy. Of course even twisting its arm 
now is a little dangerous because the thought police will first have 
to determine whether we are twisting its arm because we want it to 
use a particular language or because of race, religion or sexual 
orientation. I guess I will have to start to be more careful in the 
House.
<P>
	I would like to speak just briefly to Groups Nos. 5 and 6. Group 
No. 5 deals with the Bloc motion with the Pont de Québec. I 
listened to the group which came to committee on this matter. They 
were a very passionate and dedicated group. They obviously feel 
very strongly about their project to preserve the bridge and have a 
lot of commitment to this. I am sympathetic to their case. It was 
their explanation that there is a legal obligation on the part of CN. 
If that is true, and I have no reason to believe that they would be 
incorrect given how conscientious they seem to be about this, then 
it will not matter whether CN is still held by the government or 
privatized.
<P>
<B>(2420) </B>
<P>
	That legal obligation, if it exists, will go with the company and 
should be dealt with and enforced. I have suggested to them that I, 
among others I am sure, because I know the Bloc is very concerned 
about this, would be prepared to take this up if they are prepared to 
bring forward the evidence that this is a legal obligation.
<P>
	With regard to Group No. 6, in principle I have some support for 
what the Bloc is talking of. However, this is the wrong forum in 
which to do this. The government has already put me on notice that 
it will be introducing legislation next week dealing with regulatory 
reform for the entire rail industry. It would be inappropriate to take 
a small segment of that and try to deal with it under privatization 
when we have the regulatory legislation coming forward that will 
deal with all of it.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Guimond (Beauport-Montmorency-Orléans, 
BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, first of all, since I am not familiar with the 
procedure, I would like to ask a question. I would like to know 
whether I will have more than ten minutes to speak to each group. 
Since the motions have been grouped, I know I will need more than 
ten minutes. How does this work?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Boudria:</B> You ask for unanimous consent.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Guimond:</B> I should ask for unanimous consent? Thank you, 
Mr. Speaker.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> There is a request to speak for a little bit longer 
than the usual amount because we are putting three groups together. 
Is there unanimous consent to give each other a little bit more 
time?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Guimond:</B> Thank you, Mr. Speaker, and I apologize. I hope 
you will not take the fact that I thanked the Government Chief 
Whip for agreeing to extend my speaking time as a lack of respect 
on my part for the Chair.
<P>
	I would like to start by speaking to Motion No. 12 standing in the 
name of the hon. member for Kootenay West-Revelstoke, which 
proposes to delete clause 15 which reads as follows: ``The Official 
Languages Act continues to apply to CN as if it continued to be a 
federal institution within the meaning of that Act''.
<P>
	I think it is too bad that my Reform Party colleague, who is an 
ardent Canadian and wants to maintain Canadian unity, does not 
behave like one and is indulging what is referred to in English 
Canada as Quebec bashing. That is really too bad, and the Reform 
Party will suffer the consequences when one day it decides to field 
candidates in a federal election in Quebec. Mr. Speaker, in Quebec 
our motto is: ``Je me souviens'', I remember. And we certainly will 
remember, provided Quebec is still part of Canada, which is 
unlikely once we have won the referendum.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13993"> 13993 </A></B>
<P>
	We will take every opportunity to remind Quebecers that the 
Reform Party proposed amendments to remove the privatized 
company from the application of the Official Languages Act. And 
this is not the first time, as the hon. member for Bourassa pointed 
out. This party makes a habit of presenting petitions in the House of 
Commons to complain about the Official Languages Act. I would 
like to point out that the government acted responsibly by including 
Clause 15 in Bill C-89, under which the Official Languages Act 
will continue to apply to CN when it is privatized.
<P>
	The government's actions reflect those of the previous 
government in 1988 when it proceeded to privatize Air Canada. I 
could also mention another amendment by the hon. member which 
proposed to reverse the present government's commitment to keep 
the company's headquarters in the Montreal Urban Community.
<P>
<B>(2425) </B>
<P>
	I would now like to touch briefly on amendment no. 14, which 
would provide for the federal government, therefore the Minister of 
Transport, to remain responsible for the maintenance of the Pont de 
Québec, despite the privatization of CN.
<P>
	The Pont de Québec is a jewel in our world heritage. This is no 
bridge over some backwater creek at the end of some concession. 
This is the structure that Sir Wilfrid Laurier called an architectural 
masterpiece when it was inaugurated, a source of pride not only for 
the Province of Quebec and Quebec City, but for all of Canada.
<P>
	I publicly denounce here in the House the attitude of my 
colleagues on the Standing Committee on Transport. Both the 
chairman, the hon. member for Hamilton West and the 
Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Transport, the member 
for London East were impolite to the people from the Coalition 
pour la sauvegarde du Pont de Québec when they presented their 
brief to the committee last week. And that is putting it mildly.
<P>
	The chairman of our committee and the parliamentary secretary 
are both unilingual anglophones. With their earphones off, our 
committee's chairman and the Parliamentary Secretary to the 
Minister of Transport chatted away throughout the unilingual 
French presentation by the representatives of the coalition, taking 
in absolutely nothing at all.
<P>
	After it was over, they went so far as to ask me why the coalition 
had not applied under the infrastructure program. That is utterly 
unacceptable. Canadian National, and not the City of Quebec, is the 
owner of the bridge. And why should the City of Quebec have 
applied under the infrastructure program to renovate the bridge? 
This shows how ignorant they are of the whole issue and, to top it 
off, how impolite they were to the unilingual francophones who 
came before the Standing Committee on Transport to present their 
brief.
<P>
	I would like to remind you that the coalition to save the Pont de 
Québec is not a partisan organization, on the contrary, it is 
non-partisan. And I can assure you that I have never personally 
met any of the members of this coalition and they have never been 
associated with me or affiliated with my party. Their work falls 
squarely outside of the political arena. The people of the region of 
Quebec were very disappointed by the reception this coalition 
received in Ottawa.
<P>
	The bridge is in a pitiful state. According to the coalition, the 
required work is estimated at between $41 million and $45 million. 
What will happen if the new privatized CN refuses to honour its 
commitments with regard to the bridge? What will happen? Will it 
be left to deteriorate? It is a world heritage jewel.
<P>
	Here again, I deplore, I forgot to mention it earlier, I deplore the 
fact that the chairman of the Standing Committee on Transport 
downplayed the Pont de Québec, saying that the new privatized CN 
would never save any old bridge crossing a stream at the end of a 
concession or any bit of rail line in some village in Canada or some 
old station in Canada.
<P>
	This was how the bridge was described, and it is crazy. Perhaps it 
was to convince himself that those watching us would think the 
Bloc member was fantasizing and making it up. I suggest they read 
the minutes of the Standing Committee on Transport; they will see 
where the truth lies.
<P>
	In closing, I would like to talk briefly about Motion No. 15. The 
aim of this amendment is to avoid short line railways CN might 
have an interest in being put under federal jurisdiction.
<P>
<B>(2430) </B>
<P>
	At the moment, all intraprovincial transport comes under 
provincial jurisdiction. We are concerned about the wording of 
clause 16 of the bill and so we have proposed an amendment to 
ensure that SLRs remain within provincial jurisdiction and do not 
become federal.
<P>
	Obviously, by stating that interprovincial transportation 
structures-check the wording in the bill-are ``for the general 
advantage of Canada'', we avoid having SLRs in which CN has an 
interest being automatically placed under federal jurisdiction, and 
this is the aim of our amendment.
<P>
	CN could thus become a partner and share in the creation of 
SLRs. I think that our party has shown great openness towards 
SLRs; it may be the way of the future, an instrument that will give 
us more flexibility to satisfy the clients' needs, etc. But what is 
important is that, to prevent abandonment, it isimportant that many 
lines be taken over by SLRs. Some of them may even belong to 
CN. I think that instead of eliminating regional services, it 
isimportant, and I will conclude with this, to consider rail transport 
in the same way as air or water transport. A mode of transport is 
above all an instrument for regional economic development.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13994"> 13994 </A></B>
<P>
	It is obvious that when a rail line is abandoned, it can make 
regional economic development much more difficult.
<P>
	To conclude, I will give you an example. A cement factory is 
planned in Port-Daniel, in the Gaspé. Unfortunately, the member 
for Bonaventure-Îles-de-la-Madeleine has not intervened and 
never made any inquiry regarding this planned cement factory, 
although it is in his riding, probably because he is not interested. 
Anyway, there is a plan for a cement factory in Port-Daniel, in the 
Gaspé, a beautiful village with a 25 per cent unemployment rate. 
The developers have two requirements. First, they require a sea 
port; Port-Daniel is located in Chaleur Bay; I believe that having a 
deep water sea port will not be a problem. Second, to move cement 
to Canadian and American markets, they require a railway since, as 
we know, Gaspé roads cannot take heavy trucking.
<P>
	Therefore, if they close the railway in Gaspé, how will it be 
possible to attract companies and develop Quebec? This is what I 
wanted to say to conclude my remarks.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Lee Morrison (Swift Current-Maple 
Creek-Assiniboia, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am not going to ask you 
for any extra time or for anything over 10 minutes. As a matter of 
fact I may not even speak for five minutes.
<P>
	I have noticed a certain ambivalence on the benches opposite 
toward this privatization bill. Clearly privatization is not 
something you do just to do it. It is done for a reason. The reason is 
to try to put a crown corporation in a position where it becomes an 
efficient money making organization.
<P>
	The hon. member for London East has spoken on several 
occasions about the fact we must not apply constraints to the 
company after it is privatized. If we do that we defeat our purpose. 
One of the constraints the government is proposing to apply is to 
maintain the Official Languages Act for this private corporation. 
The Official Languages Act is intended for government 
organizations.
<P>
	If CN has to maintain the extra cost and the extra inefficiencies 
of having the hand of the official languages commissioner on the 
throttle of every locomotive, it is not going to be as competitive as 
it needs to be. It is unnecessary. Most of CN's operations are west 
of the lakehead. There is very little French spoken by either the 
employees or by the customers.
<P>
	There will certainly be circumstances in any company working 
in Canada where it will want to maintain the use of two languages 
voluntarily.
<P>
<B>(2435) </B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	I worked from time to time in mines or other work sites where 
workers spoke two or even three different languages. We had to use 
these languages correctly for the sake of efficiency or safety, but 
never for political reasons. That is sensible bilingualism. It is not 
always necessary to impose rules for everything.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	I would like to speak even more briefly on Motion No. 14. 
Again, we have an example of an attempt by government to 
maintain control over the corporation after it is privatized. No one 
but the management of a company should be in a position to decide 
what bridges it is going to maintain, what tracks it is going to 
maintain.
<P>
	This is something that is not done if the government really 
means what it says about making the thing run properly. It does not 
allow bureaucrats or politicians to stick their cotton pickin' hands 
into the operations of a private company. If it does that, it may as 
well forget about privatizing the company, just keep on dictating to 
it. Government cannot have it both ways.
<P>
	Either the company is going to be private or it is going to 
continue to be a semi-crown. I strongly agree with the proposal to 
privatize it.
<P>
	On the last motion, the question proposed by the hon. members 
of the Bloc to simplify the regulatory regime, to give the provinces 
more regulatory powers and the federal government less, in 
principle I agree with that but this is neither the time nor the place 
to debate that question.
<P>
	It certainly should not be written into the bill. With that, I have 
had my five minutes.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Philippe Paré (Louis-Hébert, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I will be 
brief. I will confirm what my colleague from 
Beauport-Montmorency-Orléans has said.
<P>
	The Pont de Québec is indeed a heritage jewel. However, it is in 
very poor condition due to the irresponsible behaviour of Transport 
Canada as well as of CN. The reason why it is necessary to propose 
this amendment is that both entities, Transport Canada and CN, 
never fulfilled their responsibilities. Therefore, by adding this 
element to the bill we might have a chance to see the Pont de 
Québec become once again what it used to be, a source of pride for 
the Quebec region.
<P>
	Just as the Eiffel Tower is the symbol of Paris or the Statue of 
Liberty the symbol of New York, the Pont de Québec is something 
which symbolizes the Quebec region.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13995"> 13995 </A></B>
<P>
	The amendment is necessary because, in 1993, CN and Transport 
Canada signed an agreement that they never fulfilled. Why should 
we believe that a privatized CN, in the hands of private 
shareholders, would all of a sudden tell its shareholders: We must 
now ensure that the Pont de Québec be kept in good repair. We do 
not believe it would.
<P>
	The agreement signed in 1993 was very clear, it said in section 4: 
``Canada transfers the Pont de Québec to CN. CN undertakes to 
finance a major maintenance program on this bridge, including 
installation and maintenance of architectural lighting, to restore 
this structure to a condition which guarantees its long-term 
viability and maintain it in this condition. Without limiting the 
specified obligations of CN, the company will try to conclude an 
agreement with the Province of Quebec.'' I should say that 
Transport Quebec was never against such an agreement.
<P>
<B>(2440) </B>
<P>
	Section 13 of the same agreement reads: ``This agreement comes 
under Canadian legislation, is interpreted in accordance with that 
legislation and binds parties and their successors and assignees''. 
Therefore if an agreement signed by the Transport minister and the 
CN has remained totally inoperative, how can we believe that 
private shareholders would fare better? This is why we believe it is 
essential to pass amendment no. 14 in order to make sure that the 
Pont de Québec will be maintained by those who have the 
responsibility to do so.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Antoine Dubé (Lévis, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, my colleagues are 
inviting me to justify my presence in this debate. If the hon. 
member for Louis-Hébert can justify his presence because one of 
the bridge pillars is located in his riding, I must add that there is 
another one in my riding.
<P>
	This bridge was built in 1917 and, in the beginning, it was used 
to allow trains to cross the St. Lawrence River. It is a river, I say to 
the whip of the Liberal Party. It is not a brook, as my colleague for 
Beauport was saying. If ever this bridge were to collapse through 
lack of maintenance-I do not want to make people feel uneasy 
about this-if ever it were to collapse and CN trains could not go 
over it, imagine the detour we would have to make in order to ship 
our goods. We would have to go from Quebec City to Montreal, 
and then to the Maritimes.
<P>
	This does not make sense. This is unacceptable. Of course, the 
bridge may not collapse in the next 20 years, but its physical 
appearance is deteriorating to such an extent that people in the 
Quebec City region tell us that this bridge belongs to the federal 
government and has become a symbol of the decrepit state of 
federalism in Quebec.
<P>
	This is getting a reaction from some of the people here. If 
members of the current Liberal federal government wanted to 
enhance their visibility before the referendum, they should do as 
the coalition suggests  because every day, every person who comes 
to see me-not only people from the Quebec City region but also 
foreign visitors-note the state of disrepair of this symbol. I think 
it would be to the Liberal Party's advantage-I am giving them 
some valuable advice-to ensure that the bridge is being 
maintained, to give it a new image.
<P>
	Coalition members should also remind them that this would 
create 200 jobs over six years. Is this not right, my dear colleague? 
Over six years. This would allow the bridge to be renovated and 
create jobs, in addition to the purchase of materials. There would 
be an economic impact. We are looking for ways to put people back 
to work, for useful projects, and the Pont de Québec would fit the 
bill.
<P>
	This would cost $40 million but we must spend it. Strangely 
enough, an engineer told me this week that CN asked a U.S. firm to 
study the whole matter. The Americans recognize the value of this 
bridge. They took an interest in it and even gave it an architecture 
and engineering award. It has been described as one of the eight 
wonders of the world. That is quite something.
<P>
	But the wonder does not impress anyone any more. On the 
contrary, it has become an object of shame. Something must be 
done, but it does not make sense to leave this in the hands of a 
company that will be privatized.
<P>
<B>(2445) </B>
<P>
	No privatized company will want to invest $40 million to repair 
this bridge, unless it is forced into it. Nobody will do it. So, we are 
asking the federal government to act as the owner, not as a tenant, 
because it really is the owner, and it is responsible for these repairs.
<P>
	Finally, the amendment proposed by our colleague, the hon. 
member for Beauport-Montmorency-Orléans, is valid, as the 
federal government saw fit to remove the CN Tower from CN's 
assets. If it is good for Toronto, it should be good for Quebec City. I 
will end here, as it is quite late.
<P>
	<B>Mr. François Langlois (Bellechasse, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I will 
be brief. No one will wonder why I rise on the issue of the Pont de 
Québec.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> We want to know.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Langlois:</B> It is first for historical reasons. When the bridge 
collapsed for the second time, my grandfather was there. 
Consequently, that event was the topic of many stories when I was 
young. I often cross that bridge. The hon. member for Lévis 
referred to the CN Tower, in Toronto. It would be more appropriate 
to compare the Pont de Québec to the Tower of Pisa, considering 
that both structures are more or less in the same condition.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13996"> 13996 </A></B>
<P>
	There is also a more personal and even religious reason. Indeed, 
every time I cross the bridge on a train, I cannot help but feel a need 
to say my prayers, because I always wonder if we will make it to 
the other side.
<P>
	If you have been in Quebec City on more than one occasion, you 
should go at least once to have a look at the bridge from the lovely 
city of Saint-Romuald. You will realize what an eye-sore it is, not 
to say anything about the risk it represents for those who have to 
use it.
<P>
	If it remains a federal crown asset, we will see what will happen 
later on. We will at least get an assurance that that bridge will be 
repaired. Everything that needs to be done has already been 
identified. In the notes my colleague from 
Beauport-Montmorency-Orléans was kind enough to give to 
me, I notice that as late as 1994, that is last year, an American 
company called Mojeski and Masters was paid $700,000 U.S. for a 
visual inspection of the substructure and superstructure of the 
bridge. Surely, we must have qualified people in Canada to do that 
kind of work, but the contract was awarded to an American 
company anyway.
<P>
	When the railway service was dismantled, in Bellechasse, the 
entire Monk line, from Charny to Edmunston, New Brunswick, was 
dismantled. Even the rails were torn up. The right of way has not 
been given back to the original owners yet, but the rails have 
disappeared.
<P>
	The dismantling of the railroad is a real disaster, since the 
railway has always been a symbol and a reality for Canada ever 
since 1867, which is why I will be pleased to support the 
amendment put forward by the hon. member for 
Beauport-Montmorency-Orléans and to vote in favour of the 
Pont de Québec remaining a public asset.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Joe Fontana (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Transport, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, let me assure everyone in 
attendance I will not be quite as long as the Bloc was with all its 
members. I will be about the same time as it took the hon. member 
for Kootenay West-Revelstoke.
<P>
	With regard to Motions Nos. 12 and 13 which affect clause 15 in 
the bill, CN currently operates under the Official Languages Act in 
both official languages. In its continuing capacity as a national 
railway CN will continue to serve both anglophone and 
francophone clients across the country.
<P>
	Continued application of the Official Languages Act will not 
require any change to its operations. In addition, CN management 
has indicated it makes good business sense to operate a bilingual 
railway.
<P>
<B>(2450 ) </B>
<P>
	Moreover, CN's intention to continue operating as a bilingual 
railway will also have no effect on the value of the company's 
shares when they are sold.
<P>
	With regard to Motion No. 14 and the Quebec bridge, Motion 
No. 14 deals with the renovation and maintenance of the Pont de 
Québec in Quebec City. Although the government understands the 
desire to ensure the Pont de Québec is maintained in good 
condition, Bill C-89 is not the proper venue for such assurances.
<P>
	Putting such a clause in the bill would draw negative attention 
from investors as an operating cost imposed on CN. CN has stated 
its willingness to increase its contribution for maintenance to $1.5 
million but needs matching funds from the province of Quebec, 
keeping in mind the province has an interest in the bridge because 
it is a highway structure, an area of provincial jurisdiction.
<P>
	I hope members of the Bloc would impose upon their friends in 
Quebec City that they have an equal responsibility to maintain that 
bridge, as 70 per cent of the traffic on it is vehicular, which is under 
provincial jurisdiction.
<P>
	Let me assure everyone this bridge is in safe condition. It is in 
need of repair. CN is obligated to maintain it and it has promised to 
do so. I encourage everyone to have the province put in its fair 
share as well as those people who want to keep it for historical 
purposes.
<P>
	Therefore we cannot support Motion No. 14.
<P>
	On Motion No. 15, which impacts on clause 16, Bill C-89 will 
have no effect on the jurisdiction under which either an 
interprovincial or an intraprovincial railway operates. Currently 
interprovincial railways come under federal jurisdiction and must 
comply with federal safety regulations. Intraprovincial railways 
may choose to incorporate either under the provincial jurisdiction 
of the province in which they operate or under federal jurisdiction.
<P>
	Currently most intraprovincial shortlines choose provincial 
jurisdiction. Internal shortlines, whether they be intraprovincial or 
interprovincial remain part of the class one railway and therefore 
operate under federal jurisdiction.
<P>
	An example of this is the internal shortline in northern Quebec 
recently established by CN and its employees. Again, none of the 
foregoing would be affected by Bill C-89, and the proposal to 
amend clause 16 is therefore unnecessary.

<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Guimond:</B> Mr. Speaker, I will try to proceed as quickly as 
possible.
<P>
	You will know that the firms Scotia McLeod, Nesbitt Burns and 
Goldman Sachs have been hired to co-ordinate the sale of CN 
shares at the international level. The purpose of this amendment is 
to ensure that CN remains under Canadian control, since it is 
Canadian taxpayers' money that was used to build it. That is what 
our amendment is all about.
<P>
	I can tell you that, in the transport committee, I was very 
disappointed that the syndicate of the three companies responsible 
for launching the issue of shares refused to answer my questions, 
and in particular a very legitimate question asking what their fee 
for this operation would be. I think the taxpayers of Quebec and 
Canada have the right to know how much Scotia McLeod, Nesbitt 
Burns and the U.S. firm Goldman Sachs will be paid to launch the 
new issue of CN's shares.
<P>
	The question was perfectly legitimate, but I was told this was 
confidential information that could not be divulged. I want to say 
that the answer is unsatisfactory.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="13998"> 13998 </A></B>
<P>
	I had other very pertinent questions for which I did not get any 
answers either. I will read a few to the House. I had 21 of them. For 
instance, I asked:
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	What are the prospective financial statistics for CN upon which 
the sale price will have to be based? I am interested in the 
following for the years 1990-95 through 2000. I wanted to know 
the operating cash flow, the free cash flow after capital spending 
but before dividends, operating income and the net income.
<P>
<B>(2500) </B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	I had all kinds of questions to which I received no answer. I 
asked them, for example:
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	What is your estimation of the value of land and other real estate 
property?
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	I received no answer. That is why I am very concerned about the 
fact that the new privatized CN could fall under foreign 
management when taxpayers in Quebec and Canada have made 
such a major contribution to the development of this company.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I will also be very brief. I just want to explain to hon. 
members what the consequences are of adopting or defeating this 
amendment.
<P>
	I would like to provide some historical background. Certain 
choices were made in the course of Canada's history and one was 
that the railroad would go from New Brunswick through Eastern 
Quebec and then to Ontario. These decisions also led to the 
introduction of transportation subsidies to compensate for the fact 
that the distance was greater than it would be through the United 
States.
<P>
	If we do not adopt the amendment before the House today, we 
might easily land in a situation where American interests would be 
able to buy or get a controlling interest in CN and thus be able to 
close down certain parts of the line for the benefit of American 
lines, in other words, the routes through the United States.
<P>
	This is true in Eastern Canada and also in Western Canada. I 
think that if we do not watch out, 25, 30 or 35 years from now we 
will realize we made a strategic mistake that will cost Quebec and 
Canada dearly. In the past, we saw that Quebec was adversely 
affected as a result of certain choices made with respect to railway 
routes. The amendment before the House today would prevent this 
kind of situation.
<P>
	Incidentally, a Canadian group would not be prohibited from 
owning more than 15 per cent of CN shares. This might give 
Quebec interests a chance to ensure that in the future, the entire 
railway network in Quebec is harmonized with the road network. 
That is why this amendment should be passed.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Osvaldo Nunez (Bourassa, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, even though 
it is late, I would like to say just a few words, because I think this is 
a very important subject.
<P>
	I support this motion and it is important, because when the 
Liberals were in the opposition, they were more nationalist and 
Canadian in their outlook than they are today. I think they defended 
the interests of Canadians better than they are doing now. Today, 
that is history. I think some people in this country are apprehensive 
about the foreign interests that might control CN.
<P>
	The very fact of selecting Goldman Sachs in New York does not 
augur well, as far as I am concerned, and that is why I want to 
support this motion which I think is very important.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Joe Fontana (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Transport, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I want to take a couple of minutes 
to address the amendment and a very fundamental question here.
<P>
	First, let me indicate there is no evidence in other countries 
where privatization has taken place of foreign takeovers. In fact, to 
protect against any individual gaining control of CN, as has been 
indicated, a 15 per cent individual ownership restriction has been 
imposed.
<P>
	Moreover section 8 of the enabling legislation protects against 
investors colluding to control the company by combining the 
voting power of their shares. To insert such an amendment into the 
bill would negatively impact on both the value of the shares as well 
as what the government would receive and hence the Canadian 
taxpayer.
<P>
	I do not believe we need to take any lessons from the Bloc 
Quebecois in protecting Canadian interests. The government wants 
to maximize the return for Canadians in this national railroad and 
does not need any lessons from them on how to build good national 
railways.
<P>
	Let me also take this opportunity to assure my friend in regard to 
the question he asked about fees. Obviously they will be made in 
due course. I believe he also heard of this global team that will 
offer these shares across North America and beyond, that is why 
this team was put together.
<P>
<B>(2505) </B>
<P>
	He also heard that our Minister of Transport has negotiated the 
best deal with regard to fees and they have complimented the hard 
bargain he drove. I assure members we will be getting good value 
for the fees from our global underwriters.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> We are now dealing with Group No. 7, Motion
