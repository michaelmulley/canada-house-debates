tell the justices that Quebec is not entitled to unilateral 
secession. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This marginal group, some of whose members are Liberal MPs, 
does not speak on behalf of women's groups in Quebec or in Canada. 
It is not, therefore, surprising that their proposal is more in 
line with the government's position than with the women's position, 
particularly when we see that one of their representatives, Mary 
Eberts, was also the Treasury Board chief negotiator in the wage 
equity issue, which is still not settled, moreover. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All of the women's groups in Quebec believe that only the 
people of Quebec are entitled to decide their future.   In 
solidarity with Quebec, these women believe in freedom and 
democracy. They know that Quebec's right to be the only one to 
decide its future does not in any way encroach on their own rights.

Nagano Winter Olympics. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no doubt these athletes in Nagano are there not only 
because of their personal achievements but thanks to the training 
provided by dedicated coaches and the support of their families. 
However news coverage also shows coaches and parents holding 
fundraising events. Why? In an attempt to raise dollars to join 
their athletes in Nagano. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now some Canadian politicians are attempting to justify their 
own participation in a $75,000 all expense taxpayer funded VIP 
junket to Nagano. The heritage minister is accompanied by 
Conservative, Bloc and Liberal members of Parliament. These 
politicians say they are going to Nagano to show solidarity and 
support for our Canadian athletes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It seems to me that Canadian athletes would garner far more 
solidarity and support from their coaches, parents and teammates 
than from politicians acting as VIP cheerleaders.

the 14.6% loss nationwide. I am told that Newfoundland will have 
lost nearly 30% of its federal employees by the end of March

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier—Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
there is a great deal of confusion about the government's position 
with respect to the supreme court reference.  There is the position 
of the Minister of Justice, the position of the Minister of 
Intergovernmental Affairs, and the position of the lawyer, Yves 
Fortier. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would ask the Prime Minister to tell us what the 
government's position is. 
Is it the position of the Minister of Justice, who says that 
Quebec's sovereignty would create such an exceptional situation 
that the Constitution would be of no help, or is it that of Yves 
Fortier, who argued the exact opposite before the supreme court? 
<P><A NAME="LINK48"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the government's position is very well known.  We are saying 
clearly that the case is before the supreme court right now, that 
the lawyers are making their arguments, that we are going to let 
them do so, and that the supreme court will be able to make its 
decision. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The important thing for us is to ensure that all Canadian 
citizens comply with the law of Canada.

I see that the Prime Minister is avoiding the issue, while his 
Minister of Justice is talking about it to the newspapers and his 
Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs is talking about it just 
about everywhere. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Justice tells us that the court must rule on 
native rights, while Yves Fortier is arguing quite the opposite. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I therefore ask the Prime Minister from whom exactly in this

<P><A NAME="LINK50"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker,

that it had no say in the matter, they are taking quite an interest 
in the court's goings on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government's lawyers are explaining the position of the 
Government of Canada and the other intervenors representing 
particular groups are explaining their points of view.  It will be 
up to the supreme court to decide.  If they want to go and present 
an argument, let them apply to the supreme court and send a lawyer.

her lawyer was saying in court on Monday.  The Minister of

$1.5 billion from education.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Yesterday, he appeared to finally acknowledge that there was 
a connection between education and job opportunity.  In Canada, 
students graduate with a very heavy debt load.  This country is 
also faced at this time with a brain drain caused by excessive 
taxation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If there must be a millennium fund, I would like the Prime 
Minister's commitment today to making the solution to two questions 
his priority: student debt, and the brain drain, by cutting taxes 
so that our young people remain—

<P><A NAME="LINK62"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
student debt is a problem of enormous concern to the government. 
When we met with the provincial premiers in December, an agreement 
was reached between all the provincial premiers and the federal 
government, that the two levels of government would work together 
to solve this problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As for education, we of course believe—and I said so 
yesterday in my speech—that for young people with a good 
education, there is 5% unemployment.  Those who unfortunately have 
less education have a 15% unemployment rate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This means that—

the student debt problem is an extremely important problem.  It 
has been assessed at FMC. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If that is the case and there is to be a millennium fund, will 
the Prime Minister make a commitment today that the number one

his tax collectors were cracking down on employees who dared to 
upgrade their education at work.

this time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With regard to employers providing training, we actually 
encourage employers to provide training.  Assessments on whether 
it is an expense have to be done on a case by case basis.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jason Kenney (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
once again the minister demonstrates that he has no capacity in 
his file.  It has nothing to do with writing off the expense.  It 
has to do with Revenue Canada retroactively assessing these 
training courses as taxable benefits.  Yesterday somebody was hit 
with $30,000 for taking a university course. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Business Council on National Issues says that millions of

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Stéphane Dion (President of the Queen's Privy Council for

education, because we are the federal government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, financial aid to students has always been a shared

for Finance.  According to the arrangement made by the Minister 
of Finance when he became Minister of Finance—everybody knew 
that he was in that business—he made a disposition to make sure

not implemented.

commissioner's statement proves that there is an apparent conflict 
of interest and the 1994 code of ethics states that ministers must 
not find themselves in such situations, what does the Prime 
Minister intend to do about his minister-cum-shipowner-cum-legislator?

handed the matter over to the Secretary of State for Financial 
Institutions.  It is clear cut. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since the Minister's very first day in this House as an MP, 
everyone has known he was a highly successful businessman in that

the Prime Minister believes that this millennium fund will be his 
government's legacy.  I say that his education legacy is one of 
shame. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today's students have paid for this future fund by shouldering 
massive cuts to education.  Today's students do not need a legacy 
fund, they need an education fund.

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>POINT OF ORDER 
</H3><P align=left>
<P><A NAME="LINK135"></A></P>
<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>STANDING COMMITTEE ON FINANCE 
</H4><P align=left>

<P><A NAME="LINK136"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I appeal to 
you as the defender of parliamentary rights and protector of the 
right of everyone in this parliament to speak, not only in this 
House, but wherever our work as members takes us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The members of the opposition were prevented from doing their 
work properly by various decisions taken by the chair of the 
Standing Committee on Finance.  This is the subject of my remarks 
to you. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The chair of the Standing Committe on Finance categorically 
and systematically rejected a request by my colleague the member 
for Saint-Hyacinthe—Bagot, who wanted to hear from witnesses in 
committee in order to better understand the entire scope of clause 
241 of Bill C-28. 
The chair refused any witnesses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Saint-Hyacinthe—Bagot also asked to have the 
ethics commissioner testify.  The committee chair, contrary to all 
expectations and plans, shortened the appearance of the ethics 
counsellor, on his own initiative. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The third point I would like to raise with you, and which I 
consider quite extraordinary, is the fact that the chair of the 
Standing Committee on Finance rejected the request of my 
colleague from Saint-Hyacinthe—Bagot for a special committee, a 
sub-committee, at least, to hear witnesses and clarify the matter 
of the apparent conflict of interest involving the Minister of 
Finance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is extraordinary, in our opinion, for a committee chair to 
use his powers, which should serve to enable parliamentarians to do 
their work, to systematically prevent the opposition from obtaining 
any information on this matter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the good of the Minister of Finance, if the opposition can 
query a number of specialists in order to clarify this important 
and complex situation, it seems to me the committee should be 
allowed to do its job. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I therefore appeal to you as the Speaker of the House and 
ultimate chair of all committees so that parliamentarians may be 
heard.

</P>
<P><A NAME="LINK137"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Don Boudria (Leader of the Government in the House of 
Commons, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have had the opportunity to read a 
portion of the proceedings of the committee sitting in question, or 
at least a summary of that sitting.  There are two points that 
should be brought to the attention of the Chair. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First of all, the fact that a decision by the chair of a 
committee may be appealed.  An appeal can be made to the committee 
as a whole.  Parliamentarians are free to do so, of course, but 
ultimately at that level whom a committee will or will not hear is 
under the committee's jurisdiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As for procedure, I would remind you of what it says in 
Beauchesne's sixth edition: 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Article 760(3) states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Speaker has ruled on many occasions that it is not competent 
for the Speaker to exercise procedural control over the 
committees.  Committees are and must remain masters of their own 
procedures. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is from the <I>Journals</I> of December 4, 1973. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I recall having the occasion when I was in opposition of rising 
in the House to plead a similar case in the late 1980s which I 
lost. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also want to remind you, Mr. Speaker, of article 760(4) which 
states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>On one occasion, after a grievance was raised in the House 
concerning procedure in a committee— 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again, we are talking about procedure here, not the matter of 
whether or not someone likes the quality of the decision, which 
is entirely different.  It continues: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—the Speaker then undertook to write to all committee chairmen 
pointing out that when a grievance is not resolved satisfactorily 
in committee it often results in the time of the House being 
taken— 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>And so on.  Then again there is not an instance where the 
Speaker personally intervened in that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The two points I want to summarize are:  First, this is not an 
issue of procedure per se; in other words whether someone has 
been aggrieved because he or she was not allowed to speak in 
committee, whether the chair went beyond the usual control the 
chair has over committee and so on.  One is making a qualitative 
judgment here in terms of how the chair of the committee ruled. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, even if it had been a matter of procedure, His Honour 
has been constant in the past by saying that he—and your 
predecessors, Sir—has not seen fit to undertake to overrule such 
decisions before. 
<P><A NAME="LINK138"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
rise on the same point of order.  It is a very serious issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will simply say that the government House leader pointed out 
that when he was in opposition he understood the necessity of 
having the Speaker at that time intervening in a situation.  He 
subsequently lost his case but I think he appreciates the point. 
He has taken it to heart. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I simply want to make the same point.  In this case the 
allegations that are being made are extraordinarily serious.  If 
they are not dealt with in an appropriate way, it will darken the 
reputation of the House.  I believe the Speaker is charged with 
the responsibility of upholding the reputation of the House of 
Commons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this case I believe the seriousness of the allegations 
warrant the intervention of the Speaker. 
<P><A NAME="LINK139"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Nelson Riis (Kamloops, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on 
the same point of order.  I listened to the government House 
leader.  I think there has been some slight error in 
interpretation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reason that members of the opposition parties in the finance 
committee jointly introduced a motion asking for the opportunity 
to delve into the issue further was in an effort to clear any 
hint of wrongdoing by the Minister of Finance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We recognize that for us to do our work in the House of Commons 
and in the finance committee the reputation of the Minister of 
Finance is paramount.  Allegations have been made. 
Interpretations of various comments have been made, the fact that 
there may be a conflict of interest with the Minister of Finance 
on the eve of the budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is an effort not to question necessarily the procedure in 
the finance committee but simply to find a way to clear the air 
once and for all so that there is no hint that a possible 
conflict of interest may occur with the Minister of Finance.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Scott Brison (Kings—Hants, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise 
on the same point of order.  We support this point of order.  We 
feel this process requires transparency, not just for the 
opposition but for the government and the minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the Liberal promises was that the ethics counsellor would 
be reporting to parliament as opposed to simply the prime 
minister.  In lieu of that, the committee needs to have the 
ability to investigate the matter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For instance, the commissioner talked to CSL to find what the 
tax implications would be.  Perhaps the committee would be able 
to call tax experts to find out what the implications would be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The point is that all Canadians will be best served by a 
transparent process in the hands of parliamentarians at the 
subcommittee level. 
<P><A NAME="LINK141"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  This point has come up a number of times 
since I have been in the House.  My predecessors in this chair 
have consistently ruled that the committees are masters of their 
own work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would point out with respect that members of the committee can 
bring this forth in the committee proper and the committee will 
decide what it wants to do with it.  If a report is brought back 
to the House then I believe we could entertain the motions or 
objections such as those that are brought forth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unless and until I get direction from the House of Commons that 
the policies in this regard are to be changed, I would rule at 
this time that the committee is master of its own destiny and 
that if a report comes back to the House, at that time I will 
have a look at it.

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>QUESTION PERIOD 
</H4><P align=left>

<P><A NAME="LINK143"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
rise on a point of order in regard to a document that was quoted 
from by the minister of fisheries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I first raised this matter yesterday after question period.  I 
based my point of order on Beauchesne's sixth edition, citation 
495, which reads: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>A Minister is not at liberty to read or quote from a despatch or 
other state paper not before the House without being prepared to 
lay it on the Table. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government House leader argued that the minister did not 
actually quote from the document and therefore did not have to 
table the document.  I have reviewed the videotape and it clearly 
shows the minister quoting from the document.  I have reviewed 
<I>Hansard</I> which indicates the exact statement in question in 
quotation marks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As you are aware, Mr. Speaker, the authority of the House stems 
from the powers granted it by the Constitution, our standing 
orders and our longstanding practices.  I would point out that 
any attempt to deliberately omit information from the House by 
disobeying the practice as outlined in citation 495 of 
Beauchesne's sixth edition would be considered a contempt of 
parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reason why the minister may be reluctant to table the 
document containing the accusation against me is because that 
document is a lie. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  I believe the member mentioned the hon. 
minister of fisheries.  Is that correct? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Monte Solberg:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I owe the minister of 
fisheries an apology.  I intended to say the Minister of Veterans 
Affairs. 
<P><A NAME="LINK144"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. David Anderson (Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, 
Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, if the member is going to get up in the 
House and declare that people happen to be lying, at least he 
should understand who he is talking about.  I feel offended by 
this hon. member and I find his apology totally inadequate.

<A HREF="#LINKT15"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  Colleagues, with regard to the use of the 
word “lie”, of course the word “lie” in itself is not 
unparliamentary.  I did not hear the hon. member for Medicine Hat 
say a minister lied.  If I understand correctly, although I do 
not have the precise words, the member stated that the document 
was a lie.  That is a lot different from a member lying. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to put that particular part to one side.  With regard to 
the hon. member misnaming a minister, that is regrettable.  I 
could understand the minister of fisheries reacting to it. 
However, the hon. member has clarified that he was talking 
specifically about the Minister of Veterans Affairs.  Is that 
correct? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Monte Solberg:</B>  Absolutely, Mr. Speaker. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  That being the case, yesterday I do not know 
that the minister quoted from a letter.  I do not know that he 
quoted necessarily from a document.  I believe that the hon. 
leader of the government in the House did make a statement on 
this yesterday.  At that time the hon. government House leader 
said that if this was a letter or a document it would be tabled 
in the House.  I might have misunderstood.  However, he also said 
that if this was a briefing note, which is different from a 
document as I see it, then that would not be brought into the 
House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How do we get to the bottom of this?  Evidently the Minister 
of Veterans Affairs is not here so he cannot tell us whether he 
quoted from a document or not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Oh, oh. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  Colleagues, it is rather difficult for me to 
give a decision and to bring us through this situation if I am 
being interrupted.  I would ask you to please hold your comments 
until at least we get the situation as clarified as we can. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was saying that the minister is not here.  I put this question 
to the government House leader.  Does he have direct and specific 
information about this document? 
<P><A NAME="LINK145"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Don Boudria (Leader of the Government in the House of 
Commons, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I indicated yesterday that I 
would undertake to look into the request made by the hon. member 
and of course I will.  I do not expect to delay this at all.  Had 
he contacted me informally before, I would have done my best to 
have it for him today.  To the extent that it can be available 
for the next sitting of the House it will with the same 
conditions that I stipulated yesterday. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, if you will allow me, I would like to raise 
something else in relation to what the member said.  It is the 
reference to citation 485 of Beauchesne's regarding 
unparliamentary language. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It states quite clearly that language, whenever it is 
conditional or hypothetical, does not make unparliamentary 
language acceptable.  For someone to suggest in any way that the 
minister may have been not telling the truth in terms of quoting 
from a document or that he did not have a document and that in 
itself was not true, and so on, is the same as saying the 
minister himself was making statements which were untrue.  To 
make it conditional like that does not make it any more 
acceptable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I invite Mr. Speaker to check the parliamentary records, the 
blues as we refer to them, later to see whether that language is 
appropriate even with the conditionality that was placed on it 
today.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  I am going to deal with the first point and 
then I will come back to the second point the hon. government 
House leader brings up. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have <I>Hansard</I> from yesterday.  I am looking at page 4020 
and I do not see in this any quotation marks.  That could be an 
error on the part of <I>Hansard</I>.  I wonder if the hon. member 
could wait until we have the Minister of Veterans Affairs here. 
We will question him.  If indeed he did quote from a document, I 
am sure he will tell us.  Then we will proceed from there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to go to the other point of order brought up by the hon. 
government House leader.  I did not hear, either in the tone or 
the words that were said, the allegations that the hon. 
government House leader said were uttered to him in this House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, I will take it upon myself to review specifically what 
was said. I will review the tapes, the television tapes also, to 
satisfy myself that such was not the case.  It is not 
parliamentary for us to accuse each other of telling untruths. My 
understanding is that there was no accusation made of an 
individual.  However, I will review it and I will come back to 
the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the hon. member have more information to give us? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Monte Solberg:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am informed that the 
quotation marks were on the original blues that were sent out. 
They have subsequently been removed. I simply point that out. 
<P><A NAME="LINK146"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
would like to request that when you review <I>Hansard</I> and the 
movie rights to this saga, perhaps you could also look at what 
the minister for ACOA said in the House with the tapes. That is a 
telling tale in itself. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  The hon. member is right, this is becoming a 
saga. I have given an undertaking to this House. I will fulfill 
that undertaking and I will get back to the House.

</I></B></P><P align=left>It is hard for us to do our job on a critical issue like

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt—Juan de Fuca, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I have two motions today.  Motion No. 337 calls for this 
House to restore the taxes on cigarettes to the level existing 
January 1, 1994 which happened just at the time when the 
government dropped the taxes and caused the single biggest 
increase in consumption by youth this country has ever had. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It also calls for the tax rate on tobacco sticks to be the same 
as the tax rate on tobacco sticks equal to that on cigarettes, 
increase the rate of tax on fine cut tobacco, smokeless tobacco 
and leaf tobacco intended for retail sale so that this tax on one 
gram of tobacco is equal to the rate of one cigarette and, last, 
to improve the tax paid markings that are required on packages of 
tobacco products and apply the incremental revenue to health 
care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  The motion I believe is on the Notice 
Paper.  Why is he rising on motions today?  Could he explain that 
to the Chair, please. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Keith Martin:</B>  I call for unanimous consent, Mr. 
Speaker. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  What is he asking for unanimous 
consent to do? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Keith Martin:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I have another motion that 
I would like to ask for unanimous consent for. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  For what?

</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion calls for this House to convene in 1998 a meeting of 
like-minded nations in order to develop a multilateral plan of 
action to reform international organizations such as the IMF, the 
World Bank and the UN, so that they can identify the precursors 
to conflict and establish multilateral conflict prevention 
initiatives. This is so we can move our foreign policy from 
dealing with conflict— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  Does the hon. member have the 
unanimous consent of the House to move the motion?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Marlene Catterall (Ottawa West—Nepean, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, there has been no information given to us on this side 
of the House.  I am wondering if the member has any compelling 
reason why his motion should be taken out of precedence of all 
the other motions of the other members of Parliament.  There is a 
procedure that we follow for private members' motions.  I wonder 
if he has a compelling reason why his should be treated 
differently. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  I have a feeling that if we got into 
the reasons we would be into a debate.  I think the question that 
is properly before the House at the moment, with respect, is 
whether or not the hon. member has consent to deal with his 
motion today during motions.  Is there consent? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  No. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  There is no consent.

</H4><P align=left>

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvan Bernier 
(Bonaventure—Gaspé—Îles-de-la-Madeleine—Pabok, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, on behalf of the people of 
Gaspé—Îles-de-la-Madeleine—Pabok, I am pleased to present a 
petition to this House from the Pabok regional county 
municipality.  This petition contains 1,276 signatures and 
concerns the Atlantic Groundfish Strategy, more commonly known as 
TAGS. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The petitioners are drawing attention to the fact that our 
region has been heavily affected by the groundfish moratorium 
imposed by Fisheries and Oceans Canada back in May 1994.  Since 
then, the Atlantic Groundfish Strategy, or TAGS, has been the only 
means of survival for a large part of our population.  This program 
was slated to continue until the end of the moratorium in 1999, but 
has been re-examined and is now slated to terminate in August 1998. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The people are calling for this program to be continued until 
the end of the initial moratorium and feel they should not be the 
victims of poor management.

my pleasure to present a petition this afternoon from a great 
number of constituents from my riding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The petitioners feel that the issue which they are addressing in 
this petition certainly is something which consumers right across 
Canada feel is important at this time.  They feel that Canadian 
consumers are at the mercy of the pricing policies of oil 
companies.  They call upon the Parliament of Canada to adopt 
legislation which would require gasoline companies to give 30 
days written notice to the Minister of Natural Resources of an 
impending significant increase in the price of gasoline that is 
over 1% of the current pump prices per litre and that such notice 
also contain the reason or reasons for the increase and when it 
will take effect.

petition bearing 239 signatures, which combine with the 10,847 I 
have already tabled in the House, for a total of 11,086 people who 
have signed the petition, which reads as follows: 
</I></B></P><P align=left>“We would like

Speaker, pursuant to Standing Order 36, I have the honour to 
present a petition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The petitioners draw the attention of the House to the fact that 
some individuals are marrying Canadian citizens or permanent 
residents for the primary purpose of entering Canada as a member 
of the family class. Since fraudulent marriages of convenience 
cause pain to innocent spouses, the petitioners request that 
Parliament encourage the government to consider introducing a 
three year conditional period for sponsored spouses.

Leroux, Laurie Cameron, Susan Scarth and more than 23,000 others 
who are calling upon Parliament to create a system of student 
financial aid which includes the following elements: special

am pleased to present a petition signed by a number of Canadians, 
including constituents from my riding of Mississauga South. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The petitioners draw to the attention of the House that our 
police officers and firefighters are required to place their 
lives at risk on a daily basis as they execute their duties. The 
employment benefits of police officers and firefighters often do 
not provide sufficient compensation to the families of those who 
are killed in the line of duty.  Finally, the public also mourns 
the loss of police officers and firefighters killed in the line 
of duty and wish to support in a tangible way the surviving 
families in their time of need. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The petitioners therefore call upon Parliament to establish a 
public safety officers compensation fund for the benefit of 
families of public safety officers who are killed in the line of 
duty.

would receive an answer.  It appears on the Order Paper as 
Question No. 21.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Jean J. Charest (Sherbrooke, PC)</B> moved: 
<A NAME="LINK182">&nbsp;</A>
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That, in the opinion of this House, the government should lower 
the tax burden on Canadians and offer interest relief to student 
loan holders in order to address the brain drain crisis which is 
forcing Canadians to move to the United States where unemployment 
rates, income tax rates and student debt levels are lower and the 
standard of living is 25% higher than in Canada. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said: Mr. Speaker, from the outset, with your agreement in 
the House, I would like to inform you that I am going to split my 
time with the hon. member for Kings—Hants who is seconding this 
motion. I will then speak 10 minutes and, I understand, do 
questions and comments for five minutes and then he will speak. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I rise on this opposition day motion with some anticipation as 
we look forward to the budget that will be delivered here in this 
House on Tuesday, February 24. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have given a great deal of thought and have debated a great 
deal of the matters that we will be discussing today. I want to 
share with the House some of the views that we have in regard to 
the choices that we will be making in the next few weeks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to start from the outset by saying that for us in 
this party, this budget that we will see on February 24 is more 
than just about numbers. It is not just about a balance sheet. 
The budget exercise is not just reduced to just calculating what 
the numbers are and adding them up. All of this is about our 
country, about the values that we share within our families, our 
communities and the choices we will make for those communities in 
the future.  The budget will speak to that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also think it is important for us to have a cold hard look at 
the situation we are experiencing in this country economically 
and how it affects people, how it affects individuals in their 
lives. The government likes to quote all these economic 
indicators.  They get up in the House and the Minister of Finance 
talks about the OECD and how we are doing in terms of debt to GDP 
ratio or whatever it may be. All this also includes the impact 
that our decisions have on individual Canadians, on families. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the government talks of its record, I think it is important 
for all of us in this House to talk of all of the record.  What 
does this record include? It includes a record, a statistic that 
explains more than anything else the plight of Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact is that disposable income continues to go down in 
Canada. Simply put, we are poorer today than when the Liberal 
government was elected in 1993. Unemployment is still very high. 
Youth unemployment went up in the last month. Poverty is more 
pronounced today than it was. There are more children living in 
poverty today than in 1993. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians are saving less. On savings, 2% of their income is 
going to savings compared to 6% of the American average, 12% of 
what it was a few years ago. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we want to talk about the indicators, taxes in Canada are the 
highest taxes among the G-7 countries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I try to assess what the full record is of this government, 
I cannot help but compare it with the only economy we really 
compare with, which is the United States. In the United States 
the unemployment rate is half of what it is in Canada and 
disposable income is continually rising to the point where the 
gap has never been more pronounced, more important than it is 
today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me mention a statistic, a number that tells the story. In 
the third quarter of 1997 per capita after tax income in the U.S. 
was a bit more than $30,000 in Canadian funds. My colleagues will 
actually be surprised by this number. When you hear it the first 
time, you say it is not possible, but let me quote it to you 
directly, Mr. Speaker. “Per capita after tax income in Canada 
was a bit over $17,000”. That is a gap of $13,000 between Canada 
and the United States. 
These are our neighbours to the south, the people with whom we 
compete.  We should be on the same footing as they are, yet the 
gap is incredibly wide.  Why?  The wrong choices have been made.

</P>
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would say right off that the greatest problem facing us is 
that of the impoverishment of Canadians.  Men and women, in their 
family, in their day to day choices, are unable to make purchases. 
They are vastly poorer than they were in 1993. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are more poor children today than there were when this 
government was elected.  Unemployment among young people is at 
unacceptable levels. 
The gap between Canadian and American incomes continues to rise. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We believe in the Progressive Conservative Party that it is time 
this country had a plan for economic growth.  That is what we 
need. This country has been on its heels and on the brakes.  Now 
is the time we allow Canadians to earn more money.  If there is 
to be a balanced budget, if there is to be a fiscal dividend, we 
happen to believe the first people who should benefit from that 
are those who have made the biggest sacrifices in the last few 
years; individual Canadians and Canadian families deserve an 
increase in their revenues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I look at the whole record and see Canadians becoming 
poorer and poorer I cannot help but come to one solid, 
unequivocal conclusion.  If they have seen their revenue go down 
they deserve to see it now go up.  This should not be a foreign 
argument to the people in this House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Deputy Prime Minister said, after a report was published 
suggesting that the pay for members of Parliament and cabinet be 
increased, our pay has gone down long enough and we have lost 
revenue.  I do not quarrel with this, but if that is true for the 
Deputy Prime Minister then it must be true for the people who 
voted for the Deputy Prime Minister. This government should be 
able to understand that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What do we need to do if we are to allow our friends, our 
neighbours and the people in our families to begin getting the 
breaks they deserve?  The first thing we have to do is reduce 
taxes.  This country needs less taxes and less debt and, as a 
consequence, more jobs.  That is what will produce jobs in this 
country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to make our position clear.  From the outset in the 
election campaign we said very clearly that we do not need to 
wait for the budget to be balanced to offer Canadians tax breaks. 
They deserve them now.  What kind of tax breaks do they deserve? 
The first people who should benefit are lower income Canadians. 
We should increase the basic exemption from $6,500 to $10,000. 
They are the ones who can use it.  That would allow us to take 
thousands of Canadians off the tax rolls.  It would allow them to 
increase their revenues and give families with young children a 
very important break. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We continue to believe there should be a reduction in personal 
income taxes.  By the way, we are not the only ones who believe 
this.  There are more and more people, whether they are 
economists, think tanks or universities, saying it is time we 
gave Canadians a reduction in personal income taxes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need to reduce employment insurance premiums.  There is a $13 
billion surplus in the fund now for no good reason except to 
reduce the deficit which the fund was never designed for.  This 
is done at the expense of jobs and the unemployed.  I see the 
minister laughing.  He thinks it is laughable that Canadians are 
unemployed.  Now he is talking. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also believe it will be critically important for us to reduce 
taxes by eliminating the federal surtax of 3%.  The time has 
come.  That surtax came upon us because there was a deficit.  If 
the deficit is gone the tax should go. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also need to index the child tax benefits.  The government, 
by deindexing and allowing this to continue, is taking the 
equivalent of $160 million out of the pockets of lower income 
families and their children for the purpose of paying down the 
deficit.  We should return to indexing and introduce a little 
justice into the system.

<A HREF="#LINKT22"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also believe the time has come to reduce student debt.  The 
Prime Minister talks about the millennium fund. Every member of 
this House has heard about the number one priority for students 
today.  The member for St. John's West has heard about it.  He 
has done excellent work on the question of student interest debt 
on behalf of our party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a reason for this problem. The consequence of high 
taxes and high debt in this country has led us to a situation in 
which we are experiencing a brain drain like never before.  We 
are losing the best and brightest.  They are graduating with high 
debt levels and they are being offered jobs in the United States 
with higher pay, lower taxes and a higher standard of living. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The consequences for us in the long term development of Canada 
could be incalculable if we do not address this issue soon by 
reducing that debt and by reducing taxes. We should have concrete 
measures, including an interest tax credit and an initiative that 
will allow us to give a break to students who could reimburse on 
an income contingency loan program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will speak briefly on some other things we believe in, that we 
are going to make the right choices in terms of our values.  We 
believe we should modify the registered education savings plan to 
make the contribution tax deductible.  We should increase RRSP 
contributions.  Income tax brackets should be indexed in order to 
stop bracket creep which has brought one Canadian in five on to 
the tax rolls. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those are some very concrete ideas for Canada to have once and 
for all a plan for economic growth for all Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For clarification, the member for St. John's West is seconding 
this motion and not the member for Kings—Hants. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  The hon. member's correction is duly 
noted.  Questions and comments. 
<P><A NAME="LINK183"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Bryden (Wentworth—Burlington, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I compliment the Reform Party at this time.  Generally I 
find when Reformers make their points in debate, while sometimes 
wrongly thought out, they are always genuine, whereas the member 
for Sherbrooke has offered the scenario that because disposable 
income is going down, it is somehow the fault of this government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He knows disposable income is tied to economic health and he 
knows that the government of which he was a part ran up an annual 
deficit of $44 billion and a debt of $600 billion plus.  He knows 
full well that no government can turn that around overnight. 
This government has reduced the deficit and will reduce the 
deficit to zero.  Will he acknowledge that the situation of which 
he complains is his former government's fault? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Jean J. Charest:</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is interesting to 
hear the member talk about arguments being genuine.  Did he not 
promise to scrap the GST?  Is he not the person who promised his 
constituents he would scrap the GST?  Apparently he has 
discovered some new found righteousness in the position.  It is 
the same thing for helicopters. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us for a moment forget our partisan positions. I quote from 
a memo written to the Minister of Finance by Nesbitt Burns.  He 
would not assume that Nesbitt Burns is a partisan outfit, that it 
would have a view.  This was written to the minister with regard 
to advice for the upcoming budget: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>While the Liberals claim to have slain the deficit dragon 
without resorting to significant tax hikes, federal tax receipts 
have still climbed $25 billion over the past four years—courtesy 
of bracket creep, closed loopholes, and economic growth.  The 
flow-through impact from revenue measures of the past budgets 
will boost the tax bill by $2.6 billion this year alone. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>If there has been any economic growth in Canada it has not been 
domestic.  It is because of the free trade agreement established 
in 1988.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The same memo states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The tax wedge between the two countries has already widened to 
unprecedented levels. Allowing it to widen further would harm 
competitiveness, stifle job creation, and keep the Canadian 
dollar on the downtrend. These are not the ingredients for a 
revival in our country's living standards.  There is also strong 
evidence that the growing tax gap is prompting record numbers of 
high income Canadian professionals to move south of the 
border—particularly doctors, educators and engineers. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is from major financial institution in the country.  That 
is the response it is giving to this Liberal member. Rather than 
whine and complain, I hope he would face up to these hard 
realities and offer those who are suffering in this country 
answers instead of trying to blame everything on another 
government that was defeated in 1993. 
<P><A NAME="LINK184"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gary Lunn (Saanich—Gulf Islands, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I would like to commend the leader of the Tory Party for 
this motion.  We are on the eve of a new budget that will be 
coming down within a few days.  This is an issue that I hope all 
members will take dear to their hearts.  It is a very important 
one. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We talk about the brain drain and I hear people laugh at that. 
It is for real.  I have to agree with the leader.  I was visiting 
family over the weekend.  In speaking with my brother-in-law, 
they are actively pursuing employment south of the border.  These 
are people who were born in Canada, lived in Canada and have been 
here all their lives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Jean J. Charest:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. 
member for his kind words.  He did not say them in any partisan 
tone.  I hope the whole debate is that way.  What he says is 
pretty compelling.  When it is a brother-in-law and a member of 
the family, we cannot pretend these are statistics any more.  It 
is happening. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What I am worried about is I see 80% of the graduating students 
at the University of Waterloo moving to the United States.  Who 
bears the cost of that education?  Who goes through all that? 
Why do they leave?  Simple math.  It is higher pay, lower taxes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals can laugh all they want.  I see them laughing on 
the other side.  I do not think it is a laughing matter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  The hon. member will appreciate that 
his time is expired. 
<P><A NAME="LINK185"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Scott Brison (Kings—Hants, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, good 
government means looking ahead.  Good government means 
recognizing trends, especially in a global environment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The PC government recognized the global trends and brought this 
country free trade, the deregulation of financial services, 
transportation and energy, which enabled Canadians to compete 
nationally and internationally.  The Liberal government inherited 
a country that was poised globally to compete and to succeed. It 
could have invested in Canadians. It could have provided 
opportunities for Canadians to succeed. Instead of allowing 
Canadians to embrace the future, the Liberal cuts to health and 
education transfers handcuffed young Canadians to the past. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The 280% growth in student debt has been a significant yolk, a 
significant burden on all young Canadians.  The loss is to 
Canada.  When are young people are graduating with a $25,000 
student debt after a four year program, that is a loss to all of 
Canada.  If we look at the reasons why Canadians are going south 
of the border and young people are pursuing their dreams 
elsewhere, we have to recognize that student debt and high taxes 
in Canada are directly related to that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The February 14 issue of the <I>Globe and Mail</I> said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is evidence that the heavier tax burden, combined with 
lower overall incomes in this country is putting in motion a 
brain drain of our most productive workers.  Higher tax loads 
mean bureaucrats substituting their judgment for that of business 
people and workers on how their income is to be spent. That is no 
recipe for productivity growth. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is not about partisanship.  This is about what is best for 
Canadians.  I hope all members of this House support this motion 
because it is extraordinarily important that we take a 
non-partisan perspective on an issue as important as brain 
draining.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Like a lot of families in Atlantic Canada over the past 30 
years, my family and I have watched the phenomenon of brain 
drain.  We have watched our young people move to central Canada, 
for instance, to seek opportunities.  It is very sad. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This phenomenon now exists throughout Canada.  When the finance 
minister or any of these members fail to acknowledge the issue, 
when they look into that camera they are looking into the eyes of 
mothers and fathers in Atlantic Canada who are losing members of 
their families.  They are losing their children.  They are going 
away.  The romantic thought that they will return some day just 
does not happen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have always talked about our standard of living in Canada and 
the quality of life our health and social programs provide us. 
With the right income that can be bought elsewhere.  That is 
exactly what is happening. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Eighty per cent of Waterloo computer science graduates are now 
going to the U.S.  There is a standing offer by Microsoft for 
Waterloo computer science graduates.  Why?   It recognizes the 
talent we have in Canada and that the Canadian economy will not 
provide the same level of incentive and opportunity for young 
people as the U.S. economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us look at some of the other issues in the U.S.  On average, 
American manufacturing workers are paid $1 more per hour than 
Canadians.  Effectively Canadians are paying one-third more in 
income taxes than Americans.  The U.S. savings rate has remained 
steady at about 6%.  That is about three times what Canadians 
have been able to save. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The budget will be about choices and we feel very strongly that 
those choices should be with Canadians.  The Minister of Finance 
did not balance the books.  The books were balanced by Canadians 
who have made significant sacrifices in their lives over the past 
four years.  It is those Canadians who now deserve an opportunity 
to build their futures and to invest in their families, their 
educations and their homes in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our registered education savings plan would provide tax 
deductibility.  It is very similar to the structure of the RRSP. 
It would provide Canadians with more flexibility to save for 
their dreams, dreams that are important to them and their 
children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is the type of policy we are looking for and would like to 
see in the upcoming budget.  We do not need the gigantic 
traditional Liberal policy of bringing forward some sexy program 
like the millennium scholarship program which will effectively do 
more for the Prime Minister's legacy than it will for young 
Canadians who are graduating at this point with significant debt 
load. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need tax reduction.  We are speaking about increasing the 
basic personal exemption from $6,500 to $10,000.  Why should a 
Canadian making $8,000 per year be paying taxes?  We have to ask 
ourselves that hard question.  Why should a family that is below 
the poverty line be paying income taxes?  It is fundamentally 
wrong.  It is creating a direct disincentive to work and 
employment.  It is similar to EI premiums which the government 
has refused to deal with in a significant way.  We believe they 
should be set at about $2 as opposed to $2.70. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Payroll taxes, EI premiums and the CPP tax grab the government 
has implemented are the biggest impediments to job growth in 
Canada.  High taxes kill jobs and the most insidious tax as a job 
killer is the payroll tax. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That has been demonstrated internationally.  Policy does not 
need to be created in a vacuum.  We can look at other countries 
and how they have succeeded.  Let me say that high taxes kill 
jobs in any jurisdiction that practises them.  In a global 
environment we do not have the luxury of taxing our citizenry to 
death because when we do it we are preventing them from 
participating in economic growth and prosperity in a global 
environment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we enter the 21st century what would be the best policy to 
ensure that our young people are able to compete in a global 
knowledge based environment?  It is one that provides them with 
opportunities to seek and receive education and to succeed within 
their own countries.

the continued government policy of high taxes has an impact on

seriously.  I hope they will come to their senses and support

the motion and ensure the policies we generate as

handcuff them to the past. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  The amendment to the motion is in order. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Bryden:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order.

because the Conservative government eliminated the manufacturers' 
sales tax and replaced it with a consumption tax, the GST, which 
made more sense in a global environment and his party committed 
to ripping it up.

that the motion we are debating is a rather encouraging motion.

taxes.

income tax systems.  In Canada we have a child tax benefit which 
is outside the tax system.  We also have a GST credit which is

services that we pay in our tax system which is not covered in 
the U.S. by its tax system.  In addition, the social fabric of 
the U.S. does not respect—

many good reasons why Canadians should stay in Canada, he should 
be speaking to all the Canadians who are leaving Canada.  He 
obviously knows something that ordinary Canadians do not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians are making decisions and voting with their feet.  They 
are going to the U.S. because the level of taxation is lower.  If 
they want a standard of living, they can buy it down there.  This

four years is denying Canadians the quality health care they need 
in Canada.

Speaker, I am pleased to have an opportunity to speak to the 
motion.  It will allow me to talk about some of the economic 
progress the government has been able to achieve with Canadians 
over the last four years.  It will also give me an opportunity to 
deal with the absolute, total and complete hypocrisy of the Tory 
Party that put forward the motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Tories have a very selective memory.  I do not blame hon. 
members every time it is brought up for saying “Let's not talk 
about that.  We will just point toward the future”.

<A HREF="#LINKT27"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many of the challenges we have in the future are the result of 
their total incompetency in managing the Canadian economy for the 
nine years in which they were in power.  In fact it is to the 
point that back in 1994, shortly after we had taken over, the 
<I>Wall Street Journal</I> described what the Tory government had 
done to this country by saying that Canada was then a candidate 
for membership in the third world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is a party which with the very words of its motion says 
volumes about the way it thinks.  The Conservatives do not look 
to the historic progress Canada has achieved over the last 50 
years in creating social policy that is the envy of the world. 
No, they do not look toward that. What they look toward is the 
United States. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Conservatives look to the model of the United States.  It is 
a model where we see millions of people without health care.  It 
is a model where they create employment by simply driving down 
minimum wages so that people are not able to live on those wages. 
It is a country where the inner cities are totally crumbling. 
That is the model that party points to and it totally ignores 
what this nation has been able to accomplish. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>More important, when we talk about a party that does not honour 
Canada, that is the party which just last week in this House 
totally abandoned the interests of Canada and voted with the 
separatists.  It abandoned Canadians.  That is what that party 
across the way did last week.  It is total hypocrisy.  I am sorry 
to use that word again, Mr. Speaker, but that is what that party 
did. What does not help the country is voting with the 
separatists. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But let us return to the debate. This debate is about what 
Canada has in fact been able to achieve over the last few years. 
Again, there is faulty memory. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Tories came to power. And they are right. There was a 
deficit.  It was around $38 billion in 1984.  Boy, they worked to 
bring it down.  They had policies to bring that deficit down. 
They were going to clean up the finances of the country.  They 
inherited $38 billion and what was it when they left nine years 
later?  Had they eliminated it?  Had they made progress on it? 
Yes, they made progress right up to $41 billion. That is the 
progress that they made. In the process of doing that they more 
than doubled the national debt. That is the type of progress the 
Tory party made in terms of controlling the deficit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The balance sheet is not the only thing we ought to be looking 
at.  I know the Tories certainly do not want to look at it.  In 
half the time it managed to go from that $42 billion deficit 
which we inherited to a point, and I will quote the finance 
minister who I believe said “on the cusp of a balanced budget”. 
That is $38 billion to $41 billion in eight years and $42 
billion to zero in four. I think the Canadian people were quite 
appropriate in the choices they made back in 1997. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us look at another important measure which is the 
measurement of job creation in the last four and a half years. We 
have made some progress but it is certainly not enough yet. 
Unemployment is at 8.9% although that is a lot better than the 
11.2% when we took office.  It is still not good enough and more 
progress does have to be made. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us make that comparison in job creation.  In the first 51 
months of this government's mandate there has been over one 
million net new jobs created in this country.  Most are in the 
private sector and most are full time.  What happened in the last 
four years of the Tory government?  We saw much the same progress 
as we saw on the deficit, a 58,000 decrease in net new jobs in 
this country in that period. Let us compare the record:  58,000 
jobs lost, or over a million jobs created. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think Canadians understand that the economic policies of this 
government have meant progress for Canada.  Increasingly better 
economic ideas have meant a better country economically for the 
people of Canada.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us talk about taxation for a minute. We believe in reducing 
taxes. In fact the last budget saw a number of significant tax 
decreases. But they were tax decreases, not as the Tory party 
suggests across the board where those who earn more get a bigger 
tax break, they were targeted tax decreases. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They were tax decreases that were important to Canadians who 
needed it.  For example, $850 million to low and middle income 
Canadians with children. Tax reductions for Canadians with 
disabilities. Tax reductions for Canadians making charitable 
donations. Tax reductions to help individuals pursue 
post-secondary education. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We believe in applying principles when it comes to tax 
reductions. One of the most important ones is that low and middle 
income Canadians will benefit first from tax reduction. Second, 
tax reductions will be provided when we have the surpluses to 
provide them, not by going out and borrowing the money as the 
Tory party has suggested we do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us just talk about one particular tax reduction the Tories 
did suggest during the campaign. I want everybody to listen to 
this because this is almost unbelievable. The Tories suggested 
that corporate income tax would be reduced from 28% to 24%. That 
is right in their platform. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What would that mean?  That would mean that those paupers of 
Canadian society, those hard done by people in Canadian society, 
the Canadian financial institutions, the Canadian banks, would 
receive a $300 million tax reduction under the Tory plan. That is 
what they were suggesting, that we reduce taxes for Canadian 
banks by $300 million. That is their idea of progressive tax 
reduction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians saw the type of ideas that they were trying to put 
forward and they were not fooled. Canadians understand something 
and they understand it well. Although we continue to have 
difficulties in this country, and we do—I do not think anybody 
in this House would suggest that we do not—Canadians understand 
that the policies of this government have worked to improve the 
situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We took over in 1993 at a time when the previous government had 
put this country close to economic ruin. We have restored the 
health of the nation's finances.  We have seen employment 
increase. We have historically low interest rates as compared to 
the Americans. We have a sustained low inflation rate that is the 
envy of the industrialized world.  In fact we have had economic 
growth in the last 12 months near the very top of the OECD. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is one conclusion that Canadians have, and that is that 
the Tories' incompetency in managing the financial affairs of 
this nation is matched only by their audacity in trying to 
re-write history. 
<P><A NAME="LINK192"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Scott Brison (Kings—Hants, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the 
hon. member has a penchant for quoting publications. It is a 
penchant I share as well. One of the publications I enjoy is the 
<I>Economist</I>.  For $172 a year he could be similarly well 
informed.  And that is in Canadian dollars by the way, which 
makes it even better value now that the dollar has been so weak. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The <I>Economist</I> on the deficit issue and the elimination of 
the deficit in its 1998 preview said that the credit belongs to 
structural changes made in the early 1990s. It listed free trade, 
GST, deregulation of financial services, transportation and 
energy.  You know, the national energy program.  Members opposite 
may remember that.

deluded himself in believing that the management of the economy 
between 1984 and 1993 was so great, but Canadians did not buy it. 
They did not buy it in 1993 when there were two Conservative 
members and they did not buy much more of it in 1997 when there 
were only 20 of them. They understand what was there.  Employment 
down 100,000.  Real disposable income down one and a half points. 
Real disposable income per capita down 6.6%.  Canadians 
understand. 
<P><A NAME="LINK193"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Werner Schmidt (Kelowna, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am 
really quite intrigued by the comments made by previous speaker, 
the member who made the presentation.  I thought this motion 
related to students and keeping brains in Canada.  I thought it 
was concerned with identifying reasons for losing them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I refer the hon. member to his own record and the record of the 
government at this time.  In successive budgets the government 
has reduced the money available for science and technology, in 
particular for research and development and especially basic 
research. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would the member be prepared to address the question of how we 
could keep our brains in this country and provide them with the 
research infrastructure that is so necessary to develop and 
advance knowledge? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Andy Mitchell:</B>  Mr. Speaker, in the last budget we 
saw the foundation for innovation, an $800 million investment 
into exactly that type of thing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the last budget a series of measures were introduced to help 
Canadians pursuing post-secondary education.  There was an 
expansion of the registered education savings plan; 100% increase 
in the education tax credit; changes in the tax system to allow a 
carry forward of the tuition deduction; expansion of the tuition 
deduction; and the interest relief period being increased from 18 
months to 30 months.  When added to the original six months, the 
period becomes three years. This government has taken very 
specific measures. 
<P><A NAME="LINK194"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mike Scott (Skeena, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I truly 
never thought I would be sitting in this Chamber listening to the 
Liberals and the Tories bragging about who ran up the best 
national debt.  I cannot believe it. But the member has a point. 
In 1984 Mr. Mulroney was elected with a landslide on the promise 
to do something about the debt.  He had nine years to do it and 
he did not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With the concern about the brain drain that is coming from the 
Tories, would the member not agree that the brain drain has 
already occurred, that the people with any brains have left the 
Tories and joined the Reform Party? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  I will take that as a comment rather than as 
a question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Andy Mitchell:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I will not get involved 
in the courting of the Reform Party and the Tory Party.  I will 
let them deal with that on their own. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The record is very clear. This government has managed to bring 
the deficit probably down to zero.  We will know next week if we 
have reached zero or if we are just short of it.  We have made a 
commitment to debt reduction and tax reduction.  We will invest 
in the types of programs Canadians believe in. Programs related 
to education, job creation and health care are the kinds of 
investments Canadians have asked us to make and those are the 
investments we will make. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  Resuming debate, the hon. member for 
Medicine Hat.  I erroneously told him he had 20 minutes.  He has 
10 minutes to speak. 
<P><A NAME="LINK195"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it 
is a pleasure to rise and speak to this motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The members of the Conservative Party have raised an important 
issue.  They have referred to relieving Canadians of the onerous 
tax burden in Canada today.  They have spoken of interest relief 
on student loans, an important issue, the brain drain crisis 
which is forcing Canadians to move to the United States where 
they have lower unemployment rates, income tax rates and student 
debt levels.  The Conservatives have also referred to the fact 
that the standard of living in Canada has fallen like a stone in 
the last several years.  The standard of living is now 25% higher 
in the United States than it is in Canada.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are important issues.  I am glad my friends across the way 
in the Conservative Party have raised them.  I do believe that 
when we address these issues and talk about them, we have to talk 
about them in the context of who is best able to address them. 
When we are in Parliament we are supposed to be providing 
leadership to the country.  That is a pretty important point. The 
only way to determine that is to look at the records of the 
various parties in the House of Commons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My friend from Skeena pointed out that we had the Liberals 
and the Conservatives fighting over who had done the best job of 
managing the economy.  It is an interesting spectacle, a little 
like sending an arsonist out to fight a fire. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this case let us review the historical record. Let us start 
on the issue that is most obvious.  Let us look at the national 
debt.  There is the absolute record as to the ability of 
successive governments to keep their spending in line. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we have seen since the early 1970s is the federal debt rise 
from about $13 billion.  It took a 100 years for the debt to 
accumulate to $13 billion.  Starting at that point, under the 
Liberal government, we saw the debt start to mount and mount.  It 
went up and up for years.  When the Liberal government left 
office in 1984, it was in the range of $160 billion to $170 
billion. In that short period of time, over a dozen years, it had 
mounted to somewhere in the range of $140 billion.  It had gone 
up a tremendous amount. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1984 Canadians across the country said they had had it. They 
did not want to have anymore debt.  They were tired of this 
government getting ever bigger, providing all kinds of programs 
that amounted to intervention in people's lives.  They were tired 
of the mounting tax burden that was necessary to feed this 
voracious government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At that point they decided to elect the Conservatives.  They 
said they would give the Conservatives a try.  In Alberta a lot 
of us put our faith wrongly in the Conservatives.  We had 
Conservatives around the cabinet table from Alberta.  We thought 
that perhaps now we will finally have some sanity when it comes 
to making economic decisions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What happened?  We saw the debt continue to mount.  We said in 
Alberta with one voice you have to stop this.  But the debt 
continued to mount.  Pretty soon, by the end of the nine year 
mandate of the Conservatives, it had gone up $300 billion.  These 
are facts that occurred under a government that is supposed to be 
conservative.  What does conservative mean?  What does it mean in 
that context.  If it is there to protect the finances of the 
country and be conservative with people's money, obviously 
it did not do it.  We saw the debt mount by $300 billion under 
its watch alone.  Obviously it was not the answer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Liberals jump in and say they have done a wonderful job.  They 
have added another $100 billion to the debt.  Now we get to the 
point in the country where the government is balancing the budget 
on the backs of taxpayers and on the backs of the provinces by 
cuts to health care and social programs. What is their plan? 
Their plan, after 30 years of deficits, is to start spending 
again.  I find that extraordinarily frightening. It is absolutely 
imprudent.  It is reckless.  Furthermore, it betrays a trust that 
the government should have established with Canadian taxpayers 
which is that it recognizes and understands how much taxpayers 
are suffering today under staggering debtloads. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Conservative Party has pointed out that the standard of 
living in Canada has fallen like a stone.  It started under the 
Conservatives. We should point that out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I refer to an article in the Ottawa <I>Citizen</I> from December 
where World Bank statistics show the standard of living in Canada 
for decades was on par with the United States.  For per capital 
income we were two and three in the world.  Ten years ago it 
started to fall.  Canada has fallen from third spot to twelfth 
spot in the world.  I am amazed that this has not been more of an 
issue today.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Sadly, for reasons I do not understand, a lot of people have not 
picked up on this.  The fact is the very people this government 
is supposed to be serving are suffering tremendously under 
Liberal and Tory governments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The article talks about the difference in unemployment rates. 
It points out that the real unemployment rate in Canada is 18.5% 
counting all the people who are discouraged and who have given up 
looking for work.  I know my friends opposite will talk about job 
creation.  They have created some jobs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, imagine if we would have kept the participation rate 
the same as it had been 15 years ago in the economy in terms of 
people participating and looking for jobs.  We would have a 
million more jobs today than we have. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I simply want to say that what we have heard here today is an 
argument between two different political parties that have both 
demonstrated by their actions that they are completely unable to 
grasp the concerns of Canadians and to do anything about it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now we are here today in a situation where we have a huge debt, 
$600 billion, where the average per family debt is $77,600. We 
have a situation where Canadians pay income taxes, taxes of 
$6,000 a year just to pay the interest on the debt. That is what 
the average family has to pay.  The average family in Canada 
today pays $21,000 in taxes, more than what it puts out for food, 
shelter and clothing combined. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Surely it will start to dawn on my friends in the Liberal Party 
and certainly on my friends in the Conservative Party after the 
horrible government they brought us that we must start to reverse 
this trend. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why I was so disappointed to hear the finance minister 
say in an interview on CBC that they are not going to keep their 
50:50 promise, tepid though it was, to start to reduce debt a 
bit, to start to pay down taxes a bit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They said “no, really we meant it for later on and now what we 
want to do is start spending”.  I think that is unbelievable. 
Perhaps the worst thing of all about this is the people who are 
most vulnerable in Canada today pay the highest price. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am talking about low income people, people who do not have a 
lot of skills in many cases.  These are the people who are paying 
the highest price.  My leader in December pointed out that he had 
received a letter from a family in New Brunswick trying to get by 
on $32,000, a pretty modest income. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those people were doing their level best.  They decided that the 
mother in the family would stay at home to look after their four 
children because they believed their children were more precious 
than anything.  They were barely making it.  They were still 
paying $3,000 a year in federal income tax. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The answer is to come to grips with the fact that this debt is 
killing the country, it is hurting people and we should start to 
pay it down. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we do that, the interest payments drop and then we can start 
to cut taxes.  We can ease the tax burden on low income 
Canadians.  That is the answer to helping Canadians.  It is the 
answer to keeping more Canadians in the country instead of seeing 
them flow south of the border as my friends have pointed out.  We 
need to start doing that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The answer is not more government programs.  Surely by now, 
after 30 years of spending evermore, we will come to grips with 
that important point. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I urge my friends on the other side to vote in favour of this 
motion so that we may once again return to that tradition in 
Canada that we had of limited government and people who can stand 
on their own two feet.

changed on tax cuts.  In the past it spoke continuously about across 
the board tax cuts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want him to tell us unequivocally, without budging, nudging or 
fudging, whether he still supports across the board tax reduction 
or whether he will support the government's balanced approach to 
reducing taxes for select people who need the tax reduction while 
maintaining spending on our social programs.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Monte Solberg:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the answer is of course 
we support broad based tax relief, absolutely.  We have made that 
very clear.  We have offered up in our latest document $20 
billion in tax relief that would help all Canadians because all 
Canadians have suffered under successive Liberal and Tory 
governments.  We had 71 tax increases under the Conservatives and 
37 now under the Liberals, including the CPP tax hike which is 
going to hurt the most vulnerable Canadians.  The government 
should be ashamed of that action. 
<P><A NAME="LINK197"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Scott Brison (Kings—Hants, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
agree with the hon. member that government spending is not the 
answer to the problems of Canada.  That is why I am concerned 
about the big government spending programs like the millennium 
scholarship fund. That is why the Conservative government reduced 
government program spending growth from over 15% per year to 
around 0% growth by the time our government was defeated in 1993. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My question for the hon. member is related to regional economic 
development.  Our party believes in a strong market based economy 
that all Canadians have access to the levers of and can 
participate in the economic growth.  That means we need regional 
economic development programs in some regions of the country in 
order to ensure equality of opportunity.  I would like to know 
the member's position on regional economic development programs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Monte Solberg:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I think that is a fair 
question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our belief is that regional development programs have failed 
miserably.  If they had worked people in Atlantic Canada would 
have all the jobs in the world, but they have not worked. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We take a different approach. We believe first that we should 
lower taxes across the country.  In fact, our tax relief package 
would deliver over $1 billion in tax relief to Atlantic Canada 
every year.  That would do a lot more for Atlantic Canada than a 
bunch of patronage programs which simply pass out pork to loyal 
party supporters of various political parties.  It just has not 
worked in the past. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second point we would make is the federal government has an 
important role to play judgment in ensuring that the 
transportation infrastructure of the country is in good shape. I 
think that Atlantic Canada of all places needs to have its 
infrastructure improved, not by giving it to Doug Young, not by 
giving hundreds of millions of dollars or $32 million to people 
like Doug Young, but to ensure that it goes to the—

the hon. member for Medicine Hat in his support for the motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member repeatedly said the debt should have priority.  He 
said that over and over again.  Yet when we look at the motion it 
does not discuss debt at all.  It discusses only tax cuts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I cannot understand why the member for Medicine Hat would want 
to support the motion when his own leader has said that debt 
reduction has priority, yet this motion gives priority to tax 
cuts.  Is he not in a contradiction here? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Monte Solberg:</B>  Mr. Speaker, obviously we did not 
write the motion.  It is not perfect but I think at least it goes 
in the right direction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have been in a situation where we have seen taxes go up 71 
times under the Conservatives, 37 times under the Liberals. I 
will not belabour the House with the horrible Liberal record.  I 
think it is time we offered Canadians some tax relief and freed 
them from the horrible burden that both Liberal and Tory 
governments have placed on them.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mike Scott (Skeena, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I will try 
keep my question short. I congratulate my friend on a great 
intervention.  I think he put it forward very well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to ask him if he would consider that the problem 
here is a conflict of vision, a conflict between the Liberal-Tory 
view of Canada in which we have to have a nanny federal 
government that congers up a new program, a new spending 
initiative for every problem that comes along, and Reform's 
vision of a smaller, more focused federal government which lets 
the provinces and municipalities do more for themselves.

</I></B></P><P align=left>We feel that present student debt levels are horrendous, and 
that a solution must be found that respects the fact that education 
and assistance to students is a provincial jurisdiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will leave it to my colleague, the member for Lac-Saint-Jean, 
to speak to this issue and, in the nine minutes remaining, I will 
focus on two other concerns addressed in the motion: Canada's 
high rate of taxation compared to that of the United States, and 
the issue of unemployment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The tax burden of Quebeckers and Canadians has always been a 
great concern of the Bloc Quebecois. 
Since our arrival in 1993, we have called on the government to take 
another look at individual and corporate taxation, which has not 
been reviewed since the late 1960s. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It must be made fairer and the tax burden on low and middle 
income members of the public reduced.  Corporate taxation must be 
amended so that tax resources now available in the form of 
unwarranted benefits, particularly for very large companies, are 
shifted towards SMBs, which are the real source of new jobs, so as 
to lighten their tax burden and stimulate employment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Two years ago, we released a 300-page detailed analysis of 
Canadian taxation, the first since the late 1960s, as I was saying. 
This analysis says essentially the following: we have the means, if 
we dust off the Canadian tax system, to reduce the tax burden on 
low and medium income taxpayers by $3 billion, each year.  We are 
talking about a $3 billion reduction in taxes on the incomes of low 
and medium income households. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also concluded from this in depth analysis that we could 
move $4 billion of the current tax burden, of taxes not paid by the 
major corporations.  We could take these savings and move them over 
to the SMBs.  We are talking about $4 billion, and there would $2 
billion left over, which could go to really reducing taxes on small 
and medium businesses and on the very small businesses, known as 
the VSBs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Two weeks ago as well, we released a statement on what we 
expected in the upcoming budget of the Minister of Finance. 
On the subject of reducing the tax burden, we asked the Minister of 
Finance, as we did last June in the election, to reduce it for 
individuals by fully indexing tax tables. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Indexing has not been used since 1985 and brought in nearly an 
extra half billion dollars to the government the first year the 
practice was stopped.  Since then, with inflation every year, 
billions of dollars are at stake. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If tax tables were indexed again, taxpayers would have an 
additional $2 billion in their pockets as tax refunds in the first 
year.  Two billion dollars is not trifling matter. 
Only with a return to indexing, which should be standard practice, 
since otherwise it is a disguised tax, can we avoid making middle 
income earners pay more income tax than their fair share. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also sought a targeted reduction in the tax burden in order 
to lower it from its very high level for businesses in Quebec and 
Canada.  The best target at the moment, which could enable us to 
give a boost to job creation, is the level of contributions to the 
employment insurance fund.  These levels are far too high for 
employers and employees and are seen as hindering job creation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the forecasts of the Minister of Finance are right, this 
year, there will be a $7 billion surplus in the employment 
insurance fund, which will not go to job creation and to increasing 
benefits to those hit by the scourge of unemployment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the coming years, the federal government will have the 
means to make targeted reductions to the tax burdens of Quebeckers 
and Canadians.

<A HREF="#LINKT34"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why? If the Minister of Finance gives us the real numbers—over 
the past four years, let us say that his forecasts have been far 
too pessimistic—gives us figures that are a little more 
realistic, we will see that, starting this year, or in other 
words the fiscal year ending next March 31, there will be a 
recorded surplus of about $2.3 billion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Starting next year, that is to say the fiscal year starting 
April 1, 1998 and ending March 31, 1999, there will be an 
accumulated surplus of $9.5 billion.  In 2001-2002, if we make it 
till then, the surplus will be over $30 billion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are not forecasts pulled out of thin air, as the Finance 
Minister has often accused us of doing, then confirming our figures 
himself within a few months.  These are forecasts based on very 
conservative hypotheses, conservative in the non-political sense, 
on the rate of economic growth, the inflation rate, the input of 
new receipts compared to the average for the last four years.  As 
I have said, that puts us at a surplus of $30 billion for the year 
2001-2002. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Finance has an excellent opportunity to reduce 
the tax burden and, if he cleans up the taxation system as well, he 
will be able to free up still other surpluses to be applied to 
reducing taxpayers' burden and to job creation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Finance will be in an even better position to 
reduce this tax burden if he does not implement new initiatives in 
areas that are already under provincial jurisdiction, which would 
only increase inefficiency. I am thinking of initiatives in areas 
like education, health and so on, in which the minister has no 
business interfering.  The federal government does not have 
jurisdiction over education or health, and ought not to be 
implementing new initiatives such as those announced during the 
election campaign and in the throne speech. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are going to fight against the inefficiency of new 
initiatives by the federal government in areas already covered by 
the provinces.  And, while we are on the topic of such initiatives, 
it could, as requested by Canada's premiers at the last first 
ministers' conference, give back to the provinces what it has taken 
away from them over the past four years, and what it is getting 
ready to take away between now and 2003. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us not forget—and I hope that people who are listening 
today and who tune in for next week's budget will remember—that, 
in 1994, when the Minister of Finance brought down his budget, he 
unveiled a plan to cut federal transfers to the provinces in the 
areas of social assistance, post-secondary eduction and health. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These cuts will take place every year until 2003. 
He mentioned it only once in 1994, but these cuts will be going on 
until 2003.  Between now and then, the federal government will cut 
$42 billion in provincial transfer payments in these three sectors. 
Now, he has just announced that it will no longer be $48 billion in 
cuts by 2003, but only $42 billion.  But that is another story. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We therefore support the Progressive Conservative Party's 
motion, because it looks at three major concerns.  First, student 
debt levels, which are shocking, given that education is said to be 
the cornerstone of nations; second, we will be fighting for a 
reduction in the tax burden; and, third, we will be supporting the 
Conservatives' motion because it addresses the horrendous problem 
of job creation.

note the member said he supported the motion so I would like to 
ask him about something which relates to the provincial 
jurisdiction of education. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member will know that the motion proposes interest relief on 
student debt.  The facts put on the table were that the average 
student debt load was some $25,000 a year.  The facts did not 
state that only one-quarter of all university graduates have any 
debt at all.  We are talking about a small number. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For me the issue is accessibility, not the servicing of debt 
after they have a job. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member will also know that the unemployment rate for 
unemployed youth who have a university degree is only 6.5%. 
For all Canadians who have a university degree the unemployment 
rate is only 4.5%.  The motion addresses university students and 
graduates who will have the best opportunities of all our youth.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The question I have for the member relates to youth unemployment 
of which 52% are high school dropouts.  They have an average 
unemployment rate of some 23%.  The dropout rate in Quebec is 
over 30%.  If education is provincial jurisdiction in Quebec, 
what is he proposing be done to deal with high school dropouts 
which amount to more than 30% in the province of Quebec? 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvan Loubier:</B> Mr. Speaker, what I am proposing is very 
simple.  Since the Liberals came to power in 1993, the average debt 
level of students in Canada has nearly doubled.  Is there not a 
connection somewhere between this government's policies and 
students' average debt level?  I think it is easy to figure out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The planned cuts I mentioned in the conclusion to my speech 
just now, which were initially to cut $48 billion in social 
transfers between 1994 and 2003, primarily in post-secondary 
education—in health and social assistance, but in education as 
well—say it all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We cannot cut billions in the education sector year after year 
and think that governments across Canada will be able to absorb all 
these expenditures without an impact on tuition fees and on student 
debt levels. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What would I do in their shoes?  First, I would start by 
minding my own business.  Education is an area of provincial 
jurisdiction.  Second, I would cancel the cuts planned between now 
and 2003 in the education sector. 
It seems to me that that would be the first step, if I were 
concerned about improving the situation for students and the level 
of education across Canada.  I would give back to the provinces 
what the government took away from them for education.  This will 
help people and will not be a strictly political gesture to get 
some visibility as federalists.

Leaving all the politics aside, it is fine for the government 
side to say that you did this in 1984, but the reality is that we 
are now in 1998 and taxes are choking the country, choking our 
youth.  I hear examples of it over and over again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am speaking in support of the motion.  I wish I had 10 minutes 
but I do not, so I cannot make a lot of points.  However, I want 
to say that we must have a tax system which ensures people stay 
in the country and which works for all Canadians. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvan Loubier:</B> Mr. Speaker, to echo what my colleague has 
just said, the Minister of Finance seems more interested in passing 
legislation to his own benefit than lowering the tax burden on 
Canadians.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Nelson Riis (Kamloops, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to have a chance to participate in today's debate.  The 
motion reads: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That, in the opinion of this House, the government should lower 
the tax burden on Canadians and offer interest relief to student 
loan holders in order to address the brain drain crisis which is 
forcing Canadians to move to the United States where unemployment 
rates, income tax rates and student debt levels are lower and the 
standard of living is 25 per cent higher than in Canada. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>When it comes to a vote we in the New Democratic Party will vote 
against the motion.  To me it does not make much sense at all.  I 
am not saying it is totally wrong but it does not make much 
sense. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, the motion refers to the brain drain.  Do we actually 
have a brain drain in this country?  Interestingly enough 
Statistics Canada says that we do not.  In a recent report from 
Statistics Canada, according to Mr. Ivan Fellegi, the so-called 
brain drain is in fact a brain gain. 
He acknowledges that Canadian skilled workers are leaving the 
country, with 11,000 knowledge workers having left Canada in 
1995, 5,600 to the U.S. of which 1,600 were doctors and nurses. 
But evidence shows that there is a net brain gain if one 
considers that Canada has more immigration of skilled workers 
from the rest of the world than it loses to the United States and 
other countries.

from the rest of the world. In 1996, 42,600 knowledge workers 
came to Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Participants in a recent C.D. Howe Institute conference 
examining this issue concluded that there was no particular 
problem in Canada with a brain drain. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is fair to say that the evidence—and I think all of us will 
acknowledge that Statistics Canada is probably one of the best 
statistics gathering centres in the world—tells us that part of 
the premise of this motion is actually incorrect.  So set that 
aside. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As my friend across the way indicated, student debt problems are 
certainly very serious for tens of thousands of young people, but 
access to higher education is probably even a greater issue that 
we should confront. We have to find ways and means of easing the 
debt burden so many young people have accumulated as a result of 
pursuing their higher education goals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wonder if it is not time for us as a nation to get bold and 
actually strike away the whole issue of having tuition fees at 
all. This is not a particularly unique idea. Sixteen of the OECD 
countries already are tuition free. The majority of OECD 
countries have tuition free colleges and universities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A few years ago as a society we determined that a grade 12 
education was what was required to be a contributing citizen in 
the economy of the time. I think all of us would agree that grade 
12 is now the minimal standard. Probably grade 16 or grade 18 
makes more sense in terms of what is required to become a 
contributing citizen in the knowledge based economy of the 21st 
century. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why not have tuition free universities and colleges? I think my 
friends in the Reform Party—although I stand to be 
corrected—are proposing tax cuts to the tune of $2.6 billion. 
What is interesting is that that is the exact amount of money 
Canadians spend on tuition fees each year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have a choice. This is what the business of politics is all 
about. Do we give across the board tax cuts of $2.6 billion to 
everyone, rich as well, or do we invest it in education and 
training for Canadians?  That is the fundamental question we have 
here between political parties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We say we should invest it in young people. We should invest it 
in Canadians. We should invest it in the human resources of the 
country.  It is fair to say it would be the best investment one 
could make, as other countries have already determined. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another point however is that tuition fees account for about 
$2.7 billion annually. If we were to introduce an inheritance 
tax, which virtually every industrialized country in the world 
has with the exception of Canada and one or two others, and we 
exempted the first $1 million in inheritance and taxed only an 
inheritance above $1 million, we would collect on an annual basis 
$2.8 billion. This would cover the cost of tuition fees for every 
student in this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In other words, if we did what virtually every other 
industrialized nation does, if we collected money from the vast 
inheritances some people receive with the first $1 million being 
tax exempt, we would bring into the central government coffers 
the equivalent of all the tuition fees in Canada. It seems to me 
that would be worthy of some consideration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are going to have a budget in a few days. I hope the Minister 
of Finance sees the value of investing in young people and others 
who are pursuing better education and training opportunities, and 
takes this bold step and does away with tuition fees. Fund it 
from this new tax that virtually every other western 
industrialized nation has in place today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is rather interesting that this motion comes from my friends 
in the Conservative Party who Canadians totally rejected a few 
years ago for actually bringing this nation to its knees 
economically. 
There were massive cuts to education, massive cuts to health 
care, massive cuts to social programs, debts skyrocketing. 
Canadians said “We have had it with these guys.  We are going to 
toss them out so far that we can hardly see them”.  There used 
to be Tories packed into this place.  Now there is a little group 
down at the far end. Then they were replaced.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Nelson Riis:</B>  We have always been a small group at 
this end.  Nothing changes particularly for us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then it changed and now it is Liberals. I suspect that when 
Brian Mulroney gets up in the morning and reads the newspaper he 
cannot believe what the Liberals have done. They have done things 
that he only dreamed of doing.  Massive, massive cuts to 
education.  Horrendous cuts to health care. They have almost 
completely wiped out all the major granting agencies.  There have 
been huge cuts to social programs so that this morning we now 
have 1.5 million children living in poverty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Other countries have no children living in poverty because their 
parents do not live in poverty.  Countries such as Norway and 
Denmark do not have people living in poverty.  They have no 
children waking up in the morning who live in poverty.  We have 
1.5 million. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have 400,000 young people who do not even have a job.  They 
should be working today.  Since the Liberals took office, 200,000 
young people have been added to these rolls.  There are 1.5 
million people without a job and another million people working 
at part time jobs.  Yet the Minister of Finance and the Prime 
Minister stand up and say that the economy is strong, that things 
are going well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Somebody said the other day it is like having the <I>Titanic</I> 
economy.  Remember that two-thirds of all the wealthy first class 
passengers were rescued and two-thirds of all the people in 
steerage were locked down below and drowned. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yes, we have a recovery for bankers and banks, wealthy people, 
corporations and wealthy families.  Things have probably never 
been better for them.  However for the average person things are 
rough.  For the unemployed things are rough. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I just came from a conference this morning sponsored by the 
Canadian Labour Congress, a special interest group I am told by 
my Liberal friends.  It is interested in labour.  What was the 
name of the conference?  Jobs. Do we hear of the government 
having a three day conference on jobs in this country?  No, we do 
not.  The Canadian Labour Congress two blocks from here is having 
a conference on jobs, trying to find ways and means of getting 
people back to work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Prime Minister and the Minister of Finance stand up here and 
say “Do not worry.  Unemployment is down to eight point some per 
cent, to just under 9%”.  It was at 9% for 87 consecutive 
months.  Are we supposed to be joyous at the fact that it has 
come down a quarter of a percentage point? This is embarrassing. 
It is probably immoral that we stand here and accept this 
immorality of having so many people unemployed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to relate a point that was raised at the conference this 
morning at the Chateau Laurier sponsored by the Canadian Labour 
Congress.  They talked about a woman who a few months ago had a 
good job in Winnipeg, Manitoba.  She had a condo and a car.  She 
was doing well. Then they experienced layoffs in the business. 
She lost her car, lost her condo, lost her job and is essentially 
homeless.  She has gone from being a productive citizen with a 
meaningful job living in a community to being homeless in a few 
months.  That is how close most people are to that status. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will sit down now because my time is finished.  I cannot 
support this motion.  It really fails to deal with the crucial 
issues confronting our country.  Let us hope and pray that when 
the Minister of Finance stands up here next week on Tuesday 
afternoon he will have something to say that will actually 
address these serious problems of unemployment.

agree with everything of course.  I used to support the NDP at 
one point earlier in my life. However, I found out that its 
policies do not work and I became much more realistic. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the concerns the people of Saskatchewan have is that one 
of our main exports is young people. 
Why is that happening?  Why are the young people leaving 
Saskatchewan?  It is plain and simple.  There are not any jobs 
available for them.  Very few jobs are being created in that 
province.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Why are there very few job opportunities?  Saskatchewan has the 
highest taxes in the country.  What would happen if there were 
broad based tax cuts? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us lay politics aside.  Let us forget about the left and the 
right and all the rest of it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The question I have for the member is what creates real jobs in 
this society? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is good to talk about education.  However, in Saskatchewan we 
have a very low unemployment rate.  Why?  Because there are very 
few people looking for jobs.  There are very few people left in 
that province because there are very few job opportunities. I 
agree with the member that there should not be cuts to education. 
We should not be making our young people pay the price for the 
debt and the high taxes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, what creates real jobs in this country?  It is not more 
government programs. I hope the member would agree with that. 
Would the member agree, as has happened in many places around the 
world, that if we reduce taxes we begin to allow investment to 
take place and we allow people to keep their money so they can 
buy goods and services that produce real jobs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would he agree that is the main problem which young people face 
today?  Education is important, but they can have all the 
education in the world and it will do them no good when it comes 
to getting a job. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What creates the real jobs in this country?  That is the debate 
we should have.  Let us lay politics aside and find out what 
creates the real jobs.  That is what we should be doing in this 
place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Nelson Riis:</B>  Madam Speaker, my hon. friend probably 
knows this but Saskatchewan has the lowest unemployment levels in 
Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Roy Bailey:</B>  Because all the young people leave. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Nelson Riis:</B>  No, it is because it has one of the 
hottest economies in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By the way, it was the first province to have a balanced budget. 
My friend forgot to mention that fact, as well as the fact that 
it has the lowest unemployment in Canada.  These are realities 
that my friend forgot to mention. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member said that tax cuts create jobs.  I remember Ronald 
Reagan saying that when he was president of the United States. He 
gave tax cuts to the rich.  It was the trickle down idea. Give 
the tax cuts to the richest families in the United States and 
eventually the benefits would trickle down to the regular folks. 
Regular folks got sick of being trickled upon.  That is what 
happened.  Unemployment went up.  The debt load went up.  The 
economy went down.  It was an economic disaster.  Ronald Reagan 
bankrupted the United States. I will let the facts speak for 
themselves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My friend asks if government can play a role in job creation. 
Yes it can.  I will give my friend an example. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the city of Kamloops we have a program, like many other 
communities across the country, called community futures.  It is 
sponsored by the federal government.  It is one of the few 
federal programs which I think really works well.  Basically it 
provides support for individuals on employment insurance to 
create small businesses.  It provides loans of up to $75,000 to 
entrepreneurs who want to start a small business. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the city of Kamloops alone, using this microcredit arm of the 
federal government, 850 new businesses have been created. 
Normally each business has two or three employees.  The odd one 
will have more.  These small businesses are thriving.  Every loan 
has been paid back.  There have been 850 new businesses and about 
1,500 new jobs created in the city of Kamloops alone. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is something which the federal government has done and has 
done really well.  People appreciate that.  We should be 
expanding those kinds of programs so people do not have to go 
begging to the banks for the $50,000 loan to start their small 
enterprise.  That is something the federal government could do. 
It is doing it now, but it could expand the program to create 
thousands and thousands of new businesses and job opportunities 
across the country.

it is a pleasure to be here today to discuss this issue, although 
it is not a very pleasant issue. 
I was the seconder of this motion and I was a factor in 
convincing our caucus to use our supply day to discuss what we 
consider one of the great problems in this country and one of the 
great pending tragedies for the next generation of Canadians that 
will help to contribute to our economic growth.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The problems of student debt are way greater than a student 
problem.  It is a Canadian problem.  It is the Canadian taxpayer's 
problem.  We must deal with it as such. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The cost of having student debt in Newfoundland in particular 
and in the rest of Canada is reduced access to education. 
Education becomes an elitist kind of approach where individuals 
can get educated only if they have significant personal wealth. 
In many families that is simply not going to happen.  Many 
students in many parts of the country are being discouraged from 
getting an education. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We all know that job opportunities and education go together. It 
is really a penny wise and pound foolish kind of policy to have a 
situation where we effectively discourage people from getting 
educated.  The future growth of Canada is definitely at stake if 
we do not do something with this student debt problem. Again, I 
say this is one of the reasons that our caucus has made this one 
of the most important policy matters that we want to deal with. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know we have to try in opposition to influence the government 
to deal with real problems in Canada. This real problem in Canada 
seems not to be fully understood by the Government of Canada. Our 
job in opposition is to bring it to the attention of the 
Government of Canada and to see if we can find solutions to the 
problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The problem is horrendous and huge. There are 1.5 million 
students presently enrolled in Canadian post-secondary 
institutions.  Collectively these are the youngest and brightest 
people who are trying to get ahead in Canada, who are doing the 
most for the future of Canada and for themselves and for their 
future families.  Those 1.5 million students now owe collectively 
$6.9 billion.  Most of them do not have anything but a part time 
job, working on an education. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a tragedy brewing in this country if tuition fees and 
education costs continue to rise.  This country cannot grow into 
the next century. This new millennium we all want to talk 
about is going to be an apprehensive place for a lot of those 
students once they graduate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the other problems we have, besides having tremendous 
student debt, is that we have tremendously high student 
unemployment.  We can brag about the employment rates in this 
country that may be 8% to 9% for adults. The Stats Canada figures 
for the real unemployment rate below 30 years of age is 16.5%. In 
Newfoundland where I come from it is 23.5%, statistically proven. 
In real terms in Atlantic Canada if the truth were known for 
those students and young people who are still in Atlantic Canada 
we probably have an unemployment rate well in excess of 30%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That causes the other great problem which Atlantic Canada and in 
particular Newfoundland have been all too familiar with, the 
problem of out-migration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Kamloops is wrong if he thinks that Canada has a 
net brain gain.  We have more people leaving Saskatchewan, we have 
more people leaving Newfoundland. Where are they going to?  There 
was a time when we could export some of our most uneducated 
people out of Atlantic Canada, out of Newfoundland to parts of 
central Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Central Canada is going to find out and British Columbia is 
going to find out that a lot of the job opportunities for our new 
students who have tremendous debt, who need to go to areas where 
there is lower taxation, higher rates of pay and greater 
opportunities, when they want to visit their children or their 
grandchildren they better have a passport to visit them because 
they are not going to be in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am going to quote a very prominent Liberal on this problem 
because sometimes I think the Government of Canada does not 
really take into account where this problem came from.  This is a 
letter from one of our well known Liberal premiers who was a 
Liberal cabinet minister.  When asked by my colleague from St. 
John's East the premier of Newfoundland answered: “The rising 
cost of post-secondary education is due in part to the reduction 
in transfer payments that was particularly targeted to 
post-secondary education”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not a coincidence that over $6 billion in transfer cuts 
have happened since this Liberal government took office in 1993. 
It is not a coincidence that there is also $6.9 billion worth of 
debt for students in this country.  It is not a coincidence that 
the provinces of Canada took the cut in federal transfers and 
simply transferred them to somewhere else.  The federal guys 
transferred the cuts to the provinces, the provinces transferred 
them to the universities and the universities did what? They 
transferred them to the students. That is where the $6.9 billion 
of debt comes from. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I said, with the effects of that transfer to students across 
this country some have taken the most terrible of all courses.

<A HREF="#LINKT40"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Newfoundland they have actually chosen not to go to 
universities or colleges.  They have chosen not to get educated. 
They see examples in dying rural communities where people are 
saying what is the point of getting educated.  What is the point 
of my degree if I owe $30,000 and there are no jobs?  I might as 
well not have gone at all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For Canada that is the most expensive and tragic alternative. 
We all know there is a direct correlation between education and 
employment.  If you choose not to get educated you will live on 
the social welfare system of Canada for the next 40 or 50 years 
of your supposed working life. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another terrible tragedy from this terrible debtload is 
bankruptcies.  Almost 8,000 bankruptcies are from students. These 
are not people who went into business.  These are not people who 
have mortgages on their homes.  These are not people who have 
travelled extensively and who have wasted money.  There were 
8,000 young Canadian declaring bankruptcy in 1996-97.  It was 
because they went to school. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another tragedy is the collection agencies, which this 
government should do something about. I know one of those 
agencies is based in the U.S. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Talk to parents who are trying to help their children pay off 
their loans with their savings.  Some become targets of 
collection agencies when their children who cannot pay the loans 
themselves move within or outside of Canada.  It is nothing short 
of mafia style collection tactics.  I could give song and verse 
about some families in Newfoundland that are digging into their 
meagre savings accounts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a letter from one parent whose daughter owes $19,000. The 
mother has $16,000 in savings and the collection company will not 
take it.  Unless you pay it all, it does not want anything from 
you.  The out-migration is unbelievable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we do not educate students at a reasonable cost we will have 
another great problem.  Where is the source of future economic 
growth in Canada?  In the year 2006 of the new millennium who 
will buy cars and houses?  Who will have the money?  Who will 
have the money to pay into the Canada pension plan to keep 
members of our age group reasonably content?  Where is the 
economic growth?  It comes from well employed, well paid people 
who pay taxes to this country.  That is not going to happen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The finance minister has solved our deficit problem for the late 
1990s but I think he will create a huge economic and social 
problem 10 or 15 years from now when a large number of people 
cannot work and cannot spend on consumer goods. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Entrepreneurship and small business is such an important part of 
Canada's future growth.  Small business creates most of our jobs. 
We all know that if you are going to get involved in a business 
you had better have some net personal worth when you go to the 
bank.  I met a young lady the other day with a masters in 
engineering.  She wants to start a business but she owes $57,000. 
Go down to one of our chartered banks and say that you have this 
great business idea.  Guess what it will say?  No business loan, 
no job creation, no real constructive place for you in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the member for Kamloops said, it is all a matter of making 
choices.  There are choices.  We can decide to freeze tuition. We 
can decide to lower student debt.  We can forget this millennium 
fund which will help somebody somewhere in the future.  Instead 
we can help students in our universities today who will graduate 
this year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know.  I went to a university in Newfoundland and I had free 
tuition.  It works.  A whole generation of us who went to 
university in Newfoundland in 1965 to 1970 had free tuition. 
Guess what?  There was a whole generation of us who got educated, 
never had to draw unemployment insurance over 30 working years 
and contributed to the economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The investments that countries like Ireland are making into free 
tuition, the investment that Newfoundland made into free tuition 
from 1965 to 1970 are bold, visionary and they work.  That is 
what this country needs when it comes to student debt.  It does 
not need something called a millennium fund for some scholarships 
for some students.  It really needs to get a handle on the cost 
of education and the idea that if we do create an educated 
workforce we will have jobs into the future and we will have a 
very successful country.  I can only urge the Government of 
Canada to start paying attention to this very tragic problem.

just a few comments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It seems that the parties, whether Progressive Conservative or

country.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need to look at what has been going on in this country and 
at why we have lost jobs.  Many jobs have been lost because of 
technology. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have used the example of the Brunswick mine in comments I 
have made here in the House before.  It used to have 1,400 
employees and produce 8,000 tonnes daily.  Today, with 800 
employees, it can produce 10,000 tonnes daily. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many jobs have been lost in the Atlantic region because of the 
problems with the fisheries.  In Newfoundland, fish plant closures 
have done away with many jobs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleague from the Conservative Party who has just spoken 
cannot bring himself to say that free trade is responsible for the 
loss of many jobs. 
Perhaps if we quit giving our jobs to the Americans, Canadians 
would have work too. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Charlie Power:</B>  Madam Speaker, in answer to the 
question, very often in debating in the House of Commons or any 
other place we want to say the same things, we agree on the same 
things and we take different approaches to them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am a very strong believer that free trade helped this country. 
Free trade created those million jobs that the Liberals take 
credit for now and say what a great economy we have.  In Canada, 
with so many interprovincial trade barriers, our domestic economy 
has not grown at all like our export economy.  That is very easy 
to prove. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In future it will not be free trade that will create jobs in 
this country.  It will be free brains that will be developed in 
the minds of our young people in our universities and 
post-secondary institutions.  That is where the future is.  I am 
really not interested in sitting down, listening and talking 
about what happened to free trade, GST, 1984 and 1991.  In 1998 
we have 1.5 million students who are heavily indebted.  Their 
future, if they can get an education, is going to be a good 
education at a reasonable cost.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Alex Shepherd (Durham, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I 
listened with intent to the member.  He talked about huge 
economic social problems of the future.  Also, the motion 
addresses people fleeing from this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I could not help but observe a few short days ago that this 
party sided with and supported a motion from the Bloc Quebecois 
which denied a legal process.  That is the unilateral declaration 
of independence by the separatist party in Quebec.  I take that 
one step further.  It is a suspension of the Constitution of 
Canada. It would be a suspension of the rule of law in this 
country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How many people does he think will leave the country the day 
that revolution starts? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Charlie Power:</B>  Madam Speaker, that is absolutely the 
most silly frivolous point when we are talking about student debt 
and future employment problems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the problems in this country is that little reference to 
the Supreme Court of Canada.  If the Liberal Party of Canada 
wants to create separatists that is one of the great ways to do 
it.  It has caused the constitutional crisis of this country.  It 
is devoid of ideas of how to deal with Quebec. It is devoid of 
ideas of how to create employment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To use this reference to the Supreme Court of Canada to try to 
brand our leader, the federalist who saved Canada in 1995, as a 
separatist because he does not agree with the government 
resolution is wrong.  It was wrong when the government sent it to 
the supreme court.  It is still wrong.  It will do nothing for 
the good of Canada.  If it creates unemployment or it creates 
separatists, it is because the Liberal government did not have 
many ideas to begin with. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B>  Thirty seconds for 
the hon. member for Wentworth—Burlington. 
<P><A NAME="LINK208"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Bryden (Wentworth—Burlington, Lib.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, the member for St. John's West commented considerably on 
the fact that student unemployment is the crucial problem.  Would 
he not agree that student debt is not the problem, it is student 
unemployment?  They come out of university and cannot get jobs to 
pay off their debts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does he not agree that is because the economic situation 
which exists in his province and across the country was a 
result of Conservative mismanagement of the economy for nine 
years?  That is why there are no jobs.  It is his former 
government that is— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B> The hon. member for 
St. John's West. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Charlie Power:</B>  Madam Speaker, obviously there is a 
great connection between being able to find a job and paying off 
any debt you happen to have. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the case of students, debt has become significantly more 
difficult.  With student aid, even if you get a job, if you end 
up with $25,000 in debt for an undergraduate degree, and probably 
$40,000 plus for a masters degree, even at reasonable rates of 
remuneration, you cannot pay off the debt.  It is simply not 
manageable.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Jones (Markham, PC):</B>  Madam Speaker, I would like 
to thank the member for Kings—Hants and the member for St. 
John's East for bringing this important motion to the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Finance was warned by university leaders months 
ago that a brain drain is drawing the intellectual life out of 
Canada.  A prescription to remedy this problem is an infusion of 
dollars for research and training to increase participation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is time this government realizes that Canada is not an island 
on its own.  We need to retain our human capital and convince 
Canadians to stay here in a country that has full potential to 
prosper internationally at an exceptional level. Right now is the 
time for this to happen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many of our country's most promising young researchers and 
academics are leaving for more enticing grounds, mainly to the 
United States.  They are leaving because they cannot get the 
resources they need to thrive in Canada, namely research dollars, 
decent salaries and lower taxes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Consequently this trend will ultimately damage our economy. 
Canada stands to lose domestic talent to our southern neighbour. 
Less homegrown research and development means fewer resources 
available to support our Canadian businesses. These same 
businesses are struggling to find well trained workers who will 
help them compete internationally. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The facts are clear.  Canada is losing talent to the United 
States because American companies are offering Canadians higher 
salaries and the U.S. government can offer lower taxes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>High taxes in this country are also scaring away businesses to 
low tax U.S. and other destinations around the world.  The tax 
rate for corporations ranges from 38% to 46% in Canada.  In the 
U.S. it is considerably lower.  If corporations are feeling the 
pinch, let us now consider young people and understand what 
drives them south of the border. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Studies indicate that as of late we are losing young talent and 
ambition.  Our leaders are the future.  A student graduating from 
university is faced with a high debt burden from years of student 
loans.  When offered a high paying job, they obviously take it in 
anticipation of ridding themselves of debt and saving for the 
future.  Paying off a debt of $25,000 to $30,000 when entering 
the workforce is unbearable.  How are our young people ever to 
get ahead when they are suffocated with huge student loan 
payments monthly? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Debt repayment incentives are driving our teachers to Columbia, 
Mexico, Egypt and the United States.  High debtloads are driving 
our engineers and computer scientists to the United States and 
many private school grads are deciding to work elsewhere to cover 
their debtloads. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I urge this government to seriously consider the implications it 
is imposing on our young graduates.  Student debt burdens are a 
serious problem in Canada.  The Minister of Finance must 
introduce measures in the upcoming budget that will repair the 
damage he has done to our young people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The only way to ensure that the Canadian economy continues to 
grow is to empower the consumer.  To do this requires an increase 
in the disposable income of Canadians.  Unlike in the United 
States, disposable income has fallen in Canada.  In fact, it has 
fallen or been flat for two years running.  The unemployment rate 
in the United States has been considerably higher.  Canada's 
unemployment rate, on the other hand, has consistently been 
higher than that of our southern partner. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberal government has continued to cut, cut, cut.  Now its 
eyes are finally opening, a little late I might add.  Dramatic 
cuts in post-secondary education by this government have caused 
the average student debt to almost triple this decade from an 
average of $8,700 in 1990 to $20,000 this year and forecast to 
$25,000 in 1998. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe in the Liberal budget next week they will be coming 
out with the millennium fund of $1 billion.  They have caused 
this student debt by tripling tuition fees in the 1990s.  Maybe 
they should be giving the money back to the universities so that 
tuition fees can be reduced. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These disheartening figures point to another issue that is 
surfacing.  The fear of enormous debt is driving qualified 
students away from the universities.  How will this country 
compete internationally if talent is not encouraged to flourish? 
If this trend continues, what future does this country have? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know that the personal income tax gap has widened between 
Canada and the United States.

<A HREF="#LINKT43"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is due to many reasons.  One which can be fixed in this 
upcoming budget is bracket creep.  By indexing bracket creep we 
can realize almost a billion dollars returned to the hands of 
Canadians.  It is time that we let Canadians spend their money 
instead of government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A document compiled by the industry department raises serious 
concerns about whether Canada has much to brag about or not. This 
report is entitled “Keeping up with the Jones”, no relation I 
can guarantee.  It reveals the true picture, not the rosy one 
this government keeps referring to. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me share with this House some of the findings since the 
Liberal government so quickly swept it under the carpet with 
embarrassment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The national income gap between Canada and the United States is 
getting worse. Americans are now 25% richer than Canadians.  The 
U.S. economy is getting richer and it is paying its workers 
better.  The salary gap is especially pronounced in occupations 
requiring high skills.  Engineers, computer scientists and 
architects are earning an average of $11,000 to $13,000 more than 
their Canadian counterparts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The combination of lower taxes and higher income in the United 
States means working Americans have more money to spend. An 
example is a couple with $80,000 in taxable income and two 
children living in California will take home $7,000 more than a 
similar Canadian family. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians pay about one-third more in taxes.  Top corporate tax 
rates are significantly higher in Canada than in the United 
States. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many state governments offer very generous tax and investment 
incentives to businesses for the purpose of attracting investment 
and innovation activities.  Canada's ability to attract and 
retain knowledge workers is seriously undermined by its personal 
income tax structure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadian workers hand over significantly larger portions of 
their earnings to the tax man than Americans.  The top marginal 
personal income tax is 20% higher in Canada than in the United 
States. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The continual shortage of knowledge workers such as software 
engineers in this country poses a huge problem as Canadian 
business struggles daily with the year 2000 problem.  It is 
estimated that there are 300,000 Canadians in California working 
in Silicone Valley. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is time this government admits to these mistakes.  It must 
undo the damage it has done.  Cuts in transfers to the province 
have cost this government the credibility as an effective 
government and are costing Canada our talent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberal government must put a stop to this brain drain. 
Unless this government wakes up and starts now, we stand to lose 
more and more of our talent to the United States. 
<P><A NAME="LINK210"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, 
the member repeated the numbers the leader of the Conservative 
Party said about the differential between Canada and the U.S. in 
terms of the average income. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member did not mention that in Canada we have a different 
income tax system.  The computations are different.  We have 
things that are outside the Income Tax Act whereas they are not 
similar in the U.S., for example the child tax benefit, the GST 
credit and our health care system alone.  He used the example 
that a family making $80,000 a year in the United States would 
have $7,000 more of disposable income than a similar family in 
Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to ask the member if he can tell this House exactly 
how much that family in the U.S. then has to pay for health care 
and social security that Canadians do not have to pay for. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Jones:</B>  Madam Speaker, if we compare the tax rate 
between Canada and the U.S., in Canada we max out at the top tax 
rate at $55,000 to $60,000. That is 54% in Ontario, I guess a 
little less now with the cuts the Harris government has done for 
the provincial level. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the U.S. people max out at 36%, at $250,000.  With the 
difference between the 20%, a lot of health care can be bought, 
child tax benefits, education.  There is a lot more disposable 
income and just as good an education system.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jason Kenney (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, I am entertained watching our Liberal and Tory friends 
quibble over their GST.  It is very entertaining indeed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was very interested in the remarks made by the hon. member for 
Markham.  He is a strong advocate of tax relief as a policy for 
economic growth.  However, not too long ago I read some remarks 
made by the hon. member in the local Markham newspaper.  He said 
that if Mike Harris continues his harsh cuts which are necessary 
in order for him to impose tax cuts, this would hurt the federal 
Progressive Conservative Party in Ontario.  I find it ironic for 
a party which is at 12% in Ontario to be criticizing at party 
which is at 35%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wonder if the hon. member could explain how he squares his 
remarks this evening with his earlier comments which criticized 
the fiscal virtue of the Mike Harris common sense revolution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Jones:</B>  Madam Speaker, I heard the member from 
Calgary bring this up the other day in the House.  If he had 
called me instead of making the comment in the House he would 
have found out exactly what I said. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I agree with what Mike Harris has done. In this country, in the 
last nine months of 1997, 270,000 jobs were created.  Of those 
270,000 jobs 216,000 were created in Ontario.  That proves that 
high taxes cost jobs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What I said is that on issues such as the megacity people are 
saying that maybe the Harris government could communicate a 
little better.  Government could be a little more consultative 
when bringing people into the process so they understand and 
accept what the problem is and what the government is trying to 
do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I did not say I was against Mike Harris and I did not say I was 
against his tax cuts. 
<P><A NAME="LINK212"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Tony Valeri (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Finance, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I will start off by saying how 
quickly they forget.  How quickly the hon. member for Sherbrooke 
forgets. Let me remind the House of a few frightening fiscal 
facts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1985 the government recorded a deficit of over $38 billion. 
By 1993 it got the deficit down to $41 billion.  Over those nine 
years the total yearly deficits exceeded $290 billion. Just as 
damning, the interest payments on those deficits totalled $300 
billion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not trying to shift the focus of today's debate.  The fact 
is that decade of deficits and the failure of political will 
which resulted in them is a key reason why Canada's tax burden is 
so heavy today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no mathematical mystery here.  Deficits are like credit 
cards.  The more you use them, the more you have to pay back, 
principal plus some pretty heavy interest.  The only way 
governments can pay interest, even before they get to the 
principal, is through taxes.  The more the interest grows, the 
more the taxes grow. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us look at the evidence on taxation.  I think we will find 
the fingerprints of the hon. member for Sherbrooke all over it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1985 the former government introduced the high income surtax. 
It was a temporary measure to help fight the deficit. Then there 
was 1986 when that government added a 3% surtax on the basic 
federal tax.  Again it was a temporary measure to fight the 
deficit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those surtaxes are still with us because when we came to office 
the deficit was the highest it had ever been. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the hon. member wants to condemn a government for our painful 
tax burden he only has to open his scrapbook.  If he wants to 
thunder about a brain drain crisis he should consider how the two 
surtaxes which he helped to introduce have added thousands of 
dollars to the yearly tax bills of successful professionals and 
scientists.

<A HREF="#LINKT45"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>My purpose today is not just to look at what caused the tax 
problems Canadians face but to remind the hon. member that when 
he looks at this government he is also seeing solutions that 
work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>From the start of our first mandate we made an absolute 
commitment to deficit reduction and elimination.  One of the 
driving reasons was our recognition that the only way we could 
start the process of broad based tax relief was to get our 
finances under control. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since then we have brought the deficit from $42 billion down to 
$8.7 billion last year, the lowest level since 1969-70.  We have 
done this without a single increase in personal income tax. 
Despite our constrained fiscal situation we began a process of 
targeted tax relief to those who needed it most and where it 
could do in fact the most economic and social good.  These 
include increasing the child tax benefit by $850 million and 
measures to help the disabled, low income working parents and 
Canada's charities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Prime Minister and the Minister of Finance have made it 
quite clear that this is only a start.  As our fiscal situation 
improves so that we can act without jeopardizing our fiscal 
progress and while preserving Canada's cherished social programs, 
we will certainly widen the scope of our tax action. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is another area where we have already taken some positive 
action.  I would like to highlight it because it relates directly 
to the specific problem the hon. member addresses, student debt 
loads. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another bit of history the hon. member for Sherbrooke may have 
forgotten or perhaps would like Canadians to overlook is that 
during the Tory government era the tax credit which was supposed 
to help cover basic personal necessities for post-secondary 
students grew from $50 to $80.  That was between 1984 and 1993. 
Under our government, in just half the time that education amount 
more than doubled to $200 a month. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our government understands that in today's work knowledge and 
education are the keys to economic and individual success and 
security.  We are not only talking the talk, something the hon. 
member is very good at, I might say, but we also walk the walk. 
That is why our 1996 budget provided an $80 million increase in 
direct federal tax assistance for post-secondary education.  In 
last year's budget we increased that support by $137 million 
through measures whose value will reach $275 million when they 
mature. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They were complemented by the creation of the Canada Foundation 
for Innovation which will ensure that post-secondary students 
have access to better facilities and equipment to prepare for the 
knowledge based economy of the 21st century. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other measures include increasing the education credit to 
$150 per month from $100 immediately and increasing it to $200 
per month in 1998 and in subsequent years, allowing students to 
carry forward all unused portions of the education and tuition 
credits to be applied against any future income. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a result of these budget measures a student in full time 
attendance at a post-secondary institution for eight months with 
tuition fees of $2,800 and additional fees of $300 will receive 
over $1,200 in combined federal and provincial tax assistance per 
year.  This is an increase of more than 30% from the $900 in 
assistance available to students in 1995. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The 1997 budget also announced an important change to the Canada 
student loans program.  To better recognize that some students 
still may not have the capacity to repay their loans, the budget 
proposed to extend to 30 months from 18 months the period of time 
during which students are allowed to defer making payments. 
Combined with the initial six months after graduation when no 
payments are required, this means that students will have up to 
three years of help in dealing with their loans. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not want to magnify our actions.  We know they are only the 
beginning of a solution for Canada's students.  That is why the 
Prime Minister has set out a dramatic further advance, the 
millennium scholarships.  He has told Canadians that will be an 
important part of next week's budget.  Let us remember that every 
dollar of scholarship a student receives—and the Prime Minister 
has said in his speeches that this will help tens of 
thousands—is one dollar less debt that he or she must incur. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I could certainly go on reminding members of the House how 
legislation before us will help tomorrow's students by doubling 
the annual limit of contributions to registered education savings 
plans.

</I></B></P><P align=left>While students and the plight of Canadian taxpayers deserve our 
attention, this motion does nought.  There is no doubt the 
problems it raises are real, but the solutions we are offering 
are equally real.  Starting with the courageous deficit action 
that eluded the previous government, I am confident that next 
week's federal budget will prove that our solutions are more 
certain and more concrete than the motion and the hon. member 
dares to dream. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can go on and on about the various initiatives the government 
has put forward.  Let us remember one thing.  This party and this 
member do not own any of the issues of student debt.  Canadians 
and students across the country have continued to communicate 
with the government and with members on this side of the House 
who held town hall meetings in their ridings to talk about the 
plight of students. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We realize that education and skills training will certainly be 
the cornerstone by which the economy will continue to grow into 
the next millennium.  We have said over and over again in the 
House that the government is committed to ensuring that students 
have accessibility to higher education and skills training.  We 
have done it in our past budgets and we will continue to do it in 
the upcoming budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to mention something I neglected to mention earlier.  I 
will be splitting my time with the member for Kitchener Centre. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the member for Sherbrooke decided to come forward with the 
motion, he conveniently forgot the previous Tory government was 
in large part responsible for the mess we found the country in. 
Today he comes to the House merely pointing out the problems and 
not offering anything in terms of concrete solutions, except to 
say that a broad based tax cut, irrespective of whether or not 
the government books are in balance, is the solution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would say to the Tory caucus that Canadians disagree. 
<P><A NAME="LINK213"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Roy Bailey (Souris—Moose Mountain, Ref.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, somehow I do not like the term brain drain.  It somehow 
indicates that all the smarts have gone some place else.  Looking 
around at all of us here, I do not believe that is true. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to direct a question to the member who has just 
spoken.  I would rather call it an intellectual exodus.  Does the 
member remember the greatest exodus outside the depression in 
Saskatchewan?  The greatest exodus that ever hit Manitoba, 
Saskatchewan and Alberta was when a Liberal government instituted 
the national energy policy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are talking about an exodus.  That kind of taxation brings 
about an exodus.  Would the member not agree that the exodus we 
are talking about is brought about by high taxation? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Tony Valeri:</B>  Madam Speaker, while I respect the 
intervention of the member, to stand and essentially say that all 
the challenges faced by the country as we move into the next 
century will be solved by reducing taxes is just not the case. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Right from the beginning the government has said we would 
continue on a balanced approach.  We have done so since we came 
to office.  The Reform Party certainly does not have to worry 
about our commitment to fiscal responsibility.  It is rock solid. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am sure the hon. member will be here on February 24 at 4.30 
p.m. to listen very closely to the budget speech.  That budget 
will certainly be not merely rhetoric or exchanges in the House 
but a demonstration of the commitment of the government and of 
the results we have been able to achieve.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Werner Schmidt (Kelowna, Ref.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I 
found it rather amusing to look at the members who proposed the 
motion and to hear the reply we just heard from the Liberal 
member opposite.  A pox on both parties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the one hand the Liberal government says the fault lies with 
the previous Conservative government.  The Conservatives simply 
say it was the Liberals' fault because of what they are doing. 
One of those parties governed the country since Confederation. 
Therefore it seems to me they are both to blame. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the hon. member would have had another five minutes to speak, 
I think he would have lost one arm.  He was so busy patting 
himself on the back that there is no way he could have preserved 
his arm. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The claim is that taxes have been reduced and the government has 
been balanced in everything it has done.  Why is it, then, that 
we have so many bankruptcies and so much dissatisfaction with 
what is happening? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Tony Valeri:</B>  Madam Speaker, I remind the hon. member 
for Kelowna that if he wants to dole out the blame between those 
two parties he should also stand in the House to say that the 
Liberal government will balance the books over the next number of 
years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberal government takes initiative in terms of reducing 
taxation for Canadians.  The Liberal government invests in the 
priorities of Canadians in education and health care.  The 
Liberal government will bring the country into the next 
millennium with stronger fundamentals than there have ever been, 
with confidence in a stronger economy than has ever been, and 
with Canadians saying they have greater opportunity than they had 
between 1984 to 1992. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member can live in the past if he wants to.  I am not 
patting myself on the back.  I am merely stating the facts and 
ensuring they get on the record, only for the benefit of members 
opposite. 
<P><A NAME="LINK215"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Karen Redman (Kitchener Centre, Lib.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, I thank you for the opportunity to apply a little reason 
to what has become a very rhetorical debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleagues opposite seem to relish raising alarm bells about 
the national brain drain.  It is true some American and Canadian 
employers are competing for talented Canadian youth.  An example 
would be the software industry.  The brain drain is a challenge 
faced by all industrialized countries including the United 
States. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I encourage members opposite to raise their awareness of the 
government's many strategic investments in Canada's young people 
which seek to create job opportunities for them at home. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I welcome the chance to assure the hon. member that Canada's 
future is in very good hands.  It is in the hands of 
extraordinarily talented and creative young people, the best 
educated, the most literate and the most technologically savvy 
generation the country has ever produced. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the Prime Minister stated in his Reply to the Speech from the 
Throne, the government is investing in our youth's future.  He 
said “Canada will remain the best country to live in because it 
cares about its people”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our commitments to Canada's youth are a living testimonial to a 
fundamental truth.  Let me remind the House that the government 
made youth a national priority.  Each year we invest over $2 
billion on youth programs aimed at helping young people to 
realize their potential and to prepare them to seize job 
opportunities in the emerging new economy.  These investments 
support access to learning, the key to employability in today's 
demanding and rapidly changing economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We offer young Canadians every opportunity to pursue their 
professional goals by supporting them financially in their 
post-secondary studies. 
Increasing access to higher learning is an overriding goal of 
federal initiatives such as the Canada student loans program, 
registered education savings plans, and the recently announced 
millennium scholarship endowment fund.

<A HREF="#LINKT48"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Access to education is only one part of this equation.  The 
federal government also makes strategic investments in science, 
technology and the creation of knowledge, the very lifeblood of 
the new economy.  These investments enable Canadian youth to 
carve out new niches for themselves in an emerging knowledge 
economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To encourage excellence and inspire aspiration, this government 
funds the $800 million Canadian Foundation for Innovation.  By 
rebuilding the research infrastructure of universities and 
teaching hospitals, the foundation will stimulate economic 
development in knowledge intensive sectors to improve 
opportunities for young graduates to pursue research careers here 
in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Government of Canada also works closely with the national 
business organizations involved in leading edge research into the 
development of the workforce for the next century.  For example 
we contribute to the business education partnership forum 
advisory committee which is organized by the Conference Board of 
Canada.  Initiatives such as Career Edge which is backed by over 
200 Canadian corporations and the corporate council on youth and 
the economy are giving Canadian youth a leg up in the competitive 
global economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This government's productive partnerships with the private 
sector are equipping young Canadians with the skills they need 
not only to find work but to excel in an information economy. 
Partnerships such as the sectoral partnership initiative form a 
cornerstone for Canada's approach to creating job opportunities 
for youth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many of our initiatives link universities with the business 
community by bringing together educators, employers, workers and 
government both to define and to address human resource 
challenges facing Canadian industry. There are a number of 
outstanding examples of successful partnerships with universities 
either directly with individual institutions or through the 
Association of Universities and Colleges of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another crucial partnership in light of the skills shortage in 
one of the fastest growing sectors of our economy is the Software 
Human Resources Council.  The council is working to increase the 
supply and quality of workers entering this booming area of the 
labour force and in the process is creating opportunities for 
Canadian youth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While we are quick to nurture the best and the brightest, we are 
equally determined to ensure no young person is left behind in 
the rapid transition to the knowledge economy.  We assist youth 
who experience difficulties moving from school to the labour 
market through a range of programs under our youth employment 
strategy.  This government invests $375 million a year in 
initiatives such as Youth Service Canada, Youth Internship Canada 
and the student summer job action program to help young people 
find jobs.  Over three years this strategy will create nearly 
280,000 experiences for young Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since the Government of Canada began investing in youth 
employment in 1994, over 300,000 youth have acquired work 
experience and skills development.  Recent surveys indicate that 
88% of Youth Internship Canada and 85% of Youth Service Canada 
participants are either employed, self-employed or returned to 
school six to twelve months after completing the federal youth 
program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our collective challenge is to ensure we nurture this new talent 
pool, match would be workers with job ready employers and create 
every opportunity for young people to put their abilities to work 
for the benefit of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am the first to admit that government initiatives are not the 
entire solution.  They never will be.  There is no doubt there is 
much more work to be done to ensure Canadian young people assume 
their rightful place in the workforce.  But there can be no 
denying that this government is doing many things right. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not share my hon. colleague's sense of alarm that the sky 
is falling.  Instead I see every reason to believe that Canada in 
the new millennium will be a place of great hope and equally 
great opportunity, a place where young Canadians can proudly 
stake their claim to a better future.

“In Canada my children are free to make their lives as they 
would be nowhere else, less free perhaps than I was, because now 
there are more people; but more free because now there are more 
ways”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On that inspirational note I urge my hon. colleague to withdraw 
his unduly pessimistic motion.  Instead find new ways to work 
with us for the betterment of Canada's young people and for us 
all.  For truly, the sky is the limit. 
<P><A NAME="LINK216"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Garry Breitkreuz (Yorkton—Melville, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I made the point earlier that simply providing an 
education for students is not going to solve the problem because 
there are very few jobs out there.  I come from the province of 
Saskatchewan and I gave the examples. I want to go beyond that 
and ask the member something else in regard to education. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many educational institutions are not educating students in a 
way that prepares them for the working world.  They go to some of 
these institutions of higher learning with the purpose of 
preparing themselves for a job, a job which they later discover 
does not exist.  Simply pouring money into education in itself 
does not accomplish miracles. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope the member will listen to the question carefully.  How 
can we hold these educational institutions more accountable to 
provide an education that is truly going to meet the needs of 
those students who are spending thousands of dollars?  How can we 
hold those institutions more accountable to meet the needs of 
those students?  There is a real problem.  They go to these 
institutions and they end up not being properly prepared.  What 
can we do about that? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Karen Redman:</B>  Mr. Speaker, one of the examples I 
used in my comments was the sectoral arrangements that are being 
made and the partnerships that are being formed with institutions 
in the business sector.  It is key that all of those parties 
continue to look at curriculum and continue to have it evolve in 
a way where there is meaningful employment at the end of the 
educational stream.  I see that as being done in partnership. 
That is something this government has demonstrated.  Not only is 
it committed to it happening, but it is successful at having it 
happen. 
<P><A NAME="LINK217"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Scott Brison (Kings—Hants, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, when I 
hear the undying optimism on the opposite side of the House, I 
sometimes wonder.  I heard one hon. member say earlier that some 
people in this House talk the talk, but the Liberal government 
walks the walk.  Perhaps we should remind ourselves who is 
walking the walk.  It is the young people in Canada who are 
seeking opportunities elsewhere who are walking the walk.  They 
are leaving Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With the unbridled optimism of the government, perhaps it should 
spend less time in the House and more time out talking to young 
people and telling them why they should stay. Not the talk of 
this government, but the actions of this government and the 
fundamentals of the economy are driving the young out of this 
country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Given that free trade, the GST and the deregulation of financial 
services, transportation and energy have been fundamentally 
important to this government's ability to eliminate the deficit, 
where did the hon. member stand on free trade and the GST in the 
1993 election?  Where did the Minister of Finance stand and where 
did that party stand at that time? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Karen Redman:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the issue of the brain 
drain is one that is very near and dear to my heart.  While not 
directly in my riding, Kitchener-Waterloo are twin cities. It is 
one of the institutions the members opposite have been quoting 
when they talk about the brain drain. I point out to the hon. 
member that one of the highest growth sectors for the region of 
Waterloo is the high tech industry. It is staying in Canada. It 
is creating jobs and opportunities in companies that make this 
country proud on a global basis. 
<P><A NAME="LINK218"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Charlie Penson (Peace River, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
when the international trade committee did a study into why small 
and medium size businesses were not expanding their 
opportunities, they told us that the cost of business was too 
high in Canada. 
The cost of payroll taxes and interprovincial trade barriers were 
hurting their ability to trade.  They said that it was easier to 
go across the line.  One Ontario company said that it was easier 
to go across the line and establish in Michigan and do business 
back in Canada.

</I></B></P><P align=left>How does the government intend to resolve the problem that we 
are losing jobs because we are not competitive? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Karen Redman:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am not quite clear on 
the gist of the question, however this government has 
demonstrated that it is committed to looking at breaking down 
barriers within Canada as far as trading goes.  We will continue 
down that road. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also point out that when something is done in 
partnership with the provinces, it is something that has to be 
worked out in concert with them. It is not something that can be 
done unilaterally.  Of course, it is taking time. 
<P><A NAME="LINK219"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jason Kenney (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I am delighted to speak to this supply motion from our friends in 
the fifth party caucus.  We are pleased to support this motion 
even though it is a conversion on the road to fiscal Damascus as 
it were for our friends in the fifth party.  Late conversions are 
welcome ones nevertheless. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I must commend the hon. member for Kings—Hants and his 
colleague from St. John's West for their eloquent remarks on this 
subject.  Later on in my remarks I will address the extent to 
which their party and their colleagues contributed to the 
problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me begin at the outset by saying it has been remarked many 
times that the government opposite will have to increase the 
federal chiropractic budget because of the amount of back 
slapping that is going on over there.  It truly is remarkable. 
They should take up yoga.  Such flexibility is required. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This government has applauded itself for its fiscal rectitude, a 
government that has added a $100 billion to the national debt in 
three and a half or four years, bringing our debt interest costs 
up to $47 billion a year.  We spend more on debt interest as a 
percentage of our federal budget, as a percentage of our national 
accounts and as a percentage of our gross domestic product than 
does any other G-7 country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is money that does not go to post-secondary education.  It 
does not go to support students or higher education.  It does not 
go to help health care or those less fortunate.  It goes to line 
the pockets of bondholders and those to whom we owe this money 
here and abroad.  It is an enormous waste. It is a sinkhole of 
resources and economic potential.  It costs the average Canadian 
family $6,000 a year in taxes just to finance the $47 billion in 
debt interest payments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The party opposite, and occasionally the party to my literal 
right and my figurative left, sometimes argue that it is cruel 
and hard hearted to talk about tax relief, that we are misplacing 
our priorities, that what we need are more big government 
programs like the Prime Minister's $3 billion endowment fund. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To put it in context, the reality is that $47 billion is almost 
equivalent to the entire budget of the Government of Ontario for 
all of its health care, welfare, social programs and everything. 
It is also equivalent to what the provinces of Newfoundland, New 
Brunswick, Nova Scotia, Prince Edward Island and Saskatchewan, 
the five smallest provinces, spend annually on their budgets for 
all of their programs.  That is how much is being flushed down 
the Liberal-Tory sinkhole of debt financing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We believe there is a need for radical, dramatic policy change 
to offer hope and opportunity to younger Canadians, those who are 
presently struggling to get into university, those who are in 
university and struggling to get out from under their debt, and 
those who are out of university struggling to get into the labour 
market but who are unable to do so because of the 17% youth 
unemployment given to them by this and the previous government. 
They need economic opportunity and it is not available to them 
today.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is no accident that we find in this caucus—and I will grant 
in the Progressive Conservative caucus—a number of younger 
Canadians, people like myself who are not very long out of 
university, people who have faced economic challenges in a very 
real and concrete way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will not find among the younger members of these two caucuses 
professional politicians who have been shifting between municipal 
councils, provincial legislatures and federal parliaments that 
have been legislating taxes, tuition increases and cuts in 
transfer payments for higher education. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will find people who know what it is like to graduate with 
$20,000, $30,000 or $40,000 of debt and to try to find their 
first leg up the ladder in a labour market which offers so little 
opportunity to young Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why we will find in this caucus, and to some extent in 
the Progressive Conservative caucus, an appetite for a different 
approach.  Not more big government, Ottawa style programs 
administered by bureaucrats; not more back to the future of the 
1960s and 1970s.  We want to move ahead to the 21st century, a 
21st century not characterized by a family tax burden which 
consumes 47% of what the average family earns, not burdened by 
$600 billion of public debt and not limited in opportunity with a 
17% youth unemployment rate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Imagine a future where tax freedom day comes on April Fool's Day 
as opposed to the end of June.  Imagine a tax burden which only 
takes 25% or 30% of the average family's income instead of 45% or 
50%.  Imagine a country which only spends a few billion dollars 
on debt interest and is able to spend the rest on tax relief, job 
creation, health care and higher education.  That is the kind of 
country I want to live in.  That is why I ran to be in this 
place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Speaking of the tax burden, I will run through some of the 
numbers, but before I do so let me say that the brain drain of 
which my hon. colleagues speak has a very personal meaning for 
me.  It is not simply an economic concept.  I will speak of the 
experience of my family. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some of my family are fifth and sixth generation Canadian. I 
have ancestors who like yourself, Mr. Speaker, descent from the 
United Empire Loyalists.  Mine is a Canadian family which goes 
back 250 years.  I am in a sense ashamed to say that today my 
entire immediate family—my parents and both of my brothers—are 
now working and living abroad because they could not find the 
economic opportunities in Canada they were able to find overseas. 
They are not happy about the fact they had to leave the greatest 
country in the world.  I am not happy about that fact. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to tell a personal story about my father.  My 
father served in the Royal Canadian Air Force for 11 years as a 
jet fighter pilot and as a squadron commander of CF-100s at 
various air force bases.  He then went on to teach and become 
headmaster of several fairly well known Canadian private schools. 
Those who know about the private school industry will know it is 
not a very compensatory vocation.  People earn far less there 
than they do in the public school system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  Not as good as MPs' salaries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jason Kenney:</B>  There is no MP pension.  In fact there 
is no pension for people who work in the independent schools. 
They are there because they are profoundly dedicated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My father worked for the air force but not long enough to get an 
air force pension.  Then he worked in independent schools where 
there are no pensions.  When he retired he and my mother simply 
did not have enough money to live on. That is the truth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One day my father opened up the careers section of the <I>Globe 
and Mail</I> and found that a school in the United Arab Emirates, 
in Dubayy, was seeking a headmaster for a new international 
school.  Lo and behold, my father applied and was selected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the United Arab Emirates, which is not a country I would 
suggest as a model for the Canadian economy, the tax rate is 
precisely zero. 
There are no taxes. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1820"></A>

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not suggesting that Canada ought to adopt the Arab economic 
model.  However, when we are competing in an international 
marketplace with the best trained and the most skilled 
professionals, we are competing with jurisdictions like the 
United Arab Emirates which allow people to keep 100% of the 
fruits of their labours, not 30% or 40% as in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The moral of this personal story is that in three years my 
father and mother will have been able to save more for their 
retirement there than they were able to during the time they 
worked in Canada.  That is a shame. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My oldest brother is a very skilled lawyer with an expertise in 
a particular area of international law.  He went to Canadian 
universities.  We subsidized his education, for which he is 
grateful.  When he went on the international marketplace offering 
his wares, he found that by practising in New York State he was 
able to keep 20% to 30% more of what he earned than he could 
here.  He just relocated to Dublin, Ireland, with his company, 
taking 30 employees who would otherwise be in Toronto or 
Montreal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a kind of personal irony in this story because some of 
my ancestors actually came to this place 150 years ago during the 
Irish potato famine, from which I have since recovered.  They 
came here 150 years ago for economic reasons.  They came to the 
shores of this great country aboard the coffin ships in 1847, 
seeking a life of hope and growth and leaving behind them a life 
of subsistence agriculture and no opportunity.  They found 
opportunity in Canada and prospered in many different fields. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am proud of my ancestors who worked so hard to build the 
country and give so much to me and my generation.  However, I 
find it tragic and ironic that 150 years later the descendants of 
those very same potato famine emigrants are now going back across 
the Atlantic, back to the land from whence they came where they 
now find economic opportunity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The grandchildren of paupers from Ireland are going back to 
Ireland now because the tax rates in Ireland have been lowered to 
a point where it is now leading the OECD in growth.  There has 
been a 9% growth in real income for each of the last four years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no more a brain drain in Ireland.  The greatest export 
in Ireland used to be its people. Now it is keeping its people 
because it has invested in higher education, in lower tax rates, 
and in research and development.  It is the model growing economy 
of Europe as a result. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Young Canadians are pulling up their stakes and moving from this 
place to Ireland because they do not have the kind of opportunity 
they need here; because relative to our G-7 partners the personal 
income tax burden of Canadians is a whopping 56% higher; because 
the Canadian property tax burden is the highest in the entire 
OECD; because the corporate income tax burden is 9% higher in 
Canada than the average in our G-7 partners; because the average 
Canadian family paid a total bill of $21,242 or 46% of their 
income last year compared to only $17,000 in food, shelter and 
clothing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If one were to keep constant the personal income taxes brought 
in, in 1994 by the government, it would necessitate a $6.5 
billion tax cut just to keep income taxes constant with where 
they were three years ago. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The top marginal tax rate in Canada kicks in at $60,000 a year 
while in the United States it kicks in at $271,000 a year.  The 
Americans have many flaws but at least they are prepared to 
reward risk taking and the kind of venturous spirit that is 
necessary in a free market economy.  We penalize those people. We 
think the wealthy are those who earn over $60,000 a year but the 
middle class knows differently. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My family and other Canadians have moved abroad because working 
Canadians and their employees are currently paying a deficit 
reduction tax of $7 billion into the unemployment insurance fund. 
It is basically a cook the books fund for the Minister of Finance 
to cloud the actual size of the deficit.

</I></B></P><P align=left>While I am speaking about my friends in the Tory Party, I cannot 
help but recall their economic record, those who introduced— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  Oh, oh. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jason Kenney:</B>  I am being heckled by the hon. member 
for Markham.  A comment he made during his speech was 
interesting.  This new found champion of fiscal rectitude was 
quoted in the <I>Economist & Sun</I> of Markham on November 25, 
1997.  I would be happy to table the article.  He is quoted as 
“putting some distance between himself and the provincial Tories 
as he spoke to Markham high school students” the week previous. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of the Mike Harris tax cutting, deficit cutting, waste cutting 
Tories, he says “If they don't get a gentler heart and get a 
little humanity and sensitivity into it, not only will they hurt 
themselves but they will hurt us, the federal Tories”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Do my Liberal friends believe that a party at 12% is saying that 
the tax cutting champion of Canada, Mike Harris, is going to hurt 
it when he is at 35% in the polls?  I would expect as much from a 
party that raised taxes 71 times and cut the average after tax 
disposable income of Canadian families by over $2,900 in their 
last term of government alone.  I would expect it of a party that 
raised federal revenues to 16.9%, their highest point in history. 
My friends remind me of their GST, their great glory.  They bask 
in the glory of the GST. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope my hon. friends in both parties will listen not to me but 
to the voice of the Canadian people.  Let us look at the most 
recently released major national poll, released February 9 by the 
<I>Globe and Mail</I>. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government promised in the campaign to spend 50% of every $1 
billion in a future surplus on debt reduction and tax relief.  We 
did not hear a word about debt reduction and tax relief in the 
throne speech.  We heard very little about them in the November 
economic statement by the finance minister.  Now that the 
Minister of Finance and the Prime Minister are doing their 
prebudget spin, it is very clear that 75% or 80% of the surplus 
will be directed to new big government Ottawa programs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is not what Canadians want.  In that poll Canadians were 
asked “Do you think the federal government should start to grow 
again?  Should it get bigger?” Guess how many think it should 
start to grow.  The grand total is 15%.  Some 44% thought it 
should stay the same size and 40% of Canadians think the 
government should shrink further than where it is today.  The 
government is to spend 80% of its surplus on new programs and 
only 15% of Canadians think that is an appropriate response. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When asked what the priorities ought to be with the surplus we 
will be facing next week, 45% of Canadians chose debt reduction 
as their preferred option; 29% said tax relief to create jobs, 
hope and opportunity for young Canadians to which this motion 
speaks; and a grand total of 23% said it should go into new 
program spending like the blow away millennium project of the 
Right Hon. Prime Minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When those 15% who think we ought to spend more were asked what 
their spending priorities were, they said their top spending 
priority was to increase transfers to the provinces for health 
care and higher education. 
When they asked about a federal government sponsored scholarship 
fund, it fell so far down the list that I cannot even find it.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>They want to repair the damage the government has done by 
cutting over $9 billion to health care and education.  The 
government wants to take the credit.  Instead of co-operative 
federalism, instead of transferring the money to the provinces 
where it will be most efficiently and creatively administered, 
the federal government wants the credit.  That is what the $3 
billion millennium fund is about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not about the future.  It is about a past rooted in the 
1960s, a past of big government, a past which offers very little 
to my generation.  We need the tax relief and investment in 
education and research development which will provide real hope 
and opportunity.  For that reason I am pleased to support the 
motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  More, more. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  I can see there is a lot of 
enthusiasm so we will move quickly. 
<P><A NAME="LINK220"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Bryden (Wentworth—Burlington, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I listened very carefully to the remarks of the member 
for Calgary Southeast. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  You did? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Bryden:</B>  Yes, I did.  Early in his remarks he 
criticized the government for having incurred a hundred billion 
debt in the course of the four years of its mandate.  He was 
alluding to the fact that it took us four years to reduce the 
deficit of $44 billion a year down to zero.  He was criticizing 
us for not cutting spending fast enough. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are Liberals, not Reformers.  We believe we have to move 
rather reasonably on these things and not an immediate slash and 
burn.  We tried to move ahead in cutting spending in an orderly 
fashion so the economy could get used to it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Nevertheless, after four years we did get there.  I am sure the 
member for Calgary Southeast will agree it is very good to get 
the deficit down to zero and to start paying down the debt. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the member for Calgary Southeast who supports the 
Conservative motion listened very carefully to what the 
Conservatives were saying, he would have heard that the 
Conservatives— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  If the hon. member is going to ask a 
question, could he do it right away, please?  I am trying to 
squeeze people in, as we have been doing all day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Bryden:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I will ask the question 
very quickly.  You are quite right. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Conservative members suggested cutting taxes, which would cost 
$2 billion.  They proposed through the member for St. John's West 
free tuition, which would cost $2.6 billion.  They also proposed 
increasing transfers for another $1 billion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the member for Calgary Southeast agree with the $5.6 
billion in new spending suggested in the Conservative motion? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jason Kenney:</B>  Mr. Speaker, my party and I do not 
support any new net spending, but we believe we can repriorize 
overall spending. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We spend $103 billion in program spending.  There is no reason 
we could not take billions out of grants and handouts to 
businesses, crown corporations, regional development programs and 
useless grants and redirect them to where they would be far more 
productive in research and development and higher education.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Elsie Wayne (Saint John, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I read 
in my local paper that the Reform deputy leader was in my riding. 
In her interview by the editorial board she talked about extra 
spending.  She wanted extra spending in health care.  She wanted 
extra spending in education.  She wanted extra spending in social 
programs.  She wanted all kinds of extra spending. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the member have two different stories, one for the House of 
Commons and one for when he comes to Saint John, New Brunswick, 
to see if he can pick up some votes? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jason Kenney:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the member's 
question.  I can understand the member is confused in the same 
way as the member from Ontario was. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are proposing that new spending can be found for such areas 
as research and development, higher education and health care 
transfers, but not net new spending.  That new spending ought to 
be found by reducing other programs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have enumerated the areas we think deserve reinvestment and 
the areas we think should be cut in order to fund those 
reinvestments in our excellent document “Securing Your Future”

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
during the member's speech he gave some figures.  I would like to 
table figures from the Angus Reid poll issued on February 7, when 
Canadians were asked what they wanted to see the fiscal dividends 
spent on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The top priority was health and education, followed by increased 
programs to create jobs for young people, followed by programs 
such as home care and pharmacare, followed by new benefit 
programs for children in low income families, followed by the new 
scholarship fund to improve access to education, followed by 
reduction of debt, and then followed by tax reduction.  I do not 
know where the member gets his information from, but this is 
public. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a question for the member.  A Statistics Canada report 
says that in 1995, 11,000 knowledge based persons left Canada but 
34,300 knowledge based persons entered Canada.  It says there is 
no brain drain.  In fact we have a net addition to the knowledge 
based manpower in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jason Kenney:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the very same poll from 
which the member cites asked the question “What do you think 
should be the federal government's main priority in deciding what 
to do with any future surplus money?”  Reducing accumulated 
debt, 45%; cutting taxes, 29%; spending more in government 
programs, 23%.  The numbers he was reading were from the 23% who 
think we ought to spend more. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to Statistics Canada, I simply do not buy the idea 
that we have a net increase in skilled workers.  We have a very 
high level of immigration, relatively speaking, and many 
immigrants are quite well skilled. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However many Canadians who have gone through our post-secondary 
and university education programs are leaving the country.  I 
defy members of the House to stand and say they do not know 
people or are not related to people with post-secondary education 
who have left the country for brighter economic opportunities 
elsewhere. 
<P><A NAME="LINK223"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Scott Brison (Kings—Hants, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
thank the hon. member for sharing his thoughts today and for the 
gastro-colonic reflexes from members opposite. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It has been sad 
for some of us to watch the party of prairie populism emerge and 
evolve into the party of prairie poll mongering. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our party believes as strongly as the Reform Party in the free 
market.  The Liberals believe in free government, in big 
government.  The Reform Party believes in free market.  We 
believe in free market for the Canadian economy, but we believe 
that all Canadians need access to the levers of the free market. 
There are some fundamental changes that need to occur such that 
those Canadians can access the tools. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Speaking of brain drains, in 1993 there was a huge brain drain 
from the House.  However one of the most important issue is 
student bankruptcies.  Students are graduating on average with 
$25,000 worth of debt in Canada.  In 1997, 8,000 students had to 
declare bankruptcy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is the hon. member's personal opinion on the bankruptcy 
issue?  Since it is an immediate problem, how would the Reform 
Party address the student bankruptcy issue in the short term? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jason Kenney:</B>  Mr. Speaker, a brain drain is voluntary 
and a lobotomy is imposed.  That is what happened to the Tory 
caucus in 1993. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to student loans, we propose that student loan 
interest should immediately become tax deductible to reduce the 
burden.  We also support the immediate adoption of a income 
contingent student loan repayment program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. Leader of the Opposition tabled a private member's bill 
to that effect in 1994.  We have long been on the record as 
taking concrete steps to adopt the kind of flexibility in student 
financing we need to relieve the enormous burden many young 
people face.

Speaker, I thank the hon. member for Calgary Southeast for his 
riveting speech.  When this member gets up to speak, he speaks 
with such knowledge on the subject and based on his record with 
the taxpayers' federation that he is obviously an authority on 
the subject. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is ironic.  I was speaking with good friends of mine, Troy 
Lanigan and Robert Pauliszyn of the taxpayers' federation, who 
say that we have the formula exactly right.  The taxpayers' 
federation is agreeing with us: 50% debt reduction and 50% tax 
relief. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Because the other side cannot seem to get it, would the member 
explain to them in quite simple terms how tax relief will 
stimulate the economy?  They do not seem to understand. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jason Kenney:</B>  That is a difficult question, Mr. 
Speaker.  I will just briefly point to history as evidence that 
tax relief produces more jobs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1962 when John Kennedy dramatically cut marginal rates, 
employment and disposable income skyrocketed.  When Ronald Reagan 
did it in the early 1980s, revenues skyrocketed as did real 
incomes.  When Mike Harris did it in the last two years in 
Ontario, revenues grew faster.  When Bob Rae and the Liberal 
Government of Ontario raised tax rates, revenues went down.  When 
Mike Harris cut tax rates revenues went and with them came tens 
of thousands of new jobs.

Speaker, I will be sharing my allotted time with my learned and 
articulate colleague from Mississauga West. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is rather interesting to listen to the debate.  A colleague 
in the Conservative Party talked about the Liberals being big 
government.  We should compare the size of government today with 
what it was prior to the election of the Liberal government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us look at the motion to see whether or not there is a 
problem with it.  It says “lower the tax burden”.  It does not 
say by how much.  Would it be lower the tax burden of everybody? 
By how much?  Are we talking one percentage point or ten?  Is a 
particular level required before it is effective?  They do not 
talk about that, of course. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Offer interest relief to students is another comment that is 
made.  How much interest relief?  Does it matter?  Is it a little 
bit?  Are we talking total relief?  Are we going to put it off 
for a while?  No, of course they would not explain it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Do you know why they would not explain it, Mr. Speaker?  I will 
tell you why.  It is because they do not know what to do.  They 
had nine years to do it, and what did they do?  Nothing but 
accumulate large debt, a huge $42 million deficit, and in fact 
get booted out as they should have been. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When hon. members talk about brain drain, I suspect some of them 
can spell it but I bet they cannot define it.  They do not know 
what they are talking about.  They are offering a simplistic 
solution.  They say we should lower interest rates and offer some 
interest relief and all of a sudden we will get a solution for 
those people who may be seeking employment elsewhere.  That is 
why they are out of power. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They say nothing about the short term challenge Canadian 
industries face or nothing about the long term challenge.  They 
do not know the difference.  They have made no concrete proposals 
in terms of how you would address each one.  Absolutely none. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>And do you know why? Because they do not know the solutions. 
They have no creativity, no imagination. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is from a party that left us with a $42.8 billion deficit. 
I want to say en anglais et en français that when they left power 
the unemployment rate was 11.4%. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We had an unemployment level of 11.4% in Canada.  And here 
they are today with ill-defined solutions, and no suggestion on how 
to go about solving the problems. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They failed to acknowledge that.  I am not one of those who 
pretend that we as a government have been perfect, but we have 
done some things that have been acknowledged and in fact have 
worked. 
We do have the lowest unemployment levels in seven years.  We 
have with other Canadians created over one million jobs. We 
started from the second highest level in terms of the deficit to 
GDP ratio and we are now down to the lowest.

government. I hope it is not because they do not understand. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When one speaks about a knowledge based economy it is important 
to realize that we have to train, attract and retain highly 
skilled workers.  That is not done in a simplistic manner, as has 
been suggested.  We need to encourage people who have good ideas 
and good skills and who have the ability to continue to learn. We 
live in a society where continued learning is absolutely 
essential. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The principal issue here is to understand the complexity of the 
problem.  I have not heard that from members opposite.  I have 
heard slick little slogans that if we do this and if we do that 
all of a sudden everybody will want to stay.  I am sorry but that 
is not the way it works.  We have to broaden and deepen the 
talent pool in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have had difficulties all along the way.  We continue to have 
difficulties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I had the honour of chairing the G-8 ministers committee on 
science, education and technology. Countries such as the United 
States of America, Japan, Russia, Germany, Italy and France 
shared with each other the challenges they face. Do they have the 
same problems we have?  On this particular front they do.  Is 
that what they have to do as well?  Do they have to adopt this 
ill-defined solution?  This solution does not even attempt to 
define the problem. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Not only do taxes have to be decreased, as the motion says. 
That is one part of the solution, of course, but the true solutions 
are far more comprehensive and far more complex.  We need 
partnerships between the universities and the various sectors, the 
various levels of government, and industry.  All this is essential. 
The government is already working with all those partners. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is working toward deepening the pool of scientific and 
technological workers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to give some concrete examples.  I challenge my 
colleagues opposite to argue the points which I am about to 
raise. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is the millennium fund which will provide scholarships to 
tens of thousands of low income able Canadians.  I heard a member 
of the Reform Party suggest that it is wasted money. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All I can say is that the young people with whom I speak do 
not believe it is a waste of money. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have not sufficiently invested in the granting councils in 
the past.  I hope that will be corrected because they are a 
source of tremendous possibilities for the education of people 
generally and in particular young people. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have established an infrastructure that encourages 
innovation. No doubt members are aware of reason for the 
establishment of centres of excellence, which bring together 
researchers from government, universities and business.  There is 
the Canadian Foundation for Innovation. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The foundation for innovation now has over $800 million which 
will be devoted to improving the infrastructure of universities, 
colleges, teaching hospitals and like enterprises which undertake 
research.  Why?  So they can employ, train and educate more young 
people for today's knowledge based economy. That $800 million 
will activate over $2 billion.  Was that a bold and creative move 
on the part of government?  Yes it was. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need to encourage workers to stay in Canada.  We have done 
that by using the national graduate register, helping students 
and employers to match job openings with qualified Canadians. 
Over 50,000 people are on that network.  We have had a great deal 
of success with it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The student connection program is the first business experience 
for many young people.  Those young people train managers and 
employees on how to use the Internet so they can get a head start 
or be competitive in the knowledge based economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need to create an economic environment which fosters 
innovation.  We have the IRAP program.  We have research and 
development tax credits.  We have an unemployment rate which is 
the lowest it has been in seven years.  It is still too high, but 
it is coming down.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I will close these few remarks with the comment that it is 
always so easy to turn up with a ready made solution.  It is so 
easy to turn up claiming one knows the answers.  It is so easy to 
suggest something without defining it.  It is so easy to criticize 
without offering any concrete and proven solutions.

that had nine years of opportunity in government and that will 
probably be judged as the worst government this nation has ever 
had is extremely difficult to believe.  To suggest that we are 
going to address the need for workers in the knowledge based 
economy by undertaking those two steps, steps that are supported 
by both parties on the right, is really not understanding the

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay—Columbia, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I would like the member to address the issue of the cost of the 
millennium fund.  I suggest the whole idea of this millennium 
fund is nothing more than to create some kind of movable shrine 
for the Prime Minister when he finally retires so that it will 
have his name on it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us assume the finance minister determines he is going to put 
$3 billion into the fund.  Let us further assume that fund will 
theoretically throw off a certain number of dollars.  Let us pick 
a figure of 5% or $150 million a year that would be directed 
toward these scholarships. Let us also take into account our 
national debt is approaching $600 billion.  By taking $3 billion 
that could be used toward paying down that $600 billion debt, by 
not paying down that $600 billion debt, that $3 billion still has 
interest payable on it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Guess what?  At 5% the cost of that $3 billion is $150 million, 
indeed the amount of money the government wants to spin off to 
the students through this millennium fund, this great moving 
shrine for the Prime Minister who at some point in time will be 
the ex-prime minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This millennium fund is nothing but smoke and mirrors.  If you 
do not pay down the $3 billion, you have to pay interest on the 
$3 billion.  How can you pay interest on the $3 billion when you 
have already put the interest back into the bond market?  It is 
just smoke and mirrors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Ronald J. Duhamel:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am offended by the 
suggestion that this is a shrine to the Prime Minister.  The 
Prime Minister has chosen to invest in young people.  He has 
chosen to prepare Canadians to meet the challenges of the 
knowledge based economy, to prepare Canadians to go forward in 
the new millennium as leaders and not followers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member is with the same party that came to this House of 
Commons to suggest that Liberal solutions could not tackle the 
deficit.  I am delighted to tell the member and his party that 
Liberal solutions have indeed tackled the deficit.  It may have 
been wrestled to the ground. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member of the Reform Party and his party do not understand 
that sometimes when you make strategic investments you get a 
whole lot of return.  The Reform Party does not understand that 
if you fail to invest in the skills of the knowledge based 
economy that you will be at the back of the line. I want to be 
with the young people at the front of the line.  I applaud this 
move and I will support it completely, totally, unequivocally.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Scott Brison (Kings—Hants, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, sound 
long term economic policy takes years to have an effect.  It also 
takes consistency.  Let us talk about consistency. The hon. 
member was first elected to this House in 1988 I believe.  As I 
said, consistency is critical when we are talking about sound 
economic policy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The <I>Economist</I> magazine's 1998 preview did say specifically 
that the deficit reduction in Canada was largely due to 
structural changes made in the Canadian economy by the government 
in the early 1990s, free trade, the GST, deregulation, including 
the elimination of the national energy program—and I hope my 
friends in the Reform Party appreciate us for that—and 
deregulation of transportation and financial services. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Where did the member stand on the issue of free trade and on the 
issue of the GST?  We have acknowledged that consistency is 
critical.  Where did he stand at that time on those two issues? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Ronald J. Duhamel:</B>  Mr. Speaker, he is the same 
member who just a short while ago said that Liberals were big 
government.  I challenge that member to compare our size of 
government with that which preceded us which was the Progressive 
Conservative Party, just in case they have forgotten. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member is trying to take credit for the government's success 
with other Canadians.  That is what he is trying to do. He is 
trying to suggest that after the nine years the Conservatives 
spent in power where they were dismally unsuccessful on any 
number of fronts whether it be debt, deficit, unemployment, we 
are reaping the benefits. I am sorry. We have done as we have 
because we have stood with Canadians.  I stood with my party. 
<P><A NAME="LINK228"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Steve Mahoney (Mississauga West, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I find it interesting to listen to members opposite in this 
debate.  I just heard a comment which is absolutely incredulous. 
The comment was that it takes time for sound, long term economic 
policy to have an effect.  I believe that is what the member 
opposite said. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In nine years of what the member opposite would like to call 
sound long term economic policy, each and every year— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Scott Brison:</B>  Free trade. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Steve Mahoney:</B>  Sure you can talk about the free trade 
that you brought in.  You can talk about the GST, which was 
brought in by the Mulroney government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, each and every year, the Conservatives ran a deficit 
and a deficit is an overdraft.  If they want to talk about sound, 
long term economic policy, they do not run an overdraft every 
year and then at the end of the year pile it on top of the 
mortgage and then run another one and do that every year for nine 
years. In the last year when the Canadian people finally had had 
enough, the overdraft was $42 billion.  Each year that you pile 
that overdraft on to the mortgage of this country, you wind up 
increasing the debt.  Figure it out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For nine years, we had overdraft financing by the Conservative 
government and the Conservatives are now trying to lecture this 
government.  I would ask the members to look at a graph.  If they 
looked at a graph of the nine years of Mulroney government, and 
the member for Sherbrooke was in that government I might add, the 
graph on the overdraft would go straight up I say to the former 
mayor of Halifax.  It would go straight up and out of sight. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since 1993, what has happened under the leadership of the 
present Prime Minister and the Minister of Finance is the graph 
has been turned on its ear.  The graph has gone straight down to 
the point where finally we are not continuing to run overdrafts.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now that, I would submit to the members opposite, is what one 
would call, to use their terminology, sound, long term economic 
policy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With regard this motion, it is also rather incredulous.  It 
reads: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That, in the opinion of this House, the government should lower 
the tax burden on Canadians and offer interest relief to student 
loan holders—. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The example they continue to use, as does the Reform Party, is 
the provincial Tories in the province of Ontario.  They talk 
about how the economy has grown and jobs have grown.  I would 
admit they have. In fact, revenue has increased in the province. 
There is no doubt about that.  Why? Imagine that just by chance 
the policies of the federal government in ensuring that inflation 
is eliminated, ensuring that interest rates are at 20 year lows 
and ensuring that we have restored the funding in the transfer 
payments to the provinces might have something to do with the 
economic turnaround in the province of Ontario. I am sure members 
could. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B> He is a Liberal, he can understand your 
logic. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Steve Mahoney:</B>  And he is a good Liberal at that, I 
say to the member. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reality is that even the members would have to look at it 
and say that Ontario is not an island unto itself.  It relies on 
the policies of the federal government. Indeed it relies on 
international policies and international relations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The province of Ontario, were it a sovereign country, which I do 
not advocate, would be the ninth or tenth largest economy in the 
world.  It is quite remarkable.  It was also strong in the 1980s 
when I had the pleasure to serve under David Peterson, who 
balanced the budget I would add.  It was the first time in 40 
years that any provincial government eliminated the deficit and 
balanced the budget.  That was the legacy of David Peterson. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bob Rae took over and we all recall why.  We can all recall the 
battles around national unity and how David Peterson stood strong 
and paid a horrendous political price because he stood up for 
Canada.  I remember that day.  I remember with pride being a 
member of that caucus and a member of that government. 
Tragically, I admit, it cost David Peterson the job as premier. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, the economic realities were that we were booming under 
the David Peterson government.  It was then that Bob Rae came to 
power and he did almost verbatim what the Conservatives did here 
in Ottawa.  He intentionally ran $10 billion deficits, overdrafts 
each and every year.  Remember what I said, a deficit is an 
overdraft.  When government pays off its overdraft it piles it on 
to the mortgage which becomes the debt. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we left office in 1990 in the province of Ontario the total 
debt for the province was $39 billion.  In five years under the 
NDP, whose members stand here and talk with pride about their 
ability to govern, that debt in the greatest province in this 
country went from $39 billion to over $100 billion.  It continues 
to grow because today the Mike Harris government is continuing to 
run a $6 billion deficit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why have they not cut?  There is no question that they have cut 
dramatically and yet we hear members in the Reform Party saying 
how revenue has increased in the province of Ontario.  Please 
help me with this.  We have people lined up in emergency wards. 
Just read any newspaper.  We have replaced the level of transfer 
payments to the provinces.  Why were they cut in the first place? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  Because the federal government cut them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Steve Mahoney:</B>  I will admit to the member chirping 
why we cut them.  We cut them because after nine years of Brian 
Mulroney and Jean Charest we wound up with an unmanageable— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  I am sure the hon. member means Brian 
Mulroney and the hon. member for Sherbrooke.  I am sure he would 
want to use that kind of nomenclature. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Steve Mahoney:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I was speaking in the 
past tense so I thought I could do that.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the Brian Mulroney government the leader of the fifth party 
in this place was clearly a member of that cabinet.  He was a 
driving force in that government.  I presume he would sit 
at the cabinet table and talk to Mr. Mulroney.  He would talk to 
his colleagues around that cabinet table and they would make a 
decision. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Their decision would be whether to increase the deficit or not. 
Bob Rae did it for five years and incredibly damaged the finances 
of that province and so did this government led by Brian Mulroney 
and strongly supported by the leader of the Conservative Party 
today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will admit that many of the people in that party here today, 
in fact all but the leader, were not there.  So they are new to 
this place. They went from 160 down to 2. Some would call that a 
brain drain.  I think I would call it a brain strain.  In any 
event, it was a dramatic impact and obviously a reduction in the 
size of that caucus and there was a reason. The people were fed 
up. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What do they do now?  They come back and say “we can solve the 
problem, we will just cut your taxes and this is the model”. 
Mike Harris said in 1995 “I'll cut your income tax by 30%”. He 
has delivered 22.5%.  He has absolutely done that.  That is what 
he and Mr. Eves said they would do.  They have cut the taxes. How 
have they done it?  They have cut funding to health care. They 
have cut funding to education dramatically. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We do 
not mean to pick on him, but the member for Markham continues to 
talk in support of Mike Harris but he is not really sure.  He has 
terrific ideas.  I will give the House one of his ideas.  This is 
a quote from the member for Markham: “The Liberals should use 
surplus funds from employment insurance to help save the CPP”. 
Is that robbing from Peter to pay Paul?  This is from the same 
party that increased employment insurance premiums by 77 cents. 
It has no credibility, none whatsoever on this issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will be strongly speaking and voting against this motion. 
<P><A NAME="LINK229"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay—Columbia, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I am going to try again with this member because the last Liberal 
member was not too good on figures.  I guess I am going to have 
to work quite slowly for this chap too, him being a Liberal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to talk about this millennium fund. We will not get 
into the rhetoric about it being monuments and so on and so 
forth. Let us just deal with some simple math. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know that the government is in debt almost $600 billion as a 
result of the Conservatives and the Liberals, the two old parties, 
but that is another story.  The reality is that Canada owes 
almost $600 billion.  Every dollar of the money we owe has 
to have some interest paid on it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we have $3 billion of the $600 billion that is not paid down 
it costs money.  We will have to pay interest on that $3 
billion.  I think the member would have to agree with that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If this is not smoke and mirrors, if we are not just saying we 
are going to take $3 billion and put it into a fund, and indeed 
that money should be going to debt repayment, where is the money 
going to come from that they are suddenly going to say it is 
spinning off so much? I will use some numbers just so that we are 
talking about some hard numbers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we were talking about 5%, if the government said we are going 
to put $3 billion into this millennium fund and we are going to 
be spinning off 5% of that or $150 million a year, will this 
member admit that the $3 billion is going to cost an additional 
$150 million in interest payments alone? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Steve Mahoney:</B>  Madam Speaker, one of the reasons I 
believe in my heart that the Reform Party will never govern this 
country is it simply does not understand that you have to 
continue to govern.  You have to invest in our young people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I admit quite clearly that the debt must be attacked.  Our 
finance minister has committed to that.  We have put out what we 
believe is a balanced plan which says 50% of our surplus will go 
toward debt reduction that the member goes on about as well as 
selective tax relief.

home or are we to say to the Canadian youth that they are on 
their own?  They need our support and we need to invest in our 
youth.  That is what the millennium fund will do.  It will invest 
in the education of the people who will run this country in the

Progressive Conservatives when they were in power.  I want to say 
that when they were there, we had the trees, we had the planes, 
we had all modes of transportation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I practically have to thumb to get to Ottawa these days with the 
cuts that have come from the government side.  It is a serious 
situation where we have our young people who are hurting like 
never before. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the Conservatives were in power they knew there were 
regions of Canada with different needs and they addressed them. 
This government has not done that and we have never hurt like 
this before. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What does he see?  Has he been to New Brunswick?  I thank him 
for calling me the mayor of Halifax, but the mayor of Saint John 
I was very proud to be for 12 years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Has he been to New Brunswick?  The people across Canada when 
they come find it the most wonderful place in the country.  They 
want to help us.  We had shipbuilding.  We had marine.  We had 
everything going until these people took power and within the 
last three and a half years devastated it.  What will they do for 
the maritimes? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Steve Mahoney:</B>  Madam Speaker, I stand corrected on 
the city the member was the mayor of.  I have respect for the 
member and if she really is thumbing I will make sure to give her 
a lift. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know this member was not part of the Mulroney days. I just 
find it incredible the legacy that was left, what we had to 
inherit in 1993. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the members opposite would simply do a mea culpa and admit 
they were wrong, admit they ran a huge deficit then maybe they 
would have some credibility.

first comment would be that, if I were a single mother or a student 
owing $20,000 listening to the debate this evening, I would go to 
bed pretty discouraged.  There is all this finger pointing going 
on, with charges that the Liberals did this and the Conservatives 
did that. Could we not focus a bit on the future? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Progressive Conservative Party's motion today reads as 
follows: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That, in the opinion of this House, the government should 
lower the tax burden on Canadians and offer interest relief to 
student loan holders in order to address the brain drain 
crisis which is forcing Canadians to move to the United States 
where unemployment rates, income tax rates and student debt 
levels are lower and the standard of living is 25 percent 
higher than in Canada. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This morning, when I read it and learned that I was to speak 
to it, I found the motion strange, although there are a lot of good 
points in it.  It covers so much.  It talks about tax burden, 
student loans, and the brain drain, and praises the United States 
as though it were the best place to live.  I am going to look at 
each element in turn. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, there is the brain drain.  I did some research this 
morning. 
The chief statistician of Statistics Canada recently declared that, 
between 1986 and 1996, approximately 50,000 people with various 
levels of education left the country, while 200,000 came here to 
work.  So we are somewhat ahead.  The fact still remains, however, 
that there is a brain drain problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this regard, a study on the behaviour of 1995 graduates 
shows that, two years after they obtained their degree, 24% of 
those with PhDs had left Canada, compared with 10% of students who 
had obtained a master's, and 3% of students with a high school 
diploma. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to draw members' attention to a survey done by 
the Association of Universities and Colleges of Canada.  This 
survey showed that the main factor in leaving for the United States 
was the salaries there. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1915"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT63"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The tax burden could be a factor, but according to the study, 
it is primarily the phenomenal salaries the Americans can pay in 
Silicon Valley and elsewhere. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One thing bothers me, however.  They say the United States is 
a great place to live.  In this regard, the Liberal Party said some 
interesting things today.  As a country we have choices to make. 
If our taxes are so much higher than in the U.S., it is in large 
measure because of our societal decision to provide universal 
education and health services.  That has to be paid for somehow. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the subject of the American dream, the information I have 
indicates that, between 1973 and 1995, the per capita gross 
domestic product increased by a third and gross salaries for people 
in management positions decreased by 10% to US$258. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It all looks fine there, but what choices do they make as a 
society?  Their crime rate is one of the highest in the world. 
Child poverty is the highest in the world.  Choices have to be 
made, and in many instances, to my great regret, they strongly 
resemble the choices the Reform Party wants us to make, although I 
would like to hear their remarks should they change their minds. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That concerns the first two elements.  The third element is 
student loans.  Here I am going to have some fun.  I am going to 
have fun because there is a lot to say on this subject. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We should have a quick look at the history of student debt. 
Students go into debt because it costs a lot to go to school. 
Every year tuition fees go up.  Why?  We have to start at the 
beginning. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government gives large sums of money to the 
provinces for education.  In fact, this money comes from our taxes. 
We must remember that.  The federal government distributes our 
taxes to the provinces, which pay the education costs.  Then for 
whatever reasons, the federal government makes huge cuts, leaving 
the provinces stuck with the problem.  Fees increase, student debt 
increases, and the song goes on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government finally took notice of the problem. It 
should be praised for noticing that the student debt load is very 
high. Faced with the problem, the federal government said “We are 
going to create a scholarship fund.  We will provide assistance for 
students because now we are rolling in surplus dough”.  But we 
still need to see them put their money where their mouth is. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will speak of the situation most familiar to me, the 
situation in Quebec, where we have the most efficient system of 
loans and bursaries in Canada.  Don't take my word for it.  That is 
what the president of the Canadian Student Association says, and he 
ought to be well informed about the situation throughout the 
country.  He has said “If I were in Manitoba, I would be a bit 
jealous of students in Quebec, because they have an excellent 
system of loans and bursaries”.  Recently, however, we have had to 
cut back on the system because of certain cuts in transfer 
payments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The student debt load is increasing, and now the federal 
government is turning up as a Johnny-come-lately. 
The Minister of Human Resources Development said once in committee, 
and I was there to hear it: “The federal government is giving 
enormous sums to Quebec and other provinces, but has no visibility 
whatsoever”. Is that what the purpose of the policy is, to gain 
some visibility? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It has therefore created a system of loans and bursaries with 
its own money, to be administered at the federal level.  It is not 
concerned in any way about whether this creates duplication, about 
whether it decreases efficiency, about whether it is throwing a 
monkey wrench into a system that is working perfectly well at the 
moment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All these questions have to be asked, and they are things that 
bother me a great deal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are many things that could be done to help students. 
During the last election campaign, for instance, the Bloc Quebecois 
proposed a registered education savings plan. That could be one 
solution.  The tax credit for tuition fees could be another. 
The education credit, the transfer of education credits to a spouse 
or parent, not taxing the first $500 of a bursary, all these could 
be yet other solutions. 
In this regard, there is a consensus in Quebec, as representatives 
of the Liberal Party and the Parti Quebecois, student associations 
and university presidents all agree with what we are saying.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Yesterday, Mr. Bouchard sent a letter to the Prime Minister of 
Canada asking for an emergency meeting. Since there is a consensus 
in Quebec, could a way not be found to take these huge amounts of 
money and let Quebec administer them as it sees fit, in its own 
jurisdiction? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is really a shame to see this sort of petty politics. 
Other ideologies may be better, but I say that, on this issue, the 
logic is obvious. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another point mentioned was the tax burden.  In fact, many 
issues have been mentioned today, given the wide variety of issues 
covered in the motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am interested in the tax burden, as it covers quite a range 
of things.  Today's debate on the tax burden prompted the NDP, 
which often says things I find relevant, to speak about child 
poverty, and poverty in general. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a great deal of difficulty understanding, and I keep up 
on this area, how it is that, in a period of full economic growth 
that has gone on for several years, poverty continues to grow. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the topic is child poverty, and it is said that one child 
in five is living under the poverty line, I find this frightening. 
As a politician, I ask myself what will be the consequences of the 
measures taken, or very often not taken, here in 15 or 20 years. 
You will tell me I am being very egotistical, because I am thinking 
of what will become of me in 20 years—I will be only 44—in what 
sort of society we will be living, when I see the steady increase 
in the rate of poverty. This is an up-to-date statistic, but it is 
also a persistent trend. We are looking at a steadily growing gap. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Four years ago, there were one million children living under 
the poverty line in Canada; today there are 1.5 million.  That is 
a huge increase.  If this keeps on, where are we headed? 
These children living below the poverty line, who have a hard time 
studying since they are not properly fed, and who have a hard time 
finding a job because of their poor education, and who have trouble 
making their way in the world, are much more likely to get involved 
in crime.  All of this makes me wonder about the kind of society we 
will end up with. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I see“tax burden”, I think of taxes.  When I think of 
“taxes”, and I see more wealth and more poverty, I can see there is 
a problem somewhere.  I am not alone in saying this.  But what are 
we doing about it?  I do not see anything happening. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In terms of tax, wealth is being created, but it does not 
appear to be going into government coffers. 
In 1950—I was not around—businesses paid 50% income tax, as 
did people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>People are overtaxed as they say, and I agree.  It is truly 
hard for a single parent to pay tax on a salary of $20,000 a year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What I am wondering is where is the money?  The money stays in 
the bank vaults or the coffers of big business.  I have, in this 
regard, a long list of companies that made huge profits and paid 
almost no income tax. I will not show it to the House, because 
unfortunately am not allowed. I will name some of the companies. 
Barrington Petroleum made profits—not revenues—in 1994 of $11 
million and paid $194,000, or 1.7%, in taxes.  BCE Mobile 
Communications Inc., with $66 million, paid 4% in taxes.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me continue.  In 1993, the Nesbitt Burns Inc. group made 
profits of $50 million and did not pay a red cent in taxes.  The 
money is there.  It is in the pockets of the rich. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>From what I read when I am doing research, the attitude seems 
to be that we should not lower the taxes of the rich, of 
corporations because they are the ones creating jobs.  This might 
well seem logical at first. But their taxes have been going down 
for 20 years, which means less revenue for governments.  Taxes have 
to be raised somewhere.  So personal income tax is raised. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is in this sense that I find the Progressive Conservative 
Party's motion interesting.  When it says that Canadians' tax 
burden is much too high, there is no denying that.  But there is 
also the other end of the scale, the corporate tax burden, to 
consider.  I am not talking about SMBs nor about businesses just 
starting up.  I am talking about healthy companies, multinationals 
making millions, even billions—we see the banks paying heavy 
taxes, but that is another debate—and not paying any taxes.  I 
have to wonder about this, particularly when I see poverty on the 
increase. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I heard what my colleague from New Brunswick had to say.  In 
New Brunswick, poverty is steadily increasing.  Something is not 
working, and I have to really wonder.  At some point, people are 
going to have to stop arguing and trying to blame one another.  I 
think people will have to sit down and try to solve this serious 
problem. 
In my opinion, the first step toward solving a problem is admitting 
that there is one. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In his next budget, the Minister of Finance will be announcing 
highly laudable measures to help students, but what is needed are 
measures that are effective, not political.  Where are things 
headed with measures like these?  Where are things headed with one 
and a half million children living in poverty?  And I am not 
talking about the parents, or the delayed impact of poverty, what 
I call people's inability to save. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>You know, ten years ago,—and I am not talking about 20 years 
ago here—the savings rate was much higher than it is now.  I 
think that the average savings per household is 1% annually.  This 
may not be poverty right now, but that is what it will become. 
When we speak about future poverty, that is where I get worried. 
In 10, 15 or 20 years, these people will stop working and will have 
almost nothing set aside. 
There is a certain degree of income security, but it is just 
delayed poverty, and that is what is the cause of concern. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think that the taxation system needs to be revamped.  I am 
not the first one to say so, either.  The last major review of the 
personal income tax system dates back to the work of the royal 
commission on taxation in the 1960s.  The last time they saw fit to 
review the taxation system was in the 1960s.  Now, instead of 
revising the tax laws for shipping companies belonging to the 
Minister of Finance, and instead of passing legislation that will 
benefit the rich even more, would it be possible, at some point, to 
sit down and look at what is not working properly in the system? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals should be aware of the inequalities in the 
present federal system. 
So should everyone.  I think that, with a subject as serious as the 
increasing gap between rich and poor, we must stop playing politics 
and get moving. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In a document by the Department of Finance,  it is stated that 
there are three factors which explain the extent of the advantages 
high income taxpayers enjoy: first of all, these taxpayers have the 
necessary resources to make better use of tax advantages; second, 
some of the major tax expenditures relate to investment income, 
most of which is earned by this group of taxpayers; third, the 
higher the taxation rate, the more advantageous the exemptions or 
deductions.  So, like just about everywhere else, it takes money to 
make money.

<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That, in the opinion of this House, the government should set 
targets for the elimination of poverty and unemployment, and 
should pursue those targets with the same zeal it has 
demonstrated for targets to reduce the deficit. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>She said:  Madam Speaker, I am very pleased to speak to the 
motion I have introduced in the House. I would like to spend a 
moment to tell the House why I introduced this motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reason for bringing this motion forward is to open up debate 
and critical thinking on this issue.  If we are truly serious 
about poverty and unemployment in this country then we have to 
set a real plan and we have to set real targets in order to 
ensure that we do actually reduce and finally eliminate poverty 
in this very wealthy country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I represent the riding of Vancouver East which has the lowest 
income community in Canada.  My riding has been particularly hard 
hit by poverty and by unemployment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the last two decades Canadians have heard many promises 
about reducing unemployment and eliminating poverty in ridings 
such as mine and right across this country.  The reality is that 
none of these promises has been fulfilled, not by a Conservative 
government and certainly not by the current Liberal government. 
Instead, the number of people living in poverty in this country 
has increased and unemployment has remained unconscionably high. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to go back into history for a moment to the year 
1989 when the House of Commons unanimously supported former NDP 
leader Ed Broadbent's motion to eliminate child poverty by the 
year 2000.  That was in 1989. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1935"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT67"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now here we are in 1998 and despite what might have been at the 
time very good intentions of all the members of the House from 
all parties represented, nothing has changed.  In fact, the 
situation has worsened. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since 1989 there are now 538,000 more children living in 
poverty.  The number of poor children has grown by 47%.  We must 
recognize that children are poor because their parents are poor. 
Their parents are usually poor because they are unemployed or 
they are in a low wage ghetto because our minimum wages are so 
low or because the jobs that have been created have been part 
time jobs that cannot support a family at any decent standard of 
living. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a result of this, the reality faced by a growing number of 
Canadian families is that the number of food banks in Canada has 
tripled and the proportion of the population relying on food 
banks has doubled.  The number of Canadians filing for personal 
bankruptcy has tripled, which is something that affects small 
businesses as well as lone business operators.  The number of low 
income persons in 1996 was 40% higher than it was in 1989. That 
is the tragic record of what has happened in our country since 
the motion was passed in the House of Commons in 1989. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must ask ourselves what the root of the question is.  At the 
root of the growing number of people living in poverty is the 
high level of unemployment.  We have heard statistics many times 
that unemployment is at 9% or higher for 86 consecutive months. 
We talk about it a lot but it in no way describes the tragedy 
that is faced by individuals and families, by working people when 
they feel the devastation of unemployment.  This is felt in the 
family, in the local community, by business, in the school yard, 
in our community centres, and on and on it goes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are 1.4 million unemployed Canadians and 5 million 
Canadians who live below the poverty line as established by the 
low income cut-offs.  Of those who are employed, 18.5% have only 
been able to find part time work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When it comes to youth the situation is even worse.  The 
official unemployment rate for youth is 16.5%.  That does not 
include young people who have given up looking for work.  Even if 
we use the official statistics, youth unemployment is almost 
double the unemployment rate for adults.  The reality is many 
young people who manage to find work are trapped in part time 
jobs that pay minimum wage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe, as do all members of the New Democratic Party, that 
Canadians who are living in poverty or coping with unemployment 
should be able to expect support and assistance from the federal 
government and provincial governments.  Instead, we have seen a 
growing trend of inequality and poverty in Canada.  The most 
disturbing growing trend is poor bashing where government 
policies zero in and target certain sectors of the community. 
These policies say in effect you are undeserving, you are going 
to be put on a work fare program, you are going to be put back on 
the unemployment roll.  That is the kind of mentality that has 
developed through policies we have seen from the Liberal 
government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have seen cuts to transfer payments for health care, 
education and social support.  The programs announced by the 
government have only been skin deep and have done little to 
alleviate high unemployment especially among young people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many of the government's own policies contribute to growing 
inequality, poverty and unemployment in our country.  The Bank of 
Canada's obsession with fighting inflation ahead of all other 
social issues has cost us thousands of jobs.  We have lost 
something like 100,000 jobs in health care, environmental 
protection, education and public services as a result of the 
slash and burn approach of the Liberal government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This government has gutted our employment insurance system. 
Unemployed people have a right to expect they can receive a 
decent income while unemployed.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reality is that our current unemployment insurance system is 
now pushing more and more people into poverty.  Eight years ago 
87% of Canadians who lost their jobs and had paid into UI 
received benefits.  Reports have been tabled in the House and the 
stories are horrific and shocking that now only approximately 37% 
of those people who pay into UI will actually receive a benefit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>People who are no longer eligible for employment insurance must 
now depend on social assistance.  Unfortunately that too is 
becoming more and more of a tragedy.  Social assistance as well 
has not been immune to the savage and violent cuts that have been 
perpetrated by the Liberal government in terms of transfers to 
the provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Conservative government's cap on the Canada assistance plan 
payments cost B.C. and Ontario alone $9.7 billion.  While in 
opposition, the Liberals criticized the cuts as penalizing the 
poorest of the poor.  Now that the Liberals are in office, they 
have simply continued the same old story with the same old 
policies that served to harm and penalize the poorest of the 
poor. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Between 1995 and 1997, the Liberals used the introduction of the 
Canada health and social transfer to slash federal funding for 
social programs by $2.8 billion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us turn to education for a moment as another example of the 
growing inequality we face.  We have heard a lot of debate in the 
House today about the announced millennium fund. However, the 
amount of money that is being cut from post-secondary education, 
more than $2.29 billion by the Liberal government in transfer 
payments, has had an incredible impact and is a growing crisis 
within our post-secondary educational facilities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under the Liberals post-secondary education has become a debt 
trap for students.  The average student debt is now $25,000. Even 
the prime minister, in speaking to the Canadian Club, 
acknowledged that too many young people cannot afford to attend 
university or college anymore.  Tuition fees have increased by 
45% since the Liberals took power.  Again, much of this is due to 
the cuts in federal funding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Martin and his so-called fiscal responsibility has been 
carried out— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John O'Reilly:</B>  Madam Speaker, it is the tradition in 
this House to not call members by name.  I would ask, in your 
vigilance, Madam Speaker, that you not allow people speaking to 
call members by name but only by riding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B>  I must remind the 
member to please adhere strictly to that rule. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Libby Davies:</B>  Thank you for the reminder, Madam 
Speaker.  As a new member of Parliament, it is something that 
takes a while to get use to.  I appreciate the reminder and will 
continue with my remarks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The finance minister has slashed $2.29 billion from 
post-secondary education.  What this means is that by the year 
2000 colleges and universities will have lost $3.27 billion due 
to Liberal policies.  That is unconscionable, especially when we 
hear the hypocrisy that comes out of the mouths of Liberal 
members who profess to be concerned about the future of young 
people in this country.  We need student aid today, not in the 
year 2000, not a millennium fund and not a scholarship fund.  We 
need a national grants program and a tuition freeze. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the Liberal members truly care about the future of young 
people and about poverty in this country, this motion is 
something that should be critically debated and acted on to show 
that we are serious about that commitment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Instead of meaningful assistance, those who are on social 
assistance are caught up in a cynical public relations game. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In December 1997 the Minister of Finance described child poverty 
as a priority.  However, based on the actions of the government 
to date and as the evidence shows, child poverty has not been a 
priority.  It has been rhetoric.  Child poverty has been 
increasing.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have heard a lot of talk about the national child benefit but 
we all know that when the finance minister presents his budget 
next week he will be announcing the national child benefit for 
not the first time, not the second time, not the third time but 
the fourth time.  Meanwhile poor kids in this country and their 
families have not seen a dime in terms of improved circumstances 
to relieve the poverty stricken measures that they live with in 
their local communities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Whenever the Liberal government is called to account for this 
government's appalling record on poverty, it tries to hide behind 
the national child tax benefit.  With these repeated 
announcements and exaggerated claims by Liberal ministers the 
fact is the truth is coming out that not one thing has changed. 
As I have pointed out in this debate tonight the situation has 
worsened. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The announcement by the Liberals on the child tax benefit does 
not even come close to making up for the 40% cut in federal 
transfers to social services and other programs since the 
Liberals took office. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Anti-poverty groups in this country have been outspoken.  They 
have made it very clear that the $850 million that has been 
announced so many times is simply not enough to deal with even 
the limited program that the federal government has announced. 
And it does not apply to those on welfare. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important that we address and lay out clear and meaningful 
targets for the elimination of poverty and reducing unemployment. 
In the upcoming budget I believe there is a critical question 
that each of us has to ask ourselves.  That is, will the measures 
that are outlined in the budget eliminate poverty, will they 
reduce poverty and unemployment or will they increase the growing 
inequalities that we have seen? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to point out that there are good alternatives we 
can look to. An alternative federal budget was put together and 
presented by a group in Winnipeg, Choices and the Canadian Centre 
for Policy Alternatives.  It lays out in a much better way than 
what the finance minister has done in all of his years of dealing 
with this, very clear choices and targets that we can 
systematically move toward to reduce unemployment and poverty if 
we have the political will and if we have the fortitude to speak 
out.  We must call for things like fair taxation and minimum 
wages, and for ensuring that the massive profits of the banks are 
reinvested in our communities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe that we must set national targets. We must embark on a 
national housing program. What better program could we have to 
reduce unemployment, to pay people decent wages and also to 
fulfil a social need?  That is a program for people who are 
living in inadequate housing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would urge the members of this House to take this motion 
seriously.  I would also seek the unanimous consent of the House 
to have this voted upon. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B>  Does the hon. member

motion.  In the words of her motion the hon. member for Vancouver

the elimination of poverty and unemployment and should pursue 
those targets with the same zeal it has demonstrated for targets 
to reduce the deficit”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to assure the hon. member and all members of this 
House that the Government of Canada is responding to the 
challenges of poverty and unemployment with innovative and 
effective policies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am sure the hon. member realizes that reducing the deficit, as 
Canadians say we should do, is helping to create a stable 
economic environment for private sector growth which in turn 
helps create jobs and reduce poverty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Finance has made it clear that future dividends 
from deficit reduction will be distributed to reduce the national 
debt, to reduce the tax burden and to invest in new programs.

</I></B></P><P align=left>We know that too many people are unemployed and struggle to make 
ends meet.  We are sensitive to the plight of Canadians who are 
doing their best to provide for their families.  In this regard 
we do have a number of effective programs that are designed to 
move on in the right direction toward reducing points of 
unemployment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That being said, I believe it is important to stress that shared 
responsibility is the key to helping people return to the labour 
force and alleviate poverty.  The Government of Canada cannot 
shoulder this responsibility on its own.  Provinces, businesses, 
individuals, the labour movement, community agencies, everyone 
needs to contribute. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We emphasized shared responsibility once again in last fall's 
Speech from the Throne.  We are prepared to work with the 
provinces and territories to develop a Canada-wide mentorship 
program.  We are prepared to work with the private sector to 
better forecast the number and types of jobs available in the 
future and then jointly develop a plan to ensure that young 
Canadians are qualified to fill those jobs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On poverty we are already working with the provinces on the 
national child benefit system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me first address the issue of unemployment.  The 
government's contribution is to help by setting the right fiscal 
environment, supporting learning, making available up to date 
information and facilitating sectoral based partnerships.  Our 
strength is in giving Canadians more options to pursue 
employment.  I am thinking of the ways in which we promote labour 
mobility so workers can take advantage of job opportunities 
across the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Hon. members will be familiar with the saying “an ounce of 
prevention is worth a pound of cure”.  That is the philosophy 
behind the formation of sectoral councils that bring together 
employers, workers, educators and governments to address human 
resource needs before they become problems.  These initiatives 
are showing concrete results. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some 370,000 new jobs were added to the economy in 1997 and the 
unemployment rate declined steadily in 1997.  According to the 
Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, Canada is 
expected to have the fastest growth among G-7 countries in 1998. 
Since this government was first elected there are over one 
million more Canadians working. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe our new employment insurance program is designed to 
get unemployed workers back into the labour force.  As part of 
the new employment insurance we are investing $800 million more 
in active employment measures for a total investment of $2.2 
billion by fiscal year 2000-01.  As well we have a $300 million 
transitional jobs fund designed to create 40,000 permanent jobs 
and productive partnerships in areas of high unemployment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All members of this House are concerned about the high rate of 
youth unemployment.  Again in co-operation with our partners the 
government is tackling that challenge with renewed vigour.  Our 
youth employment strategy builds on some $2 billion in Government 
of Canada programs.  It helps Canada's young people make the 
often difficult transition from school to work and land that all 
important first job. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, perhaps the hon. member has heard of the youth 
employment strategy project in Vancouver where this past spring a 
number of young people created a healthy living space for both 
seniors and youths.  For over six months the group constructed a 
rooftop garden at the Vancouver General's Banfield Pavilion which 
is a long term care facility for seniors.  As well they designed 
a rooftop garden at VanCity Place for Youth.  When the project 
was completed, several participants began providing horticultural 
therapy for residents at the Banfield Pavilion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the future we will increase funding and expand programs under 
the youth employment strategy.  Since a sound education is 
crucial in today's knowledge based economy, we will ensure that 
post-secondary education is accessible and affordable.  For those 
young people who lack education and have inadequate skills, we 
will assist them by further developing community based programs.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of course in a changing economic environment it is essential 
that we all upgrade our skills and think in terms of lifelong 
learning. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member's motion also calls for the elimination of 
poverty.  The initiatives I have just mentioned, which result in 
sustainable employment are the most effective way to eliminate 
poverty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government is also addressing the horrendous problem of 
child poverty.  For the member to continue to suggest that this 
government has not made this a priority, the fact is it has been 
made a priority.  The provinces are now working with our 
government very closely in order to deal with this blight on our 
society. We are determined to do everything possible to eliminate 
it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the February 1997 budget the Government of Canada committed 
$850 million to create an enriched child tax benefit. The new 
investment will give much needed support to 1.4 million Canadian 
families and will help more than 2.5 million children. In June 
the Minister of Human Resources Development and his provincial 
and territorial counterparts reached agreement to establish a 
national child benefit system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the Speech from the Throne we promised to at least double the 
$850 million investment over the course of our current mandate. 
This will bring the total Government of Canada investment in the 
well-being of our children to almost $7 billion per year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government's commitment to provide more income support for 
low income families will enable our provincial and territorial 
partners to redirect savings in social assistance.  Those savings 
can go into complementary programs and services with the goal of 
helping welfare parents become employed. This is the basis for 
the national child benefit system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Building on this collaboration last January, we agreed to work 
with the provinces and territories to develop the national 
children's agenda.  This will be a broad, comprehensive strategy 
to address the developmental needs of Canada's children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As part of the agenda the Speech from the Throne announced three 
new federal initiatives.  In addition to the national child 
benefit system, we will develop indicators to measure and report 
on children's readiness to learn.  We will expand the aboriginal 
head start program for First Nations children on reserves and we 
will establish centres of excellence for children's well-being to 
help us better understand children's needs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In closing, I would say to the hon. member that there is no 
magic means of eliminating poverty and unemployment.  What is 
needed are concerted efforts from all concerned, including 
members of this House. I encourage the hon. member and her party 
to work with the government on constructive ideas to meet these 
challenges.  In that manner we will be serving all Canadians.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary—Nose Hill, Ref.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, it is a pleasure to speak in debate to the hon. member's 
private members' motion. These are initiatives that all members 
of the House have the opportunity to take when they feel that an 
issue is important enough for them to bring forward in their own 
private members' bill.  I would like to commend the hon. member 
for taking advantage of the opportunity that members of 
Parliament have to bring issues forward for debate and 
consideration by the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member is concerned about unemployment and poverty and 
wants to see something done about that.  I think there would be 
no one in this House who would not applaud and agree with the 
member's concern that in this wonderful and rich country of 
Canada we do not have citizens living in poverty, nor citizens 
who are unable to find a job and have a steady income with which 
to provide for themselves, for their families and for their 
future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The intent of this motion is one I think with which this House 
agrees.  I think the reason and the point of the debate is to 
address these concerns, to examine them and also to talk about 
some solutions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First of all, the motion provides that the government set 
targets for the elimination of poverty. 
It also provides that the government set targets for the 
elimination of unemployment.

<A HREF="#LINKT72"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are two things to say about this part of the motion and I 
would like the hon. member to consider them carefully. One is 
just some practical observations.   Elimination of poverty should 
be considered in the context of opportunity to make sure that a 
person is not in impoverished circumstances.  Those are 
opportunities that individuals must take advantage of themselves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are cases where poverty cannot be eliminated because 
sometimes the choices of individuals not to take advantage of 
opportunities cannot be eliminated.  I would suggest wording that 
is this sweeping and this inclusive is not very realistic in 
light of human nature and in light of the fact that a minority of 
people may not be able to take advantage of opportunities that 
ought to be there but, even if they are, are not capitalized on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The same holds true for the elimination of unemployment.  I 
recommend to the hon. member that the motion would read better if 
it included setting a target to ensure that every Canadian had 
the opportunity to have a reasonable standard of living, an 
adequate and comfortable standard of living, and to have 
employment.  That would be a more reasonable and a more realistic 
target. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another difficulty with this portion of the motion is the hon. 
member's statement “the government should set targets”. This 
suggests that government is the agency through which poverty and 
unemployment should be eliminated or, as I have suggested, 
addressed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would argue that the member might want to consider that it is 
not government particularly that creates unemployment or 
employment.  Government is not the agency by which these issues 
can be totally addressed.  There are other agencies or other 
entities involved in this whole area.  Individuals and their 
choices, job creators, investors, business people and 
entrepreneurs are very much involved in the whole area of 
employment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Government being the whole entity, the whole vehicle or the 
whole answer is a very serious fallacy.   We have seen that the 
state as nanny has not worked in many countries around the world. 
The state as the total agency for central planning, management of 
the economy and management of employment has failed miserably in 
eastern European countries and other countries where a total 
government system was in place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When addressing these very serious, very real and very heartfelt 
concerns on the part of Canadians, the member would do well to 
recognize that the agency of government is not the whole answer. 
She would do well to remember that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am a little bemused the motion says that government should set 
targets and pursue them but does not say what measures should be 
taken to reach those targets.  Setting targets and pursuing them 
is nice if they are realistic targets, which I suggest these are 
not, but also there have to be some practical measures to reach 
the targets. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will talk about this a bit later, but I must say the hon. 
member did a wonderful job of pointing out the real lack of 
opportunity for Canadians to rise above poverty and to make sure 
there were adequate resources for themselves and their families. 
She made a very excellent case for Canadians who are not able to 
have employment opportunities that are needed and desired. 
However she failed to spend almost any time—she just barely 
touched on them—on measures which could actually achieve the 
goals the member sets out.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is nice to define the problem.  It is nice to expand on the 
problem.  It is nice to underline the problem.  It is nice to 
complain about the problem.  It would be a lot more helpful to 
the people involved if we as leaders and legislators actually 
laid out a plan of action to address the problem in a substantive 
way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Rather than spending 18 minutes on the problem and 2 minutes on 
what we can do about the problem, it might be better to spend 2 
minutes on laying out the problem clearly and practically and 18 
minutes on what we might do to address the problem.  We have to 
put a framework around what we are talking about. I have 
attempted to do that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to move on to what I believe would be helpful in 
addressing the problem of ensuring that Canadians have 
opportunities so they will not live in impoverished circumstances 
and will not be unemployed.  I do not think there is any Canadian 
who wants to be in these circumstances.  Nor do I think there is 
any Canadian who thinks this is acceptable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to talk about the whole area of job creation and 
employment.  The hon. member referred to the alternative budget 
put out by the Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives and 
Choices.  It is a very interesting document.  The document 
recommends such popular measures as ending the capital gains 
exemption on family farms and small businesses.  In other words, 
if someone has a capital asset and it gains in value, that gain 
should be taken away according to the alternative budget.  I am 
not quite sure how that will help families and business people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It recommends carbon taxes.  It recommends a huge tax on banks, 
which will simply drive service charges through the roof. It 
recommends personal income tax rates should be increased.  How 
are families supposed to not be impoverished if their money is 
taxed away from them when they manage to get some? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member should be looking at measures that will give us less 
government spending and take less of our resources so that we 
have more to provide for ourselves and our families and more to 
expand business opportunities.  We need lower taxes and less 
government intervention and over-regulation of businesses so that 
opportunities can be created. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We do not need to do some of the things the NDP is consistently 
suggesting.  We need new measures to bring real prosperity to the 
country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I recommend that to the member.  I commend her for her motion 
and wish her well in achieving these goals along with the rest of 
us.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Christiane Gagnon (Québec, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I would 
like to thank my colleague from Vancouver East, who by introducing 
this motion, has enabled me to participate in today's debate and to 
speak to a subject that I hold dear and that is of concern to the 
Bloc, namely the increase in poverty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion by the member of the NDP proposes that the 
government set targets for the elimination of poverty and 
unemployment and that it should pursue these targets with the same 
zeal it has demonstrated for targets to reduce the deficit. 
The Bloc Quebecois has no disagreement with the aim of this motion, 
but we would point out that the means proposed to fight poverty 
must respect provincial jurisdictions.  We do not want flowery 
speeches on poverty, but action when we have the means to change 
things. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why I would like to point out today that the very same 
Liberals, now in government, criticized the government of Brian 
Mulroney in the 1993 elections for systematically weakening the 
social safety net.  This is what the red book says.  They accused 
the Conservatives of cutting hundreds of billions of dollars in 
health care and assistance to children, seniors and the unemployed. 
These fine words come from the red book of the Liberal Party, while 
it was in opposition.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It looks a lot like the criticism levelled at the present 
Liberal government.  Since the Liberals have been in government, 
few specific measures have been taken to slow the rise of poverty 
in Quebec and Canada.  Worse yet, despite its election promises, 
the current government refused to unleash a vigorous fight against 
poverty and to a large extent it has weakened measures taken by 
Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Tom Kent, one of the main architects of social programs under 
the Liberal government of Lester B. Pearson, is very critical of 
this government, accusing it of being largely responsible for the 
cuts in health and social programs in the provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A few days before the Minister of Finance brings down his 
budget and with the little time we have, I would remind this House 
of what the government refused to do to improve the situation of 
the most disadvantaged and what the Bloc proposes in order to 
really fight poverty.  The situation is not as rosy as the Liberal 
members in this House would have us think. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We strongly encourage the Liberal government to stop wandering 
about and to drop its obsession with looking after its own 
visibility before the interests of taxpayers. 
Otherwise, it will have to face strong opposition from the Bloc 
Quebecois MPs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There must be a proper strategy for dealing with the problem 
of poverty.  The provinces need to have the necessary funds to put 
into place measures tailored to their realities, which may differ 
from one context to another.  Is it too much to ask for this 
government to respect the need while respecting jurisdictions? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What the Bloc is proposing first of all is that the amounts 
that were taken away from the provinces for social transfers be 
paid back.  It is all very fine for the Liberals to boast that 
their cuts are over now, but I would like to remind them this 
evening that the cuts to health, education and social services cost 
the provinces more than $6 billion a year, and will do so until the 
year 2003, for a total of $42 billion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To illustrate the unprecedented impact of these cuts, we need 
only remember that, in Quebec, out of every dollar cut from health, 
education and social assistance by the National Assembly in 1994 
and today, approximately 75 cents are the result of the downloading 
done by the federal Liberals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Clearly put, Quebeckers must realize, and we cannot ever 
repeat it too many times, that it is through their efforts in 
recent years that the federal deficit was eliminated, as the 
Minister of Finance boasts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before starting up its spending again, it is imperative for 
the federal government to reimburse the provinces.  This is why we 
are proposing that, to cancel out the effect of the cuts there have 
been since 1993, the government need only restore to the provinces 
tax points equivalent to 25% of the forecast surpluses for the next 
two years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the federal government gave the provinces $2 billion in tax 
points in 1998-99, and an additional $4 billion for 1999 and 2000, 
they would end up with the same amount of money they were getting 
at the start of the Liberals' term in office, when they were 
elected in 1993. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the next budget the government will be tempted to make new 
expenditures, once again in the jurisdiction of the provinces.  We 
therefore encourage the Minister of Finance to resist such 
temptation, but we know he will not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the 1997 throne speech, the federal government clearly 
announced its intention to create programs for children and young 
people in the areas of health, education and social policy.  Should 
we applaud that? 
Not yet.  The federal government is talking about looking after 
home care, community services, strategies for youth, bursaries, 
pharmacare, ways to interest young people in science, a national 
school nutrition program, Canada wide benefits for poor children, 
a Canadian foundation for innovation, and a partridge in a pear 
tree.  All provincial jurisdictions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It would be unspeakable for the government to use some of the 
savings from transfer cuts for hospitals, schools and social 
assistance to increase its visibility while putting its stamp on 
areas of exclusive provincial jurisdiction.

</I></B></P><P align=left>A number of representatives from different milieux are very 
critical of this government's approach.  Its centralizing attitude 
without regard for the provinces has but one aim: to show it off in 
the best light and thus justify its existence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Viewers must be wondering why the Bloc Quebecois is making 
such a kerfuffle over reimbursement of social transfers to the 
provinces.  The reason is simple: the government's cuts to the 
transfers considerably hamper the establishment of real social 
policy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Quebec already has policies in these areas.  The Quebec 
government released its white paper on family policy in 1997. 
The Premier of Quebec emphasized that economic recovery had to be 
achieved through a better coalition of labour and family, through 
more equitable policies and more work incentives.  A true 
redistribution of wealth and a genuine effort to combat poverty 
must place the focus on children and their families. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Christiane Gagnon:</B> You would do well to listen, sir. 
When you were in opposition— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B> Order please.  I must ask 
the hon. member to please put her remarks to the Chair and not to 
colleagues across the way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Christiane Gagnon:</B> Madam Speaker, I would like to put my 
remarks to you, but I am being addressed from the opposite side. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Christiane Gagnon:</B> They would like to throw me off, so 
that I will not speak about the way the government is fighting 
poverty, but I will go on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In six years, the cost of these new measures undertaken by the 
Government of Quebec will require $235 million on top of what the 
Government of Quebec now spends on the family. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I urge members of the House to consult this white paper.  They 
will be able to see how Quebec is better placed than the federal 
government to intervene in family policy.  I must point out that 
the proposed policies will benefit all families, particularly those 
with low incomes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is why it is so important that we recover the amounts 
paid under the Canada social transfer so that we can implement real 
strategies, so that we can stop making the mistake this government 
is making of having no policy on poverty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois will therefore continue to call for full 
indexing of tax levels, personal exemptions and credits for GST, 
medical expenses and child tax benefits.  Furthermore, $2 billion 
is now needed for the child tax benefit, and not the mere $850 
million being touted by the Minister of Human Resources 
Development.  Two billion dollars must be invested now to help 
children.  If there had been real tax benefits, the goals would 
already have been reached, but now, we are lagging behind.  The 
federal government is missing the boat on poverty.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Herron (Fundy—Royal, PC):</B>  Madam Speaker, it is 
with pleasure that I speak this evening to Motion No. 133 as put 
forward by the New Democrats. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I must compliment the New Democratic Party for submitting this 
motion which reads: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That, in the opinion of this House, the government should set 
targets for the elimination of poverty and unemployment—. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>From 1993 to 1997 this House lost some of its social 
consciousness which was provided to a large degree by the New 
Democratic Party.  I think we have a stronger and healthier 
Parliament since the return of the NDP which can now speak to 
these issues.  I do not think there is a member in the House who 
thinks child poverty is funny.  Individuals in this country are 
unemployed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Statistics can describe the unemployment rate and the child 
poverty rate in Canada, but the big issue for many families in 
this country, whether they be from Atlantic Canada, British 
Columbia, the north or elsewhere, may not necessarily be the 
political philosophy they follow. 
It may actually come down to the issue of whether they have milk 
in their fridge or whether they actually have bread in their 
cupboard.  Those are the greater issues for which we are here. 
It is a higher calling than actual political rhetoric.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is an adage in business that is used quite often.  It is 
what gets measured gets done.  What the New Democratic Party 
wants to do with this motion is challenge the government to set 
benchmarks with respect to unemployment, challenge the government 
with respect to child poverty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was brought up by one of the hon. members of the NDP earlier 
that the poverty rate in Norway, a country I have been too as 
well, is such that it essentially has no child poverty and it is 
directly connected to its unemployment rate which is quite low as 
well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would advocate that children are not poor necessarily, it is 
their parents who are poor.  Children are poor because their 
parents are poor. They do not have a job.  They do not 
necessarily have the economic means to provide for their 
families, provide for their children to seek post-secondary 
education. It is those very issues which are our duty and 
responsibility as legislators to address. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We believe for too long, for over a decade, Canadians have not 
had any increase in disposable income.  In fact, Canadians now 
earn 6% less after taxes than they did in 1990. Canadians are 
poorer than they have been in a decade. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I cannot fathom, and I know my colleagues in the NDP as well 
cannot fathom, why we tax individuals who only make $9,000 a 
year.  What we believe is our economy needs a plan for growth. We 
need to ensure that we have more individuals participating in the 
economy to have a better standard of living than they are 
experiencing now.  We need to create more growth in the economy 
so that more individuals can participate and have a decent 
standard of living. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why earlier today the leader of the Conservative Party 
and our finance critic, the hon. member for Kings—Hants, tabled 
a plan for growth. Within that plan for growth there are 
initiatives that will help those individuals most in need. One of 
the things we want to do is raise the personal exemption on an 
individual's income tax form from $6,500 to $10,000.  It would 
take two million Canadians off the tax rolls overnight. Those are 
two million Canadians who simply should not have been there in 
the first place. Because we have not indexed the personal 
exemption on income tax forms, today we have 500,000 Canadians 
paying tax who did not in 1990. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another initiative we want to put forward in order to stimulate 
the economy and to help those in need is tax relief with respect 
to payroll taxes.  It has been proven time and time again by 
economists that if there is one kind of tax that has a most 
negative effect on creating jobs it is that of payroll taxes. The 
reason we are having this debate about a fiscal surplus or a 
fiscal dividend is this government takes in nearly $6 billion 
more in the EI fund than that program actually consumes. That is 
what is responsible for the surplus. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have balanced the budget on the backs of Canadians and 
unfortunately on the poorest Canadians in that regard.  We want 
to make sure the EI fund is sustainable.  The chief actuary for 
the government points out that although the EI payment is $2.70 
per $100 of insurable earnings, it is sustainable at $2. I know 
the hon. member for Compton—Stanstead understands that as well.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Two dollars for every one hundred of insurable earnings would 
put $6 billion back into the economy.  The other thing it would 
do is stop taxing every new job that we create. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another thing we put forward earlier today in our plan for 
growth, and I think my hon. colleagues in the NDP will be 
receptive to this, was with respect to the child tax credit. For 
too long it has not been indexed to inflation.  What happens is 
we take money away from the poor families that need the money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to challenge ourselves.  The intent of this motion is to 
measure our success.  The NDP should be applauded for bringing 
forth such a motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What this government is not willing to accept at the moment is 
that we have had unemployment above 9% for well over 80 months. 
That is the longest single stretch of high unemployment since the 
depression.  What the economy needs is a plan for growth through 
less debt, less tax and more jobs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, we need to ensure that we challenge the 
government to raise the personal exemption from $6,500 to $10,000 
and take those 2 million people off the tax rolls overnight. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is another social cost here which has a very 
negative effect on our economy overall.  I said during my 
campaign in Fundy—Royal that for too long Atlantic Canada's best 
export has been our best and brightest young people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately it is not only an Atlantic Canadian phenomenon. 
Some of our best and brightest are now seeking opportunities in 
the United States.  Why?  There are those who have been 
successful enough to get a university degree who are now seeking 
opportunities in areas where they do not necessarily have a 
chance for employment. They end up going to the United States. 
They do not have to pay for the last 30 years of overspending, 
mom and dad's spending binge.  They will be taxed less and they 
will have more opportunity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we need to do is ensure that more individuals have a chance 
to participate in the economy by growing the economy through less 
debt, less tax, more jobs and more opportunities. Above all we 
need to help those most in need, those in the margins of society. 
That is why we want to take 2 million people off the tax rolls 
overnight.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvon Godin (Acadie—Bathurst, NDP):</B> Madam Speaker, my 
colleague has just been saying that the labour movement ought to be 
involved throughout the entire process, so as to create youth 
employment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am pleased to hear that, on the other side of this House, 
the Liberals realize that there is a labour movement here in 
Canada, that they are prepared to talk to them, unlike the former 
Minister of Human Resources Development, who said that if he met 
the president of the CLC in the desert after wandering about for 2 
weeks, he would not even drink a glass of water with him. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At last they are beginning to acknowledge that there is room 
for the labour movement, that it  can discuss with government and 
employers to create employment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Not long ago, I was talking with the people at a food bank in 
my riding.  They told me “It would be nice if they came to visit, 
came to see how well we are operating.  Even though there is 
nothing to get excited about, as the fact we exist is no reason to 
rejoice”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no reason to rejoice when we have food banks just 
about on every corner.  There is nothing to rejoice about when, in 
the past, a person could walk the streets of Montreal and not see 
all those people—

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, 
I rise on a point of order.  In view of the fact that the House 
is scheduled to adjourn at this time, I wonder if you would seek 
the unanimous consent of the House to extend the time by two 
minutes to allow the member who moved this motion an opportunity 
to reply before the House adjourns. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B>  Does the hon. member 
have the consent of the House? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Agreed.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Libby Davies (Vancouver East, NDP):</B>  Madam Speaker, I 
would like to thank the members of the House for consenting to a 
further few minutes to conclude this debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I only regret that we could not have a longer debate beyond the 
designated time. I feel if we could have had some more debate in 
this House, we would have had an interesting dialogue and 
exchange of ideas about this motion that is before us today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I listened very carefully to the members from the other parties 
in the House in terms of their response to this motion.  I would 
like to say that while I hear the Liberal members say that they 
are sensitive to the plight of poor Canadians, I really believe 
that the programs that have been put forward by the Liberal 
government are very superficial and do not even begin to address 
the damage that has been done since 1993. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member from the Liberal Party spoke about the child tax 
benefit as being a positive sign that things are improving. 
However the reality is that if this is an anti-poverty measure, 
why does it not apply to people who are on social assistance? Why 
will the child tax benefit not be fully indexed?  If it was an 
anti-poverty measure, it would be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my riding we had a round table on youth unemployment.  One of 
the concerns was brought forward by young people themselves. 
Because many of the government programs are not sustained and 
because they do not have a continuity in terms of training and 
moving people into good paying jobs, young people become very 
frustrated. They get into a program, it ends and before they know 
it they are back on the street or they are back in the unemployed 
lines. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The issue before us today is to set timetables, to set targets 
for a full employment strategy. I believe this can be 
accomplished if the government is seriously committed to it by a 
program of fair taxation, by a national housing program, by 
encouraging the provinces to adopt a minimum wage that is 
liveable, by ensuring that welfare rates are above the poverty 
line, and by reducing student debt. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have not talked about the issues raised by the Royal 
Commission on Aboriginal Peoples, where we see the greatest 
poverty in this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe that these are things that can be done by the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B>  The time provided for 
the consideration of Private Members' Business has now expired 
and the order is dropped from the order paper. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It being 8.32 p.m., the House stands adjourned until 10 a.m. 
tomorrow, pursuant to Standing Order 24(1).
