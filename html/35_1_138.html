	<B>Hon. Sheila Finestone (Secretary of State 
(Multiculturalism) (Status of Women), Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
today, December 6, is the day that all parties in the House have 
unanimously proclaimed national day of remembrance and 
action on violence against women.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	These young women were smart, ambitious and hardworking. 
They had much to contribute to their families and to their 
country. All this was stolen from them in a burst of gunfire.
<P>
	Today, 14 red roses have been placed at the entrance of the 
Chamber. Each rose represents the life of a young woman, a life 
full of promise, a life full of dreams, a life cut short by a 
horrifying act of violence by a man who voiced the old hidden 
belief that women do not have the right to equal status in a man's 
world.
<P>
	The tragedy was a catalyst for action and the rose has become 
a symbol in memory of the women who died. It appears on the 
YWCA buttons sold each year as part of its campaign to address 
violence against women. It appears on the Canadian Labour 
Congress lapel pin as part of its new campaign.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Every year, since 1989, increasing numbers of individuals and 
organizations have joined forces with women's groups and other 
community organizations in order to bring about social change. 
The Federation of Canadian Municipalities, the Canadian Union 
of Public Employees, the Quebec women's federation-many 
people are trying to make a difference in their community.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Our government is also a partner for change. Last week the 
Minister of Justice announced the government's intention to ban 
the type of gun that was used in Montreal. Firearms control is a 
life and death issue for women. In the new proposals anyone 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8660"> 8660 </A></B>
<P>
charged with criminal harassment such as stalking will 
temporarily be prohibited from owning a firearm.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	A national firearms registry would have enormous 
advantages. When responding to a domestic violence call, 
police would know if there was a registered firearm at the 
address in question.
<P>
<B>(1010) </B>
<P>
	Last year, Statistics Canada reported that, based on the 
definition of violence in the Criminal Code, half of Canadian 
women have been victims of violence in their adult life, often 
more than once. Men they know pose more of a danger to them 
than strangers.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The foundation of the federal government's multifaceted 
approach to violence against women in Canadian society is 
legislation, giving protection under the law. We have made this a 
priority. It is part of the solution, clearly our part. We are also 
working in new ways to facilitate community action.
<P>
	I am pleased to have tabled today the publication entitled 
``Community Stories: Taking Action on Violence Against 
Women''. It chronicles the experience of 10 communities that 
took part in a demonstration project of a community kit on 
violence against women. Both community stories and the 
community kit are tremendous resources for grassroots action in 
our own neighbourhoods. They are a source of inspiration on 
what is possible.
<P>
	There are many other excellent resources available today for 
increased safety and security for all women in the workplace, in 
municipalities and in relationships. Violence against women is 
simply unacceptable. We must work together to change attitudes 
and behaviour that give rise to these acts, to these terrible 
tragedies.
<P>
	Gender violence does not just threaten women; it threatens 
their families, their loved ones and all of us. It tears at the very 
fabric of our society. We need to act not just for ourselves but for 
our daughters and our granddaughters. It is for their right to 
walk safely and earn fairly anywhere in our Canada.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Christiane Gagnon (Québec, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is 
with a great deal of emotion that we are reminded today of a cold 
and snowy day, five years ago, when 14 female students of 
l'École polytechnique de Montréal were shot and killed by a 
young man who had a visceral hatred of women, and feminists in 
particular. These women, like many others, had families, 
friends, hopes. Such senseless acts have sounded a call, a 
heart-rending call, in Quebec and Canada, and even had an echo 
in the United States.
<P>
	Violence against women must stop. The word was out before 
this tragic incident, but the atrocity of these murders created a 
new awareness of a reality experienced by a great number of 
women.
<P>
	From then on, all forms of violence against women were to be 
seen under a much harsher light. For instance, a harder and more 
serious look was taken at one of the most revolting aspects of 
our society. Conjugal violence must stop and we must take all 
the necessary steps to stop it. Spousal violence is widespread in 
Quebec and Canada. The figures are alarming. Let me just quote 
a few here. This fall, Statistics Canada reported that 29 per cent 
of women who had been married or in a common law 
relationship were physically or sexually assaulted by their 
spouse at one time or another in their life together.
<P>
	It is reported that 21 per cent of spousal assaults occur when 
women are pregnant. Physical abuse may or may not be 
accompanied by psychological abuse. The blows, injuries, death 
threats, and humiliations leave permanent psychological scars 
in women, as well as in the children who often witness and are 
themselves victims of the abuse.
<P>
	Since the second half of the 1970s, homes for battered women 
have mushroomed. The care and services they provide 
unquestionably meet a fundamental need in our communities. 
However, the issue of funding is much thornier and the financial 
support they receive from the federal government is far from 
adequate. Funding programs for housing that used to help these 
shelters open up new places for battered women now have no 
budget. This government decided instead to offer public funds to 
private owners.
<P>
<B>(1015) </B>
<P>
	Last February's budget did not provide any financing for a 
campaign to address violence against women, despite the formal 
promise contained in the red book. Nevertheless, all provincial 
governments as well as the federal government must do even 
more to promote awareness and spread information in order to 
eliminate violence against women.
<P>
	Another statistic involving women has to do with firearms. 
Firearms are the weapon of choice used in spousal homicides. 
Between 1974 and 1992, 42 per cent of women killed by their 
spouses were shot dead.
<P>
	In this context, Bloc members, like most Quebecers and 
Canadians, eagerly awaited the bill on how the federal 
government would effectively control firearms. Unfortunately, 
the Minister of Justice was rather timid in announcing a policy 
statement on gun control. Surprisingly enough, despite the 
urgent need for gun control, this bill will be implemented over 
the next seven years until 2002.
<P>
	We also fail to understand why all 4,000 AK-47 and 6,000 
FN-FAL owners will be allowed to keep these weapons for the 
rest of their lives. All 555,000 Canadians who own .25 or .32 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8661"> 8661 </A></B>
<P>
caliber handguns or 105-mm guns will also be able to keep them 
until they die.
<P>
	Heidi Rathjen is to be commended for her determination and 
her work in the Coalition for Gun Control, which helped 
highlight the importance of controlling guns in Canada and 
Quebec. Her crusade will not be in vain.
<P>
	The victims and survivors of the massacre at the École 
Polytechnique will live in our collective conscience for many 
years to come. We must not, however, forget that this violence 
still goes on on a different scale, often far from the spotlights 
and the cameras.
<P>
	In 1993, 63 women were killed by their spouses, 49 by their 
legal or common law husbands and 14 by separated or divorced 
spouses. Another 63 roses could have been laid at the entrance to 
the House of Commons and in front of all provincial 
legislatures.
<P>
	Every time an injured woman seeks refuge in a shelter for 
battered women, every time a woman decides to sue her abusing 
spouse, every time a woman leaves her home to start a new life, 
it is another step forward in the campaign to eliminate violence.
<P>
	On December 6, 1989, 14 students at the École Polytechnique 
were silenced forever, but we cannot remain silent.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Miss Deborah Grey (Beaver River, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise 
to pay tribute today as well to the 14 women who five years ago 
were brutally murdered at l'École polytechnique. We deplore 
such violence in our society and must make every effort to 
reform the criminal justice system so that tragedies like this are 
avoided.
<P>
	On December 6, 1989 one of the worst nightmares in this 
society came to pass when one sick individual went into our 
schools and gunned down 14 young women. Crime is a terrible 
fact in our society that we must do our best to eradicate. It 
affects us all.
<P>
	Not only was that murder deplorable but there have been 
several since, maybe not on that large scale, but certainly the 
fact is when anyone is murdered in this country it is too many.
<P>
	It is reported that violent crime is on the rise. Since 1988 in 
the nation's capital alone, here in Ottawa total violent crime is 
up 75 per cent. Considering this alarming statistic, let us look 
together at a solution to the situation, not always look back in 
time but forward as to how we can avoid these things in the 
future.
<P>
	We must be cautious not to give the impression that the 
problems of violence in our society only affect women. We need 
to be very careful that is not the only thing we talk about. They 
are not simply women's issues. All men must not be branded. 
Most Canadian men abhor violence. They do not condone it, nor 
do they want to be put on a guilt trip for one maniac who went 
crazy and committed such a deplorable act.
<P>
	These issues affect all members of our society. Violence is 
perpetrated on many areas of our society, certainly violence 
against women but also men, seniors and children. The largest 
category of violent crime is male violence against other males. 
We have grandparents and seniors who are verbally and 
physically abused, and let us not forget the children. Our 
vulnerable children are being preyed on more and more.
<P>
<B>(1020) </B>
<P>
	The government pays lip service and expresses a sincere 
intent to address the issue of violence against women. The 
minister just said we need to act. However, on looking back at 
the legislative agenda of this government for the last year it 
seems that there has been very little action taken that will 
remedy the situation.
<P>
	There needs to be fairness in the system. Sentencing for 
violent crimes needs to be fair. Recently in Surrey-White 
Rock-South Langley a father of two murdered his wife, put her 
back into bed, and after the crime he admitted to a friend what he 
had done. He was not convicted of murder one or murder two but 
simply of manslaughter. His defence was that his wife had 
threatened to spread a rumour that he was molesting his 
children. He was sentenced to five years in jail, but he served 
only two of them for killing his wife. This is intolerable.
<P>
	I would hope that the minister would hear me when I say that 
we must have punishment in place for criminals that fits the 
crime. Unfortunately the government aims at the wrong people 
in society and at the wrong sector for getting tough with 
criminals such as someone who could kill his wife and simply 
serve two years of his sentence. That is intolerable.
<P>
	If we want to truly stop the tide of violence in society we must 
start one small step at a time. We are willing to take that step. We 
are willing to make the commitment. We are willing to make the 
tough decisions that will protect our women, our children and 
our men. If we really want to make a difference and show 
Canada that we are truly sick and tired of senseless crimes the 
government should take action now to keep people from beating, 
raping or killing people, and then using the excuse that we have 
seen recently that they were simply too drunk to know what they 
were doing and so they get away with the crime.
<P>
	If the Secretary of State for the Status of Women wants to 
safeguard women, children and men in Canada, surely she will 
use her influence around the cabinet table to get rid of the 
drunkenness defence. I urge the secretary of state to listen to 
Canadians and to push the Minister of Justice to introduce an 
amendment to the Criminal Code now. We have given our 
consent that we would let this be passed within 24 hours.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8662"> 8662 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Finestone:</B> On what?
<P>
	<B>Miss Grey:</B> ``On what'', the minister asks of me. 
Unfortunately she did not hear what I said. Let me reiterate it 
because it is that important.
<P>
	Our party said that we would give unanimous consent to an 
amendment to the Criminal Code to get rid of the drunkenness 
defence immediately. If the minister is sincere, if she is serious 
about making sure that violence is not perpetrated on other 
people in our society, especially people whom they know and 
ultimately care about, surely we could pass that amendment 
now. That would be true action. I think nothing would speak 
louder than an amendment to the Criminal Code.
<P>
	I urge the secretary of state to listen to Canadians and to push 
the Minister of Justice to introduce an amendment to the 
Criminal Code.
<P>
	My colleagues across are saying ``What about gun control?''. 
Yes, gun control for the people who are abusing guns and 
making sure that those people pay the price. This needs to be 
done now.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> What does this have to do with it?
<P>
	<B>Miss Grey:</B> That was my question exactly: What does this 
have to do with it?
<P>
	Since the Supreme Court ruled on the Daviault case, the 
drunkenness defence has been used successfully three times in a 
matter of weeks. If this government were serious about it we 
could have this passed by the Christmas break and I look 
forward to working with the government on bringing that in.
<P>
	We look forward to making sure that justice not be put on 
hold. Our women, our children and our men expect nothing less 
from the government, from the secretary of state and from the 
Minister of Justice. They expect action now.
<P>
	<B>Ms. McLaughlin:</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like to ask the House 
for unanimous consent to reply to the ministerial statement.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> Is there unanimous consent?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Audrey McLaughlin (Yukon, NDP):</B> Mr. Speaker, five 
years ago we rose in this House to commemorate the 14 young 
women who were killed in Montreal and today we must 
remember these 14 women, their families and friends, and also 
propose actions for a policy of zero tolerance of violence against 
women.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Five years ago when we stood in this House and sadly 
recognized and commemorated the tragedy of the Montreal 
massacre we all committed ourselves to action.
<P>
<B>(1025) </B>
<P>
	It is true that awareness of the issue has increased since that 
time. While there is never any positive aspect to the loss of such 
young lives, I think we can say that following that massacre 
there has been much more attention to the issue.
<P>
	While there has been much condemnation there is still much 
to do. Far too little has been done. Sadly few steps have been 
taken which would actually end the violence; some have, but too 
few. I would say for example that the current social security 
review that is being undertaken does not address the question of 
violence but indeed does address the possibility of less funding 
under the Canada assistance plan for the provinces and 
territories which fund transition homes and those organizations 
which help who are under threat of violence.
<P>
	As well we have seen several recent court judgments which 
excuse assault and sexual assault on the grounds of intoxication 
or the use of drugs. This is totally unacceptable. If we are to be 
committed to zero tolerance in our society, I join with others in 
this House to demand that government take action on this issue 
now. I assure you, Mr. Speaker, that this party will support such 
immediate action.
<P>
	As we remember those who lost their lives five years ago, we 
again recommit ourselves to real action. I call on the 
government to start today with that real action.

	<B>Hon. Audrey McLaughlin (Yukon, NDP):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
pursuant to Standing Order 36 I am pleased to deposit a petition 
today from residents of virtually every province from coast to 
coast in Canada.
<P>
	The petitioners suggest that research conducted by Health 
Canada shows that the number of people, particularly teenagers, 
who smoke increases as the cost of cigarettes goes down. 
Tobacco products are clearly linked to forms of cancer, heart 
disease, stroke, emphysema, chronic bronchitis and many other 
illnesses. Given the fact that tobacco products contain over 
4,000 chemicals of which at least 43 cause cancer in humans and 
that the use of tobacco products is directly responsible for the 
premature death of some 38,000 Canadians annually tobacco 
can rightly be termed a hazardous product.
<P>
	Therefore the petitioners call upon Parliament to remove the 
exemption for tobacco under the Hazardous Products Act.

	<B>Hon. Audrey McLaughlin (Yukon, NDP):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
wish to bring before the House an important matter requiring the 
urgent attention of the House of Commons.
<P>
<B>(1035 ) </B>
<P>
	Five years have passed since the murder of the 14 women at 
l'École polytechnique in Montreal yet violence does continue at 
alarming rates. More than half of all Canadian women will 
experience in their lifetime at least one incident of violence. 
Therefore I have put forward the request today for an emergency 
debate on this issue.
<P>
	We have to date and this morning certainly acknowledged and 
given our condolences to the families of the 14 young women 
who were so sadly and tragically murdered five years ago. 
However it is incumbent upon this House to show its seriousness 
in this matter and have a true debate on this issue. The 
government should hear proposals of members of this House 
from all parties.
<P>
	I urge that this motion for an emergency debate be accepted.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> This topic indeed is a very serious one and I 
would make these points. This is a chronic matter for our society 
to deal with. As the motion stands now it is not in the strictest 
sense a matter for an emergency debate. However all this might 
be moot in view of the fact it is my understanding that in just a 
short while I will be reading a motion in orders of the day. All 
hon. members will be able to join in to make their views known 
on this very important topic.
<P>
	I wish to inform the House that pursuant to Standing Order 
33(2) because of the ministerial statement Government Orders 
will be extended by 20 minutes.

<BLOCKQUOTE>That this House take note of the anniversary of the murder of 14 young 
women at l'École polytechnique on December 6, 1989 and the continuing 
urgent need for action to eliminate the threat of violence in society, including 
the threat of violence to women.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	She said: Mr. Speaker, I am most pleased that the House has 
unanimously agreed to address this issue of violence against 
women in our society. This issue has become pervasive and has 
created concern for the men and women in this House and of 
course many organizations, associations and groups outside of 
this House.
<P>
	The House has accepted the resolution unanimously to 
acknowledge the issue of the women who were murdered 
unconscionably five years ago. That unfortunate circumstance 
has given us the excellent opportunity for us to look at this issue 
not from a partisan political perspective but more in the interests 
of the well-being of the women and children and the 
responsibility that women have for the future of our society, for 
the well-being of the children, for the education and for the 
community work that is needed and is often the role of women.
<P>
	Women have many roles in our society. Not only are they the 
progenitors of the future, they also educate and train our 
children. They do a great amount of community based work and 
care for the elderly. As well women are in the workforce. 
Women bear tremendous amounts of stress and strain. The last 
thing they need is a lack of respect, understanding and 
appreciation of the multiplicity and the importance of their role 
for all of us in our society.
<P>
	I am pleased to rise to speak on this topic. I am pleased there 
was unanimous approval in this House to proceed in this way. 
This morning in commemoration of the national day of 
remembrance and action on violence against women, I talked 
about statistics and the magnitude of the problem in Canada. I 
would like to put forward a fact sheet to which women and men 
can refer and which organizations and institutions can look at to 
take proper concerted action together so we can win the fight 
against violence against women.
<P>
<B>(1040 ) </B>
<P>
	In 1993 Statistics Canada conducted a national survey on 
violence against women. Approximately 12,300 women were 
interviewed. Only behaviours considered an offence under the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8665"> 8665 </A></B>
<P>
Criminal Code of Canada were  addressed in this survey. In fact, 
they were quite specific about what they were prepared to look 
at and include in the survey.
<P>
	The survey included a wide range of behaviours such as the 
threat of imminent attack, attack with serious injury, unwanted 
sexual touching up to and including violent sexual attacks with 
severe injury. The findings are chilling and should advise us 
here in the House about our responsibility to represent, to speak 
for and to speak out in the interests of our constituents, half of 
whom are women.
<P>
	In Canada 51 per cent of all women have experienced at least 
one incident of violence since the age of 16. Women are at 
greater risk from men they know than they are from strangers. 
Twenty-five per cent of all women have experienced violence at 
the hand of a current or past marital partner. In those cases 
weapons were used by 44 per cent of violent spouses. 
Twenty-one per cent of women abused by current or previous 
partners were assaulted during pregnancy; this is absolutely the 
most repugnant of the statements as far as I am concerned. One 
in six currently married women reported violence by their 
spouses and 39 per cent of those women said it happened more 
than once.
<P>
	For sources of support that most women need and use, 51 per 
cent of women who ask for help turn to friends and neighbours 
and 42 per cent turn to family. Those figures come from the 
violence against women surveys in the Statistics Canada daily of 
November 18, 1993.
<P>
	We also know how important are the homes for battered 
women, the transition houses and the groups that work right at 
the community base on these issues of violence. They enable 
women to leave their homes, take their children and protect 
themselves. They enable the women to get legal aid and some 
advice and counselling.
<P>
	I sincerely hope that more work will be done with the 
batterers. If we leave them out there it will mean that some other 
woman is put at risk. We need to do work in that regard.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The other important aspect illustrated by this information on 
violence against women in Canada is that of women and 
firearms. On average, one woman is killed by a firearm every six 
days in Canada, often in a private residence and by someone she 
knows.
<P>
	Firearms are the weapon of choice in spousal homicides. 
Between 1974 and 1992, 42 per cent of women murdered by 
their spouses were killed by bullets, 21 per cent were stabbed 
and another 21 per cent died from blows received.
<P>
	During that same period, a married woman was nine times 
more likely to be killed by her spouse than by a stranger, and 
there were a total of 1,886 spousal homicides. Women were the 
victims in 76 per cent of cases. According to a study on domestic 
homicides conducted by the Department of Justice in 1992, only 
18  per cent of firearms used by husbands who killed their wives 
were acquired illegally.
<P>
	These are important facts to consider on a day like today and 
during a debate such as this one.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	I would like to talk about this whole issue in terms of the 
human toll. The following testimonial is from a woman living in 
Canada today: ``My husband struck me on our honeymoon. He 
killed our first child by kicking the four month old child in my 
uterus. My doctor asked me what I did and what I do to make him 
so mad. Our Anglican minister reminded me that I had married 
for better or worse. The lawyer wanted to know where I would 
get money to pay the fees. My mother told my husband where I 
was hiding''.
<P>
<B>(1045) </B>
<P>
	The voice is a chilling one. It is an incisive call for change in 
the attitudes throughout Canadian society.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	I want to point out two important realities for Canadian 
women. The first one is that we are more likely to be abused by 
an acquaintance, that is a spouse or a friend, as the hon. member 
from the opposition and I mentioned earlier. I feel it is very 
important for women to know that this is the reality and that they 
should take it into consideration before talking or making 
arrangements with anyone.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	I just finished outlining some of the highlights of a Statistics 
Canada survey from last year. I did not outline the impact on the 
children who witness this violence and then become repeaters, 
carrying on this behaviour pattern into their own relationships 
with women. We find that half of the women reporting violence 
by men are known to them: dates, boyfriends, marital partners, 
friends, family and neighbours. It is very disquieting.
<P>
	The second reality that I want to impress on the House is that 
violence and women's inequality are inextricably linked. 
Violence is a manifestation of women's inequality. In the words 
of another women: ``When my husband stole a pizza he got a 
$100 fine. He beats me and sometimes he gets a $50 fine. I think 
this is awful. I am worth less than a pizza''.
<P>
	What messages do these words send to all women about our 
worth? How deeply entrenched are the old views that it is a 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8666"> 8666 </A></B>
<P>
man's right to control his wife and his daughters, that, as in past 
centuries, women are possessions?
<P>
	Admitting that these attitudes exist is an important step in 
finding solutions. As I said earlier today, I am encouraged by the 
level of community action taking place across Canada. As a 
nation we are beginning to hear what women's groups have been 
saying for years, that violence against women is pervasive in 
Canada, that it is tolerated and that violence is the most 
deplorable symptom of women's inequality.
<P>
	On behalf of the people of Canada I would like to extend our 
thanks to the women and to the grassroots groups that started the 
shelter movement, staffed the assault crisis centres and started 
self-healing circles. They were determined to get the public's 
attention. We must ensure that their voices continue to be heard 
and support the work and the undertakings they have made.
<P>
	The government understands that violence against women 
results from complex inter-related factors. That is why we 
favour a comprehensive approach to this issue. I was asked by 
one of the members of the opposition to explain the question of 
drunkenness and the Supreme Court of Canada ruling which 
cited extreme drunkenness as a defence in a case of sexual 
assault. This defence has since been successfully used in several 
other lower court cases. I find this to be totally unacceptable. 
The women of our caucus and I have spoken to the Minister of 
Justice. The Minister of Justice is equally outraged. However, 
the charter and the Constitution speak before the courts.
<P>
	The question is how to amend the laws of this land so they will 
not be found wanting when we go to the courts. This kind of 
abysmal, unacceptable behaviour can no longer take place and 
be accepted and certainly that unenlightened judges do not use 
proper defence mechanisms from my perspective.
<P>
	I would like the House to know that the Minister of Justice 
intends to propose amendments which he has pointed out several 
times. He will present an amendment to the Criminal Code to 
deal with self-intoxication as a defence when the House 
resumes in February. This Friday, on December 9, he is holding 
discussions with groups that have a tremendous interest in 
seeing the reduction of violence and enabling us to move 
forward in our agenda against violence against women.
<P>
<B>(1050) </B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Some members of this House claimed that we did not take 
important measures. As I said before, our responsibility lies 
primarily in passing appropriate legislation, and I believe that, 
in this respect, we truly made critical choices on a series of 
actions which will ultimately be complemented by other 
measures later on this year.
<P>
	I also think that it must be recognized that we have taken 
important measures. Let us take a look at the firearms control 
program. On November 30, the Minister of Justice announced a 
gun control program, an important step towards eliminating 
violence against  women. The development of a national fire 
arms registry, the ban on some firearms and the relaxation of 
prohibition orders are all measures that can be beneficial to 
women and used to save lives.
<P>
	The National Crime Prevention Council was set up in July 
1994. Among other issues, this Council will study how women 
are vulnerable to crime. The Council is made up of 25 members, 
14 of whom are women, who come from all walks of life. As for 
keeping the peace, in June, the Minister of Justice tabled Bill 
C-42, which contains more than 100 changes to the Criminal 
Code, including various provisions to improve our efforts to 
keep the peace. For example, the police and other stakeholders 
will be able to ask for a peace bond in order to protect women in 
danger.
<P>
	The national screening system to identify individuals who 
have sexually assaulted children is the fourth part of our 
approach. Announced in November, this database will enable 
organizations and employers to check if a job applicant has a 
criminal record for sexual offences before allowing the 
applicant to work with children. I think that this is the fifth bill 
on sentencing reform.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	I would say to members that the sentencing reform is an 
important piece of legislation.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Bill C-41 gives the courts the means to make a distinction 
between serious violent crimes and less serious non-violent 
crimes. This sends a clear message to society: violence against 
women and children will not be tolerated. The bill stipulates that 
evidence that a crime, including a sexual offence, was motivated 
by hate or that the offender abused a position of trust or 
authority will be deemed by the judge to be an aggravating 
factor for the purpose of sentencing.
<P>
	I must say that the opposition's complaints are unfounded 
because we have made progress. We also looked at the issue of 
equality before the law. Take the court challenges program, for 
example. In October 1994, the government reinstated that 
program in order to provide funding for cases of national 
interest regarding equality rights or language rights under the 
Canadian constitution.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	In giving this list I do not think there can be complaints by the 
opposition as to the undertakings of the government with respect 
to violence against women. The facts should speak for 
themselves. Certainly there are other issues to which I can point. 
These include the question of legal equality, which is the court 
challenges program I just talked about, and public education.

<P>
	In April Canadian heritage, in collaboration with other 
federal departments and the Canadian Association of 
Broadcasters, launched a series of radio and television programs 
and ads in the first of a three-year campaign on violence in 
society. I want to thank the Canadian Association of 
Broadcasters for the undertaking. That is $10 million worth of 
publicity which we have enabled to happen. It will ensure that 
violence against women and children, violence in society and 
violence based on race, prejudice, hatred and bigotry no longer 
find a home in this country.
<P>
	I just deposited in the House today a community kit on 
violence against women. It is to promote community action so 
that people in their own backyards, leur petit patelins, will take 
responsibility for auditing what is dangerous in their society and 
for undertaking collective community action to prevent 
violence and promote safety.
<P>
	The community kit on violence against women was tested in 
10 locations across the country. The stories tell us what took 
place, what was helpful, what was not helpful, and how the audit 
was a positive factor in small towns and regions and in larger 
cities.
<P>
	We have published those stories and I think members would 
find them interesting reading. I advise members of the House to 
take a good look at this kit, take it back to their towns and 
villages and enable their constituents to take control of their 
own lives. We must control the violence that is inherent in our 
society and make sure that our women and children can walk the 
streets of our cities safely and can live in safe homes.
<P>
	Over 2,000 projects have been funded across the country by 
Health Canada on child abuse, on violence against women and 
on senior abuse. The family violence initiative is now in its 
fourth year. It also funds the building of shelters for abused 
women and their children.
<P>
	In June I met with my colleagues, the ministers of the status of 
women across Canada, in Regina. We discussed the whole 
question of violence against women. We discussed it from the 
provincial perspective and we discussed it from the federal 
perspective. We discussed what initiatives we each could take, 
collectively and collaboratively, to ensure that the lives of 
women and children were safe. We issued a Regina declaration 
on the rights of women subjected to violence. It calls on justice 
systems across this land to ensure the equal protection of women 
subjected to violence.
<P>
	In November 1993 we received the Statistics Canada research 
which was very important. In April of this year Statistics Canada 
released data from a transition home survey. It revealed there 
was a 2 per cent increase in the occupancy rate from 1992 to 
1993 by women fleeing from abusive situations.
<P>
	Most women using shelters are aged 25 to 34. These women 
are in their child bearing years and are subjected to violence by 
aggressive men even when pregnant. They have children in their 
homes who are visibly upset and mentally disturbed by what 
they see, action taken against women as something acceptable 
within their society. Less than 10 per cent of shelters primarily 
served ethnocultural and visible minority women, although 41 
per cent offered culturally sensitive services.
<P>
	The Minister of Justice, the Minister of Health and I have 
conducted public consultations. We held consultations with 
women's groups on violence as well as on the budget and social 
security reform. This is a very important and effective means of 
understanding what is going on in our society.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	During the first year of our mandate, I think we have given top 
priority to legislation aimed at better protecting women and 
children. The protection provided by law is the very foundation 
of personal and public security.
<P>
<B>(1100 ) </B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	As we move to support the program that has been presented by 
my colleague, the Minister of Justice, on firearms control, I 
would suggest that we have an obligation to the women of the 
country. Women do not like guns. That is a pretty obvious 
understatement. Women are fearful of guns.
<P>
	I do not have to argue that the issue of firearms control is one 
of crucial importance to women. Nationally women have 
already spoken out. Numerous women's organizations from 
across the country and from a wide variety of social and cultural 
backgrounds have come forward to support tougher firearms 
control laws.
<P>
	If people want to own firearms then let them own them with 
responsibility. You have to get a licence and do various other 
things to own a car. For goodness sake, what is so terrible about 
doing the same thing to own a gun? We are not taking them away 
from people. Those people who object to firearms control 
should not object to having us know that they own a gun. It does 
not make any sense to have it any other way. Tighter restrictions 
on firearms are what we want and that is what we are responding 
to.
<P>
	I would like to answer the Reform Party which is not very 
pleased with this. A poll conducted recently by Angus Reid 
revealed that as many as 70 per cent of all Canadians 
interviewed favoured tighter restrictions on firearms. Firearm 
control is also supported by Canadian teachers. In a joint 
statement two weeks ago the Canadian Teachers Federation and 
the Centrale de l'enseignement du Québec agreed that a series of 
measures, including the Minister of Justice's package on 
firearms control, was necessary to reduce violence in our 
society.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8668"> 8668 </A></B>
<P>
	The Minister of Justice has consulted across the land from big 
cities to small cities to the towns and villages. He has met with 
all kinds of organizations. He has listened and he has adjusted, 
understanding the needs and the sport recreational aspects. He 
also understands what women have to say. Every one of us ought 
to support his measures.
<P>
	We have also taken other legal measures. I think of how 
important the peace bond was in the amendments to the Criminal 
Code and the sentencing on abuse of trust. How many of us know 
about incestual relationships that have taken place? How many 
of us know of friends and children and particularly relatives 
whom we call on to babysit for us, who do not have a code of 
ethics and abuse that trust, teachers who have abused the trust, 
priests who have abused the trust? Abuse of trust and sexual 
abuse are not acceptable in Canadian society. We are moving on 
that bill.
<P>
	We have established the national information system, the 
court challenges program. Other initiatives to improve the 
status of women, although not necessarily dealing with violence 
and abuse against women are equally important. There is the 
creation of the national breast cancer information exchange 
program, the establishment of the prenatal nutrition program 
and our work to help women achieve economic equality.
<P>
	Economic equality gives women the freedom to move away 
from an abusive situation. If a woman is trapped with no money 
she fears leaving. Economic equality in our society tells women 
that their work is valued, that their contributions to society are 
honoured and respected. Therefore economic equality will help 
women care for themselves and their children, give them a sense 
of worth and a sense of independence, not merely out of the 
generosity of the heart of her husband, but because she 
contributes to his growth and development, to his success. She is 
deserving of a fair share of those earnings if she stays at home 
and raises children. Raising children in today's society is a value 
in and of itself.
<P>
	I was very pleased to chair the task group on the treatment of 
child support. The government will be coming in shortly with a 
comprehensive package of guidelines for the courts. It will have 
an enforcement component and will look at tax treatment. This 
more comprehensive policy is long overdue.
<P>
	We must find a way so that not so many children in our 
country are poor. Children are poor when their mothers are poor. 
That too is a violence against women. It is a violence against 
people in our society.
<P>
<B>(1105) </B>
<P>
	I would like to close my remarks by talking for a few moments 
about the Beijing conference which is coming up. In the 
international arena Canada is seen as very important and 
effective in addressing the concerns of women.
<P>
	The machinery of government that we have set up to advise 
and counsel ministers on any kind of project, policy or 
legislation is seen as a very positive factor. The input our staff 
has made, because staff really equals service, and what we have 
been able to render in the international arena has been very 
important. We are not the only nation in the world seeking 
solutions to these issues. We can be proud of what we have done 
at the international level. We have played a leadership role in 
two key areas that I want to point out.
<P>
	First was the adoption by the United Nations General 
Assembly of the declaration of the elimination of violence 
against women last December.
<P>
	The second was the appointment of a United Nations special 
rapporteur on violence against women. That was an initiative of 
Canada as well. The rapporteur will report to the United Nations 
commission on human rights every year starting in March.
<P>
	I had the pleasure of meeting the young woman who is filling 
that responsibility. We can have a sense of confidence that we 
are going to move forward on the international stage in this area.
<P>
	In less than a year we will be meeting in Beijing for the fourth 
United Nations world conference on women. It has an enormous 
potential to act as a catalyst for change and progress on women's 
equality worldwide and particularly women's equality in China.
<P>
	The role of the NGOs, the non-government organizations, has 
been very key, very different from Mexico and Nairobi. They 
have had a significant input into the preliminary documents we 
will be examining at that time. Ten key areas and key issues are 
of concern. It will look at women's struggles with poverty, with 
violence, with access to education and health, with access to 
power and decision making, to name but a few.
<P>
	We want solutions to those problems right here for all 
Canadians. We do not have to wait until the UN world 
conference.
<P>
	I encourage the women in the House to renew their 
commitment to women's equality today. I encourage them to 
speak out. The government intends to fulfil all its red book 
commitments with respect to the increase in funding for services 
for battered women. Public education campaigns will be 
ongoing and will enable behaviour modification with the 
goodwill and support of the men as partners in society. The 
options for removal of abusers from the home shall certainly be 
part and parcel of what we look at.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	I am very happy to have had the opportunity here today to 
mention some of the things that make life more difficult for 
women. I look forward to working with our colleagues from the 
opposition and indeed with all Canadians, both men and women, 
who want to improve the lot of women, to prevent the increase in 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8669"> 8669 </A></B>
<P>
violence  against women and to try to educate the public in order 
to eliminate this problem in our society.
<P>
	The roses that all the members of the House placed in the hall 
on behalf of the 14 women indicate that the moment has come to 
rethink the society in which we live.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Let us remember. I thank all members of the House for the 
roses which were deposited outside in the hall.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Christiane Gagnon (Québec, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
have several things to say to this government, in response to the 
motion tabled in the House this morning. I have no doubts about 
the hon. member's sincerity, and I am sure that, as a woman, she 
is more than aware of the problem of violence against women.
<P>
<B>(1110) </B>
<P>
	There is no need to repeat the latest statistics ad nauseam. 
Everyone knows them. Statistics can shock and move us, and for 
a few moments we are upset. We have a spontaneous urge to say: 
Something has to be done. What are governments doing about 
this? It does not happen quite that way in real life. So many 
times we are filled with anger and sadness as we read in the 
papers that another woman was slain by her spouse or former 
spouse.
<P>
	Most people feel helpless to do anything about this 
phenomenon, and most people, unfortunately, do not feel 
directly concerned, and I will get back to this.
<P>
	The fact remains that violence against women is a social 
problem and that society elects governments to give leadership 
and ensure its collective well-being. Politicians are very much 
aware of their role in this respect. That is why during every 
election campaign, politicians reflect and analyse and make 
promises. Of course, no politician would dare promise to deal 
with violence, once and for all. However, since they are very 
aware of the public's expectations, they promise action and 
funding to renew the hopes and obtain the trust of the voters.
<P>
	As I said at the beginning of my speech, politicians are 
usually sincere. What happens after election day? Consider the 
present situation as an example. Since the situation exists here 
and now, people cannot accuse us of distorting the truth or 
letting the passage of time colour our perceptions.
<P>
	The present government was very well intentioned. Like 
everyone else, it analysed the situation and made promises. It 
promised to make eliminating violence one of its big priorities. 
It found ways to do this. It would launch a massive public 
awareness campaign against violence. It would promote a 
community-based approach. It would introduce strict gun 
controls. It would tighten the provisions of the Criminal Code in 
order to eliminate spousal violence.
<P>
	All this has a very direct and very specific connection with 
violence against women. Some progress has been made. The 
government will say it did not make any direct cuts in funding 
for shelters for female victims of violence, while other budget 
items were cut by 5 per cent.
<P>
	The government will also say it experimented with the use of 
community kits. On the whole, it will say it is aware of the 
problems experienced by women who are victims of violence.
<P>
	However, it has overlooked a number of things. It forgot about 
all the recommendations of the committees wich examined this 
problem, and met thousands of women and hundreds of agencies 
that worked with victims of violence. It forgot that they all 
reached the same conclusion: violence will continue as long as 
women are not treated as men's equals. That is the real problem. 
Women are unanimous in this.
<P>
	This government could take a step towards equality and 
recognize that women, who are directly concerned after all, are 
perfectly capable of identifying the source of their problems, the 
symptoms and the solutions. If this elusive equality is ever to be 
achieved, the government will have to start by trusting our 
abilities, at least in this area. Women are adults. To stop being 
victims, they must be recognized as equal to men and treated as 
such in every respect and by everyone, governments included. 
This sounds so simple and so obvious that I am sure many of my 
male colleagues are thinking: Equality is already a fact, so what 
are they complaining about? What else do they want?
<P>
	The answer is just as simple: Women want equality, and the 
government must help them, which it promised to do but did not.
<P>
	Equality means equal rights. It means equal social, human and 
economic rights. Equal social rights means that unemployed 
women are treated the same as their spouses and not like 
economic stopgaps who work just to be able to afford a few 
luxuries like a fur coat every five years. It means a woman has 
the right to work, study and participate fully in the labour 
market.
<P>
<B>(1115) </B>
<P>
	Equality will not happen with this government which is 
preparing to treat working women as second-class citizens who 
depend on their husbands for a living and for whom the country 
should not invest its precious resources.
<P>
	Equality means studying without accumulating a debt for a 
lifetime, if and when you can get a loan, because it is not so easy 
for women to borrow. How does this government expect women 
to be equal if they have to rely on men financially and on their 
husbands' bank account in order to get a diploma? It seems 
absurd! But that is exactly what this government is suggesting 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8670"> 8670 </A></B>
<P>
with its social reform. How on earth does the government 
intends to promote equality for women.
<P>
	It is also hard to understand how this government can resort so 
much to rhetoric on equality and at the same time do so little to 
make it easier for mothers to have access to the workplace. 
Adequate day care services often are essential for women 
entering the labour market or taking occupational training. But 
what have they done in that area? They promised they would 
create thousands of new places in day care centres and even 
included this in the budget.
<P>
	However, they robbed Peter to pay Paul. They made the 
creation of day care services conditional on the economic 
recovery. What a nice way to encourage job creation. What a 
perfect way to make sure women would stay home or rely on 
lower quality services for their children. This way, women can 
be accused of being bad mothers besides.
<P>
	This government prefers to keep matters pending before the 
courts and pay their lawyers handsomely instead of paying their 
employees adequately and enabling them to improve their 
financial situation and become more self-sufficient.
<P>
	Despite what women suggested, this government chose not to 
apply the Employment Equity Act to employees of Parliament, 
civil servants and employees of its many agencies and 
commissions and this same government talks about equality.
<P>
	It is the same government which did not see the need to 
re-establish a committee which would thoroughly analyze 
problems experienced by women. How serious is the 
government about improving the living conditions of women, 
Madam Speaker? We have committees for everything, but not 
for promoting the cause of women. Fine proof of the real 
concerns of this government.
<P>
	Equality also comes from fiscal justice, an area where the 
government does not really shine. How can it justify taking Mrs. 
Thibaudeau's case to the Supreme Court, when the decision 
brought some to parents, generally women, who receive support 
payments for their children. While the court was trying to 
restore some financial equity between the paying parent and the 
custodial parent, the Minister of Justice rushed to appeal, for 
fear of upsetting the Department of National Revenue. What a 
noble concern on the part of this government.
<P>
	So women are left to fend for themselves. You will tell me that 
a committee is looking into the matter. Sure, and maybe in the 
same breath you will tell me that the committee will find 
solutions. The solutions are obvious to all, but the government 
spends its time and energy consulting. It is probably easier than 
taking action. Equality suffers, but who cares. The 
government's money is being saved and God knows that is the 
real priority.
<P>
	Violence can take several forms.
<P>
<B>(1120) </B>
<P>
	It can be physical, and this is the most commonly recognized. 
It can psychological, and its consequences are just as severe, 
sometimes even more so. It could be financial and it could be 
emotional.
<P>
	Whatever its form, violence is the result of inequality, 
whether physical or economical. It is the concrete expression of 
the perception that one person is worth less than the other, is not 
as important as the other one, in the eyes of society and the 
spouse.
<P>
	To eliminate that perception, a tremendous amount of work 
must be done, first at the individual level, because that is where 
concrete results will be measured. However, as I said at the 
beginning, on the level of society as a whole, we need a 
government truly concerned about the problem, its 
consequences and root causes. All this government can do is 
make nice promises and hold public consultations. I urge it to 
take concrete action to help women achieve equality with men.
<P>
	When I say equality, I mean equality across the 
board-social, personal, legal and financial equality. I mean a 
government which will take the concrete action needed to make 
equality between men and women possible and to impose it. 
Then we will see violence against women diminish some day.
<P>
	I would like to tell you about an initiative taken in Quebec to 
mark the terrible tragedy that happened at the École 
Polytechnique. This initiative is co-sponsored by various 
communities: the business community, labour, the government, 
politicians, and associations.
<P>
	I would like to read the message these Quebec partners 
signed. It is entitled ``Never again''.
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>December 6, 1989 will remain forever engraved in our collective memory. 
On that day, 14 young women lost their lives at the École Polytechnique in 
Montreal, gunned down by a murderer who hated women. Five years later, we 
must turn our minds to the devastated families and their pain, to the sadness and 
the anger that overcame all of us, men and women alike.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>This tragic event shook our entire society. It revealed the truth that women 
are targets of violence on a daily basis, at work and in the street, in daylight 
hours as well as at night, in times of peace or war, regardless of the region or 
country in which they live.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Through the efforts of individuals, groups, and public or government 
organizations, various measures have been taken to identify and oppose 
violence against women. But we all know that it persists.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Each of us must be vigilant and condemn all forms of violence against 
women. We must commit ourselves collectively to building a non-violent 
world. December 6, 1989 must never return. NEVER AGAIN.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Today we remember- in order to change.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
	That, Madam Speaker, is the list of all the people who 
endorsed the statement marking this sad anniversary.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> We are now into 
20-minute speeches with 10 minutes for questions and 
comments at the end.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jack Ramsay (Crowfoot, Ref.):</B> Madam Speaker, as I 
enter the discussion regarding violence against members of 
society, particularly women, I begin by pointing out how human 
life seems to have been devalued in our society. When I look at 
the changes of attitude that have occurred in this regard, I look at 
such things as abortion, euthanasia and mercy killings. I see a 
greater and greater acceptance of these measures which suggests 
an insensitivity toward human life that has led to a devaluation 
of human life.
<P>
	Today marks an anniversary I am sure most Canadians wish 
did not exist. However, not to remember invalidates the lives 
that were lost as a result of a violent and vicious attack 
perpetrated because one male took out his fear, hate and 
frustration on a group of innocent young defenceless women.
<P>
	The cause of this crime is at the heart of the debate on violence 
against women and other members of our society. Why are men 
attacking women? Why are husbands beating wives? Why is 
violence against women occurring at such a high rate, certainly a 
higher rate than before.
<P>
	These are the questions we must attempt to answer if we are 
ever to eradicate or at least reduce violence.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8672"> 8672 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1130 ) </B>
<P>
	Until we can answer these questions and until we can 
determine the causes of violence, we will continue to have a 
problem in this country which defies logic and a problem which 
threatens to destroy the strongest foundation we have, the 
family.
<P>
	From 1981 to 1990 almost one half, or 48 per cent, of the 
women killed were killed by spouses or ex-spouses. A further 
27 per cent were killed by acquaintances. Over the past 10 years 
67 per cent of the homicides involving women occurred in the 
victims' homes. Spousal homicides amount to one out of every 
six solved homicides. According to statistics, over the period 
1974 to 1992 a married woman was nine times as likely to be 
killed by her spouse as by a stranger. The rates of spousal 
homicide have remained fairly constant over a 19-year period.
<P>
	These statistics reveal a shocking situation. Repeatedly 
governments in this country have neglected to address the issue 
which is the cause of crime. They have failed to determine, 
understand and do something about the causes of domestic 
violence. Harsher penalties, stricter gun controls and statistics 
gathering have done nothing to eliminate the rate of spousal 
homicide in this country, nothing to decrease the growing 
violence on Canadian streets and nothing to eradicate violence 
against women.
<P>
	Fifty-two per cent of the spousal homicides in 1991-92 were 
attributed by the police to an argument or quarrel and a further 
24 per cent to jealousy. What the statistics and police failed to 
reveal is what the argument or quarrel was about, why it 
occurred in the first place. I believe that finances and financial 
stress are at the heart of most domestic difficulties and 
arguments. Canadian families are under tremendous stress these 
days, stresses that are directly imposed on them by the economic 
state of this country and indirectly imposed on them by the fiscal 
and monetary mismanagement of this and previous 
governments.
<P>
	With an unemployment rate of 10.8 per cent, which I 
understand has dropped recently to below 10 per cent, many 
Canadians are without a job and for those who do have a job, the 
volatility and uncertainty of the current job market means that 
no one has job security.
<P>
	Years ago men and women could count on their job always 
being there. Job security is a thing of the past. We have not 
helped Canadians adapt to that situation. We have not helped 
Canadians adapt to many of the economic and social situations 
that have been rapidly destroying their way of life.
<P>
	While banks reveal record profits, many Canadians are 
declaring personal and business bankruptcy because their debt 
load has become unmanageable given the relatively high 
interest and tax rates in this country.
<P>
	We witness every day the impact financial stress is having on 
Canadian families. In 1991-92 statistics show that alcohol was 
involved in 37 per cent of slain wives and 82 per cent of slain 
husbands. Among perpetrators, 55 per cent of men and 79 per 
cent of women were noted to have consumed alcohol and 18 per 
cent of men and 13 per cent of women had used drugs.
<P>
	I pause here to emphasize that we do not address the cause of 
the problems. So often we are told not only in ads in newspapers 
but on television to ensure that when you are drinking that you 
have a designated driver so that you can get plastered if you 
want. The only concern those ad makers and those who are 
paying for them have is simply to ensure that a person is not 
impaired as he drives home. No care or concern is given to the 
family situation when that drunk is dropped off at his home 
where he may go in and abuse his wife or his children. There is 
no indication that there is any interest in reducing the 
consumption of alcohol in this country which police and 
statistics indicate clearly is a direct contributing factor to crime 
and violence in this country.
<P>
	According to statistics, alcohol was consumed by both parties 
in 41 per cent of wife victim cases and in 78 per cent of husband 
victim cases.
<P>
<B>(1135 ) </B>
<P>
	Alcohol abuse is induced by stress. We do nothing to help the 
alcoholic or solve his problem if we do not determine the cause 
of that stress.
<P>
	Why are Canadians assaulting and killing one another? That is 
the question which must be answered if we ever hope to reduce 
violence in our society. This is true whether we are dealing with 
young offenders, wife beaters, child molesters or murderers.
<P>
	Governments in co-operation with community and service 
organizations, churches, schools and Canadian families must 
find the answer to these questions. It is a monumental task but it 
is a task we must undertake because our traditional response to 
the problem of violence is not working.
<P>
	In response to public appeals for preventive action the 
Standing Committee on Justice and the Solicitor General 
unanimously agreed on May 6, 1992, exactly five months after 
the Tories' gun legislation, Bill C-17, received royal assent, to 
commence a national study of crime prevention. The committee 
concluded:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Traditional criminal justice responses while necessary are insufficient 
deterrents to acts that threaten public safety and security and the conventional 
crime control model fails to address the underlying factors associated with 
crime and criminality.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	In other words the committee found that the gun control 
legislation, sentencing, additional police officers and law 
enforcement agencies, more prisons and an increasingly 
negative bureaucratic answer do not and will not solve the 
growing problem of crime within this country.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8673"> 8673 </A></B>
<P>
	Presented to the committee were studies conducted in 
England, Canada and the United States. In relation to young 
offenders, these studies revealed that a minority of male 
offenders are responsible for the majority of all crimes 
committed.
<P>
	The president of the Quebec Association of Police and the 
director of the Hull police force described to the committee 
research findings showing that 80 per cent of crimes are 
committed by approximately 20 per cent of the offenders.
<P>
	Self reports and arrest records of offenders who have long 
criminal histories revealed to the committee that offending 
began when they were very young, that their offending became 
progressively more violent and that a significant proportion of 
persistent young offenders become the adult offenders of the 
future.
<P>
	A criminology professor with the University of Ottawa told 
the committee that about 75 per cent to 80 per cent of 
incarcerated adults were persistent offenders in their youth. The 
committee heard that the level of crime in a society cannot be 
separated from the social, economic and political milieu in 
which it occurs. Social science research has identified many 
interrelated factors in the social environment of persistent 
offenders that contribute to crime.
<P>
	Although the committee made a number of recommendations 
regarding crime prevention to the previous government based on 
its findings, the previous government did not introduce or even 
propose measures that demonstrated it was taking a leadership 
role in crime prevention.
<P>
	We have a new government but the same approach to crime. 
We seem to be satisfied to deal with the symptoms of crime 
rather than to get at the cause of crime. Until the government of 
the day can identify the cause of crime, until it can identify the 
reasons for domestic violence and violence against women, we 
will continue to have this problem.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, 
I congratulate the secretary of state for her excellent 
presentation on a very important matter to all members who are 
going to speak on this very important subject.
<P>
	I have one quick example to share with members about 
domestic violence. I spent about five years serving as a board 
member of the shelter for battered women in my riding of 
Mississauga South. It is called Interim Place. I am very pleased 
that Interim Place was able to arrange for additional funding and 
arrange for a second shelter to be built.
<P>
	Members would be interested to know that in one month alone 
while I was on the board 80 women were turned away from our 
shelter because there were no beds left. There was no place for 
them to go with their children. That gives some idea of the 
magnitude of the problem we have in Canada. As the minister 
has stated,  one half of all women will experience domestic 
violence in their lives.
<P>
<B>(1140) </B>
<P>
	I ask the member whether he would agree that because of the 
seriousness of the issue of domestic violence and the fact that 
there is presently a bill before this House, Bill C-41, which tries 
to identify aggravating circumstances of bias, prejudice or hate, 
that the matter of domestic violence or spousal abuse be 
included as a matter which would demonstrate bias, prejudice 
and hate and warrant a more serious sentence than the simple 
offence that was committed.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ramsay:</B> Madam Speaker, I thank the hon. member for 
his question. I think it is important. When we deal with penalties 
for offences committed, I think that if the state wishes to stiffen 
penalties we can do that, but we all ought to stand equal before 
the law. The courts and judges ought to be left with the 
discretion based upon the circumstances to decide whether a 
more severe penalty should be imposed upon the culprit who 
through motivation of hatred or bias commits an offence against 
another.
<P>
	I enforced the law for 14 years and I never saw an assault upon 
another person motivated by anything but anger, hatred or bias. I 
have never seen an assault conducted by a positive emotion of 
love or compassion. I have never experienced that. I have never 
taken anyone into court on that basis, and I have taken hundreds 
of people into courts for other types of offences during my 
service.
<P>
	When I consider the hon. member's question and I look at Bill 
C-41, I ask myself why is it that we cannot leave this matter to 
the courts. Yes, enhance the penalties, make them stiffer. Surely 
when the court feels that mitigating circumstances indicate a 
more serious penalty ought to be levied, the court should have 
the discretion to do so.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Ethel Blondin-Andrew (Secretary of State (Training 
and Youth), Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, I am pleased and honoured 
to join in the debate this morning that this House take note of the 
anniversary of the murder of 14 women at l'École polytechnique 
on December 6, 1989, and the continuing urgent need for action 
to eliminate the threat of violence in society, including the threat 
of violence against women.
<P>
	I find this debate particularly important because a year ago 
today I went to a memorial in Montreal. I spoke at the memorial 
for the 14 women. It is an experience that has left me with a 
commitment to society, a personal commitment to see that 
human beings show respect and dignity to one another that is 
deserved, a love, caring and commitment to work hard with all 
people in society.
<P>
	We must work with men, women, families and communities, 
different levels of government, all the institutions in our country 
and with our children, toward a violence free society. It is a very 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8674"> 8674 </A></B>
<P>
difficult thing to do in this day and age when the world is seized 
with wars.
<P>
<B>(1145) </B>
<P>
	We have mass media with pervasive influence that shows 
violence and there is desensitization about the effect of it. We 
have an onerous task not just to make laws but to make it a state 
of mind. We have a commitment to deal with it in a very human 
way. It is not just an issue on one day of the year; it is a state of 
mind. It is the way we live. It is the way we relate to each other. 
It is the state of mind with which we approach the work we do as 
lawmakers, as legislators.
<P>
	Recently I was unable to attend a conference in Vancouver and 
one of my female colleagues from the area replaced me as there 
were things that needed to be said that I felt very strongly about. 
These are some of the things that were said: ``Our voices need to 
be added to the urgent debate about the challenges facing 
Canada's families. Violence is not an issue of one person or of 
one gender. It is an issue of humanity and it is an issue of all 
peoples''.
<P>
	I am especially pleased to speak to the vision of Canadian 
families living violence free. I am proud to be a member of a 
team that dares to dream, one that has faith in our capacity as 
individuals and as a nation. Our dream for the country was 
clearly described in our document ``Creating Opportunity''. It is 
based on the belief that each of us can be part of the solution.
<P>
	I am particularly proud of my colleagues, the Minister of 
Justice and the Secretary of State for the Status of Women. It is 
not easy to seize particular issues that would help free society of 
those who would perpetrate violent acts and those who would 
take the opportunity not to do good. To roll that into a legislative 
agenda, to roll that into something that is accessible, fair and 
universal in approach, is very difficult.
<P>
	I look at the different attempts by the minister to change the 
Criminal Code and to deal with a number of very contentious 
issues, controversial issues, such as gun control legislation. A 
very difficult agenda is set for these individuals. I appreciate the 
work they have done.
<P>
	We are committed to changing the future and recreating 
Canada in a way that works better for all of us. We believe we 
can build a better country through stronger children and stronger 
families. People tend to focus on one issue or one aspect. 
Segmentation or compartmentalization of issues makes it easier, 
more manageable, but is not realistic.
<P>
	We cannot separate the child and say the child is unaffected. 
We cannot say the spouse, the family, the grandmother or the 
community is unaffected when there is violence in a family or in 
a community. It does not work that way. It is pervasive. The 
power of things that go wrong, the negative things, is very 
influential on people, many of whom are young children in their 
formative years.
<P>
	We are committed. Our vision stems from the simple but 
profound philosophy that everyone has the right to safe homes, 
safe streets, and a life free of violence. No one deserves to be 
abused physically, sexually, emotionally or financially. No one 
has the right to control another person by threat, coercion, 
physical intimidation or any other abuse of power and control. 
Child abuse and neglect, child sexual abuse, wife assault, 
spousal assault, other forms of violence against women and 
other people, and the mistreatment of seniors and persons with 
disabilities are serious abuses of power within families and 
relationships of trust and dependency with detrimental 
consequences for all of us. They shame us as individuals and as a 
society. Those are the people who depend on us the most. They 
have greater need and less capacity to care for themselves. They 
are the disabled, children and seniors. Those people do not 
deserve to be mistreated. They do not deserve to be treated with 
anything but kindness and generosity.
<P>
<B>(1150) </B>
<P>
	The costs of violence and personal suffering, social 
breakdown and direct government expenditure are incalculable. 
The hundreds of millions of dollars in social spending do not 
begin to pay the price of broken spirits and damaged lives, in 
some cases irretrievably damaged. Sometimes it starts a cycle 
that continues from one generation to another. It takes an 
enormous amount of effort to break that cycle or the silence. To 
correct those wrongs costs a lot more money and takes a lot more 
effort than if we are proactive and able to take preventive 
measures. We are paid back enormously for taking those steps.
<P>
	The complexity of family violence requires a long term, 
co-ordinated approach to address the root causes. We must 
eradicate the conditions that contribute to family violence and 
provide the proper environment for young people to escape the 
vicious cycle associated with abuse.
<P>
	Only when each and every Canadian lives without fear can we 
say we live in a violence free society. An important part of the 
solution is to influence the conditions of socioeconomic 
inequality that reduce vulnerability to family violence. It is not 
an excuse; it is a condition. Violence is inexcusable but there are 
mitigating factors. There are things beyond control, beyond the 
emotional, financial and social capacities of individuals who 
fall victim to becoming perpetrators.
<P>
	We need to address sexism, ageism, ableism, racism and other 
isms. We need to assure adequate access for all to appropriate 
services before we can hope to make Canada a safer place. The 
federal government recognizes the need to treat these issues as 
fundamental social problems with widespread ramifications for 
our families, indeed our entire society.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8675"> 8675 </A></B>
<P>
	I am particularly worried about young people as the Secretary 
of State for Training and Youth. We give our children an 
enormous gift when we teach them to care and to nurture 
properly, when we teach them to respect the dignity of other 
persons, when we teach them to treasure having children, having 
grandchildren and belonging to a family. They are not to be 
neglected or abused. They are to be cared for and to be taught. 
Good values and principles that presumably guide what we do, 
even in the House, should be passed on.
<P>
	Each year the federal government directs millions of dollars 
to Canadian children and their families to ensure they have 
access to the necessary conditions required for optimal health 
and personal growth and development.
<P>
	We have introduced a variety of preventive measures 
including the child development initiative, the child sexual 
abuse and family violence prevention initiatives, and building 
healthy aboriginal communities aimed specifically at providing 
protection for children and creating safer communities through 
social development and social investment.
<P>
	A central consideration in these reforms is the security of 
children and their families. We are asking what people need in 
the form of rehabilitation and family support services, 
education, skills upgrading and training to take control of their 
lives. How can we help families succeed?
<P>
	If we empower people with adequate means and opportunity, 
we are convinced that we will enable them to access education 
and employment opportunities that lead to healthy, rewarding, 
self-sufficient lives. As a result it will allow people to provide a 
better quality of life for their families.
<P>
	In a perfect world that would be enough but life is more 
complicated than that. There are things beyond the control of 
lawmakers. There are things beyond the control of governments 
at all levels. There are things beyond the control of people of 
goodwill. These are the things we expect. However they do not 
stop us from working, continuing to push and believing there is a 
better tomorrow. We have to try harder for our families, for our 
children, and essentially for our community and our country.
<P>
<B>(1155) </B>
<P>
	When children thrive our society is renewed. By nurturing 
healthy youth, ensuring they are physically, mentally and 
emotionally well, educated and employed, we run the best 
chance of creating healthy families.
<P>
	I guess we are successful in many people's eyes. We have jobs 
we are proud of and have managed to earn a living. We are 
honoured to represent the people. In the end society will not 
judge us on how well we do but on how well our children and our 
grandchildren do and what we contribute to our communities. 
How well our children and grandchildren do will be the 
significant judgment of us in terms of what we have contributed 
to society.
<P>
	These efforts reflect a growing movement not only in favour 
of prevention but in support of fundamental, social, economic 
and cultural change. It is a movement toward investing in 
people. We have a lot to do but we have each other to do it. 
Canadians working together, dedicated to building healthier 
communities, are making a dramatic difference. Not only are we 
proving that families matter. We are demonstrating we can make 
improvements in people's lives by refusing to tolerate societal 
violence.
<P>
	Let us talk about various forms of violence. Let us take a look 
at a 10-year old or 14-year old child. I have raised three 
children. I know what children of those ages are like. We wonder 
where the children are and whether we have hugged them today. 
All that comes to mind.
<P>
	Let us take one city in our country which I will not name 
because it would not be fair. There is a problem in that city; it 
has 400 juvenile prostitutes between the ages of 10 and 14. That 
is not prostitution, that is juvenile or child sex abuse. It is a real 
problem. It is a form of violence that has been perpetrated upon 
our most helpless, our most treasured, our young people.
<P>
	We have a responsibility. It is not only in one city. There is a 
problem in every city one could name. I make it my business to 
go to the source to see young people. We cannot do everything 
but we are doing some things right when we help those young 
people.
<P>
	It cannot be done alone. It is not a woman's problem or a 
child's problem. It is everybody's problem and everybody's 
responsibility. As a caring and just society we have no option but 
to make families our priority. We owe it to our children and to 
ourselves. If the challenges are great, the promise of progress 
has never been better.
<P>
	In 1994, the International Year of the Family, families have 
assumed their place on international and national agendas. 
Throughout the International Year of the Family the 
Government of Canada, in partnership with all sectors of 
society, has worked for the betterment of Canadian families. 
These partnerships have contributed to sensitizing Canadians to 
numerous and complex issues facing today's families such as 
family violence.
<P>
	Most important, we must reinforce the principle that strong 
and healthy families create strong, healthy and productive 
societies. By building on this momentum we will recreate 
Canada together in a way that mirrors our dreams and hopes for 
ourselves and will achieve our visions for our children and our 
future.
<P>
	It is interesting to note that in my riding of the Northwest 
Territories there are four women's shelters.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8676"> 8676 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1200 ) </B>
<P>
	This coming weekend one of my tours of going to the source 
as I put it will be to Sutherland House which is a shelter for 
women. Oddly enough it is communities that care that establish 
these shelters. They try to help themselves by helping the 
victims, by helping the families and the children. Whether or not 
we like to admit it most of them are women and children. They 
are the primary victims who take refuge. They are the ones who 
have to leave their homes, their living rooms, their beds to seek 
shelter elsewhere.
<P>
	Shelters have a 24-hour crisis line and apparently that is not 
enough. I have visited other shelters in communities such as Hay 
River. All these people have their own stories to tell but the big 
one is that we need to continue to work. We need to continue not 
to isolate people nor to blame or to point fingers. We need to join 
hands and work together. If we cannot stop these people who 
perpetrate violence, we can take measures that will help the 
people caught in those unhealthy relationships take the steps to 
get out, to make the commitment for a better life for a better 
tomorrow.
<P>
	Thirty-nine per cent of all women in violent marriages have 
reported that their children witnessed the violence against them. 
This is interesting because shelter workers in my riding believe 
that at least one in four NWT women have been abused by their 
partners. The NWT rate of reported sexual assault is the highest 
in the country. Girls 7 to 18 years old were the complainants in 
54 per cent of sexual assault cases in the Northwest Territories 
for 1988 and 1989.
<P>
	In Canada women are assaulted an average of 35 times before 
the police are called to assist. In Canada one in three women will 
be sexually assaulted by a man at home at some time in her life. 
Twenty-nine per cent of all women in Canada who have been 
married or who have lived in a common-law relationship have 
experienced physical or sexual violence at the hands of their 
partner. In Canada 90 per cent of sexual assault crimes are not 
reported to the police.
<P>
	According to the 1991 census there were 27,595 women in the 
Northwest Territories and 47.4 per cent of the population was 
over 15 years old. Forty per cent of all aboriginal peoples 
identified family violence as an important problem in their 
community. People on reserve and Inuit identify these forms of 
violence more than those who live off reserve and Métis. That is 
from the Canadian Institute of Child Health. It goes without 
saying that we definitely have a real problem but more than that 
we have to work on our commitment.
<P>
	We have to remember that we have a commitment to our 
children, to societies and to ourselves. Each and every one of us 
whether we are men or women have a commitment to the kind of 
work we want to see out there. We want to see results. We have a 
commitment to our communities and to our country. In 
remembering  those 14 women we can build something positive 
from this.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean-Guy Chrétien (Frontenac, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, 
I listened with great interest to my colleague, the Secretary of 
State for Training and Youth, and my friend, the member for 
Chambly, who is sitting behind me, said that sometimes the 
governing party's right hand does not know what its left hand is 
doing.
<P>
	Violence against women will never stop unless and until we 
have complete and total equality. The Canadian government 
must start by setting an example. Complete and total equality 
begins in the cradle, of course, at school, in day care, in college, 
in university and finally reaches the work place.
<P>
<B>(1205) </B>
<P>
	When the government here can say that it pays its staff the 
same regardless of sex, we will say thanks. It will be a step in the 
right direction when our children will be completely safe 
everywhere.
<P>
	For example, in Sherbrooke, in my region, there were three 
rapes in six weeks. My daughter, who is studying police science 
in college, was walking in the vulnerable area with a female 
friend. They were stopped by the police, who told them not to 
walk there. They asked why. He said that as good-looking girls, 
they were in danger of being raped.
<P>
	You see, because they were girls, they were not allowed to 
walk on the sidewalk in a part of the city. That is equality.
<P>
	Another girl told me that she was also walking, alone, it is 
true, and was harassed by two people in a car. She had time to 
take down the licence number. A few seconds later, a policeman 
passed. She signaled him and gave him the message. He told her: 
``You should not be walking here. It is a bad area. You are in the 
red-light district. Go and walk somewhere else.'' That is the 
kind of freedom we offer our women and girls.
<P>
	The Secretary of State for Training and Youth said that she 
had raised three children. I too have three children, including 
two girls. I would not be proud if my two daughters were not 
able to find as good a job as my son, because of unequal 
treatment. I would not be proud of the government of my 
country, be it Quebec or Canada, where my children would not 
have access to equality.
<P>
	Earlier, when the hon. member for Chambly alluded to double 
talk, I was reminded of the famous but tragic Thibaudeau case. 
Who is appealing Ms. Thibaudeau's case to the Supreme Court? 
The government opposite.
<P>
	The social program reform will primarily hit spouses, because 
from now on the family income, that is the salaries of both 
spouses, will be taken into account. Double talk indeed. I cannot 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8677"> 8677 </A></B>
<P>
wait to see a government which will not resort to this double 
talk, a government which will act and act swiftly.
<P>
	Here is the best example. Today marks the fifth anniversary of 
the tragedy at the École polytechnique, where 14 young women 
were killed in cold blood. The government started talking about 
firearms control. Some statement was made last week in the 
House, but things will drag on until 2002 or 2003 before the 
issue is settled. Tragedies such as the one which occurred at the 
École polytechnique could be repeated several times before 
tight and strict legislation is in place.
<P>
	I was told last week that in some Montreal clubs, bars or 
taverns, it is easy to get very dangerous offensive weapons for a 
few thousand dollars. It is as easy to buy a firearm as a good used 
car.
<P>
<B>(1210) </B>
<P>
	I would like to hear the Secretary of State for Training and 
Youth, because she sounded really sincere earlier. I want to ask 
her if she is ready to stick her neck out by asking her government 
and cabinet to stop using this double talk once and for all and to 
do everything it can to ensure that women of all ages can truly 
enjoy gender equality.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Ms. Blondin-Andrew:</B> Madam Speaker, I do not think it is 
necessary for my hon. colleague across the way to make the 
unreasonable demand of asking me to put my seat in the House 
on the line. There are other ways to deal with some of the serious 
issues he has brought forward.
<P>
	Gender equality is not one that escapes me. I have been a 
working woman all of my life. I know the trials and tribulations 
of essentially what used to be working in a man's world. In a 
sense we are graced with the presence of many good working 
women in this House at many different levels and in many 
capacities.
<P>
	Let me deal with some of the issues my hon. colleague has 
addressed. He talked about putting my seat in this House on the 
line for the equality of women and to bridge the pay gap between 
men and women and that sort of thing. It should be noted that we 
have taken great steps to have a more inclusive employment 
equity legislation put forward. We are working on it at this very 
time. He will be happy to know that it is mostly women who do a 
lot of the work on this legislation. It is not just for women, but 
for the disabled, visible minorities as well as aboriginal peoples 
who are also equally challenged.
<P>
	The member talks about the full security of children being 
able to live above the poverty line. With social security reform it 
is becoming very evident that child poverty is one issue we are 
very seized with, but we cannot just wave the wand and expect 
all the problems to go away. It will become evident as will all of 
these proposals as the responses come back that child poverty is 
one of the concerns we share with my hon. colleague.
<P>
	The other case he cited was a typical one. There is a process in 
place but I will not speak to it because it has already been 
advanced to a higher level. The member talks about the issue of 
income testing. The hon. member knows there is a process in 
place with regard to social security reform. The proposals are 
with the committee which is going across the country listening 
to people. People have expressed very loudly and clearly similar 
concerns about income testing. All those things will be 
ultimately considered.
<P>
	A man sitting across the way should not ask a women to put 
her seat in this House on the line if he really believes in gender 
equality.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Val Meredith (Surrey-White Rock-South Langley, 
Ref.):</B> Madam Speaker, I would like to say it gives me great 
pleasure to stand and speak before the House on this issue, 
however I feel that the fifth anniversary of a tragic event is not 
really a time for celebration but one for reflection. It is the fifth 
anniversary of the massacre at l'École polytechnique in 
Montreal. I think all Canadians feel a sense of horror that 
anything such as that should ever happen in our country.
<P>
	It was a tragedy when 14 young women were slain simply 
because they were female. I do not think there is anybody who 
does not feel the sense of outrage that gender should have been a 
factor in why anyone, male or female, would decide to end the 
lives of 14 young women.
<P>
	In my one year as a member of Parliament I have met with 
dozens of parents whose children were slain. Children were 
slain because their murderers did not like the way they were 
wearing their hats. Children were slain because the murderer 
was intoxicated. Children were slain because they were walking 
down a busy street in the middle of the afternoon and just 
happened to run into the wrong person.
<P>
<B>(1215 ) </B>
<P>
	Parents are unanimous that the justice system must be 
changed. They want to know how it can be called a justice 
system when it calls for Robert Latimer to receive a life 
sentence with no hope of parole for at least 10 years for killing 
his disabled daughter in what some perceive to be an act of 
mercy.
<P>
	Compare that with a man named Glenn Williams from my 
constituency who murdered his wife, the mother of four young 
children, the youngest six months old and still nursing. This man 
not only murdered his wife, but proceeded to clean up the house, 
clean up the murder scene, clean up the body of his wife, put her 
back into bed and call attention to the fact six hours later.
<P>
	The murder scene gave no indication of what really took 
place. All that we have is the version given by the murderer, by 
Mr. Glenn Williams. While he was originally charged with 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8678"> 8678 </A></B>
<P>
second degree murder, he was instead convicted of 
manslaughter. He received a five-year sentence.
<P>
	The law says that Robert Latimer will serve a minimum of 10 
years for his crime. The same law says that Glenn Williams will 
only have to serve 20 months. The system itself is flawed. For 
the last 20 years society has put the emphasis on the rights of the 
offender rather than the protection of society. This has to 
change.
<P>
	The number one priority of the criminal justice system has to 
be the protection of society. We will never eliminate all the 
violent crime from our communities, from our society. Crimes 
of passion, fits of anger will always exist. Unfortunately a lot of 
crimes are committed by people who choose to abuse 
substances. That will always be with us unless we are willing to 
deal with the situation.
<P>
	People are extremely upset when crimes are committed by 
previous offenders. How many opportunities must an individual 
get to continually violate, abuse and commit violent crimes 
against another person? How many people should an individual 
be allowed to hurt?
<P>
	At the Reform Party's last assembly we passed a resolution 
that would call for criminals who have committed their second 
serious personal injury offence to be automatically designated 
as dangerous offenders. That means these people would be 
subjected to indefinite sentences. If the parole board believes 
these people are still dangerous they would continue to be 
incarcerated. If they are perceived to be a minimum risk or a 
good risk for parole, they could be paroled and let free. They 
would always be subject to some kind of supervision for the rest 
of their lives, considering what risk they pose to society.
<P>
	Right away members from the Bloc will probably call such a 
measure draconian. The fact remains that a recent poll by Léger 
and Léger showed that 76 per cent of Quebecers agreed with this 
position. Only 16 per cent were opposed. I am confident that if a 
poll were taken across the country we would see similar results. 
Most Canadians agree that serious offences by dangerous 
offenders should be considered in that manner.
<P>
	Canadians are sick and tired of criminals being allowed to 
commit serious crimes over and over again. Take the case of 
Wray Budreo. This man has over 35 convictions for sexual 
offences against children over a 30-year period. For his last 
conviction he received six years. Only a public outcry prevented 
him from receiving a statutory release and he was required to 
serve the entire sentence. The day his sentence expired people 
were outside the prison gates protesting his release, with just 
cause I would suggest. The law said that he had to be released 
even though many considered him still to be dangerous and a 
risk to society. When it was learned that he was residing in 
Peterborough many of the residents were concerned about his 
presence until he moved to Toronto.
<P>
<B>(1220) </B>
<P>
	Mr. Budreo was upset with the attention he was receiving. He 
says he is not a threat and that he just wants to get on with his 
life. I hope Mr. Budreo knows himself well enough to be making 
that kind of assurance to society. I hope that he never commits 
another criminal offence. I hope no other child becomes one of 
his victims. But the odds are not in his favour.
<P>
	Paedophiles like Ray Budreo cannot be cured. At the very best 
they can only be controlled. But because of our justice system 
we cannot even see that Budreo is being controlled. The justice 
system says there is nothing it can do to protect society, to 
protect other children from becoming his victims. It infuriates 
Canadians to hear that their justice system cannot do anything to 
protect them from this kind of violent offender.
<P>
	There is something that we as parliamentarians can do and 
that is to enact legislation that is necessary to protect society. 
Some legislation may infringe on the rights of criminals but 
incarceration in itself can be considered an infringement on the 
rights of criminals. We cannot abrogate our responsibilities as 
lawmakers just because we fear court challenges. The people of 
Canada have entrusted us to enact the necessary legislation to 
protect them. I would suggest that we have an obligation to 
Canadians to do just that.
<P>
	This thought, this concern, was reiterated by Justice George 
Finlayson of the Ontario Court of Appeal this past Friday. In 
commenting on the appeal of Keith Léger, the justice made the 
following comment: ``If society wants paedophiles more tightly 
controlled then it is up to the Government of Canada to 
legislate-but certainly not up to the court to stretch existing 
laws to the maximum''. I think with Léger that is what this trial 
judge did. That is where we are at. It is up to us to make the laws.
<P>
	When the justice minister introduced his gun control package 
last week he said that his package has the support of the majority 
of Canadians. I am pleased to see that the minister 
acknowledges the importance of the feelings of Canadians. I 
would like to take it for granted that the minister will soon be 
introducing a bill that would reintroduce capital punishment. 
After all a majority of Canadians favour the reintroduction of 
capital punishment into our justice system.
<P>
	Unfortunately it would appear that is unlikely to occur. I 
would like to suggest to the Minister of Justice that he cannot 
have it both ways. If he wishes to invoke the spirit of public 
support with some legislation then he should be doing it with all 
legislation. If his gun control package is good legislation 
because he has the support of a majority of Canadians then 
reintroduction of capital punishment would be an equally good 
measure because it definitely has the support of the majority of 
Canadians.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8679"> 8679 </A></B>
<P>
	This is a deciding factor in distinguishing the difference 
between the two parties. For the Reform Party the will of the 
majority of Canadians has priority whether it conforms with 
party policy or not. With the Liberal Party public support is only 
relevant to those issues where the majority of Canadians happen 
to agree with it.
<P>
	Let us not make any mistake here. The public are demanding 
that tougher laws be enacted in our criminal justice system. 
Right now the justice committee is considering Bill C-37 which 
deals with amendments to the Young Offenders Act. Nothing 
seems to stir up citizens more than seeing young offenders being 
dealt with with kid gloves after they have committed serious and 
violent criminal offences. If we condone or minimize the violent 
acts of our young people against others how can we stand in the 
House denouncing violence against women? It is one thing to 
bring in the reverse onus clause for 16 and 17 year olds but 
Canadians believe they should be treated as adults, particularly 
when they commit serious violent offences against others.
<P>
<B>(1225) </B>
<P>
	In my spring householder I asked the following question: 
``Should the age limit in the Young Offenders Act be lowered 
from the current 12 to 17 year olds to cover only 10 to 15 year 
olds?'' With almost 3,500 answers the response was 91 per cent 
in favour. Ninety-one per cent of my constituents thought that 
the age limit in the Young Offenders Act should be lowered. I am 
sure that if the Liberals asked the same questions in their 
householders they would get similar responses.
<P>
	Does public opinion still matter to the government, or will it 
try and evoke that parochial attitude that ``it knows better''? 
How can it use one tragic, heinous crime five years ago to justify 
an attack against all men as being violent against women in 
general? Canadians are demanding protection from all violent 
crimes; against men, against women and against children.
<P>
	In the face of this concern experts keep telling us that violent 
crime is not really increasing. They point to a number of surveys 
to justify their claim. I do not feel like getting into a statistical 
war but I would like to present one statistic. According to 
Statistics Canada, in 1971 there were 204 crimes of violence for 
100,000 persons; in 1991, just 20 years later, that rate had 
jumped to 1,099 crimes of violence for 100,000 persons. That is 
a 500 per cent increase in violent crimes in the last 20 years. 
That is what Canadians are concerned about.
<P>
	Twenty years ago parents had no problem with young children 
playing with their friends outside. Today young children usually 
play under parental supervision. Twenty years ago high school 
students did not have any fears walking to school. Today young 
people are encouraged to walk in pairs or in groups, not just girls 
but also the boys.
<P>
	The danger of walking alone really hit home in my community 
on October 4 of this year. Sixteen year old Pamela Cameron, a 
young girl who had just moved to our community, had just left 
school, had coffee and muffins with some friends of hers at a 
muffin shop and was walking along the busiest street in our 
community in the middle of the afternoon to visit her boyfriend. 
She did not make it.
<P>
	Two blocks from my constituency office at four o'clock in the 
afternoon, Pamela Cameron was murdered. She was pulled off 
the busiest road in my community into some bushes and brutally 
murdered.
<P>
	For the next week or so while the murderer was still at large, 
the community was in absolute distress. There was such fear in 
my community that parents would no longer let their children 
walk to school by themselves. They were driving their kids to 
school. They were driving their kids to their jobs. They were not 
allowing their daughters and their sons out of the house.
<P>
	Ten days later when the individual gave himself up to 
authorities and was charged with the murder, there was a 
tremendous relief in our community. Finally they could finally 
feel a little more comfortable. Then the sense of relief over the 
tension of the capture of the accused turned to anger when they 
found out that this accused had a criminal record and was 
considered to be a violent and dangerous offender when he was 
released from prison.
<P>
	To the credit of my constituents they turned that anger into 
something very positive. They formed community groups that 
would be available to search for missing youngsters 
immediately. They began a campaign to support my private 
member's bill which deals with being allowed to keep dangerous 
offenders in detention after the expiration of their warrant. In 
one day at a local shopping mall they were able to collect 1,000 
letters each addressed to the Solicitor General and to the 
Minister of Justice. They were able to come up with a petition 
with 6,700 names. In Milton, Ontario, where the young girl 
came from her older sister collected over 10,000 names on a 
similar petition, a community showing its support for a private 
member's bill that talked about dealing with dangerous 
offenders in a very serious way.
<P>
<B>(1230) </B>
<P>
	Something quite miraculous happened last week. Despite the 
fact that all members of the Liberal Party and the Bloc who 
spoke in debate were against the bill, last Thursday that bill 
miraculously passed second reading unanimously. I am not sure 
what happened but I would like to think it was the indication of 
the public that they were extremely concerned about violence in 
our society and they wanted this House to pass legislation to 
deal with the problem and to put the protection of society above 
and beyond the rights of the accused.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8680"> 8680 </A></B>
<P>
	On this fifth anniversary of the massacre at l'École 
polytechnique we must pay special attention to violence against 
women. We as a society must clearly send a signal that domestic 
violence against women and children will not be tolerated any 
more than violence against strangers. Whether the violence 
originates with a spouse, another relative, a friend, a coworker, a 
boss or even a stranger it is a concern we have to deal with. 
Evolution has given males a physical strength, a superiority 
over females but our laws are supposed to level out the playing 
field.
<P>
	Unfortunately for many years the law has been complacent 
with some forms of violence against women, especially spousal 
abuse. Even today while society publicly condemns the act, that 
the victim was the offender's partner appears to be a mitigating 
factor in these crimes.
<P>
	We cannot continue to excuse violence against women or 
children. We must continue to address this problem. Whether it 
is through education, community intervention, treatment, or 
criminal sanction we have to repeat the message that violence is 
not an acceptable means of expression. It is not acceptable to 
abuse our spouses, our children or for that matter any other 
human being.
<P>
	As the mother of four boys I find it difficult sometimes to 
encourage young boys who are rough and aggressive by nature 
to realize there are limits to that aggression. As parents it is our 
responsibility not only with our young boys but also with our 
young girls to get them to express their feelings of frustration 
and anger in non-violent ways.
<P>
	Thank you for the opportunity to speak in this debate. I do 
hope we see a decided change in violence against all persons in 
our society over the next 20 years.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Jordan (Leeds-Grenville, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, 
I want to congratulate my colleague on her fine speech and a lot 
of interesting statistics. I have no problem with a good deal of 
what she has related. The hon. member mentioned several 
sources of her material, some of the research that has been done 
and the sources of those. That is always worthwhile.
<P>
	I would like to know which study determined that the majority 
of Canadians are now interested in returning to capital 
punishment. It seemed to me that was mentioned in the hon. 
member's speech and I am not questioning the validity of it. 
Perhaps she did not mention the source of that study. I would be 
interested in knowing what the source is and in asking for that I 
am not for a minute questioning the member's integrity.
<P>
<B>(1235 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Ms. Meredith:</B> Madam Speaker, actually there have been a 
number of polls. I believe the first poll was taken in 1982-83 
where about 80 per cent of Canadians supported the return of 
capital punishment. There was another poll done a couple of 
years ago where 76 per cent of Canadians wanted the return of 
capital punishment.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup, BQ):</B> 
Madam Speaker, I have listened attentively to my colleague's 
remarks. I would agree with her that it is important to denounce 
the deplorable crimes that have been committed, but I would 
point out that it is also important, in the course of a debate such 
as the one here today, to look for the real causes of this situation. 
The violent behaviour we are seeing is often just the symptom of 
a situation created by society.
<P>
	In this regard, I think that particular attention should be given 
to the reform of social programs and to how we intend to help all 
members of society live in acceptable conditions.
<P>
	If our analysis went deeper, might we not conclude that people 
exhibiting aggressive, unacceptable criminal behaviour often 
turned to this behaviour because they did not have the same 
opportunities as others early in life? Perhaps our social 
programs did not provide access to adequate daycare for those 
who needed it, and thus did not truly attempt to eliminate child 
poverty.
<P>
	Should we not be examining this aspect of the problem in 
seeking definitive solutions, rather than limiting ourselves to 
remedial and punitive action?
<P>
	Of course we will always be faced with finding solutions to 
specific cases of unacceptable violence, such as the one that 
took place at the École polytechnique, but there are also all the 
other cases that arise.
<P>
	Should we, as elected representatives, not be looking for long 
term solutions, rather than enumerating truly reprehensible 
situations, situations that are unacceptable? Our examination of 
the problem must go deeper and it must produce solutions.
<P>
	I would put the following question to the hon. member: Is 
there, in the Reform Party program, the necessary compassion, 
the necessary acceptance of situations, and satisfactory 
proposals for improvement? Is everyone ready to implement the 
1989 Parliamentary declaration against child poverty? Should 
the emphasis not be on prevention, so that we do not repeat the 
American experience, where more money is being spent on 
prisons that on helping people?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Ms. Meredith:</B> Madam Speaker, I thank my hon. colleague 
for the question. Certainly the Reform Party does support crime 
prevention but we cannot have crime prevention only and not 
deal with crime itself.
<P>
	We believe the social programs should be directed to those 
most in need. In reality poor people commit crimes but so do 
rich people. Crime crosses all barriers. If the hon. member 
honestly thinks that to solve the problems of poverty is going to 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8681"> 8681 </A></B>
<P>
remove crime, I would suggest that he take a better look at who 
is committing crimes.
<P>
	A lot of crimes are committed by people who come from the 
most privileged situations. I could go on and name a number of 
them we are all familiar with, from Thatcher in Saskatchewan to 
Huenemann in B.C. who killed his mother and grandmother 
because he did not want to share a $4 million estate.
<P>
	Crime crosses all barriers. We have to deal with those 
problems we see in society that need to be addressed, poverty, 
illiteracy, those kinds of situations. We must direct that support 
to those most in need. We must not make it universal so that 
people who do not need the help get the help and the help that 
goes to those most in need is insufficient to look after the 
problem.
<P>
<B>(1240 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Hon. Audrey McLaughlin (Yukon, NDP):</B> Madam Speaker, 
I listened carefully to the hon. member's presentation. I found it 
somewhat surprising that on a day when we are commemorating 
the murder of 14 young women that the member would be 
talking about reinstating capital punishment. That seems to be a 
contradiction in terms of the issue at hand. There are many 
criminal justice actions that can be taken.
<P>
	Given the fact that part of the issues concerning the safety of 
women relate to their accessibility to information and support, 
does the Reform Party support core funding for women's 
centres? As the hon. member will know, every province and 
territory in this country provides that kind of support to women 
but we do not have core funding for women's centres. Would the 
Reform Party support that kind of proposal?
<P>
	<B>Ms. Meredith:</B> Madam Speaker, I would not support core 
funding from the federal level. I do support funding from the 
communities where these programs are located. I would also 
support funding from the private sector in the local community 
and from the provincial governments. The support of these 
centres for the delivery of these services should be closer to the 
location.
<P>
	<B>Ms. McLaughlin:</B> Madam Speaker, I must say I find the hon. 
member's response rather shocking.
<P>
	It seems to me that what the member is actually saying is that 
women who are beaten and sexually and physically abused 
should rely on bake sales. If we are really serious about violence 
against women in this society the bake sale option is not good 
enough. Let the military have a bake sale.
<P>
	Does the member support zero tolerance of violence against 
women? If so, how does she propose that simply by the 
government not taking any role to support women through 
women's centres and support services that this will happen?
<P>
	<B>Ms. Meredith:</B> Madam Speaker, I would suggest that as a 
member of the House of Commons my role is to make sure our 
laws take spousal abuse and abuse against women seriously. 
When an individual murders his spouse he should get more than 
five years for manslaughter or a 20-month sentence of 
incarceration. Until our laws seriously take into account 
violence against women and give a sentence appropriate for the 
act we will continue to need transitional houses of all kinds.
<P>
	Many of my colleagues probably support these transitional 
houses through our 10 per cent donations to charity. I am not for 
a moment suggesting that bake sales are the way to raise money 
any more than I would suggest that bake sales are the way for 
anybody to raise money. However there are ways through 
education and promotion where the community can and does 
support transitional houses for battered and abused women and 
children.
<P>
	That is where the emphasis has to be placed. It is the 
community's responsibility to take ownership of the problem 
and get involved. They must stop expecting government to do it 
for them.
<P>
	<B>Ms. McLaughlin:</B> Madam Speaker, can I be perfectly clear in 
asking the member, would she then say that she does not support 
nor does the Reform Party support any funding for transition 
homes through the Canada assistance plan?
<P>
	<B>Ms. Meredith:</B> Madam Speaker, not knowing enough about it 
I cannot comment on whether or not I would support it. 
However, I would suggest that the Reform Party does support in 
many different ways, and I mentioned one through 10 per cent of 
our salaries being given to charitable organizations, that we do 
support charitable organizations such as transitional houses.
<P>
<B>(1245) </B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Audrey McLaughlin (Yukon, NDP):</B> Madam Speaker, 
first of all, I would like to note the contribution made by a 
former New Democratic member of this House, Dawn Black, 
who introduced the bill for the establishment of this day in 
memory of the 14 women from Quebec, to be observed 
throughout Canada every December 6 and known as the National 
Day of Remembrance and Action on Violence Against Women.
<P>
	I think that it is very important to mention the names of these 
14 women who died so tragically. Those who were killed must 
not be forgotten. The 14 victims were: Geneviève Bergeron, 
Hélène Colgan, Nathalie Croteau, Barbara Daigneault, 
Anne-Marie Edward, Maud Haviernick, Barbara Klucznik 
Widajewicz, Maryse Leclair, Annie St-Arneault, Michèle 
Richard, Maryse Laganière, Anne-Marie Lemay, Sonia 
Pelletier and Annie Turcotte.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8682"> 8682 </A></B>
<P>
	I would like to quote from the brief by the Canadian Labour 
Congress and its status of women and human rights committee: 
``Imagine a world in which girls and women were safe in their 
homes, their schools, in the streets and in the workplace''. 
Imagine, Madam Speaker.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	All of us want to imagine what it would be like for all women 
and children to feel safe in their homes, in the streets and in their 
schools.
<P>
	I will address several specific issues this morning. Many 
statistics have been given which I do not intend to repeat today. 
Rather, I will address several issues which I think are extremely 
important in specifically addressing the issue.
<P>
	The first issue is that of gun control. It was for that reason in 
the previous Parliament my party supported legislation leading 
to greater gun control. It is still a question and more legislation 
will be coming before the House.
<P>
	However I raise several points. In part I acknowledge the 
work of Yukon psychologist, Paula Pasquali. She raised some of 
these points as a woman and a psychologist who has worked 
tirelessly for many years on the issue of violence against 
women. She raised whether we are often talking about the wrong 
issue or asking the wrong question and whether we should be 
asking more specifically questions about safety. As Ms. 
Pasquali has noted, there is no doubt that some forms of gun 
control have certainly limited the accessibility of firearms to be 
used against women in the home, although we know it is still a 
great risk for many women because women have indeed been 
killed in the country.
<P>
	She has proposed that we should also look at prohibiting 
individuals with a history of violence or threatening behaviour 
from acquiring firearms acquisition certificates and at taking 
firearms away from individuals who have been convicted of 
violent offences. We do not need any reforms to do that; we 
could do that under the existing Criminal Code.
<P>
	One study funded by the Department of Justice found that 
police rarely seize firearms in homes where they respond to 
domestic calls, even though they know of their power to do so 
and are aware of the extent to which firearms are used against 
women. I would guess that firearms prohibitions are rarely 
ordered in cases of wife assault. This can be done under the 
existing law.
<P>
	There is nothing radical about suggesting that firearms should 
be restricted for those who have committed violent crimes.
<P>
<B>(1250) </B>
<P>
	One argument put forward is that taking away guns from 
people who rely on them for hunting or trapping would take food 
off their table or take away their livelihood. In those cases there 
is clearly an argument that they should be required to store guns 
outside their  family homes. I am talking specifically about 
people who have been convicted of violent crimes.
<P>
	We should broaden the debate around gun control and not 
specifically relate it to the narrowness of it now. We should look 
very clearly at what it is we want to accomplish, which deaths 
and which crimes we are trying to prevent, and setting priorities. 
Should we be looking at more specifically violence in the home 
in addition to proposals that may reduce it through gun control? 
We also have to evaluate the current gun control act and look at 
how moneys could best be spent to eliminate violence in the 
home and the use of firearms in the home.
<P>
	A second aspect of the criminal justice system of great 
concern to all of us is that we must insist that the system work to 
the benefit of women who choose to lay charges. There have 
been a number of studies. One recently completed in Ontario 
found that women were invariably disappointed with the 
response of the criminal justice system to assaults committed by 
the men with whom they lived. Many women do not want their 
partner to be punished but expect and need a system that will 
take effective action to ensure safety.
<P>
	This Ontario study demonstrates that only rarely does the 
sentencing imposed accomplish the goal. Indeed Ms. Pasquali's 
own studies on sexual assault in Yukon do not give much hope 
unless there is a system in place which is clearly focused on the 
victim, on the needs of the victim, and on support for the batterer 
in terms of groups for batterers and so on.
<P>
	In 1983 the Solicitor General of Canada issued a directive to 
the RCMP to lay charges and to the crown to prosecute charges 
of wife assault irrespective of the women's wishes. A lot of us at 
the time felt it was a good directive. Perhaps it is time to look at 
whether it has been effective for women. We should look at all 
laws that have been put in place to accomplish these ends.
<P>
	A third issue in the criminal justice system I would like to 
address is the issue of those who have committed a violent crime 
getting a lesser sentence or being found not guilty on the basis 
that they were intoxicated by alcohol or had used drugs. The 
government should undertake to change the Criminal Code in 
this aspect. It has been a great shock to women across the 
country to know that in this day and age when the issues of 
violence have been so much addressed that this is still possible. 
It is totally unacceptable. I have received petitions from 
individuals all over the country who are outraged about it.
<P>
	Services and the accessibility of services are very important. 
All women in violent situations live in fear. It has only been in 
the last 15 to 20 years that we have had a network of services: 
transition homes, hot lines, women's services and rape 
counselling centres. We have been able to say to women that 
violence is not acceptable, that they have an option. Society has 
taken on its responsibility. We as a society are responsible for 
the safety of our citizens.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8683"> 8683 </A></B>
<P>
	I refer to the proposals of the Liberal member of Parliament 
from Hamilton-Wentworth who is saying that funding should 
be cut to interest groups. He cited in his comments in a number 
of places women's groups. Let me put forward a few statistics 
about what the priorities in society should be. We hear that 
society cannot afford some of the work support groups or 
advocacy groups do on behalf of women and children.
<P>
<B>(1255) </B>
<P>
	Why is it, many women must wonder today, that in 1992 the 
Canadian government gave a federal grant to Pratt &amp; Whitney of 
over $54 million and in the same year gave the Canadian Day 
Care Advocacy $183,000? Why is it that in the same year the 
Canadian Marconi company received almost $10 million while 
the Canadian Research Institute for the Advancement of Women 
received about $250,000? Why is it that Spar Aerospace 
received almost $14 million that year and the Disabled Women's 
Network of Canada received just over $100,000?
<P>
	Today of all days is the day to put to rest the mythology that it 
is not the responsibility of a government to address the safety of 
its citizens. To do so there must be local resources available for 
women and the federal government has a role in that.
<P>
	In terms of accessibility I want to mention specifically rural 
areas of Canada. As many members will know, it is very difficult 
in most rural areas of the country for women suffering abuse to 
receive support services or often to receive legal or court 
services because of isolation. It is particularly important today 
to ensure that rural areas have a special focus in the planning 
done at the federal, provincial and territorial levels.
<P>
	I can give two local examples. The Victoria Faulkner 
Women's Centre in Whitehorse, Yukon, has had to move three 
times in the last year. It is trying to offer services to women. It is 
one of a few services readily accessible to women in Yukon. It is 
shocking that this service cannot find a permanent home. 
Similarly in Watson Lake, Yukon, the Help and Hope Transition 
Home for Families is under threat and has had to shut down part 
time because of a lack of funding. It is through the Canada 
assistance plan funding for transition homes that territories and 
provinces receive partial funding for these homes.
<P>
	We have not eradicated violence against women. I wish there 
was no need for transition homes for women who have been 
battered. However the need is there. Every day at the doors and 
on the phones of women's centres and transition homes across 
the nation, in every province and territory, there are people who 
are desperate for help. We cannot turn our backs on them.
<P>
	This leads me to the social security review that barely 
addresses the particular issue. It addresses the Canada 
assistance plan. If the government were truly serious in its social 
security review about looking at all aspects of issues affecting 
families, it would have made a specific  commitment to 
seriously address the issue of violence against women and 
children. It is not there, which is very disconcerting to many of 
us.
<P>
	The issues of poverty and inequality relate to violence against 
women. There is no doubt that things like the NAFTA and the 
Canada-U.S. Free Trade Agreement have adversely affected the 
working lives of many women. Often it is women who have felt 
the brunt of the negative aspects of these trade arrangements. It 
is women particularly who have felt the brunt of cutbacks to 
social services in every province and territory.
<P>
	It was mentioned today by the minister in an extremely 
important speech that women were central to the training of 
children in our families and to family life. Yet we still have one 
in five children in the country living in poverty, which means 
they have poor parents.
<P>
<B>(1300 ) </B>
<P>
	This is a form of violence everywhere in the world but it is a 
form of violence we can do something about. We have been very 
good in the House, as we were in 1989, saying we want to 
eradicate poverty by the year 2000. Wanting is not good enough. 
We have to take action and we can do that.
<P>
	There are many examples of inequalities. I gave some 
financial examples earlier where once again those who advocate 
on behalf of the interests of women received some government 
funding but nothing compared to the priorities in other areas.
<P>
	It is absolutely essential that we commit resources and have 
resources available for these services. Accessibility is a 
problem that many immigrant women have, either accessibility 
to English as a second language or to support services. The 
responsibility we as a society have for each and every person 
must be taken seriously by the House.
<P>
	The previous Reform speaker indicated that we could do this 
if we were a bit more charitable and had a few more bake sales I 
guess. I am not against it. In fact, almost all services for women 
do private fund raising. I have been involved in many of those 
efforts as I am sure other members have been.
<P>
	The reality is that they need a certain amount of core funding 
to be able to continue their work. We cannot turn our backs and 
pretend we can go back to days of charity. There has been some 
progress and greater awareness since this day was brought into 
law.
<P>
	It is absolutely essential that we recommit to specific actions 
to reduce violence against women, to eliminate violence against 
women. Zero tolerance must be the objective in everything we 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8684"> 8684 </A></B>
<P>
do. I do not believe it is simply what governments do, what this 
Parliament does. It is what we do as a society.
<P>
	There are many specific actions we can take if we want to, it is 
clearly a matter of will. I would like to end by quoting a 
comment that appeared recently in an editorial in the 
Whitehorse <I>Star</I> which sums up this issue very well:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>A government's primary mandate is to serve its electors. It's difficult to 
pinpoint a more urgent role than helping to preserve these people's physical 
well-being from domestic criminals-if not their very lives.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	I urge all members of the House to seriously address this issue 
in their constituencies and to support legislation which will help 
with the support services and ensure that we commit ourselves 
to zero tolerance on violence against women.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Elwin Hermanson (Kindersley-Lloydminster, </B><B>Ref.):</B> 
Madam Speaker, I have a short question. I was interested in 
listening to the leader of the New Democratic Party speak on 
violence against women. She did not seem to be too supportive 
or think that the federal government should be involved more in 
the charitable aspect of dealing with the results of violence 
toward women, rather than dealing with the causes of the 
problem.
<P>
	I know she would probably support measures regarding 
education that would relieve some of the problems about 
violence toward women. She did not really talk about what her 
party's position is on stricter sentencing and reform of the 
justice system so that violent acts are adequately punished. 
What is her position on a victim's rights versus a criminal's 
rights.
<P>
	I would appreciate knowing what her party's position is on 
those very important matters that would prevent and discourage 
violence not only against women but against all Canadians.
<P>
<B>(1305 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Ms. McLaughlin:</B> Madam Speaker, I would be happy to 
answer those questions. I believe I addressed at some length 
some of the criminal justice issues, both regarding gun control 
and the fact that people who have committed violent crimes 
should not have access to guns.
<P>
	Second, it is very important that the government act very 
swiftly to change the Criminal Code by creating the new offence 
of criminal intoxication.
<P>
	Third, obviously part of any kind of program of violence 
against women must deal seriously with those who commit that 
offence.
<P>
	As far as victims' rights, that is exactly the purpose of my talk 
today. Victims have a right to have support, to have counselling, 
not to be a victim in the first place. We should put in adequate 
preventive measures and adequate resources both in rural and 
urban areas to say to women that it is not acceptable that they 
live in a violent situation. We have options.
<P>
	There are people who can help women as advocates. There are 
transition homes. There are support services. The choice will 
remain with women because we have to respect the choices that 
they make. But in doing so, we want to prevent victims of 
violence. We can do it to a large extent with a number of the 
measures that I mentioned today.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jake E. Hoeppner (Lisgar-Marquette, Ref.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I would like to ask the hon. member for Yukon how she 
feels about violence.
<P>
	As kids we were always taught at home when we went to get 
the cattle out of the pasture not to wear red because it could 
infuriate the bull in the pasture.
<P>
	I have seen so much violence in my own community. When 
you look into some of these cases there is always stress which 
had developed by actions on both sides.
<P>
	How could we diffuse this? What could we do to prevent this 
in a number of cases? It is a matter of prevention, not putting on 
the red shirt when we know there is already a problem.
<P>
	That is the big answer to our problems. Somehow or other we 
must discolour that red shirt when there are problems in the 
family or problems between husband and wife.
<P>
	<B>Ms. McLaughlin:</B> Madam Speaker, I hope, and I will give the 
hon. member the benefit of the doubt, that he is not suggesting 
that women bring violence against themselves by their own 
actions.
<P>
	I will take rather that the hon. member's comments are asking 
what we can do to assist those families who are having marital 
and family problems. I suggest we can do a fair number of 
things.
<P>
	First, we can put in place economic measures that ensure that 
we decrease the amount of unemployment. Every study 
indicates that poverty and unemployment are contributors to 
violence in our society.
<P>
	Second, it is absolutely essential that governments at all 
levels take responsibility for the safety of their citizens both in 
enforcing those measures already in place in the criminal justice 
system to deal with those who commit violent offences and to 
ensure that there is a core group of services available.
<P>
	One can look for example at what some police forces have 
done across the country with their family violence prevention 
units. London, Ontario comes to mind. It has a very progressive 
program of going to a home where a call has been made, making 
sure that a social worker is present, that there is an option for 
ongoing counselling. It is not just a matter of one measure, it is a 
matter of several.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8685"> 8685 </A></B>
<P>
	Finally, the attitude that our society has toward women is key 
to this. Denigration of women in any field will set the climate 
for the acceptance of violence. It is incumbent on each of us to 
ensure that the respect and dignity of both men and women is 
always in the forefront. In our position as members of 
Parliament we have a responsibility to ensure equal 
opportunities for women in every sphere of life.
<P>
<B>(1310) </B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Pierrette Venne (Saint-Hubert, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, 
today we commemorate the sad anniversary of the massacre at 
l'École polytechnique in which 14 young women died. Despite 
the horror and revulsion which we feel about it, this act is only a 
pale reflection of the violence women suffer. We should 
denounce this violence not only today but every day of the year.
<P>
	What Marc Lépine did makes us all think, but it is just the tip 
of the iceberg. Violence against women is rarely so spectacular, 
fortunately. This violence takes many forms, some more 
pernicious than others. Women are victims of violence 365 days 
a year. Violence is insidious and affects every aspect of a 
woman's life.
<P>
	The Canadian Advisory Council on the Status of Women 
defined violence against women as a complex problem which 
includes physical, sexual, psychological and economic violence 
against women and said that this violence depends on structures, 
values and social, economic and political measures that muzzle 
women in our society, promote discrimination on the basis of 
sex and maintain the inequality of women.
<P>
	Violence is the weapon of choice for those who want to 
subdue and dominate. Men learned that a long time ago and use 
violence. Even today, we women are kept out and subjugated by 
an archaic macho attitude.
<P>
	Our Catholic Church will not let us be priests but suggests that 
we do volunteer work. This is another way of telling us women 
that we are not educated, cultivated or even pious enough to 
have access to the upper echelons of a Church which is meant to 
be a reflection of society. From deacon to pope, the positions are 
all held by men who are often pretentious and full of themselves. 
Their authority over the faithful in general and women in 
particular is a good example of the masculine philosophy based 
on control and power. Do you really think that the Catholic 
Church would be in worse shape than it is now if the pope was a 
woman?
<P>
	Unfortunately, the Church is not the only institution which 
treats women like that. Let us take a look in this House. In 
Canada, women account for 52 per cent of the population. 
However, if you count the number of women in the House of 
Commons, you will find 53 out of 295 MPs. Our great 
Parliament is very much a male stronghold. Over half of the 
Canadian population is represented here by barely one sixth of 
the total number of MPs.
<P>
	Therefore, it comes as no surprise that the government takes 
so long to table legislation to ensure the safety and well-being 
of women. A Parliament made up of men proposes and passes 
male-oriented legislation, with the result that we are still 
waiting for the Minister of Justice to table concrete legislation 
on firearms. There is no need to rush: After all, for every man 
who dies during a spousal argument, six women are killed. I am 
convinced that if the figures were reversed, the process would 
have been speeded up.
<P>
	Do you not agree that, if the Minister of Justice were a 
woman, we would have a bill to amend the Criminal Code and 
strictly prohibit the mutilation of female genitals? But the 
victims are women and the Minister of Justice does not even 
intend to amend the Criminal Code. Not only did the justice 
minister put on the back burner the idea of registering all 
firearms, he also refuses to table a bill to protect the innocent 
victims of a cruel and barbaric practice.
<P>
	The Minister of Justice promised to do everything in his 
power to end such criminal activities. Either the minister only 
has the power to make promises, or else protecting young girls 
from mutilation is not one of his priorities.
<P>
<B>(1315) </B>
<P>
	The mutilation of female genitals is a form of violence against 
girls and violates their basic right to physical integrity. Will we 
have to wait until a similar practice is introduced that would 
mutilate male genitals for the government to make up its mind to 
act? If 52 per cent of the members of this House were women, I 
am sure these problems would already have been dealt with and 
legislation would already have been introduced, passed and 
implemented.
<P>
	Last week, the Minister of Justice missed an excellent 
opportunity to show everyone he was concerned about the 
security of wives. It seems gun control is not the answer, 
because instead of tabling a bill, as he promised, he made a 
ministerial statement full of good intentions. Meanwhile, every 
six days, on average, a woman is shot and killed.
<P>
	I can hear people saying that the lack of women in the House is 
our own fault, because we choose not to run for election. 
Nothing could be further from the truth. Some obtuse male 
chauvinists fail to understand what this means for a woman. 
These guardians of the male mystique cannot imagine that 
someone would hate the sparring at all-candidates meetings, 
that woman are fundamentally different in the way they live, the 
way they are educated and trained and in the way they act.
<P>
	My answer to them is that I still hope that some day, this 
House will be truly representative of the population and that 
women will fill 52 per cent of the seats, in other words, have the 
representation they deserve.

[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Ms. Marlene Catterall (Ottawa West, Lib.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, as we rise to speak in the House today certainly our 
first thoughts are for the families who five years later still live 
with the pain of losing their children, more specifically losing 
their daughters.
<P>
	What stunned the whole country five years ago on December 6 
was not only that 14 young people just beginning their lives lost 
their lives, but that women were specifically singled out to die 
on that day. Men were moved out of the way so that the women 
alone could be shot. As a mother of two daughters in that age 
group I can only imagine the pain those families still feel.
<P>
	Today I want to talk about how we as women live in society 
and why it is so important that all people particularly men 
understand that. I want to talk about the feelings of 
powerlessness that are ours from the time we become conscious 
of ourselves as human beings. It is vital that everyone 
understand that women live their lives differently. That 
difference is vitally important to society. It is vitally important 
to us as women that decisions not be made only on the basis of 
who is strongest and most powerful.
<P>
	I realize it is very difficult for many men to understand what 
this means to women. Most men have grown up knowing from 
the time they were little boys that they would be big and strong, 
that they would have important jobs. That is not the way little 
girls grow up.
<P>
	Most women have grown up knowing from the time they were 
little girls of less than two that they would always be smaller 
than their male counterparts, they would always be weaker, 
would never be as important, would never account for quite as 
much in society. They would never have as much money and for 
many they would never have money of their own. Their job 
would be to clean up after everybody else. They would always be 
good little girls because if they were not daddy might get cross, 
or mommy might get cross because daddy did not like it.
<P>
<B>(1320) </B>
<P>
	This is why as we grow into women every day and every 
minute of our lives is regulated by the fact that we are women. 
We decide differently than men where it is safe to go at what 
time of day, whether we can go alone or whether we need to find 
somebody to go with us.
<P>
	I doubt there is a man in this House who approaches his car in 
the parking lot at night with the same fear a woman does. It is 
important for us to understand this is why it is so important to 
women to have a different kind of society. That is why we need 
to find measures to equalize our treatment.
<P>
	When I was teaching my 17-year old daughter to drive I 
taught her to lock the doors always when she was alone in the 
car, even in broad daylight, and never to get into a car at night 
without checking the back seat to ensure nobody was hiding 
there. What I was doing was teaching  her fear, the same fear that 
I and every woman live with daily. When I taught my son to 
drive a year later it never even occurred to me to give him the 
same lessons because he did not need them.
<P>
	This feeling of being powerless, of always having to be just a 
little bit afraid, is partly what leads to the kinds of violence we 
have become so much aware of. It is what leads to the 
exploitation of women in a number of different ways around the 
world. It is what leads to the exploitation and abuse of power 
over women as a universal phenomenon. It is why women tend 
not to report crimes against themselves as easily or as readily. 
They know that doing so immediately places them in a situation 
where they again are powerless. Others are in control and they 
can be hurt more.
<P>
	The motion today is so important. It is an expression of this 
House that this matters to us as parliamentarians, as the leaders 
of our communities and our country. It reinforces our hope and 
determination to change it.
<P>
	I recall a report a couple of years back on why women were 
not in engineering. I happen to be married to an engineer, I have 
a son who is an engineer, and I have a son-in-law who is an 
engineer so I know a fair bit about engineers and what great 
people they can be.
<P>
	I also know a fair bit about engineering faculties at 
universities. There is a whole culture there that is ugly and 
offensive to the very nature of women. It is so totally a male 
macho culture that no woman is comfortable in it. There are 
things like the fortunately now gone greased pole at Queen's. 
Tell me what woman wants to be an engineer when part of the 
initiation process is to expose herself to filth and I mean that in 
the most vile terms, believe me.
<P>
	Why are there not more women in politics? We will not have 
the kinds of laws that make it easier for women to get justice 
until we have more women writing laws. It is not that I would 
write better laws than any of my male colleagues in the House; it 
is just that I bring a different perspective to it, a perspective I 
think is necessary to complete our humanity when we create 
laws in this House and decide how to allocate our resources.
<P>
	Bertha Wilson said it best when she talked about the 
difference between how men and women deal with laws and why 
the justice system is anathema to women. The whole idea of 
winning and losing that seems so fundamental to our justice 
system also seems to be fundamentally a male concept. It is a 
concept promoted by those who are bigger and more powerful, 
who always have an equal chance of winning. It is not a concept 
that women are comfortable with.
<P>
	I am being very open and honest today about my feelings 
because this motion is also about feelings. It is about pointing 
out that women who have been violated can turn to the justice 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8687"> 8687 </A></B>
<P>
system that is supposed to be there to protect all of us. It is about 
having workplaces in which women are free from harassment.
<P>
<B>(1325) </B>
<P>
	I want to shock the House a little today. I want to read from a 
harassment case that has recently come to my attention. This is a 
young woman, 21 years old, a university student employed in a 
summer job. I have met with this young woman and believe me, 
any of us would be proud to have her as our daughter. The 
following is what happened in her first four days of employment 
in an office in this city:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>He sexually harassed me by hovering over me and by touching me in an 
inappropriate manner. He often touched my shoulders and on one occasion ran 
his fingers across my neck.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	This is a mature married man.
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>He often called me ``hon'' and ``love''. On one occasion he announced to the 
office that his wife was out of town for the weekend and suggested I babysit 
him at his home. On one occasion while helping me with a file that I had been 
organizing on my lap he took the opportunity to rub my upper thighs. When he 
asked if I understood what he had just done I said ``yes'', to which he added: 
``That is too bad. I was enjoying playing with your legs''.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>On one occasion he said: ``The problem with kids today is that mothers enter 
the workforce instead of staying at home to raise them properly''.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>He told the following joke: What is the difference between a lawyer and a 
woman? To win a case a lawyer puts on his robe while a woman takes hers off.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>He sometimes cornered me and used his larger size to intimidate me. He 
came up behind me, swivelled my chair around, placed one hand on my desk, 
the other on my chair, so that I was trapped between his arms and asked me 
what was wrong.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>I saw him slap a female coworker's behind. I heard him discuss male 
colleagues getting lucky.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	This is a 21-year old woman working in a government office 
enduring this. She was discouraged from making an official 
complaint. A year later she is still suffering from the emotional 
repercussions. She will not be told what action was taken against 
that harasser because his privacy is being protected. Yet we 
know that for the victim to know what action was taken is a 
critical part of the healing process.
<P>
	I want to speak a bit about a piece of legislation that is 
currently before the House. Bill C-41 has had a lot of 
discussion. In my view it has had a lot of discussion on the 
wrong issues. Bill C-41 talks about making crimes committed 
out of hate especially heinous and subject to more strict 
penalties.
<P>
	Bill C-41 says that if you commit a crime of violence against 
a woman because she is a woman out of hate, you will be 
punished more severely than if you commit the same crime for 
purposes of theft, whatever. I think that is good law because we 
cannot say that it is okay to hate people because they are women, 
because they are black, because they are Sikhs, because they are 
gay. Bill C-41 protects children against abuse by providing 
tougher penalties for people in authority who sexually or 
physically abuse children.
<P>
	I want to support a bill that does that and I will. I want to 
challenge anybody who refuses to support a bill that provides 
that kind of protection against hate and violence in our society.
<P>
	There are people who would pretend that violence is a 
society-wide issue and it is, but it is a different issue for women. 
It is a different issue for women because women have become 
the target of violence. I challenge any woman inside or outside 
this House to not remember even as a little girl when some man 
would rub up too closely against her deliberately on a street 
corner or a bus, or when she has not been accosted by some vile 
and foul sexual suggestions on the street.
<P>
<B>(1330 ) </B>
<P>
	I say to the men in this House that I do not believe they 
understand. I ask them to try to understand the gut wrenching 
caring that that kind of an incident causes. I do not think they 
understand how I feel when one member of Parliament stands in 
this House and calls a woman member of Parliament a slut. I do 
not think they understand how in the last week our concerns 
about violence have been belittled in this House by comments 
from the other side. I do not think they understand. I ask them to 
please do their best to try. It is one more way of saying to me and 
saying to women in this country: ``You don't count as much. You 
don't matter as much''.
<P>
	We also have to talk about the economic equality of women. It 
very much is an issue of equality. As long as we refuse to give 
women the same opportunities to be economically prosperous 
based on their own abilities, talents and application of their 
energies, women will not be equal politically, equal socially and 
they will not be equal before our justice system.
<P>
	I totally reject the arguments put forward earlier this morning 
by the member for Beaver River who said that violence against 
women is no different than violence against men. It is. As long 
as we refuse to face that, we refuse to face that women are killed 
by men who are close to them, who are their husbands, their 
lovers, their partners, because of the power relationship. Until 
we accept that we are not going to understand the problem. If 
you do not understand the problem you cannot solve it.
<P>
	It is fine to say these issues affect all members of our society, 
as the member for Beaver River did this morning, but that is 
turning a blind eye to the specific and serious problems that this 
motion before the House today wishes to address and that is very 
specifically the kind of violence that is directed against women 
because they are women.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8688"> 8688 </A></B>
<P>
	Yes, we have grandparents and seniors who are verbally and 
physically abused. We have children who are physically abused. 
That is a reflection of a society value that says: ``Power, might 
and strength are the most important values and if you have those 
you have the right to abuse others''. Until we recognize that that 
power relationship is why so many women die as a result of 
violent incidents, we are not going to solve the problem. We are 
not going to have a better society.
<P>
	I thank the House for its attention today. I thank all those who 
gave unanimous consent to the debating of this motion. I regret 
in a sense that the motion had to be watered down to deal more 
generally with violence in society as opposed to only violence 
against women on this particular day just to ensure that 
unanimous consent would be given.
<P>
	This is an important issue. It is an issue on which our 
government is working. As the Minister of Justice said very 
recently: ``We have not done enough but we will do more''. I 
believe this kind of debate strengthens our courage and 
strengthens our resolve to do more and to leave to our children 
and grandchildren a world and a country in which all are equally 
valuable. I say that on behalf of both the granddaughters and the 
grandsons I hope to have some day.
<P>
<B>(1335 ) </B>
<P>
	I think men too benefit from a society in which power is not 
the ruling dictate, in which equality and respect for all human 
beings regardless of whether they are men or women is a 
hallmark of this society, perhaps as in no other in the world, and 
that is a record that I would like to see this nation achieve.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ghislain Lebel (Chambly, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I listened 
with great interest to the remarks of the hon. member who just 
spoke. I have three girls myself. They are still young, of course, 
but they will grow up. I realize that Quebec has gone much 
further than the federal government with respect to equality 
between spouses and equality for women.
<P>
	In 1990, for example, Quebec passed an act to encourage 
economic equality between spouses, so that when they divorce, 
or separate or one of them dies, the property acquired by the 
couple is divided pretty fairly between the two former spouses, 
the man and the woman. Canada lags far behind Quebec and 
several other provinces on this issue of recognizing spouses as 
equals.
<P>
	I remain somewhat sceptical just the same. In a justified and 
justifiable outburst, the previous speaker mentioned women 
being in danger on our streets and everywhere, women being 
done an injustice.
<P>
	I have a problem reconciling this with the fact that the hon. 
member herself and her colleagues recently rose in this place 
and brought the house down when the Minister of Human 
Resources Development tabled his famous bill amending the 
Unemployment Insurance Act. The policy statement says that 
from now on, entitlement to UI benefits in Canada will be based 
on family income. Unfortunately-and the Bloc Quebecois and I 
did not make this decision-women are hit hardest by such a 
measure. If the husband's annual income is, say, $55,000 and his 
wife earns $22,000, $25,000 or $28,000 per year, and becomes 
unemployed, she will not be entitled to UI benefits because her 
husband makes good money.
<P>
	The hon. member opposite rose in this House to applaud this 
measure at the time it was introduced by the Minister of Human 
Resources Development. Personally, I find it is all too easy to 
act offended, to rise and say that the right hand does not know 
what the left one is doing or vice versa. Logic should prevail and 
one should rise once in a while, not only on days when we debate 
the status of women, violence against women or other such 
issues, and tell the minister that he is off the beam with his 
procedure.
<P>
	It seems to me that the story changes depending on the 
circumstances. On days when we are dealing with women's 
issues, violence against women or matters affecting women 
directly or indirectly, they come here and denounce injustices. I 
agree there are some, but in the normal course of day to day 
administration, knowing that federal legislation concerning 
women is 30 years behind provincial legislation, I think that 
more could be done, besides such statements, to remedy the 
situation.
<P>
	This concerns men and women alike, including fathers like 
me. I have three young daughters who will grow up to be women 
living in this society and I am not so proud of the legacy we are 
leaving them. In Quebec, there is an ad on television that says: 
``I myself am not affected by violence. I do not go out at night; I 
stay home. I do not talk to strangers; I stay home. No, I cannot 
say that I am affected by violence''.
<P>
	That is similar to the situation faced by women in Canada. My 
friend, the hon. member for Frontenac, said earlier that while 
walking in a somewhat disreputable neighbourhood in 
Sherbrooke, his daughter was asked by police officers: ``What 
are you doing walking at night in a neighbourhood where you 
should not be?''
<P>
<B>(1340) </B>
<P>
	This does not happen only in Sherbrooke. It happens in 
Halifax, Edmonton, Calgary, and many other places. What are 
we doing about this? What steps did the Liberals take to address 
the situation? They gave us a nice gun-control policy to be 
implemented in the year 2003. It took Marc Lépine 20 minutes 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8689"> 8689 </A></B>
<P>
to go on a shooting spree at the École Polytechnique five years 
ago. How many more shooting sprees can we expect before 
2003? When all you need is 20 minutes, it is anybody's guess.
<P>
	I think that the government must translate words into action, 
show some backbone and try to do something so that women will 
feel after today's session that something was accomplished in 
the House of Commons today and that there is a political will to 
achieve justice for women. But no. All members of this House 
make big speeches but when the time comes to support or reject 
motions that go against women's interests, the party line comes 
before anything else, including nice speeches like the one that 
the hon. member just gave us.
<P>
	I strongly disagree, because I do not want to see my three 
young daughters in 10, 12, 15 or 20 years treated even worse 
than their mother is being treated at this time.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Catterall:</B> Mr. Speaker, frankly, today I do not feel like 
debating who does more for women-the provinces or the 
federal government. I think it is clear that all parties must do 
much more, especially for family welfare. Clearly, throughout 
Canada, a family's welfare depends on the woman and the man 
in the couple.
<P>
	As for social welfare, yes, there is lots of room for 
improvement. I want to say that in Quebec, for example, the 
family has to take responsibility before someone can get 
welfare. That is not the case throughout Canada.
<P>
	I really think, as my minister and I admitted, that we are not 
doing enough to improve the status of women and especially the 
conditions that cause violence against women. More must be 
done at all levels in every country in the world. I am convinced 
that with more women in Parliament, on both sides of the House, 
it will be easier to do it more quickly.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup, BQ):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I listened very carefully to what the hon. member 
said, and I would like to give her the assurance that many men 
have thought and are thinking and learning about what is 
happening in society today.
<P>
	Like the previous speaker, I also have children, two girls and 
one boy, and I want them to have the same opportunities in the 
years to come. That is why I think the government must send the 
right signals. You say you do not feel like having a debate on this 
today. I realize that the issue of violence against women is a 
universal one, but at the same time we are here to ensure that the 
appropriate measures are taken.
<P>
	Without in any way blaming the government, we can at least 
consider what signals the government could perhaps send 
tomorrow morning. For instance, in connection with social 
program reform, could it suggest ways to fight poverty other 
than targeting poor parents and poor children, which does not 
provide any help for the middle class? There are all kinds of 
family support programs, but are they adequate?
<P>
<B>(1345) </B>
<P>
	And could the present climate of violence in our society be 
due to the fact that for the past 20 or 25 years, we have failed to 
provide equal opportunities for everyone? This is true in the 
case of women, the disabled and several other categories. And 
should the government not make this the spearhead of its action

<P>
	<B>Ms. Catterall:</B> Mr. Speaker, our objective is to improve the 
economic situation of women and children and, more 
specifically, to eliminate child poverty. However, to eliminate 
child poverty, we have to eliminate the mother's poverty first. 
That is one of the things we are trying to achieve through our 
social program reform, by putting more emphasis on training 
and providing more support for women with children and 
families with young children.
<P>
	These are some of the things I personally and many of my 
colleagues have said to the Minister of Human Resources 
Development. Women and children should be-

<P>
	<B>Mrs. Madeleine Dalphond-Guiral (Laval Centre, BQ):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, before expressing my views on this issue, I want to 
say that I regret that the Official Opposition was only informed 
yesterday of the motion tabled this morning in the House. I do 
hope that this late notice does not reflect a lack of concern by our 
society on the issue of violence against women.
<P>
	It is with sadness, dismay and pain that I participate in this 
debate to commemorate the tragedy which occurred on 
December 6, 1989.
<P>
	In Quebec, as well as in Canada, that tragedy put the issue of 
violence against women in the limelight. This episode, more 
than any other, forced our society to stop and think. Experts in 
every possible field analyzed the whys and wherefores of such 
horror. However, the answers are neither simple nor clear. Our 
society is suffering, and the result is that women and children 
are often the victims of violence triggered by this unhappiness 
and malaise.
<P>
	More often than not, violence is insidious, sneaky and 
imperceptible from the outside. At other times however, it can 
be visible, unbearable, terrifying and very concrete.
<P>
	Statistical data cannot accurately measure psychological 
violence. It is a form of communication between the tormentor 
and the victim which undermines the soul and kills self-esteem. 
In fact, even though current data on physical violence is 
overwhelming, it only represents the tip of the iceberg.
<P>
	Just recently, in 1993, Statistics Canada gathered the 
following information: One woman out of two was a victim of at 
least 
<P>

<B><A NAME="8690"> 8690 </A></B>
<P>
one violent act since the age of 16; one  in ten who lived with a 
spouse feared, at one time or another, for her life.
<P>
	Other statistics released in 1991 by the Canadian Advisory 
Council on the Status of Women provide a clear and hard picture 
of the plight of those women who live in poverty.
<P>
<B>(1350) </B>
<P>
	In 1989, eight out of every ten women living on reserves in 
Ontario were victims of violence. In 1989, eight out of ten 
women inmates of federal penitentiaries had been abused before 
their incarceration. In 1989, four out of ten women with 
disabilities had been abused or raped. While weakness should 
spontaneously generate an attitude of protection and help, we 
observe paradoxical behaviour. The weakest are at the highest 
risk of violent treatment. How can this troubling reality be 
explained?
<P>
	In a document on spousal violence and its effects on children, 
Beth Allen bore out the theory that children from violent homes 
are at greater risk of committing, or being the victims of acts of 
violence. It is as if witnessing violent behaviour causes violence 
to be incorporated in the behaviour pattern of the child who 
witnesses such violence.
<P>
	While some may learn violent behaviour at home, the role 
played by mass media in trivializing this violence cannot be 
denied. Even the most horrible things end up losing any meaning 
when you are exposed to them every day. You become 
indifferent to the horror. Parliament has a major responsibility 
in this regard. Today, on the eve of the third millennium, do 
victims of violence speak more freely of the abuse they suffer?
<P>
	It is currently estimated that one out of every four women who 
fall victim to violence will report these acts of violence to the 
police. Other figures are much more conservative, as they 
indicate that one woman in ten would report it. Perhaps these 
figures are more accurate. At any rate, fear and silence go hand 
in hand. Is this society prepared to let battered women be heard? 
The question has been put, but I am afraid that the answer is no.
<P>
	In 1991, 270 women were murdered in Canada, a 33 per cent 
increase over 1988; 85 of these women were shot dead. Thirty 
per cent of women slain in Canada and Quebec in 1991 were 
slain with firearms which were generally used against them by 
people they knew. While the women of Quebec and Canada were 
confidently expecting a fair and reasonable gun control bill to be 
tabled, the Minister of Justice announced in a ministerial 
statement made on November 30, that we will have to wait until 
1998 for the registration of firearms to start and until 2003 for it 
to be completed.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, I put the question to you: can this society afford 
to wait? Do these women have the time to wait? I am sorry that 
this government is not prepared to let women victims of 
violence be heard.
<P>
	Let me tell you about another form of violence. I will do so in 
English. It should be painfully slow, as I am already a slow 
reader in French.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Generally, when we speak of violence against women we 
focus on physical and psychological damage inflicted by one 
individual against another. However, what of the more insidious 
ways in which women are subjugated? The wounds inflicted by 
society and borne silently can be felt as keenly as physical 
blows.
<P>
<B>(1355) </B>
<P>
	Allow me to illustrate my point with an example. There is a 
new medical industry in Canada growing and developing with a 
life of its own. A full year after the final report of the royal 
commission on new reproductive technologies, the federal 
government has not introduced a single measure to regulate the 
use or further development of these new technologies. As a 
result, we see women at Toronto's IVF Canada clinic selling 
their eggs to pay for expensive and unproven fertility 
treatments. We see women desperate for money renting out their 
wombs in surrogacy arrangements.
<P>
	This is exploitation in its worst form because the federal 
government, I regret sincerely, turns a blind eye to it. Just as 
violence against women is the abuse of physical or 
psychological power, the exploitation of women's reproductive 
capabilities is the abuse of economic and political power. By not 
acting swiftly to regulate this industry and to put a halt to the 
most exploitive and ethically abhorrent new reproductive 
technologies, the federal government is demonstrating 
complacency in the form of violence against women. This lack 
of action can no longer be tolerated by the women of Quebec and 
Canada.
<P>
	I will continue later.

	<B>Mrs. Maud Debien (Laval East, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, beyond 
polls, yesterday, women's groups clearly expressed their 
opposition to the federal government's social program reform. 
Calling the human resources development minister's proposals 
discriminatory and regressive, the National Action Committee 
on the Status of Women firmly rejected the provisions to cut 
women's UI benefits.
<P>
	Under these provisions, women's access to UI would be 
determined by spousal income, although women would, of 
course, continue to pay premiums. These measures are a direct 
attack on the financial independence that women have worked 
so hard to achieve in the last 30 years.
<P>
	By completely disregarding the issue of fairness raised by his 
reform, the Minister of Human Resources Development is 
simply implementing a series of blind cuts at the expense of 
women, among others, dictated by his fight against the federal 
government's deficit.

	He also made it clear that the Reform Party was against the 
recognition of same sex spouses and the extension of spousal 
benefits to same sex relationships as per the resolution adopted

<P>
	Canadians across the country are concerned over the 
government's intentions to include sexual orientation in both 
the Criminal Code and the Canadian Human Rights Act.
<P>
	The present course of action taken by the Liberals is not 
spelled out in their red book. It is presumptuous of them to say 
they have the mandate to proceed.
<P>
	Canadians are further exasperated when they realize that no

	<B>Mr. Gilles Bernier (Beauce, Ind.):</B> Mr. Speaker, after 10 
years of existence, the services offered by Job Finding Clubs 
have been modified following a change in the rules of the game 
by Human Resources Development Canada. The department 
requires that a large percentage of training referrals be UI 
recipients, thus closing the door to those left out of the statistics, 
who were the main users of services offered by Job Finding 
Clubs.
<P>
	The goal is, of course, commendable: returning unemployed 
workers to the labour force as quickly as possible. But what are 
we doing for young people just out of school and for people 
without income, who would greatly benefit from job finding 
sessions but whom the government is now trying to exclude on 
the pretext that they are not counted in the official statistics? 
They are human beings with an urgent need to find work, and I 
think that the department should relax its rules.

years ago today, fourteen young women lost their lives at 
l'École polytechnique in Montreal, slain by a murderer who 
bore a grudge against women. This tragic occurrence sparked a 
strong movement in favour of increased gun controls as well as 
an awareness of the pervasive violence against women in our 
society.
<P>
	Would the Minister of Justice agree that five years later, the 
same type of weapon used by the murderer at the polytechnique 
can still be easily obtained on the market, and that being said, 
why is he content with a mere action plan instead of tabling 
legislation with teeth to regulate the sale and circulation of 
firearms, as he and the Prime Minister promised to do?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney 
General of Canada, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, last week in the House, 
we announced what we had decided to do in connection with this 
government's policy on firearms. We have decided, for instance, 
to table a bill next February here in the House, to amend the 
existing legislation. We have three objectives. First, we want to 
make it clear that Canada does not want the gun culture that 
exists in the United States and that we need stricter controls on 
firearms for society in general. Second, we want to make 
changes in the Criminal Code to ensure that people who use 
firearms to commit crimes will go to court for appropriate 
sentencing, and third, we want to protect the public by introduc-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8695"> 8695 </A></B>
<P>
ing universal registration of all firearms and thus encourage 
compliance with safe storage requirements.
<P>
	We announced what the government has decided to do with 
respect to firearms, including-
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> I am sorry, but the minister's time has expired. 
The hon. member for Roberval.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
Minister of Justice is saying some very fine things, but will he 
admit that under the plan he has put forward, the owners of some 
13,000 automatic weapons registered in Canada, including 
4,000 AK-47s, which are military weapons, will be legally 
entitled to keep them until their death?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney 
General of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the firearm that was 
used by Marc Lepine in the tragic events five years ago today 
will, under the decisions made and announced last week by the 
government, be prohibited from future sale when the law is 
enacted and its power exercised.
<P>
	We have also said that an order in council will be put in place 
January 1, a few weeks from now, to prohibit outright certain 
assault pistols and assault shotguns which will be confiscated 
from those who now have them.
<P>
	Further, on January 1 next an order in council will be passed 
which will prohibit over 200 types of paramilitary and assault 
firearms.
<P>
<B>(1420 ) </B>
<P>
	It is true to say that those paramilitary firearms, as well as the 
prohibited handguns, will remain in the hands of those who now 
have them. However they may not transfer them. They may use 
them only until they die. They can surrender them to the police 
or they can disable them. That is the policy.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
Minister knows perfectly well there are regular instances of 
firearms being in circulation when owners declare they have 
been stolen, lost or have otherwise disappeared. His regulations 
will not solve that problem.
<P>
	Why does the minister not understand it is important to act 
now, considering that a large number of women, in Quebec for 
instance, have been killed by firearms since the tragic events at 
l'École polytechnique and that his action plan will have no 
measurable impact before the year 2003?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney 
General of Canada, Lib.):</B> May I emphasize, Mr. Speaker, that 
nothing is postponed about this plan. On January 1, less than a 
month from now, the order in council prohibiting a wide range of 
firearms will come into effect. In the calendar year 1995 we 
shall have legislation enacted through Parliament that will 
introduce the strong criminal penalties that we have announced.
<P>
	On January 1, 1996 the registration system will begin. 
Through incitements to early compliance, we expect that the 
vast majority of firearms and their owners will be registered in 
the system in the early period after the introduction of that 
system.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Pierrette Venne (Saint-Hubert, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the Minister of Justice.
<P>
	According to Canadian police and customs officers, 
prohibited weapons continue to flow into Canada. The 
vice-president of the Canadian custom officers union is of the 
opinion that the justice minister's plan of action contains no 
measure to stop gun smuggling from the United States.
<P>
	Does the Minister of Justice not agree that the stricter control 
measures that his government announced last spring have had no 
effect to date and that his action plan will not be any more 
successful?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney 
General of Canada, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, I agree with the hon. 
member. We made public last week decisions concerning 
stricter border control. The Minister of National Revenue, the 
Solicitor General and I announced last week that the 
Government of Canada will take steps to ensure that control is 
exercised at our borders.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The minister of revenue has announced specific changes in 
both operational policy and statutory amendments that will give 
us greater control, including insisting that all shipments of 
firearms coming to Canada will have permits issued in advance. 
Second, there will be enhanced supervision at the borders. 
Third, we will limit the points at the borders at which firearms 
may enter the country.
<P>
	Along with universal registration, this will make a difference 
in cutting down smuggling.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Pierrette Venne (Saint-Hubert, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, can 
the Minister of Justice tell us if he plans to take as long to put in 
place measures to stop gun smuggling from the United States as 
to implement the registration of firearms?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney 
General of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the changes in the 
administrative and operational practices at the border which 
were outlined by the minister last week will be effective 
immediately. Other changes in the statutes will be affected by 
the bill we will put 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8696"> 8696 </A></B>
<P>
before Parliament next February. As soon as that bill is passed 
those changes will be in place and will be effective.
<P>
	May I encourage the hon. member opposite to join with the 
government in these important steps that we have taken for what 
I know is a common objective between us, a safer country. May I 
encourage her and her colleagues in that party to join with us in 
making these changes happen.

Canada has every confidence that the people of Quebec, when 
given the chance to vote on the real question of whether they 
want to become a part of a separate country or whether they want

	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr.

my question is for the minister of defence.
<P>
	While the Conference on Security and Co-operation in 
Europe is meeting in Budapest, where the international 
community is endlessly debating how to make the Bosnian Serbs 
listen to reason, the Bosnian Serbs themselves continue to 
thumb their nose at the UN and the major powers. They still 
refuse to release their 309 detainees, including 55 Canadian 
peacekeepers.
<P>
	Does the defence minister confirm that the 55 Canadian 
peacekeepers held hostage for 13 days have not been released, as 
the Bosnian Serbs promised, and is this not another proof of the 
bad faith of the Serbs, who do not honour any of their 
commitments?
<P>
	<B>Hon. David Michael Collenette (Minister of National 
Defence and Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, 
I have been informed that a meeting was held yesterday between 
the UN commander in Bosnia, General Rose, and the Bosnian 
Serbs.
<P>
	The Bosnian Serbs have given General Rose assurances that 
all detainees would be released soon.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	That means we have had assurances from the Bosnian Serb

when General Rose met with them that all of the UN 
detainees-there are about 350 right now-will be released 
soon.

the Serbs have promised several times to release the 
peacekeepers, but it has not happened yet.
<P>
<B>(1430) </B>
<P>
	Are we to understand that the Bosnian Serbs have not agreed 
to release the peacekeepers held hostage because the UN refuses 
to promise that NATO will not launch more air strikes against 
them?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. David Collenette (Minister of National Defence and 
Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I do agree 
with the hon. member that it is very frustrating to have these 
continual assurances from the Bosnian Serbs. We had it on 
Friday when Mr. Akashi, the Secretary-General's 
representative, negotiated a deal with the leadership and only a 
few people were subsequently released. We hope that this latest 
negotiation will bear fruit.
<P>
	With respect to the specific aspect concerning NATO air 
strikes, that framework was agreed to by NATO last spring. 
Canada is a signatory to that framework. Those air strikes can be 
utilized when and if the double key is unlocked, i.e., the 
commander on the ground advocates it and NATO agrees and of

	<B>Mr. Stephen Harper (Calgary West, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, in 
replying to the leader of the Reform Party the Deputy Prime 
Minister said, and I paraphrase it, that we intend to ask a certain 
question and that is the question of the unity of Canada versus 
the separation of Quebec.
<P>
	Shall we take from that response that it is the intention of the 
federal government to put its own question to the people of 
Quebec and to the people of Canada on the clear question of 
separation?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister 
of the Environment, Lib.):</B> The House leader of the Reform 
Party is on very dangerous ground when at a very crucial point in 
Canada's history he and his leader and other members of his 
party are more intent on attacking the federal government than 
on attacking the separatists.
<P>
	What I said in response to the question of the leader of the 
Reform Party was that we will not be drawn into speculation. 
The supposed bill that was put before the people of Quebec 
today by the premier of Quebec is not legitimate because the 
question has not been asked. The key question and the question 
that we will ask and ask and ask again over the next number of 
months to the people of Quebec is: Do you want to separate from 
Canada or do you want to remain?
<P>
	We are confident that by working with all members of the 
House, working with the Reform Party, working with the 
Conservative Party, working with the New Democratic Party, 
that the cause of federalism will succeed because Quebecers 
want to be a full participating partner in Canada.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stephen Harper (Calgary West, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
welcome two pieces of information from the Deputy Prime 
Minister. One is that she and her government will have a 
co-operative attitude with all federalist parties. The second is 
that she views the bill tabled today by the premier of Quebec as 
not legitimate.
<P>
	Is it therefore the intention of the Government of Canada to 
make it clear to the government of Quebec and to Mr. Parizeau 
that this Parliament has the sole legal right and the sole 
jurisdiction in areas such as boundaries, native affairs, 
citizenship, currency, international treaties and federal pension 
programs? Is that the intention and does she intend to express 
that view clearly to Mr. Parizeau?

<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister 
of the Environment, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, what we will say to 
Mr. Parizeau is that if he really had the courage of his 
convictions, he would ask the real question, which is: Do you 
want to separate, yes or no?

by commissions, he is not sure that he will win. We are 
convinced that Quebecers will vote to stay in Canada.

Mr. Speaker, the Bloc engages in demagogy. Is the hon. member

facts wrong? He misrepresented them when he said that most of 
the rationalization was in Quebec.

	Is the hon. member ready to accept, first, that the Government 
of Quebec, as MIL Davie's shareholder, is responsible for taking 
a position on the business plan? Does the Bloc think that the

	<B>Mr. Ian McClelland (Edmonton Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the government plans to increase the lending ceiling 
under the Small Businesses Loans Act to $12 billion. This 
money is available for fixed assets, not working capital.
<P>
	The industry committee report ``Taking Care of Small 
Business'' identified working capital as the problem, not asset 
capital. In fact suppliers of funding for asset financing asked 
that the government not compete with them.
<P>
	Why did the government not follow the recommendations of 
its own committee and address the working capital needs of 
small business particularly exporters, rather than increasing 
competition with the existing sources of asset capital at 
significant expense to taxpayers?
<P>
	<B>Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, let us understand first of all the proposal we brought 
forward yesterday. It indicates clearly that in making the 
amendments to the Small Businesses Loans Act it is our 
intention to ensure that program is of no cost to the government.
<P>
	In that sense the additional fees we proposed to charge and the 
cap on the interest rates will contribute to that. We have 
indicated we will work with all stakeholders to ensure that the 
changes we make continue to provide an effective program for 
small businesses to meet their needs and will not cost the 
taxpayers by way of calls on the loan guarantees.
<P>
	I also want to emphasize for the hon. member that the reason 
we raised the limit is very simple. Over the course of the last 18 
months the demand by small businesses for assistance under that 
program has caused it to reach its limit of $4 billion. That is how 
successful and popular the program is. I believe it contributed 
directly to the 400,000 jobs that have been created in this 
country in the last year.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ian McClelland (Edmonton Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, you do not have to be rocket surgeon to figure out that 
if you increase the rate, if you lower the amount that is available, 
if you make it easier for the banks to roll over their delinquent or 
their poorer loans, people are going to take advantage of it. The 
problem is that we are making it easy for the banks to get rich.
<P>
	Canadian taxpayers now subsidize the Small Businesses 
Loans Act up to $100 million a year. The government proposes a 
1 per cent fee to offset anticipated future losses. However, the 
industry committee recommended that small business loans 
guaranteed under the act carry an interest rate commensurate 
with risk.
<P>
<B>(1440) </B>
<P>
	What specific safeguards has the minister implemented that 
will ensure this does not become just one big subsidy program 
for the banks?
<P>
	<B>Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, you do not need to be a brain scientist to know that if 
you are going to get a government program right you really 
ought to consult with the stakeholders that are using it.
<P>
	The member raises a serious question. I want to assure him 
that I share his concerns as he has expressed them about what 
could be done with the program.
<P>
	The hon. member should know that we did commission a 
study of this program by Professor Allan Riding of Carleton 
University. His study indicated that the changes that were 
brought into effect in 1993 have actually resulted in increased 
loans at least 60 per cent of which were incremental to what 
would otherwise have been out there and were directly related to 
job creation.
<P>
	That is why we believe the first priority should be to raise the 
cap so that the program continues to be as useful as it was to 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8699"> 8699 </A></B>
<P>
small business. We will make the changes. I understand what he 
is asking for. That is what we will endeavour to do in the 
changes. We do not want the program to be a subsidy to the 
banks.

<P>
	Yesterday, the minister claimed that 96 per cent of Canadians 
supported an in-depth reform of social programs. The minister 
even had the nerve to claim that these 96 per cent supported his

support a social program reform which will be effected at the 
expense of the poor.
<P>
	How can the minister claim that his reform is supported by a 
majority of Canadians when over 80 women's groups, including 
the National Action Committee on the Status of Women, clearly 
reject his UI reform because it is discriminatory and primarily 
targets women?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Human Resources 
Development and Minister of Western Economic 
Diversification, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, what I said yesterday was 
simply to repeat the results that were taken by a nationwide 
survey.
<P>
	What is important to note is that when the survey is broken 
down by region as many people in Quebec support the social 
reform proposals of the government as in the rest of Canada. 
What is equally important is that according to the survey as 
many women support the programs for social reform as do men. 
There is absolute equality among genders in supporting our 
social reform proposals.

<P>
	<B>Mrs. Christiane Gagnon (Québec, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, when 
will the minister realize that his reform will make women more

their spouses' income?

[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Human Resources 
Development and Minister of Western Economic 
Diversification, Lib.):</B> Actually, Mr. Speaker, it is quite the 
reverse.

	If one looks at the proposals for two tiers established by some 
income test the fact of the matter is low income women in poorer 
regions would be the major beneficiaries of that proposal. That

	<B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley East, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
my question is for the Minister of Human Resources 
Development.
<P>
	Although employment equity already exists in practice across 
much of the federal government, the minister will soon legislate 
hiring in the public service based on race, gender and disability. 
The minister says that he does not believe in hiring quotas, but 
his legislation will instead require numerical goals.
<P>
	Will the minister tell us the difference between numerical 
goals and hiring quotas in the fulfilling of the demands of the 
employment equity program?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Human Resources 
</B><B>Development and Minister of Western Economic 
Diversification, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, as the hon. member knows 
that was a clear commitment we made during the last election 
campaign, that we would reform the employment equity 
programs. I would remind hon. members we have over 170 
members to prove just how many Canadians supported that 
mandate.
<P>
	The importance of ensuring equal access and equal 
opportunity in the workplace is one of the primary objectives to 
ensuring a good effective economy as well as ensuring the rights 
of men, women and all those who have disabilities or are visible 
minorities.
<P>
	I will be tabling legislation next week in co-operation with 
my colleague the President of the Treasury Board. At that time 
the hon. member will get a full view of what is presented in the 
legislation. I cannot pre-present myself. I think the hon. 
member should wait and see what the bill has to say.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley East, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the public service has always prided itself on the fact that it has 
always done its hiring based on merit and merit only. The 
managers who fail to meet these numerical targets, goals, quotas 
or whatever the minister may want to call them will inevitably 
be disciplined.
<P>
	What will the minister do to ensure that the managers who are 
doing the hiring and firing in the civil service are doing it based 
on merit and merit alone?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Human Resources 
Development and Minister of Western Economic 
Diversification, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the hon. member should 
know that the public service of the Government of Canada has 
been subject to a series of guidelines related to employment 
equity going back to the previous Liberal government when the 
then Solicitor General who was responsible established a very 
good regime.
<P>
	We want to ensure in the legislation that there is clear parity 
and balance between the rules that apply in the private sector 
and the public sector. This is something that was asked for by the 
public servants of Canada.

	<B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier-Montcalm, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, my question is directed to the Minister of Health.
<P>
	I would like to remind the minister that the director of the 
bureau of veterinary drugs at Health Canada, and I think she 
should know this, the boss of the bureau that is examining 
somatotropin to advise the minister on the approval being 
sought for this drug, is lobbying on Parliament Hill to promote 
the advantages of this hormone.
<P>
	How can the minister blatantly use her director's leave 
without pay as an excuse, as she did yesterday, to condone this 
conflict of interest?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Diane Marleau (Minister of Health, Lib.): </B>Mr. 
Speaker, the person in question has been on leave of absence for 
a year and a half. During his leave of absence, he does work for 
Health Canada and does not speak on behalf of Health Canada.
<P>
<B>(1450) </B>
<P>
	That being said, I am aware of the hon. member's concerns 
about this matter, and I have asked my deputy minister to look 
into the matter in order to give everyone the assurance that the 
conflict of interest guidelines for the Public Service have not 
been circumvented.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier-Montcalm, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, how can the minister guarantee that her director, who is 
on leave without pay and is lobbying on behalf of a number of 
drug companies, will not influence the recommendations of the 
bureau of veterinary drugs of Health Canada regarding 
somatotropin, since the director did not reveal his connection 
with the department?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Diane Marleau (Minister of Health, Lib.): </B>Mr. 
Speaker, I may remind the hon. member that bovine 
somatotropin has not been approved and that this drug will only 
be approved once the department's researchers have the 
assurance it will have no negative effects on either Canadians or 
cows.

	<B>Mr. Leon E. Benoit (Vegreville, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
yesterday the minister of agriculture defended commissioners 
of the Canadian Wheat Board by stating that they participated in 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8701"> 8701 </A></B>
<P>
public meetings by ``discussing a broad variety of aspects 
pertaining to the marketing of western Canadian grain''.
<P>
	The minister also said: ``None of the commissioners were 
actively involved in any campaign for the advisory committee''. 
It seems curious that the minister did not see the article written 
by commissioner Richard Klassen in various farm papers 
promoting not a variety of views but one particular view on the 
Canadian Wheat Board.
<P>
	Will the minister review the actions of Mr. Klassen and the 
other commissioners to see which commissioners violated the 
stance of political neutrality?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Ralph E. Goodale (Minister of Agriculture and 
Agri-Food, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it seems to me not unusual that 
a commissioner of the Canadian Wheat Board would from time 
to time defend the policies and practices of the Canadian Wheat 
Board. That seems to be quite logical in the ordinary course of 
events of being a commissioner of the wheat board.
<P>
	If the hon. gentleman has any specific allegation that he 
would care to make with respect to any kind of impropriety on 
behalf of any particular individual or commissioner associated 
with the Canadian Wheat Board, I suggest that he should bring 
that allegation forward specifically and not engage in these 
broad based innuendos.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Leon E. Benoit (Vegreville, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, section 
17(4) of the Canadian Wheat Board Act states: ``It is the duty of 
the board to exercise direction and supervision over the 
administrative conduct of an election of members of the 
advisory committee''. Therefore the role of the commissioners 
is parallel that of Elections Canada in a federal election.
<P>
	Several commissioners by promoting the point of view of one 
group of candidates violated the Canadian Wheat Board Act. 
Will the minister call for the resignation of all commissioners 
who actively campaigned during the period leading up to the 
election of the Canadian Wheat Board advisory committee?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Ralph E. Goodale (Minister of Agriculture and 
Agri-Food, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the short answer to the hon. 
gentleman's question is no because I have no information before 
me at the present time that would justify any of his allegations.

Transport Canada has more than doubled the parking meter rates 
at Pearson International Airport terminals 1 and 2, hiking the 
rates from $3 per hour to $8 per hour.
<P>
	Will the minister explain why such huge increases are being 
levied on the travelling public at a time when disposable income 
is on the decrease?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Joe Fontana (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Transport, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I know that the member is 
concerned with the safe and efficient operations at Pearson as 
the minister is. I want to tell the member that the rates have not 
been changed since 1991 except for the changes necessary 
because of the Ontario tax changes. Also, the parking meters are 
provided at the most congestion sensitive areas of the airport 
and are only meant to provide short term parking for luggage 
and dispersing of passengers. If people want to park for longer 
periods of time then the parking garage at Pearson is only $3 per 
half hour. That is how we are going to deal with the congestion 
problems at Pearson.

for the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans.
<P>
	At the last federal-provincial Conference of fisheries 
ministers, on November 1, the Government of Quebec ask the 
federal government to transfer a portion of the fisheries 
management function to the province. Soon after, the minister of 
fisheries announced in this House that he intended to reorganize 
fisheries, stating that he was looking forward to pursuing 
productive exchanges and discussions with all the provinces, 
including Quebec.
<P>
	Why has the minister not yet responded to the request from 
the Quebec fisheries minister, when he is about to table a 
fisheries plan that will affect the entire industry in the Atlantic 
zone? Why?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Brian Tobin (Minister of Fisheries and Oceans,

shocking thing that fully 35 days have passed since the 
Government of Quebec tabled a proposal that would radically 
alter the nature of the relationship between the federal 
government and the provincial government. This government 
has not yet offered a comprehensive response to this radical 
altering of the nature of the way in which we manage the marine 
fisheries and we have had fully 35 days to deal with it, to fully 
discuss it and implement it. It is a shocking, shocking thing and I

<P>
resources allocated under the government's anti-smuggling

there are thousands of guns coming across the border every 
month and yet the port of Fort Erie across from Buffalo has only 
interdicted six per month in the last year, six out of one 
thousand.
<P>
	Does the revenue minister agree that both he and the justice

their ill thought out gun control legislation and the fact they will 
not be able to enforce the laws at the border anyway?
<P>
	<B>Hon. David Anderson (Minister of National Revenue,

	<B>Hon. Audrey McLaughlin (Yukon, NDP):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the Deputy Prime Minister. As she will know, in 
the last four years we have had two major reports on violence 
against women: one, the war on women which is a subcommittee 
of Parliament and, second, the panel on violence against women 
which cost over $11 million. She will also know that transition 
homes, rape counselling centres and women's centres 
continually struggle for adequate funding.
<P>
	I want to ask the Deputy Prime Minister whether her 
government is committed to ensuring through core funding the 
continuation of these essential services which help to prevent, to 
treat and counsel against violence against women and whether 
her government will do so through shared costing with the 
provinces and territories.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister 
of the Environment, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I can certainly assure 
the hon. member, knowing her own personal interest in this issue 
and the interest of her party, that we are going to do everything 
we can to live up to the commitments that we made in the red 
book to make Canada a fairer and a safer place for all women.
<P>
	That is why we moved within the first year on specific 
legislation on gun control, a very strong package which could 
prevent the Marc Lepine massacre from happening again. That 
is why we are moving very soon on pay equity legislation, so the 
women in the public service get the equal treatment they 
deserve. That is why we will respect our commitment to core 
funding for transition houses, so the women of Canada can be 
protected from violence whether it comes from the streets, from 
their neighbours or sadly, from their own homes.

	The House resumed consideration of the motion.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Madeleine Dalphond-Guiral (Laval-Centre, BQ):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I would like to share a thought on violence against 
children, a painful reality I have often been confronted with in 
my profession.
<P>
	Even if our instinctive reaction of outrage tends to 
overshadow everything else when we are confronted with such 
unacceptable tragedies, I have learned from experience to read 
in this violence the signs of a society which is out of balance, a 
society in which social expectations of performance at any cost, 
family isolation, financial difficulties and psychological 
deficiencies play a major role. These are sick families.
<P>
	As Fairholm wrote in a book published in 1990 and entitled 
``Child Abuse Prevention Program for Adolescents'', children 
of all ages are abused. In every social, economic, racial and 
ethnic environment, there are adults abusing children under 
their care. All families and all children are vulnerable to this 
problem. Psychological violence is at the root of all forms of 
abuse or negligence, but we do not know how common physical 
neglect actually is. Is such ignorance tolerable? I do not think 
so.
<P>
<B>(1505) </B>
<P>
	In conclusion, I would like to go back to the events of 
December 6, 1989, exactly five years ago today. A light late 
afternoon snow is falling on the city, when horror suddenly 
strikes: 14 young women are gone forever, robbed of a 
promising future.
<P>
	This tragedy affected me personally because I knew one of the 
victims; her name was Anne-Marie. In memory of all her 
sisters, I laid 14 white lilies near her grave. I thought for a 
moment of adding a red rose dedicated to Marc Lépine's mother, 
but I decided against it because the violence done to this woman 
in the evening of December 6 was beyond imagination. This 
woman died deep in her soul.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Dear colleagues, the issue we are 
dealing with is a very serious one, so I would ask my colleagues 
to hold their discussions outside the House. The hon. member 
may continue.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Dalphond-Guiral:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thought for a moment 
of adding a red rose dedicated to Marc Lépine's mother, but I 
decided against it because the violence done to this woman in 
the evening of December 6 went beyond imagination. This 
woman died deep in her soul.
<P>
	I want to tell her today what I could not tell her on December 
6, 1989: We share your pain in solidarity and we refuse to 
condone daily violence because it always erupts in the end, 
leaving indelible scars.
<P>
	I say to the grieving families, particularly the three families in 
Laval, that they are in our thoughts and that this ultimate 
sacrifice has become the symbol of the campaign to eliminate 
violence against women.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Ms. Mary Clancy (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Citizenship and Immigration, Lib.):</B> December 6, 1989. 
Memories come flying of that night five years ago. I remember 
it very well. I remember it was cold and there was a lot of snow 
in Ottawa.
<P>
	I remember the night particularly because the then Leader of 
the Opposition, the then member for Vancouver Quadra had a 
party at Stornoway for members of the Liberal caucus. I 
remember the fellowship, the Christmas cheer.
<P>
	I remember a number of us going out for dinner after the party 
at Stornoway. I remember in particular there were more than a 
dozen of us in a downtown Ottawa restaurant waiting for the 
member for Humber-St. Barbe-Baie Verte, now the Minister 
of Fisheries and Oceans. We were wondering what was keeping 
him and why he was holding up our evening. I can remember. So 
many memories like this are etched in our minds. I can see the 
hon. member standing ashen faced in the restaurant doorway 
coming to tell us he had just heard the news on the radio of the 14 
young women at l'École polytechnique.
<P>
	I remember many things and forget others. Hon. members 
know the hon. member for Renfrew-Nipissing-Pembroke has 
sat for many years in this House and is one of its senior 
members. He was sitting next to me and he said things like that 
do not happen in Canada. They are not supposed to happen.
<P>
<B>(1510) </B>
<P>
	I remember later that night back in my apartment the member 
for Saint-Laurent-Cartierville and I were riveted to the 
television set watching Ian MacDonald of CBC report from 
l'École polytechnique. I remember the flowers in the snow. In 
particular I remember a beautiful young student talking about 
her fateful meeting with Marc Lépine in one of the corridors at 
l'École polytechnique. She described how she saw him and she 
crouched down and how he pointed the gun at her and fired 
twice. Both times through chance and the incredible grace of 
God it misfired. She kept saying she did not know why she was 
alive and the others were not.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8704"> 8704 </A></B>
<P>
	I remember most particularly from first hearing the news to 
today five years later realizing that in this instance women were 
culled from the crowd. They were singled out. They were stood 
against a wall and they were executed.
<P>
	They were executed because in that diseased mind, and there 
is no question of that, they had raised themselves above the 
trench, if you will. They had taken a step away from the norm. 
They had gone into a non-traditional profession for women. 
They had dared to do something that in that diseased mind 
women were not supposed to do.
<P>
	I want to say a very special word about two of my former 
colleagues in this House. I want to pay tribute most particularly 
to Dawn Black, the former New Democratic Party critic on the 
status of women. Through her efforts on a private member's bill 
she sponsored this day has become the day of remembrance and 
action.
<P>
	I remember being in this House many times speaking and 
supporting Dawn and being supported by the other women I 
would like to pay tribute to today. There is the Hon. Mary 
Collins who was then the Minister responsible for the status of 
women. I also want to pay tribute to our colleague from 
Saint-Hubert from the Bloc Quebecois who also supported us 
very much on that.
<P>
	I remember these things and I want all of us to remember these 
things. I remember the people I met when this terrible tragedy 
focused the debate and the battle against violence against 
women. One person I will never forget and to whom I would also 
like to pay tribute today is Suzanne Laplante-Edward, the 
mother of Anne Marie Edward, one of the victims. She would 
probably not want to be singled out. She would talk about herself 
as a parent and an activist but she has become a symbol as well. 
She would probably have preferred to remain the mother of an 
engineer.
<P>
	What happened on that cold December night in Montreal 
galvanized all of us to a degree but we still have much farther to 
go. It is very true that violence against men and against children 
exists in our society. However it is not sensible to refuse to 
recognize that violence against women is a particular problem 
that exists in every cultural group, in every society, east, west, 
north, south, in every racial background. It is a tragedy and a 
horror, but it is there. Asking what about men and what about 
children does not take away from the fact that there is the 
peculiar and particular problem that in far too many cases 
women wake up in their own houses and are afraid. When we 
talk about fighting this problem it does not mean that we think 
less of the victims of other forms of violence. It does mean that 
we underline this problem as a special one, as one that needs 
special responses and special protections. I mentioned 
journalists before and I spoke about Ian MacDonald from the 
CBC. I want to say a word about Stevie Cameron. I doubt there is 
a woman who read the <I>Globe and Mail</I> that week that does not 
remember Stevie Cameron's incredible column that was  
entitled ``What do we tell our bright and shining daughters?'' 
She spoke for all of us, those who are the mothers of daughters 
and those who are not but who have a responsibility to all the 
daughters. She talked about issues of safety. She talked about 
bringing up young women so that they do not have to be afraid. 
She talked about the way we all worry about our young, whether 
they are ours personally or ours generically. I will always 
remember her words.
<P>
<B>(1515) </B>
<P>
	Just yesterday I looked at a plaque in my office with the 
pictures of those 14 young women. I think the average age was 
22. There was one I remember looking at and saying: ``Gosh she 
was quite old. She was 29''. I think of the terrible waste that took 
place in Montreal that night. Those young women would have 
made such a contribution to their profession, to their own 
families, to their communities, to their province, to their 
country, to all of us.
<P>
	Madam Edwards mentioned in her interview in the Montreal 
<I>Gazette</I> this morning that what was lost there was not just all 
that beauty, talent, youth and enthusiasm. As a country we lost 
some of our innocence and our naivete because, as my colleague 
from Renfrew-Nipissing-Pembroke said, this is not supposed 
to happen in Canada and suddenly it had happened.
<P>
	We have many spirited debates about the question of gun 
control, about questions of violence, about how to deal with and 
how to make sure that what happened in Montreal will never 
happen again. If we are lucky never again will we see a mass 
murder like that. We all pray that we will not. The tragedy is that 
we do see this violence against women every day.
<P>
	There is a badge that some of us are wearing today that says: 
``Never again, December 6, 1989''. The tragedy is that it is still 
going on. The tragedy is that we have not yet come to grips with 
how to deal with the question of violence against women. The 
tragedy is that every six days a woman is killed in this country 
with a firearm. I did not make up that statistic. It is not false. It is 
there. The tragedy is that women are beaten, brutalized and 
abused.
<P>
	Yes, others are beaten, brutalized and abused but on a 
continuum-I underline this and repeat this-there is a 
particular, horrible and deep-rooted problem in our society, 
right here in Canada, whether in British Columbia, Yukon, Nova 
Scotia, southern Ontario, whether in a city or on a farm, it can 
and does happen in every single one of our ridings. To a degree 
we are all frightened and struck by our helplessness in the face 
of this ghastly and unacceptable situation.
<P>
	We are legislators. We are all here, every one of us, no matter 
what our political belief or background, because we want to do 
what is best for our constituents and for the people of our 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8705"> 8705 </A></B>
<P>
country. We have to legislate in the way we see fit. We have to 
understand that to root out  this kind of horrible growth in our 
society, sometimes the surgery that has to be undertaken is 
radical.
<P>
<B>(1520) </B>
<P>
	If it means intervening and removing certain rights, whether it 
is the right to privacy, the right to have certain things in our 
possession, then I have to say that every single one of us has to 
understand that the problem is so severe and so ongoing and so 
all-pervasive that I fear we will all be judged very harshly if we 
do not take the steps necessary to cure it.
<P>
	A year and a half ago the blue ribbon panel on violence against 
women reported. It was the summer before the election and part 
of my job at that time was to respond. I now think that to some 
degree my response was harsh. It was an expensive panel. As the 
hon. member for Yukon mentioned, it spent almost $11 million. 
To this day I have reservations about some of its responses.
<P>
	However, one thing I did not make enough of at the time and I 
need to make something of today, and I know other speakers will 
also, is the committee very clearly stated the acceptance by the 
general population of the deep-seated problem of violence 
against women. I call it what it is, violence against women. It is 
not domestic violence, not spousal violence. Do not try to hide it 
behind words. It is violence against women. It is something that 
too many people in our society still do not accept. They think 
that it belongs to some strange subculture. There are some even 
in the House, and again I impute no motives but is just a lack of 
awareness, who think it is provoked, who think that there are 
reasons in a victimology that creates violence against women.
<P>
	We all have to ensure that we understand the issue, and that we 
understand that to hit another person is wrong. It is a criminal 
offence. It does not deserve to be put in a special category 
because it happened in the home, because it was between 
husband a wife, because it was between two people who share a 
bed and a history that it is somehow different. It is violence. It is 
always a crime. It is never acceptable. There are too many dead 
bodies. There are too many injured women. There are too many 
scarred children.
<P>
	This is Canada. The member for 
Renfrew-Pembroke-Nipissing said it five years ago tonight: 
``This kind of thing does not happen here''. This kind of thing 
should not happen here. But we have a responsibility to do 
everything in our power as legislators to ensure that it does not.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Catterall:</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. Because 
of the interest in this debate, I wish to inform you and the House 
that the government members will be dividing their time from 
this point on.
<P>
<B>(1525 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ian McClelland (Edmonton Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it is a privilege to join in the debate and to follow the 
very moving and eloquent words of the member for Halifax. I 
am sure the House was moved in a very real and a very positive 
way five years ago when this tragic occurrence took place.
<P>
	It is particularly timely to reflect on that. We are exploring 
violence in our society as we begin to discuss the impending 
legislation, Bill C-41, which is the hate law and the legislation 
to come on gun control.
<P>
	All of these things are intermingled and mixed with the 
violence that seems to be pervasive in our society. When we turn 
on the television and see children's programs that are one 
violent scene after another, when we go to movies and see that 
they are based almost exclusively on violence can we wonder 
when it happens in our midst what causes it?
<P>
	This incident was horrible to a degree that we in Canada had 
not ever seen previously. It was aimed not randomly but 
specifically at women. The action was taken by someone who 
could have lived next door to any one of us, by someone who 
could have been one of our children, someone who otherwise 
seemed to be normal and just like everybody else.
<P>
	This happened to ordinary people who were identified 
specifically because they were women and the killer thought 
they were a threat to him. They were engineering students in an 
occupation that traditionally has not had a lot of women.
<P>
	My wife and I have a daughter who is an engineer. We 
understand that females who are engineers are unique because 
there are not that many of them. This touches so many of our 
lives because of the very ordinariness of the people who were 
affected by it and by the fact that it happened in Canada. This 
kind of thing just does not happen in Canada.
<P>
	It does happen in Canada. It happens all over our country. It 
happens with alarming frequency. It happens with randomness. 
Here in Ottawa we had a young man who had just finished 
university shot and killed by a random act of violence in a 
drive-by shooting by a young offender.
<P>
	When we compare that to the horrific events of the l'École 
Polytechnique five years ago, we have to speak to all of the 
people who are victims of violence, not just those who were 
tragically killed that night. Barb Danelesko was awakened in her 
home. She is just as dead, just as gone from her loved ones as 
anyone else.
<P>
	As a society and as a legislative body we need to get beyond 
the superficial and see if we cannot find out what are the 
underlying problems in our society that cause or will allow this 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8706"> 8706 </A></B>
<P>
kind of tragedy to happen. Violence against women is usually a 
domestic situation.
<P>
<B>(1530) </B>
<P>
	One thing that has puzzled me is that when there is violence in 
a domestic situation it is the women and the children who end up 
leaving the home and going to a shelter. The perpetrator of the 
violence is given a warning but usually that is about it. It is 
usually a male and he is usually allowed to go to work and lead a 
fairly normal life. What happens to the children? They end up 
being shunted about, torn from their home, torn from the things 
most familiar to them, torn from their friends and perhaps even 
torn from extended families if they are being stalked.
<P>
	Why can we not throw the husband in jail? It is because the 
husband has rights. Society does not have rights. The children 
do not have rights. The wife who may well be dead does not have 
rights but the husband has rights.
<P>
	The member for Halifax mentioned in her dissertation when 
she alluded to the question of gun control that sometimes in the 
greater good the rights of others need to be trampled. I believe in 
this reference she was speaking about firearms, and perhaps the 
rights of people to own and use firearms for the greater good 
have to be in some way restricted.
<P>
	If we accept that as being true, surely in the interest of the 
same greater good the rights of husbands should also be 
curtailed. It makes absolutely no sense to me that society would 
have a situation where we protect the rights of an abuser or a 
husband, take the wife and the children from the home and put 
them into a shelter because we cannot in any way interfere with 
the rights of the husband. It makes no sense whatsoever. Why 
can we not throw him in jail for 90 days or 120 days, for a 
cooling off period?
<P>
	Statistics show the vast majority of women are injured or 
killed as a result of domestic situations. However also in a vast 
majority of cases neighbours or friends know a disaster is about 
to happen. If we as fellow citizens, neighbours or relatives know 
that, why can we not intervene? Why can we not tell the police?
<P>
	One of the underlying factors in domestic homicide is 
violence. If people are not getting along the chances of them 
being shot are greatly enhanced. Therefore it would be a good 
idea if the police very quietly and very gently said: ``We know 
you are having problems. We do not want them to get worse. We 
know that you have guns. We want to remove these guns from 
your home for the protection of society and for the greater good. 
When the problems abate we will return them''.
<P>
	These laws are on the books right now. It would not require 
one new law. The police have the right to confiscate weapons if 
they feel and have good knowledge that there is the possibility 
of a crime being committed with the weapons.
<P>
	We need to be cautious when we are promulgating laws that 
deal with violence in homes, violence in general or violence in 
society. We have a situation in the country where violence is 
really endemic in society. In my view we are now trying to put 
politics ahead of principle. The principle we as a nation should 
hold dear is that we will not condone or in any way allow 
violence to become the way to resolve disputes in our society. 
Whether it is father and son, husband and wife or brother against 
brother, we are not going to use violence as a means of solving 
disputes in society.
<P>
<B>(1535) </B>
<P>
	We all agree on principle. I am sure every member of the 
House would disagree with the statement of principle that we do 
not want violence to be the means by which we resolve 
differences. What happens in a society when we say that some 
forms of violence or violence directed toward some people is 
more reprehensible than others? In my view that happens when 
we start to introduce penalties associated with a defining 
characteristic of the victim rather than the principle that we 
should not be doing it. It is almost as though we make 
allowances for some forms of violence or violence toward some 
people because they do not happen to fit in to a protected 
category.
<P>
	I know this is not the intent of the legislation. I know this is 
not the intent of the government. However it is the reality of the 
legislation and the government if not the intent. We have 
abrogated the principle of evenness and fairness to all and 
replaced it with the notion that crimes committed against a 
person of a particular gender or with a particular defining 
characteristic are more heinous than crimes committed against 
the norm. That just does not make sense.
<P>
	It does not speak to the root problem in society, that we 
tolerate ever increasing levels of violence as a means of 
resolving disputes. We see that in our grade schools. We see that 
on television when we turn on the TV. I wonder how many 
people have ever seen ``Power Rangers'', the children's program 
that was banned in many places.
<P>
	When children grow up watching an ever increasing level of 
violence that is accepted, tolerated and condoned, is it any 
wonder that we end up with a society that uses violence to 
resolve disputes? I am speaking directly to the question of 
domestic violence, which is the vast majority of violence in our 
society.
<P>
	Another form of violence I would like to spend a few minutes 
speaking to this afternoon is the violence directed toward 
children. That violence is the passive violence of neglect. In 
Edmonton there is a home called the Youth Emergency Shelter 
which is pretty much run by a few professional, very capable 
staff members and a lot of volunteers. It is pretty much 
supported by donations. It has a tremendous reputation within 
the community.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8707"> 8707 </A></B>
<P>
	In 1983 in a nine-month period the Youth Emergency Shelter 
in Edmonton comforted around 200 young people around the 
ages of 14 to 16. Last year it was 200 and some or about a 15 per 
cent increase in the number of people helped by the Youth 
Emergency Shelter. We talked to the people at the shelter and 
asked them why people came to them and what their success rate 
was in salvaging young lives.
<P>
<B>(1540 ) </B>
<P>
	If we are to use a prophylactic approach to violence in our 
community, it would make great sense to be far more 
interventionist in support of agencies like the Youth Emergency 
Shelter so that children and young people 13 years old, who 
certainly could not be called children, have a place to which to 
go and be welcomed without question. They do not have to go to 
the door, knock on the door and ask to come in because they have 
done this or that. All they have to do is show up. When they are 
there they have to abide by the rules. They are welcomed. They 
are fed. They are given warmth and love. An attempt is made 
when possible to reunite the young people with their families.
<P>
	What often happens is that a situation between a parent and a 
child becomes desperate and reaches a pivotal moment. Words 
are said and perhaps even blows are exchanged. One thing leads 
to another and the child leaves the home. Even if it is not the 
case, many young people feel they just cannot go back, that they 
are not welcome.
<P>
	In many cases all that is required is a cooling off period, an 
opportunity for the young people to give it a second thought and 
the parents to speak to someone who has had some experience in 
this regard. As parents we all perhaps think we are inventing 
every situation as it comes along, but I have learned through my 
association, limited thought it is, with the Youth Emergency 
Shelter and my long experience with the youth programs of the 
Rotary that none of us are going through a unique occurrence. It 
has always happened to someone else before and many of us are 
in exactly the same boat.
<P>
	It requires someone with some skill, some compassion and 
motivation to be an intervener and to build a bridge between the 
parents and the children to get the children, where possible, back 
into the nurturing environment of their homes. As we know that 
is not always the case. From time to time the only hope for a 
young person is to get out of an abusive situation.
<P>
	We could make a tremendous return on our investment in 
society if we were to ensure that those young people who could 
not go back to their homes had another place to which they could 
go where they would feel safe and secure. We could keep them 
out of jail and perhaps they could become productive members 
of society.
<P>
	I have had an opportunity to share in the debate today. I did so 
recognizing that violence in society directed toward women is 
something that all of us, men and  women, have a role to play in 
preventing or in some way ameliorating. As well we need to look 
at the complete and the broader picture of violence as a part of 
our society, in particular the passive violence of neglect and 
abuse of children at home.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Earlier I said that I would recognize 
the hon. member for Matapédia-Matane. Since the Minister of 
Justice is not here to take the floor, I recognize the member for 
Matapédia-Matane.
<P>
	<B>Mr. René Canuel (Matapédia-Matane, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
it goes without saying that we must remember. I was at home 
when I heard about the tragedy at the École polytechnique. Even 
five years later, the memory is almost just as painful.
<P>
	I spent my whole adult life as a high school teacher in a rural 
area.
<P>
<B>(1545) </B>
<P>
	Even in a comprehensive secondary school with 1,200 
students, there was quite a bit of violence, so much so in fact that 
some children were persecuting each other in almost a tragic 
way.
<P>
	When I first started teaching there was some violence, but it 
was more sporadic. However, toward the end of my career, it had 
become almost a daily occurrence.
<P>
	Earlier, we referred to verbal abuse, which is very prevalent 
among young people. It is fine to describe that violence, and 
when we discuss violence, we forget about partisan 
considerations and think only about the victims, but we forget 
about meanness.
<P>
	I have a question for this House: Why is there so much 
violence? It goes without saying that if a young boy is not loved, 
he will not like himself. And a young boy who does not like 
himself will develop a mean streak which he will express in 
various ways.
<P>
	How does he behave? He hits, makes harsh comments, or 
hurls insults. It is said that violence generates violence. Gangs 
are organized: three against three, four against four, and so on. 
These gangs carry on their activities; they often use drugs and 
then they find weapons. There is practically no limit to what 
they will do.
<P>
	How de we stop that? I believe there are several ways. By 
looking for the causes of violence, we will find the means to stop 
it. We feel that prevention is an excellent means to that end. In 
some schools, there is a lot more prevention than in others and 
violence has diminished considerably.
<P>
	It is also true that where poverty and unemployment are a fact 
of life, crime tends to be more widespread.
<P>
	The massacre of these young students was a tragedy, I agree. 
But two young people who make a suicide pact is also a tragedy. 
This happened in my riding two years ago, when two young 
people committed suicide. When you consider that these were 
intelligent, healthy youngsters, you wonder why they no longer 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8708"> 8708 </A></B>
<P>
wanted to go on living. Why did they want to take their own 
lives? There must  be a reason. And I wondered how at sixteen, 
seventeen or twenty, you could consider suicide. Many of my 
students committed suicide, and every time I said to myself: 
There is a reason. There is a reason, because we instinctively 
hold on to life, as anyone who has been near death will agree.
<P>
<B>(1550) </B>
<P>
	If you are in good health and you decide to take your own life, 
there may be several reasons but we have to find the right one.
<P>
	Other students are in prison, some of my own students whom I 
see from time to time. Apparently, at 15 or 16 they were like 
everybody else, just as open-hearted. So what happened? Why 
did it happen to him and not someone else? Maybe it was some 
experience they had in their lives or somehow they had reached 
the point of no return, with very unfortunate results.
<P>
	I agree we need legislation on firearms but we need more than 
that. I think that starting with primary school, we must find ways 
to wipe out this petty violence that occurs year after year. How 
can a three or four year old child become so aggressive that he is 
almost ready to strangle his next door neighbour? If we take 
them at 25 and send them to jail, the cost to society is enormous. 
Sometimes they get out with new tricks, and some, although not 
all, become repeaters.
<P>
	My main concern is not firearms. I agree that we should 
control guns. I could not agree more. It does not make sense to 
send people to prison for 20, 25 or 30 years, and turn them into 
hardened criminals. I am not saying we should not do that, that is 
not what I mean. My point is that we have to go to the root of the 
matter and find out the initial causes as soon as possible.
<P>
	Some children go to primary school without breakfast or 
lunch and only have a snack for supper.
<P>
	Some of my oldest students were saying that poverty did not 
exist or hardly. Once, during the holiday season at the school 
where I taught we made Christmas baskets. I told these older 
students who were big and tough and sure of themselves to come 
with me. They came, and the first house we went to we saw two 
cases of empty beer bottles, each with 24 bottles, and a man 
lying on a kind of chesterfield. The cupboards were bare and 
children were crying.
<P>
	When we got back, these guys who were 16, 17 or 18 and 
pretty tough, said: Poverty does exist, and we should go and visit 
poor families more often. These kids had been in trouble before, 
some had been convicted of theft. They felt they were luckier 
than others, but it takes time to make them understand. They 
should have these experiences, otherwise they harden their 
hearts and lose their self-esteem, and then they will do anything 
to survive. They try to be tough and become marginalized.
<P>
	So to come back to what I was saying, I am glad the Minister 
of Justice is here.
<P>
<B>(1555) </B>
<P>
	I want to ask the minister whether all the legislation we are 
going to adopt should not emphasize prevention. Prevention 
should take place at the earliest possible age, because once a 
person is 40 and has been in prison repeatedly, I am not saying 
nothing can be done, but it is certainly far more difficult.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney 
General of Canada, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, first of all, let me quote 
the message published in Quebec newspapers today:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Every citizen had to open their eyes and refuse to tolerate the various 
expressions of violence against women, from the smallest to the biggest, most 
obvious ones.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	``Never again, Polytechnique!''
<P>
	I have personally undertaken, as Minister of Justice, to put 
forward measures to counter violence.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	When we are asked what the government is doing with respect 
to violence in society and violence against women in particular, 
a frank and direct answer must be that we are not doing enough.
<P>
	We have taken certain steps and we resolve to take others. 
Working with the members of the House who have expressed so 
eloquently today their commitment to the principles we share 
and to the effort which we have embarked upon, I think we can 
truly make a difference through this legislation.
<P>
	The steps we have taken include the changes contemplated in 
Bill C-42 to the regime of peace bonds which makes peace 
bonds easier to obtain from the court, which permit the 
applications for those protective orders to be made by police 
officers on behalf of women victims and which makes the 
enforcement and the consequences for the breach of such orders 
more significant.
<P>
	I refer as well to the creation of the National Crime Prevention 
Council. I agree without hesitation with the comments made by 
the hon. member who spoke just before me about the importance 
of prevention in everything that we do. The National Crime 
Prevention Council which met for the second time in October 
has taken violence against women and children in Canadian 
society as one of its priority objectives during the coming 
months.
<P>
	I refer as well to the family violence initiative, led by my 
colleague the Minister of Health, and the efforts that initiative 
involves to co-ordinate the actions of governments at all levels 
to address domestic violence toward women and children.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8709"> 8709 </A></B>
<P>
	I refer to the announcement last week of the firearms control 
policy of this government and the very direct way in which it is 
intended to deal with domestic violence. Yesterday morning I 
had the honour of speaking in Edmonton at a breakfast organized 
to raise funds for shelters for women who are the victims of 
violence and for community services for such victims. I 
emphasized there one of the reasons why our firearms control 
policy is sensible. One of the reasons why universal registration 
is required is so that it will permit police the real tool to enforce 
prohibition orders where they are made in the context of a 
domestic dispute.
<P>
	Nowadays, although prohibition orders are provided for by 
law, when the police officers arrive to enforce them they have no 
idea of what firearms are in that home. They must take the word 
of the occupant to determine what firearms should be taken 
away. That is simply not good enough. There should be a 
register. There will be a universal register of firearms and that 
will be overcome.
<P>
	I can refer as well to the fact that I co-ordinate the efforts of 
nine ministers in the federal cabinet who work in a co-ordinated 
way to address the subject of violence in Canadian society 
generally. This includes the Minister of Canadian Heritage, for 
example, whose preoccupation in this context is with violence in 
broadcasting. It includes the Minister of Indian Affairs and 
Northern Development whose concern is for the incidence of 
violence in the aboriginal communities. Together, the nine 
ministers co-ordinate their efforts, working in a variety of ways 
to reduce and address the issue of violence.
<P>
<B>(1600) </B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Finally, on June 13, we tabled Bill C-41, to make a number of 
changes to the sentencing procedure. Under these proposals, 
abusing a position of trust or authority to commit a crime would 
be deemed to be an aggravating factor for the purpose of 
sentencing.
<P>
	This bill is designed to provide women with further protection 
against the violence they suffer at the hands of persons in a 
position of trust.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	That too will help, although none of these specific measures 
will be enough on its own.
<P>
	There is a great deal more for us to do as a government. We 
must do a better job in the Department of Justice in testing and 
auditing the impact of all laws, particularly the criminal laws in 
terms of gender. What is the gender impact of changes we 
propose from time to time to the criminal law?
<P>
	We must in the Department of Justice work harder and more 
urgently to resolve the issue that is getting worse by the month, 
dealing with the disclosure of confidential records in the course 
of criminal prosecutions, confidential records relating to female 
complainants that are subpoenaed from professionals who are 
treating the complainants, from confidants who may have heard 
the complainant make statements, from rape crisis shelters that 
may have helped the complainant immediately after the alleged 
event.
<P>
	We have to find a way to resolve that issue, balancing on the 
one hand the right of the accused person to make full answer in 
defence, which is fundamental to the law, but at the same time 
the right of complainants not to be revictimized through the 
unwarranted invasion of their private affairs and what amounts 
to intimidation to prevent them from participating in the 
prosecution.
<P>
	We must also grapple with the drunkenness defence in respect 
of which I am at work now to prepare legislative proposals for 
February. In many ways that is a woman's issue as well as a 
criminal law issue generally. It is no accident that the Daviault 
case involved allegations of sexual assault by a man against a 
women. It is no accident that the cases that occurred 
subsequently in other provinces too often involved allegations 
of violence by men against women.
<P>
	As we address these challenges, as we face up to the fact that 
we are not doing enough and that we must do more, as we 
approach the remaining tasks with an enhanced sense of urgency 
and commitment, I urge all members of the House to participate 
with the government, to take on this societal imperative. Our 
daughters must grow up to inherit a different country, a country 
which expressly and as a fundamental matter of citizenship 
rejects violence in all forms and rejects violence against women 
and children in particular. That must be our goal and we must 
work together to achieve it.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Leon E. Benoit (Vegreville, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I do not 
think there is any doubt that everyone in the House abhors 
violence, whether it is against women or against anyone else. 
There is no doubt about that.
<P>
	I have heard a recurring theme here today. It is a theme, it 
seems to me, to make all of us feel guilty, especially men. This 
theme runs through the Canadian Human Rights Act, through 
the Charter of Rights and Freedoms and through other 
legislation that has been directed against men and in particular 
white men.
<P>
	I would like to ask a rhetorical question of the minister. Is this 
fair? Is it not time to talk about violence against anyone as a 
serious matter? Is it not time to deal with the criminal who is 
committing the violence and deal to some extent with the 
potential criminals who are likely to commit violence? You do 
that best in a family setting. Instead of just trying to make men 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8710"> 8710 </A></B>
<P>
particularly feel guilty, is it not a better approach to deal with 
the criminals and with the crime that is committed and with 
prevention through the family?
<P>
<B>(1605) </B>
<P>
	Instead of putting forward legislation that is damaging the 
family, destroying the family, instead give the family fair 
treatment under our tax regulations, under our social program 
system and under other areas of law, particularly under the 
minister's control.
<P>
	I have one further part to this question concerning gun 
control. If the gun control the minister is proposing prevents 
violent crime, will the minister take personal responsibility for 
any crime that is committed once these laws are in place? Will 
the minister, when realizing that this gun control legislation 
totally fails, take the next step which is confiscation of all 
firearms?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Rock:</B> Mr. Speaker, I do not speak as I do because I wish 
to make the hon. member or any other person feel guilty. I speak 
as I do to make all of us together feel responsible for changing 
the way things are.
<P>
	I do not single out white men or middle aged men or men with 
blond hair or any other subcategory of the population. What I am 
suggesting is that we must face the facts. Violence in all of its 
forms against anyone is unacceptable. However sometimes 
violence against particular groups in society is so predominant, 
so widespread, so ingrained in the culture that it has to be 
identified for particular action.
<P>
	Let me tell members why I say that. In November 1993, 
Statistics Canada published a survey which was unique in all the 
world. It surveyed a huge segment of the population about 
violence. All members of the population surveyed were women.
<P>
	They found, among other things, that over half of the women 
surveyed had been the victims of an act of violence committed 
by a man against them during their adult life. That is 
extraordinary.
<P>
	What am I? I am a middle aged white Anglo-Saxon male. If 
members went out and surveyed the middle class, white, middle 
aged Anglo-Saxon males you would not find anything like that 
kind of statistic in terms of victimization of violence. Why do 
we not face the facts? We have a problem here. We have a 
problem.
<P>
	The man who walked into l'École polytechnique with the 
Ruger Mini-14 five years ago today said something when he 
pulled the trigger. He said bring on the women. I want to get the 
women. He killed 14 of them and injured another 13. It was at 
random. He was not after white, middle class Anglo-Saxon 
lawyers. He was after women, so let us deal with the reality.
<P>
	It is everywhere. May I ask the hon. member if he has seen the 
television programs recently, the rock videos on MTV or the 
commercials that peddle products? What is implicit in them is 
the victimization of women which is deplorable. Let's stop it. I 
am not doing that to make anybody feel guilty.
<P>
	Of course I support the family. That is where we must begin. 
We must teach children from the beginning to treat other people 
as human beings first, not on the basis of gender.
<P>
	In so far as gun control is concerned, yes, I strongly believe 
that those measures will help address, among other things, 
domestic violence. Do I say that such violence will never occur 
with these changes? Of course not, because we cannot make it a 
perfect world. But I firmly believe that they will help to make 
things better.
<P>
	I urge the hon. member in closing to not feel guilty because it 
is not anyone's intention to make him feel guilty for what others 
have done, rather to join us in feeling responsible. Together as 
members of this legislature we can do something to make it a 
somewhat a better world.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> There is about a minute left. I would 
ask the member and the minister to divide that minute between 
the two of them please.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dick Harris (Prince George-Bulkley Valley, Ref.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I do not have much time therefore I will just say 
what I want to say to the Minister of Justice.
<P>
	I listened to him talk about prevention. Prevention is a key 
element in cutting the violence in our society. I hate and despise 
violence as much as anyone in the House. I want to hear the hon. 
minister use the words deterrent, consequence and penalty more 
often so that I can have some comfort in my belief that more 
severe consequences for violent crimes is on the hon. minister's 
agenda.
<P>
<B>(1610) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Rock:</B> Mr. Speaker, I will be brief in just saying that 
deterrence is an essential part of this. I am the person who 
introduced decisions last week increasing to four years 
mandatory minimum penitentiary time for anyone who uses a 
firearm in any one of ten serious offences, including robbery.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Thompson:</B> No parole?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Rock:</B> No, but we will discuss this in committee. I am the 
one who proposed-
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Order, please. The time has expired.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Sue Barnes (London West, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to have the opportunity to speak on this matter today.

St-Arnault and Annie Turcotte.  These are the names of the 14 
women whose lives were needlessly extinguished at the Ècole 
Polytechnique five years ago.
<P>
	It has always bothered me that the name of their assailant 
comes more readily to mind than theirs. Today and every future 
December 6 is now designated as Canada's national day of 
remembrance and action to end violence against women. 
Ceremonies, vigils and public actions will focus public 
awareness on the many far-reaching implications of violence 
against women. These involve the social, psychological and 
economic well-being of women, men and children across 
society and across Canada.
<P>
	Tonight in my city of London a monument memorializing the 
14 women and others who are victims of violence is being 
unveiled. The monument is inscribed: ``The London Women's 
Monument was dedicated on December 6, 1994, the fifth 
anniversary of the Montreal massacre. It is a place to remember 
and reflect on violence, particularly violence against women, 
and all women and men who work to end it''.
<P>
	Women's rights are human rights. We must acknowledge that 
violence against women is often a byproduct of gendered social 
inequality and can be a rejection of women's progressive 
empowerment.
<P>
	Change can be led by governments but the most effective 
change begins with individuals. All men and women can make a 
personal commitment to the principle of zero tolerance, that no 
amount of violence is acceptable and that women's safety is a 
priority. As individuals we can focus more on co-operation 
instead of competition.
<P>
	Earlier today the four federal and provincial female London 
politicians, representing three different political parties, issued 
a joint statement speaking out against violence against women. 
Violence against women is a social issue, even though many see 
it only as a political issue.
<P>
	As individuals we can decide not to laugh at women-hating 
jokes, just as we do not laugh at racial slurs. Violence against 
women is not a funny issue. As individuals we can listen and 
discuss women's experiences, their fears and the equality 
barriers they face. It is still much more comfortable to be 
dismissive or to trivialize the alarming statistics which we have 
now compiled. Denial has never solved problems. It is time now 
to speak out and challenge any tolerance of violence or sexist 
behaviour.
<P>
	Where possible, individuals can give financial or political 
support to services for victims and survivors. Individuals can 
volunteer at local transition homes and rape crisis shelters and 
be supportive of municipal, provincial, federal and 
non-government initiatives in their own neighbourhoods and 
cities. Violence against women robs women of their 
self-esteem, their dignity and in too many cases it robs them of 
their life.
<P>
	Since Statistics Canada conducted its first national survey on 
violence against women in 1993, which was the first of its kind 
worldwide, the gravity of the situation has been brought to light. 
According to this survey, as many as 51 per cent of Canadian 
women have experienced at least one incident of physical or 
sexual violence since the age of 16. Almost 45 per cent of all 
women experienced violence by men known to them, their dates, 
boyfriends, marital partners, friends, family, their neighbours.
<P>
<B>(1615 ) </B>
<P>
	A woman is shot every six days in Canada. Firearms are the 
weapon of choice for spousal homicides. During the period 
between 1974 and 1992, 42 per cent of the women killed by their 
spouses were shot. As shattering as these statistics are they only 
account for part of the problem since Statistics Canada defines 
violence as experiences of physical or sexual assault. It does not 
touch upon other dimensions of violence to which many women 
are subjected.
<P>
	Three other areas identified in the 1993 report ``Changing the 
Landscape: Ending Violence-Achieving Equality'' are 
psychological violence, being violence that encompasses 
various tactics to undermine a woman's self-confidence; 
financial violence whereby a woman's access to employment or 
investment opportunities are curtailed by a partner or family 
member; and spiritual abuse in which cultural and religious 
beliefs are destroyed through ridicule or punishment. A wide 
range of indicators give evidence that this societal ill is 
pervasive and systemic.
<P>
	As a result women from all walks of life are targets of various 
acts of violence. Not only are the causes and the forms of 
violence against women extremely insidious but so too are their 
effects. Violence scars not only women but also the children and 
the men around them. It marks the body but also deeply wounds 
the mind and the spirit of those affected.
<P>
	As a result of having been abused a woman's physical and/or 
mental health may be at stake. Her chances of advancement in 
her working life may be jeopardized and her interpersonal skills 
generally deteriorate.
<P>
	As well as having these devastating effects on the women 
concerned, such violence is proven to seriously destabilize the 
children who witness it. Boys who are brought up in an abusive 
household are more likely to become violent fathers and girls 
are more likely to become victims at the hands of their future 
partners. In fact women with violent fathers-in-law are three 
times more at risk than those women with non-violent 
fathers-in-law. We have to stop these cycles.
<P>
	As in other issues such as poverty and crime there will never 
be one Utopian legislative effort. There are no magic wands that 
can instantly eradicate the scourge of violence against women. 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8712"> 8712 </A></B>
<P>
As with all complex issues there must be interdisciplinary 
approaches.
<P>
	First, we must state what we stand for. Canada has done this 
internationally by initiating the UN declaration on the 
elimination of violence against women which was adopted in 
December 1993. For the first time internationally we have the 
appointment of a United Nations special rapporteur on violence 
against women who will report to the United Nations 
Commissioner of Human Rights starting March 1995.
<P>
	Next we look at all levels of government agendas and 
incorporate concrete concepts that will move us toward the goal 
of ending violence against women. This will of necessity 
include increased public education.
<P>
	Last April the Department of Canadian Heritage 
collaboratively launched a three year radio and television 
campaign on violence in society. In October 1994 the court 
challenges program was reinstated to ensure funding for legal 
cases of national significance which clarify equality and 
language rights under Canada's Constitution.
<P>
	The sentencing reform bill is now being studied in committee 
which would assist in providing different options to deal with 
crime, including violence.
<P>
	Earlier this year in the House I spoke on another bill with 
more than 100 amendments to the Criminal Code, including 
provisions that would make peace bonds more effective. For 
example, police officers will be able to apply for peace bonds on 
behalf of the women at risk.
<P>
	The National Crime Prevention Council was established in 
July 1994. It will address women's vulnerability to crime as part 
of its mandate.
<P>
	I believe that the firearms control being introduced will also 
effect safety in our homes and in our streets. A national firearms 
registry, the banning of certain firearms, including the one used 
in the Montreal massacre, and more flexible prohibition orders, 
will benefit women and should save lives.
<P>
	Last June the federal, provincial and territorial ministers 
responsible for the status of women adopted the Regina 
declaration on the rights of women subjected to violence which 
calls on the justice system to ensure the equal protection of 
women subjected to violence. In the same month the federal 
justice minister, the federal health minister and the Secretary of 
State for the Status of Women held a consultation with women's 
groups on the issue of violence against women. Further 
consultation will continue. I believe that it must be ongoing if 
we are to succeed in overcoming this problem.
<P>
	I am grateful that members of this House have been offered 
this opportunity to speak on the issue today.
<P>
<B>(1620 ) </B>
<P>
	My wish and my hope is that the sentiments expressed within 
this House today will carry us forward each and every day in our 
jobs as legislators so that we are ever mindful of the situation of 
women who experience violence in Canada. I believe we are 
progressing and I am  grateful for that. However, there is much 
that can still be done.
<P>
	I hope that individual Canadians listening today will continue 
to do their part in their homes, in their communities, and in our 
ridings.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The Chair views this as a very serious 
debate and would indicate that I recognized a member earlier 
who was in fact not on the list. I had misread the list and 
recognized the hon. member from the Bloc and gave him the 
floor which I should not have done.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	I was told that there was an agreement between the two 
parties. Because I made a mistake, the Official Opposition is 
now willing to let four Liberals speak one after the other. Is it 
agreed?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> I am sure that, with this agreement, all 
the members who want to do so will speak this afternoon. I now 
recognize the hon. member for York-Simcoe.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Karen Kraft Sloan (York-Simcoe, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I have a letter from a woman in my riding by the name 
of Sally. Sally has given me permission to make her letter 
public. Sally's letter speaks to the impact of violence on women 
and the resulting poverty they face. The letter was prepared for 
our Campaign 2000 meeting. Campaign 2000 is an umbrella 
organization comprised of many drawn together to fight child 
poverty.
<P>
	``My name is Sally and I am the independent parent of two 
little girls. I am also a financially challenged recipient of family 
benefits. While I am grateful for the assistance I receive, I will 
say that I have become discouraged by the system's lack of 
insight and insensitivity to the roadblocks faced by myself and 
others on the road to financial independence.
<P>
	``When I first became aware of Campaign 2000, the word 
poverty was a difficult one to envision in relation to my 
situation. Visions of starving children in third world countries 
leapt to mind. However, over time it has become increasingly 
difficult for me to meet my children's needs and systems and 
bureaucrats turn deaf ears in a country such as Canada. I have 
come to the brutal realization that I do indeed fall far below the 
poverty line.
<P>
	``In making the decision to leave an extremely abusive 
situation and needing to enter a woman's shelter, my life and 
that of my children changed abruptly two years ago, now 
reduced to relying on a system where $1,028 per month is to 
cover living expenses being accommodation, phone and 
utilities. Clothing and feeding myself and my two daughters 
becomes a hard lesson in the realities of life for far too many 
children in Canada. Food bank? I can only go once a month if I 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8713"> 8713 </A></B>
<P>
can get transportation. So, why not get a job? I have tried,  but 
unfortunately I live in a rural area where one opening at a local 
store gets over 300 applications. Tough competition for a stay at 
home mom out of the workforce for seven years.
<P>
	``Add in the problems of transportation and day care of an 
affordable nature and the picture becomes bleaker. So why not 
get some upgrading? Better your education. Again the obstacles 
of transportation, day care and waiting lists loom large.
<P>
	``Support? For two years now I have struggled with a system 
of lawyers, legal aid and the family support person in trying to 
get some financial relief for my daughters. After this period I 
have succeeded in having $22,000 in legal aid liens placed 
against my home and an agreement from my husband to pay 
$100 a month support, that is $50 per child. Since this agreement 
in June of this year has been in effect and in spite of the fact that 
he makes $50,000 per year, I have not received any support from 
him.
<P>
	``This person is also on probation for uttering death threats. 
Two provisions of his probation are (1) he must maintain his 
dependents. He has failed to do this. I have spoken with lawyers 
and his probation officer to try and enlist their help but my 
words fall on deaf ears.
<P>
<B>(1625 ) </B>
<P>
	``A second provision of his probation order is that he must 
seek and maintain employment. I'm now told he was laid off 
when he requested help from his probation officer in getting 
some relief. Despite that fact he still is seen at his work daily and 
despite that if he is in fact unemployed, that is the second breach 
of his probation. Still nothing is done.
<P>
	``A third provision of his probation is that he remain 300 
metres away from myself and my residence. He repeatedly 
breaks this provision. I have been again to his probation officer. 
I have been to her supervisor. I was told by a police officer that I 
was fabricating lies and thrown out of the police station by this 
officer. The police have been to my home repeatedly. One of the 
officer's comment was that until someone shows up with a bullet 
hole there's nothing that we can do.
<P>
	``If you are wondering what the third provision has to do with 
poverty and the plight of my children, I'll tell you. The financial 
strain of repairing busted doors, windows, plumbing that's been 
drilled and cut, slashed tires, having a crowbar taken to the side 
of my vehicle and numerous other acts of vandalism begins to 
take its toll.
<P>
	``The police have recommended doorbolts and deadlocks, 
expensive outdoor sensor lights. Well, for that you need money 
and hydro. A year ago in April after being unable to meet a 
payment deadline, the hydro to my home had been disconnected. 
It still remains so. Hydro tax-rolled my bill after running an 
original $800 bill up to over $1,700 with service charges and late 
payment charges. They also charged me for having their line and 
a hot water heater even though they cut their  service off. They 
still come every three months to read a meter I no longer have 
and then service charge me.
<P>
	``It was also explained to me that if I ever wanted Ontario 
Hydro back, I would pay for the lines to be reconnected plus they 
would require a $1,600 deposit. I would have phoned their head 
office, but in July of that same year Bell disconnected my phone 
for a $50 bill, despite the fact that they had required a $200 
deposit from me, despite the fact that at that time I was in a 
women's shelter while the trial was going on against my 
husband. While he was out on bail he left his probation officer's 
office and came to my home to once again threaten my children 
and myself.
<P>
	``In June of this year I received a call from the bank. Due to 
my husband's refusal to sign the mortgage renewal despite the 
court order that allowed me to reside in my home and add the 
fact that I'm on family benefits, I was told I had 30 days to 
vacate, despite the fact that I have faithfully paid the mortgage, 
taxes and now the hydro arrears. Another lawyer, another bill. I 
have one year to get this straightened out. Time is running out.
<P>
	``I rely on your imagination and empathy to realize what 
effect all this has had on my two little girls. I say those magic 
words social assistance and watch human decency and respect 
fly out the window. Buy a car? Home improvement loan? Start a 
business? I can hear the bank manager's laughter still ringing in 
my ears. I almost gave up there and then.
<P>
	``But I am here tonight because I owe it to my children to keep 
trying and hopefully one day someone will listen and changes 
will be made so my two daughters and all the other children in 
this nation of plenty will have a bright future.
<P>
	``Thank you for listening''.
<P>
	It is my understanding that Sally is now in hiding away from 
her abusive and very violent husband. I hope that somehow 
someone will be able to get these words to her so she will know 
that her story has been told on the floor of the House of 
Commons.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Leon E. Benoit (Vegreville, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, we have 
just heard a very touching story. It is upsetting to me because it 
shows that the proper laws are not in place to protect this person 
or that they are not enforced. Either case is totally unacceptable.
<P>
	The member should let the justice minister know this is 
totally unacceptable and demand that either the proper laws are 
put in place or that the laws that are there are enforced. I would 
like the member to comment on that.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8714"> 8714 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Kraft Sloan:</B> Mr. Speaker, I think it is very clear that in 
Sally's letter she has outlined a number of situations of 
institutional abuse.
<P>
<B>(1630 ) </B>
<P>
	It is very difficult when women are placed in this situation and 
they go to those people they feel should be protecting them, for 
example the police, and their charges are dismissed. They are 
told they are troublemakers. Part of the problem with this has to 
do with overall societal attitude.
<P>
	The Minister of Justice is very sensitive to these issues. I have 
heard members opposite say that we should be concerned about 
violence against all people. I totally agree with that but 
somehow violence against women is a special category and they 
are being made a special interest group.
<P>
	We have to understand that until we address the issue of 
violence against women as a particular kind of violence and the 
kinds of intimidation it creates for an entire group within this 
society, namely women, we will never be able to address the 
problems of institutional abuse. No matter how good our laws 
are unless the attitudes, the understanding and the sensitivities 
that are related to this very complex and devastating issue are 
understood these matters will not be addressed.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Dianne Brushett (Cumberland-Colchester, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, on this national day of remembrance and action to 
end violence against women I believe we should not only 
remember this act once a year but throughout the year.
<P>
	This House is well apprised of the statistics relating to the 
violence and abuse against women. These numbers represent 
those incidents which have been reported, the ones we know 
about. However, the number of violent and abusive incidents 
which have not been reported are even more frightening. It is a 
tidal wave which must be abated.
<P>
	When safe houses must be established in urban areas and 
police must begin escorting women to their homes to claim 
sometimes only the clothing on their backs or to visit their 
children, then it is a sad testimony to the state of relationship 
deterioration between men and women as well as the new face 
that family life in Canada is taking. When we must stand up in 
this House and legislate against indecent abnormal behaviour 
then the time has come for action not only on the part of 
government but also individuals and corporations, all who live 
within our communities.
<P>
	Violence is not some strange enigma which explodes from the 
ground in random procession. Its seeds are planted carefully 
years and even generations in advance. The images of violence 
children are exposed to on television and in society at large and 
the subsequent lessons they learn from parents sets in motion a 
cycle of learning aggressive behaviour which is as precise as 
clockwork.
<P>
	If through this cycle we instil in our children a low sense of 
self-worth or never help them to build a sense of self-esteem 
their lives are threatened. This is extremely counterproductive 
and increasingly dangerous as they grow older and develop 
intimate relationships because under the threat of having 
self-worth challenged they will either withdraw or lash out. 
Unfortunately more often than not the males in society are prone 
to lashing out with anger while females tend to withdraw.
<P>
	More often than not pressures are exerted from poverty, 
communication breakdown, community decay, alcohol and drug 
abuse, barrages of messages in the media to possess or acquire 
material goods in order to be relegated upward from a 
non-person status. All of these contribute to the already 
overwhelming pressures of rearing children and making choices 
in this day and age.
<P>
	All too often the metaphor that when soldiers are not fighting 
on the front they are fighting in the camps can be applied to this 
appalling situation of violence against women and children. 
Many good decent people who start off in a relationship with the 
best of intentions end up watching with shock and horror as their 
relationship decays into verbal and physical abuse as 
individuals either lash out with threats or actual violence.
<P>
	Why is this? The pressures of everyday life and finances draw 
a family's attention away from its primary goal: the 
establishment of family, roots and future to each other's 
personal performance and contribution in the relationship. 
When self-esteem is challenged there is either a withdrawal into 
separation and divorce or again lashing out in anger.
<P>
<B>(1635) </B>
<P>
	It is not the function and purpose of this government to 
interfere in the personal lives of Canadians. However, I believe 
we have a responsibility and we must make a conscious choice 
for the future on behalf of the family and on behalf of women 
and children specifically.
<P>
	Programs and policies must be developed which provide not 
only for zero tolerance but also give teeth that will allow law 
enforcement to implement changes. This must be set as a last 
resort for those who cross the line, who choose not only to 
brutalize but to exploit women and children as well.
<P>
	We must also change our view and our bias of interpersonal 
relationships. The laws we write must encourage protection of 
both the immediate and extended families. We must allow for 
dealing with potential abuse through caring professionals. A 
sense of community and personal accountability must be 
developed in the inner cities.
<P>
	Finally, we must not only begin to communicate but we must 
also listen. I would venture to say that the 63 women who were 
murdered in 1993 fell prey to a person who was already in a state 
of detachment and isolation. If only there had been in existence 
a network of people with whom these spouses could talk openly 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8715"> 8715 </A></B>
<P>
and honestly  about their situation. We know that open and 
honest communication is not a prelude to murder.
<P>
	Again there must be communication in our society not only 
among our peers but outside our comfort zone as well. Parents 
must start talking to their children, grandparents with 
grandchildren, men with women, and labour with management.
<P>
	I fear that if the tide does not turn on this problem, if we do not 
start honestly communicating in a fashion that will solve rather 
than dissolve our relationships, then we as a society will be so 
distrustful that our internal growth will cease and Canadian 
families will continue to perish and die.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Rey D. Pagtakhan (Winnipeg North, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I would like to comment on my colleague's excellent 
articulation. I thank her for her thoughts. I would like to share a 
few of my thoughts by way of comment.
<P>
	Violence against women in a real sense is an insult to life. It is 
an indignity to our core Canadian values. As well it is a 
challenge to peace, order and good government.
<P>
	The incidents mentioned are staggering, but the real concern 
of course are the people who are affected the most: orphaned 
children, grieving families and the suffering of the whole 
community.
<P>
	I congratulate the member for her participation. It is hoped 
that violence against women which happened in the past and 
continues to happen will not happen in the future.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Brushett:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for his 
comments. As he has said, this does go beyond women, men and 
children. It is a community. Life in my estimation is a process of 
human relationships. The process of living is developing and 
sharing those relationships. Those relationships are what 
accumulate to make up the family which in turn makes up the 
community.
<P>
	I believe as the hon. member does that violence against any 
person is a violation of the dignity of human life. Human life is 
at the bottom of the foundation of all things we must respect in 
our communities.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup, BQ):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, when I heard of today's debate, I naturally thought 
about the victims at l'École polytechnique, but I also thought 
about all the other victims of violence, about the 300 and some 
women who have died in violent incidents since 1989, and about 
the thousands of women who face various acts of violence every 
day. It is important to see this situation, not necessarily as a 
particularly atrocious fact, but as a situation prevailing 
throughout our society, which has led to unacceptable 
behaviours and to which we must give priority so that Quebec 
society, Canadian society can be held up as an example of a 
violence free society.
<P>
<B>(1640) </B>
<P>
	Part of the problem we are facing can be found in this House 
today: all members are denouncing violence and saying that we 
must take the right measures to prevent such incidents from 
happening again in the future, but we encounter the same 
problem in society.
<P>
	Violence is often a problem, partly because we do not talk 
about the reality, the fact that people are affected. Victims of 
violence are not allowed to speak out, so they can overcome 
their fears and get on with their lives after going through a 
period of violence. For example, violent men have few 
opportunities to express who they are and release this negative 
energy, so that they can clean up their act and allow the situation 
to evolve.
<P>
	That is why, in considering what I expected from this debate, I 
thought a great deal about my children, my two daughters, 
Audrey and Maude, and my son, Renaud, because it is for them 
that we are trying to build a different society.
<P>
	When we read stories about how violence is perpetuated, we 
see that some behaviours are often passed on from father to son 
or from mother to daughter and that even abusers are not 
necessarily aware of their violent tendencies. As I said earlier, 
we must hold a public debate on the subject and initiate a 
dialogue that will enable us to correct these situations.
<P>
	Some specific ways to promote this dialogue are by 
supporting women's centres or groups that look after violent 
men, because you may have the best intentions in the world, but 
if you do not have the energy and resources needed for these 
discussions to go on, they will not take place and we will inherit 
the negative results, as we have for a long time, with tragic 
events like what happened at l'École polytechnique and all the 
tragic events that we learn about and which we hear reported as 
anecdotes; repression is suggested as the way to deal with them, 
but I think that repression is a last resort to prevent physical 
violence.
<P>
	Of course, we must eliminate violence by properly 
controlling firearms and all other instruments of violence; we 
must control them to prevent a recurrence of events like those at 
l'École polytechnique. But at the same time, we must look 
further and see what is behind this event and find out what 
caused it.
<P>
	We realize that conjugal violence and violence in general is a 
complex phenomenon because it involves not only poor 
families, middle class families or rich families. Domestic 
violence occurs in all classes of society and we must find ways 
to correct this problem.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8716"> 8716 </A></B>
<P>
	Earlier, I talked about creating proper conditions. However, 
many people in our society have basic needs that are not met, for 
education, family income, child care, equity in social programs; 
also, the new types of families in our society do not have the 
support services they need. Single-parent families and blended 
families experience completely new situations to which our 
social programs are not necessarily suited.
<P>
	I would also say that violence has a subversive aspect, a rather 
perverse aspect due to the inequality between men and women in 
terms of employment and career opportunities.
<P>
<B>(1645) </B>
<P>
	This perpetuates the feeling of inequality, and often allows 
some men to establish relations in which women are dependent, 
thus creating a situation which can potentially lead to violence. 
But there is not only physical violence; there are many other 
forms of violence.
<P>
	Consequently, it is important to do prevention from the time a 
child is born, since the way that child will develop will 
influence, to a degree, his perception of things. We must ensure 
that families can give birth to children in acceptable conditions, 
feed them properly and provide them with all the necessary 
elements to grow and build their self-esteem, so as to help them 
develop respect for their fellow citizens, members of the 
opposite sex and friends, as well as relations based on mutual 
respect instead of dependency.
<P>
	Clearly, we must launch an attack on several fronts. We are 
faced with a situation similar to that of child poverty, in the 
sense that a preventive and comprehensive strategy is required 
to end violence, but we also need ad hoc measures to deal with 
emergencies.
<P>
	It is also important to look at what can be done during the 
various stages of a child's development to curb the tendency to 
resort to violence. Do we grant adequate maternity leave to all 
Canadian women, so that they can give birth in proper 
conditions? If these women are single parents situation, do they 
have adequate financial resources to live in acceptable 
conditions?
<P>
	Later on, when a child is growing, does he benefit from 
adequate daycare services? Are there not people right now who 
would like to have access to such services to help their children 
develop in a proper environment? Do we not stereotype people 
increasingly?
<P>
	Children born in relatively well off families that can afford 
privately funded quality daycare will receive a more stable 
education. These children will develop more self-confidence. 
On the other hand, there are those who are trapped in the vicious 
circle of financial dependency and can see no way out. So we 
have to work to ensure that equal opportunities become more 
prevalent, so that 20 or 25 years from now, changes will be 
noticeable, with less violence and fewer groups living in 
conditions conducive to violence.
<P>
	Then there is school and career. If women go back to 
experiencing difficulty in finding employment and to being in a 
position of inferiority in the jobs that they do get, if they cannot 
have access to university careers, if we fail to eliminate 
stereotypes in that regard, we help perpetuate the existing 
climate.
<P>
	On that subject, choices must be made-they are still under 
consideration-concerning the social security reform for 
example. Students could have to take full responsibility for their 
loans. This means that they will have much higher debts to pay 
off when they graduate. And it would be unfair to women who 
would choose to start a family.
<P>
	Specific measures such as these do not have a direct bearing 
on dramatic acts of violence, but nevertheless add to the set of 
conditions which eventually lead to violence.
<P>
<B>(1650) </B>
<P>
	I would also like to see that, later in life, women who have 
grown up and become adults are able to start a family and have 
children in acceptable conditions, so that they do not find 
themselves in a situation where they themselves could become 
violent toward their children because we have failed to put in 
place an adequate social system to enable them to raise them in 
decent conditions.
<P>
	This whole debate on violence is a societal issue and, perhaps 
it should also be pointed out, an individual issue. Because 
somewhere we have to take a good look at ourselves and at our 
own behaviour. I think that if this debate made all Quebecers or 
all Canadians take a moment of their evening to think about and 
discuss potential sources of violence in their environments, as 
well as individual behaviours which could be corrected, and the 
need to adapt, we could say that we helped reduce the 
opportunities for violence in our society. I think that this would 
be a good response to today's debate. It is up to each one of us.
<P>
	This is also a government responsibility. A review is under 
way. The Minister of Justice spoke earlier about a series of 
measures that have been or will be taken, but important choices 
must be made regarding the resources to be allocated to the 
various programs, the approach to this problem, and I think that 
the results will show how successful our efforts were. This 
government must take concrete actions that will bring about 
some improvement in the situation and make our society better 
before the new millennium rolls around.
<P>
	When we commemorate again in five or ten years the terrible 
event that occurred at l'École polytechnique, instead of talking 
about the negative side of the current situation, we will at least 
be able to tell all those who were made aware of the issue of 
violence by this event, all those who made a contribution, all the 
women who circulated petitions until a gun control law was 
passed, that the mission has been accomplished. We will have 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8717"> 8717 </A></B>
<P>
succeeded in reducing violence in our society, and this may be 
the best test.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Geoff Regan (Halifax West, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I think 
this afternoon in this debate that many of us are in agreement. 
We in this House are very disturbed and share the sense of horror 
at the events that took place five years ago today. When we hear 
of these kinds of actions and hear about human suffering, we 
think of ourselves in those moments as one family, that it is one 
of our family who is suffering.
<P>
	I want to ask the member a question. It seems to me that he 
mentioned that social conditions are very important to people 
who may become violent in their lives. I wonder what he feels is 
the role of the economy. Does he feel that a weakened or a 
stronger economy that may have some impact on these sensitive 
issues?
<P>
[Translation] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Crête:</B> Mr. Speaker, I think that is an excellent question 
and I discussed it a little in my presentation when I talked about 
employment. Yes, I think that if this country had an active job 
creation policy for using our human resources to their full 
potential, it would mean that every man and every woman in our 
society could make his or her contribution to it.
<P>
<B>(1655) </B>
<P>
	An active employment policy would mean that we would care 
more about the whole social aspect, because our society now 
often tends to emphasize productivity as an end in itself, 
although Canadian society, despite its faults, has still developed 
some values like compassion.
<P>
	In this day and age, we should avoid following the American 
model blindly; we see the results they have obtained in terms of 
violence. They are our southern neighbours and we can see it 
right away. I think that is what haunts us in actions like the 
terrible event at l'École polytechnique, as someone said in an 
article in <I>Le Devoir</I> today. The writer saw it as an indication of 
what we might see, which is more commonly associated with the 
United States.
<P>
	I think that to counter that, to get back to the hon. member's 
question, yes, if the economy works well, if people work, if they 
pay taxes, we will be able to have a better distribution of justice. 
I think that is a contribution which this government could and 
should make in particular when it will have to adjust its reform 
of social programs to respond more closely to the 
representations made to it by many groups across Canada.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Dianne Brushett (Cumberland-Colchester, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, very quickly to the hon. member for 
Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup. He spoke with great integrity 
about women, the difficulty of developing careers and raising 
families, and the need almost to be a super human being, to do it 
all and to do it well with grace, dignity and respect for the 
children and family.
<P>
	What role do you believe that men play in the lives of sharing 
some of the responsibilities of child nurturing and rearing so 
that some of that pressure is relieved from the women in our 
society?
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Unless members want to hear from the 
Speaker I would ask them to put questions through the Chair.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Crête:</B> Mr. Speaker, I have a great interest in this issue, 
considering that with our work schedule as members of 
Parliament, it might be very tempting to adopt the traditional 
role of the father. That being said, as a man, I can only pay 
tribute to the hon. member for her work with children.
<P>
	One of the main things we can do is to act as men and parents 
who believe in a different model than the traditional one, a 
model based on respect for young girls and women, based on the 
belief that they deserve the same opportunities as men to 
develop their potential, and also based on real support in every 
day life, whenever possible.
<P>
	In the case of families where both spouses are often together, I 
believe in sharing chores. It is also important-and that goes for 
every family-to discuss problems and other issues such as 
spousal abuse, because these things do exist. For example, if we 
witness this type of violence on TV, it may be good to discuss it 
for a minute, instead of quickly switching channels.
<P>
	I also think that when half of the seats in this House will be 
filled by women, our institution will more balanced and will 
pass better laws which will take into account to an even greater 
degree what must be done to have new views on success and 
power.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker: </B>It is my duty, pursuant to Standing 
Order 38, to inform the House that the questions to be raised 
tonight at the time of adjournment are as follows: the hon. 
member for Malpeque-Trade; the hon. member for London 
West-Violence Against Women; the hon. member for 
Berthier-Montcalm-Canadian Security Intelligence Service.
<P>
<B>(1700) </B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul E. Forseth (New Westminster-Burnaby, Ref.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, today I rise to commemorate the infamous day of 
December 6, 1989. The national horror is incomprehensible, for 
there are no simple answers, no easy inferences to be drawn. We 
have an atmosphere of our times which seems to reflect a violent 
society. It is seen that our crime rates reflect a national psychol-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8718"> 8718 </A></B>
<P>
ogy. At times listening to what is put forward as fact in the 
House reflects a mood that could kill the soul, for we are so 
adversarial both in the House and in the community.
<P>
	As a former worker in the criminal justice system, I dealt too 
frequently with both the offender and the offended. Violence 
lessens us all in society. We as a society are all responsible for 
the permissiveness in general and our lack of courage as a 
community to denounce perpetrators.
<P>
	I concur with what has been said in the House today but, with 
due respect for this day, we must also recognize community 
trends. In the past crime was far from being an equal opportunity 
employer between the sexes, but the gap appears to be closing. 
Although five men were charged with criminal offences last 
year for every woman charged, a decade ago the proportion was 
seven to one. A similar trend is apparent in the United States 
where statistics show that the male:female arrest ratio in 1992 
had declined to just over four to one.
<P>
	Nowhere is the change more pronounced than in violent 
crime. In 1981 the ratio of men to women charged with crimes in 
this category which runs the gamut from threatening violence to 
cold blooded murder was almost nine to one.
<P>
	People who specialize in the study of crime say that statistics 
may also reflect a democratizing trend in the application of 
criminal justice. Maybe it is the end of chivalry. Studies have 
found differences in the way the criminal justice system 
historically has treated men and women. For instance, in the 
U.S. the death penalty has been much less likely to be imposed 
on a woman.
<P>
	Another possible explanation is that women are more likely to 
be charged today because society's growing intolerance of 
violence means that more people in general are being charged 
with low level violent crimes such as threatening.
<P>
	To the extent that women commit less serious violent crimes, 
there would be a bigger percentage increase. Statistics indicate 
that 62 per cent of women charged with violent offences involve 
assaults at the lowest level compared with 55 per cent of men 
charged.
<P>
	The fascinating question then is whether women are in fact 
becoming more criminally active. It is possible the trend is now 
surfacing in the newer data since there have been indications 
that the gender gap in crime is closing faster for young women.
<P>
	A definitive answer would require following the police 
around and seeing under what circumstances they lay charges. 
There has been an enormous amount of discretion in the 
criminal justice system that has tended to screen out charges 
against women at the street level.
<P>
	We really do not know what it means until we start looking at 
specific categories of crime. Does this reflect a real increase in 
violence or in property crime, or does it reflect a difference in 
the way in which our legal system processes crime? It is 
probably a mix of the two: some real change in behaviour and 
some change about how we count the numbers.
<P>
	It is important to look at the numbers because our beliefs and 
then perhaps our legislative responses are affected by what we 
think is true. The veracity of statistics is fundamental to our 
beliefs which then brings action.
<P>
	On November 19 of last year the news media across Canada 
led with the shocking results of a major Statistics Canada 
survey. ``Fifty per cent of women report assaults'', read the 
headline. ``Ground breaking StatsCan survey finds violence 
pervasive''. The findings on wife assault were horrifying: 29 per 
cent of women who had ever been married reported being 
assaulted by a current or previous husband. That would mean a 
staggering 2.6 million Canadian women have been the victims 
of wife assault.
<P>
	Other news sources reported the story in much the same way. 
<I>Maclean's</I> magazine quoted a woman who ``used to wake up 
with a knife at my throat. Maybe now people will believe it''.
<P>
	Women's groups expressed outrage. Social services groups 
said the survey proved how endemic violence is in our society. A 
federal cabinet minister pledged to meet with women's groups 
to launch a national campaign to combat violence against 
women. Commentators, male and female, cited examples of the 
dangers that women routinely face in daily life. We have heard 
many of those sentiments today in the House, but I must give at 
least a murmur of dissent and provide balance so we may move 
forward more resolutely.
<P>
	The national survey was delivered with all the credibility of 
StatsCan behind it. Officials billed it as the most comprehensive 
of its kind ever conducted in Canada. It cost $1.9 million. It 
included 12,300 women and, the clincher, its finding included 
only physical or sexual acts that could result in criminal 
charges.
<P>
	No one in the mainstream media did a critical analysis of the 
StatsCan's findings or compared them with the most 
authoritative work on the subject undertaken in the United 
States.
<P>
<B>(1705 ) </B>
<P>
	Let us start with the Criminal Code. A StatsCan survey says:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Violence in this survey is defined as experiences of physical and sexual 
assault that are consistent with legal definitions of these offences and could be 
acted upon by a police officer.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	This turns out to cast a very wide net indeed. It includes 
offences known in police jargon as level one. Examples could be 
a neighbour who yells a threat across the back fence or a stranger 
who makes a belligerent remark on the street. Any remark or 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8719"> 8719 </A></B>
<P>
gesture perceived by the person on the receiving end as a threat 
can qualify as a level one offence.
<P>
	The most common form of violence, the survey says, is wife 
assault. In calculating the rate of wife assault it classifies many 
domestic encounters as violent that most people would not. 
These include behaviours that do not involve physical contact 
such as threats and throwing things. Then comes minor contact: 
pushing, grabbing and shoving. The survey summary, which is 
as far as most reporters read, lumps all these things together 
with actions that anyone would agree are clearly violent: 
beating, hitting with an object, choking, sexual assault or using 
a knife or a gun to threaten or injure. Throwing a plate has the 
same weight as a knife attack.
<P>
	How many women who are or have been married reported 
incidents that are clearly violent? The answers: 11 per cent say 
that they have been kicked or hit with a fist; 9 per cent say they 
have been beaten up; 7 per cent choked; 6 per cent hit with 
something; and 5 per cent threatened or attacked with a knife or 
a gun. Because multiple responses are allowed there is a heavy 
overlap among those answers. They also refer overwhelmingly 
to former, not current spouses.
<P>
	StatsCan borrowed its questions on wife assault from 
extensive U.S. surveys conducted by Richard Gelles and Murray 
Straus for the National Institute of Mental Health. This work is 
regarded as a benchmark. Unlike the StatsCan survey, it breaks 
out the results in a way that distinguishes between minor 
violence, no injuries or little intimidation, and severe violence, 
kicking, hitting and worse.
<P>
	Messrs. Gelles and Straus found that domestic violence, 
mostly grabbing, shoving and hitting, occurs 16 per cent in U.S. 
families and that between 3 and 4 per cent of women have 
suffered at least one act of severe violence by their partners.
<P>
	Wife assault is a national problem and a deep social evil in 
Canada. We should do everything to stop it, but this does not 
afflict nearly one-third of Canadian wives as some news reports 
said, 29 per cent as StatsCan said, or 2.6 million women.
<P>
	No one, neither the surveyors nor the media, that reported 
their conclusions had any intention of misleading the public. 
They were conscientiously doing their job of spotting and 
documenting social change. However, if they had drawn a more 
reasonable conclusion from the violence data-rates of spouse 
abuse probably have not changed much in the past 30 years and 
most wives with abusive husbands get a divorce-there would 
be no real headlines and not much justification for their 
existence.
<P>
	Instead the sensational findings dug yet another deep trench 
between the sexes with their inescapable implication that not 
just tens of thousands but millions of Canadian men are 
domestic thugs. Do members of the House really believe this? I 
do not. Most men were socialized from childhood to defer to 
girls in play and boys hitting little girls is more severely 
denounced. That was the character of our social history.
<P>
	Finally, if we do not have an accurate view of the problem, 
how can we hope to arrive at the best policies to address it? 
Surely we do not need to exaggerate the numbers in order to 
make the case that family violence and violence against anyone 
is a corrosive social ill?
<P>
	Surely we do not need to induce national moral panic in order 
to get attention and action, but many women believe that we do 
and so they may be upset. Many women believe that the 
StatsCan survey captures some larger psychological truth about 
the myriad subtle ways in which women continue to be devalued 
in the world. The trouble is that there are many important things 
StatsCan just cannot measure, and it should not try.
<P>
	We know that more women than men are responsible for child 
abuse. In domestic conflict more women than men are likely to 
resort to using a weapon against a spouse. The conclusion about 
what men or women are doing is not the point. The point is that 
there is just too much violence. We must all collectively share 
responsibility for the violence on TV, movies and magazines. 
The media reflects ratings of what sells. The media are not 
totally to blame, for they reflect the worst aspects of our society.
<P>
	The Montreal tragedy, remembered today, will not be 
forgotten. We can find a vision of a new Canada where a 
rejection of violence both overt and implied is how we will live.
<P>
<B>(1710) </B>
<P>
	We must denounce violence and the excuses for it such as 
intoxication defences or freedom of expression in the 
performing arts and the mass media. We especially remember 
today the loved ones of the victims of violence. We must all 
commit to live to a higher standard where conflict resolution and 
frustrations are kept under self-control. We each must resolve to 
live a kinder and gentler life that makes pandering to violence 
uneconomic for its sellers.
<P>
	We affirm the positive and resolve to pass on to our children a 
clear sense of values that preclude thoughts of violence. I have a 
vision of Canada that we can build, where we can live in peace, 
restore broken relationships, yet strongly defend our ideals.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Colleen Beaumier (Brampton, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
vowed I would never do this but I listened to the members across 
the way and I wondered if their lack of discomfort is really the 
issue.
<P>
	I knew a young woman 25 years ago who was raped. She did 
not report it because 25 years ago women could run faster with 
their skirts up than men could with their pants down. I knew a 
woman 25 years ago who was beaten by her husband. She was 
sent to hospital. She did not report it because it was a shame that 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8720"> 8720 </A></B>
<P>
she had chosen that poorly and obviously she was beaten 
because she deserved it; she must have irritated him.
<P>
	Because of our actions, because of the noise and because of 
the circumstances of today, women can do that. This woman was 
not included in that survey. I was that woman. As much as I 
realize that we have to get a balance, it is also an issue we must 
address. We must stand together.
<P>
	Does the hon. member think that today's incidents are perhaps 
recurring more frequently or that we have now lost our shame 
and are able to report them?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Forseth:</B> Mr. Speaker, I believe we are in a violent 
society. We must do everything we can within our own purview, 
within our own families, to make sure we do not act in a violent 
way. It begins in a small manner with even the frustration of 
being at a stoplight and thinking about the car next to you or the 
one that has cut you off.
<P>
	I was trying to emphasize today that when we see statistics, let 
us make sure we have an accurate analysis of them so we can 
move forward resolutely with appropriate social policy.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Monique Guay (Laurentides, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, what 
I just heard is simply absurd. I think the hon. member of the 
Reform Party needs a good dose of real life.
<P>
	He quoted statistics and figures, and meanwhile, some 
terrible things are happening, and the hon. member of the 
Reform Party does not see anything at all. I wonder whether 
people come and see him at his riding office and whether he ever 
had specific cases involving battered women and women who 
were unemployed and had children who did not get anything to 
eat for breakfast.
<P>
	In my riding, I see this regularly. In my riding, we have two 
shelters for battered women and only 20 spaces altogether. We 
do not have enough locations to help these women.
<P>
	I would appreciate it if the hon. member would tell me if in his 
own riding he sees these people and really tries to help them 
instead of trotting out figures and statistics like he is doing now, 
information that to me is absolutely irrelevant. I see what is 
going on in my riding, and I must say it is not a pretty picture.
<P>
	When we have a recession like the one we have just been 
through, guess what happens? The crime rate goes up, and 
women and children pay the price. I cannot believe that 
everything is just fine in his riding because of these statistics. I 
hope that when he gets back to his riding on the weekend, his 
wife will forgive him for the speech he made here in the House.
<P>
<B>(1715) </B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Forseth:</B> Mr. Speaker, here is another fine example of 
what I talked about, why we are so adversarial in this House, 
where someone's words are willingly twisted.
<P>
	If it is an issue of personal credibility, I spent my career of 22 
years in the criminal justice system dealing with those people 
most in need and in time of crisis when in conflict with one 
another, be it an offender or an offended.
<P>
	I spent all Saturday night riding with the local police in my 
riding, looking at the difficulty of conflict resolution and the 
kinds of things they have to deal with.
<P>
	If we in this House are going to deal properly with the issues 
of the day, the various studies that are bantered around by 
members of this House and as was mentioned today by so many 
speakers, the StatsCanada study, then we must look carefully 
and make sure we read and draw the appropriate conclusions 
from those studies.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gordon Kirkby (Prince Albert-Churchill River, 
Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the hon. member made mention of the fact 
that there is a greater involvement of women in crime. He cited 
errors in the study done with respect to the incidence of violence 
against women. He stated that more women commit child abuse 
than men. I find that all of these statements are made to 
minimize and trivialize violent acts against women.
<P>
	When we think about what happened a number of years ago on 
this day, we must remember today what damage violence against 
women in our society does and we ought not to speak in such a 
manner as to trivialize and minimize it and make it an excusable 
type of behaviour.
<P>
	I want to ask the hon. member if he still feels that these types 
of remarks under these circumstances are justified.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Forseth:</B> Mr. Speaker, the member gets a little emotional 
when he hears the truth.
<P>
	Throughout the day certain statements were made and it is 
appropriate to provide a balancing alternate view without taking 
any of my words and twisting them to somehow diminish or 
demean the conflict and the social trouble we have out there and 
the level of violence which is unacceptable in our society.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Shaughnessy Cohen (Windsor-St. Clair, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it is difficult for me to simply start into my text when I 
have been faced with the address we just heard in this House. I 
have to say that if education is the answer to many of the 
ailments in our society and if the problems we have are problems 
of ignorance, we need to spend a great deal more money and a 
great deal more time educating people so that attitudes such as 
those that were just reflected do not become prevalent in our 
society.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8721"> 8721 </A></B>
<P>
	When I stand on this side of the House and I look across at so 
many middle aged, middle class white male faces and hear the 
kind of venom that was just spewed I have to react strongly.
<P>
	One woman is shot dead every six days in Canada on average. 
On December 6, 1989, 14 women were wiped out with bullets in 
just a few minutes.
<P>
	Others have risen in this House from the other quarters today 
to recognize these women, to remember their lives, to mourn 
them and in their name to look toward a time of hope when 
violence will be a thing of the past.
<P>
	One woman is shot dead with a bullet every six days in our 
country. A woman is nine times as likely to be killed by her 
spouse as by a stranger. They do not just use bullets. They beat 
them, stab them and suffocate them.
<P>
<B>(1720) </B>
<P>
	Some want to talk about statistics. Some want to talk about 
women engaging in crime. Women are violated and abused 
because of an attitude in our society that suppresses women and 
that seeks to continue to suppress women even though it is 1994, 
even though we are moving toward the 21st century, even though 
women are in the political leadership of our country, in the 
business leadership of our country and in the parenting 
leadership of our country; even though women have struggled 
and continue to struggle to make the same salary as their male 
counterparts and even though women continue today to lead 
single parent families from a position of poverty.
<P>
	Life is very simple on the other side of the House. Those 
members would like to arm us all. They would like to cut $15 
billion out of our social programs with no priorities. They would 
like to suggest that statistics in the most comprehensive study 
that has ever been done on violence against women in Canada 
are eschewed because they do not like the sound of them. Life is 
not that simple.
<P>
	We have tremendous problems in this country. We have 
people who want to help. They want to help women, children and 
yes, they even want to help white, middle aged, middle class 
men to have a better life. We do it by bringing prosperity to this 
country, jobs to this country, by observing the precepts of the 
Charter of Rights of Freedoms and by following the rule of law. 
We do it by treating other human lives with the dignity that they 
deserve and by remembering respectfully, very seriously and 
very intently the lives of women like the 14 at l'École 
polytechnique that were lost because our society is less than 
perfect.
<P>
	This Friday evening I will return to Windsor-St. Clair and I 
will join former colleagues, colleagues who are also great and 
tremendous friends of mine in Windsor. We will have a little 
Christmas cheer but we are going to do so as persons joined, 
friends and colleagues united in a cause, a cause which is very 
important in my community  which is the support and the 
perpetuation of the programs and the spirit of a place called 
Hiatus House.
<P>
	Hiatus House is an interval home in Windsor, a transition 
home for battered women and their children. It is a home that, in 
spite of what my friends opposite think, is always full, always 
has a waiting list and does wonders in our community. Hiatus 
House operates under the guidance and direction of Donna 
Miller, executive director. I am proud to say that she is a friend 
of mine and I am also happy to tell this country, through this 
House, that she is a visionary as are many women and men who 
work in this field.
<P>
	This is an incredible place. This is a place that pioneered 
transition homes in Canada. It pioneered special programs for 
the children of battered women. It has also pioneered a program 
called ``Fresh Start'' which is a program designed for the 
treatment of spouses who batter, of men who batter their wives 
and children.
<P>
	It is a transition home that faces the ugly realities that these 
people live with and that tries so hard to put these people back 
together in one piece again, to break the cycle of domestic 
violence.
<P>
<B>(1725 ) </B>
<P>
	I am proud to stand today as the member for Windsor-St. 
Clair to talk about Hiatus House. I wish I could have spent more 
time at it but I felt compelled to comment on other things.
<P>
	December 6 can never be forgotten by Canadians. It can never 
be forgotten because there are still Canadians who are 
oppressed. There are still Canadians who are repressed and there 
are still Canadians who are not white, middle aged, middle class 
males who make $64,000 a year.
<P>
	As long as those people are suppressed, as long as our greater 
political and societal structure is such that there are people who 
are less equal, then I think we have an obligation to continue. I 
am proud to be part of this government. I am proud to follow a 
leader who believes in these principles and I am proud to be on 
this side of the House even if talking about those principles 
means that one has to be hackled.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Myron Thompson (Wild Rose, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
certainly appreciate what the hon. member was saying. I too 
helped to set up a crisis house. I donated money, time and energy 
to do that because I think it is important. We need to do more of 
that. It is too bad we have to have them.
<P>
	She talked about the jobless, the economy, et cetera. We go 
back as far as the depression. During the time of the depression 
when the economy could not have been worse and jobs could not 
have been worse, amazingly enough on a per capita basis that 
was when there was the least amount of crime. That can be 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8722"> 8722 </A></B>
<P>
checked. If one denies it to be true, it can be checked. One will 
find that is the case.
<P>
	I remember maybe 40 years ago when there was respect that 
was really taught. I was about that age when my father would 
have a fit if I did not show a little more respect, particularly to 
the opposite sex in terms of helping them when they needed it. 
Opening doors was a common practice and things of this nature. 
We did not swear in front of a woman because it was not an 
acceptable thing to do.
<P>
	This violence against women is abhorrent. It really is, believe 
you me. I believe that. I am trying to figure out what in the world 
brought us to this point? What is it that has advanced us so far 
along the line that causes men to do the things they do to 
women? Please do not point a finger at me because I have not 
laid a hand on a woman in my entire life.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Cohen:</B> Mr. Speaker, that is quite an opening. I am going 
to resist. I have no doubt that the member for Wild Rose believes 
everything he just said. I have no doubt that he abhors violence 
against women. The problem I have is this difficulty in seeing 
the bigger picture, this tremendous desire for the quick fix, for 
the simple solution that I see in his party's policies.
<P>
	In the dirty thirties women were victimized in the same way, 
perhaps worse than they are now. The problem is that in the 
thirties the culture was such that they did not report it. They 
were afraid to. They thought it was their place to take this. They 
thought they had to put up with it.
<P>
	Times have changed. Unfortunately some people have not 
changed with the times and some people refuse to accept that 
women have a place in society. We are not a special interest 
group. We do not want a privileged position. We just want to be 
equal.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Lee Morrison (Swift Current-Maple 
Creek-Assiniboia, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, in the space of a couple 
of centuries women have advanced from being chattels to being 
real persons and now in the pantheon of the politically correct 
back to being mere victims.
<P>
	I find this extraordinarily offensive and I think it demeans 
women. Women are people and should be treated as such. 
Violence exists throughout society. It is symptomatic of an 
alarming loss of civility, traditional values which have gone 
down the pipe.
<P>
	Talk about women being victimized in the thirties. I am old 
enough that I can remember those times. Yes, spousal abuse 
went on in those days but when it did anyone who took part in 
that sort of activity was (a) socially ostracized or (b) stood a 
very good chance of getting the socks beaten off him by the 
abused woman's brothers, father, cousins, uncles and so on. This 
was commonly done.
<P>
	You don't know; you were not there, madam.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Shaughnessy Cohen (Windsor-St. Clair, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I will be brief. In the pantheon of the politically 
correct, sir, may I say that I do know. I was there, and you are 
wrong.

	The House proceeded to the consideration of Bill C-216, an 
act to amend the Unemployment Insurance Act (jury service), as 
reported (without amendment) from the committee.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Alfonso Gagliano (Secretary of State (Parliamentary 
Affairs) and Deputy Leader of the Government in the House 
of Commons, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. Hon. 
members will note on the Order Paper that the recommendation 
from His Excellency the Governor General has been provided 
for this bill in order to permit the House to consider its final 
passage without conflicting with either Standing Order 79(1) or 
section 54 of the Constitution.
<P>
	The government is pleased to have this opportunity to take the 
unusual step of obtaining a recommendation for a private 
member's initiative, which is entirely within the spirit and the 
letter of our program of parliamentary reform.
<P>
	I must caution the House however that this individual case has 
been examined by the government carefully and it is only 
because Bill C-216 fits with the existing fiscal framework that 
the government has been able to take this opportunity.
<P>
	The House should not consider this case as a precedent. It is 
highly unlikely that there will be many cases that lend 
themselves to this kind of accommodation. In order to maintain 
strict control over expenditure the government will insist on the 
strict enforcement of this order and in the other place of the 
constitutional principle that no expenditure may be voted by a 
parliamentary motion or bill without the explicit 
recommendation to this House by His Excellency.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Guy H. Arseneault (Restigouche-Chaleur, Lib.)</B> 
moved that the bill be concurred in.
<P>
	Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the motion?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> No.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> All those in favour of the motion will 
please say yea.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Yea.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> All those opposed will please say nay.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Nay.
<P>
	[<I>Editor's Note: See list under Division No. 130.]</I>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Arseneault</B> moved that the bill be read the third time and 
passed.
<P>
	He said: Mr. Speaker it gives me pleasure to rise tonight to 
speak on third reading of this private member's bill.
<P>
	I would like to commence by thanking all my colleagues from 
all parties who have supported me. It has been a four-year 
battle. It started four years ago in December and we are in 
December again looking at third reading.
<P>
	I thank my hon. colleagues on this historic occasion. I am 
looking for their support at third reading. We hope to conclude 
third reading this evening.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	I have the honour and the pleasure to rise in this House to 
speak on a private member's bill which I sponsored to amend the 
Unemployment Insurance Act.
<P>
	As you know, section 14 of this act prevents unemployed 
people who have to do jury duty from collecting UI benefits.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	I have spoken on this issue for the last four years. I could go 
on. Other members have spoken on the issue. I think we should 
put it to rest this evening. I will now rest my case to my 
colleagues and would ask for their unanimous consent to pass 
the bill at third reading.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Is there unanimous consent to pass this 
bill on third reading?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bellehumeur:</B> Is this a continuation of the debate, Mr. 
Speaker?
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> I thought we were ready to adopt this 
bill. Is there some misunderstanding with the member who 
wishes to rise on a point of order?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bellehumeur:</B> There was an amendment by the Reform 
Party, but it is not up to me to raise this point of order.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> It seems the hon. member for 
Berthier-Montcalm has the right to make his speech.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier-Montcalm, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I prepared a few notes because in any case, I was going 
to support the hon. member on this bill as the Bloc Quebecois 
did when the hon. member for Mercier spoke to this bill. At the 
time, we agreed with the hon. member's initiative regarding this 
legislation. I think there was an oversight. Earlier we had 
comments from the government.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8735"> 8735 </A></B>
<P>
	I think these comments are in line with our own support for 
the hon. member's bill, in other words, I believe that at the 
present time, we are penalizing people who would be able to 
perform a duty that is extremely important in our judicial 
system, and I am referring to jury duty. A person on 
unemployment insurance was either penalized, in other words, 
did his jury duty but was not entitled to receive unemployment 
insurance benefits, or the judges, considering this particular 
situation, rejected such people for jury duty.
<P>
	However, thanks to the hon. member's amendment, and he is 
to be commended for making this proposal, the situation will be 
rectified.
<P>
	I believe that in previous debates, we stressed the usefulness 
of jury members in our judicial system, and I should add that the 
jury system is a provincial matter, in other words, the province 
has jurisdiction over the administration of justice at this level.
<P>
	I believe that as legislators, in the House, we have helped 
accelerate and simplify procedures and assist those responsible 
for the administration of justice. I think that Bill C-216 is 
entirely in line with this attempt at simplification and helping 
people fulfil their jury duties.
<P>
	Finally, Mr. Speaker, I would like to mention something that 
happened in the judicial district of Joliette, in connection with 
the selection of jury members. In a murder case, after seeing 
about 300 to 400 potential jurors, the lawyers had rejected 
practically everyone, so that the sheriff finally rented a bus and 
had the bus stop in various streets in the municipality of Joliette, 
pick up anyone who looked like they were of age and take them 
by bus to the court house to be selected as jurors.
<P>
	My point is that people do not exactly go out of their way to do 
jury duty, and I think that if we can simplify things and help 
people, if there are people on unemployment insurance who 
could do jury duty, I think we should let them, and Bill C-216 is 
a step in the right direction.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bellehumeur:</B> That being said, I will be delighted to 
support Bill C-216.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hugh Hanrahan (Edmonton-Strathcona, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I stand before my hon. colleagues and my constituents 
today to discuss Bill C-216, a private member's bill that 
changes the rules of the unemployment insurance program to 
allow unemployment insurance claimants to collect 
unemployment insurance benefits while they are serving on a 
jury.
<P>
	Essentially, Bill C-216 if passed would change only six words 
in the Unemployment Insurance Act. These changes include the 
removal of the word ``or'' in section 14 and include the words 
``or engaged in jury service'' in the same section.
<P>
	The question that needs to be addressed is why are we 
spending all this time discussing these six words. The answer to 
this question is simple. If these six words were changed, the 
initial intention of the Unemployment Insurance Act would have 
been pushed even farther from its original purpose.
<P>
	Section 14 of the Unemployment Insurance Act states clearly: 
``A claimant is not entitled to receive benefits for any working 
day for which he or she is unable to prove capability to work and 
availability for work or is unable to prove incapability because 
of prescribed illness, injury, or quarantine. A claimant engaged 
in jury duty is considered unavailable under section 14 of the act 
and is therefore disentitled from benefits''.
<P>
	This statement makes it indisputably clear that the framers of 
the original unemployment act saw that the UI system was not to 
include those individuals who were called to do their civic duty 
and perform jury duty.
<P>
	The Reform Party unequivocally supports the return of the 
Unemployment Insurance Act to its original function, an 
employer/employee funded and administered program to 
provide temporary income in the event of unexpected job loss.
<P>
	This has been our policy since the late 1980s. Canadians are 
tired of supporting habitual and seasonal abusers of 
unemployment insurance. Many people would say that Bill 
C-216 would become another case of abuse of the great 
Canadian social security system as it could lead to employers 
laying off employees who must serve jury duty so that these 
individuals would be able to collect otherwise uncollectable 
unemployment insurance.
<P>
	The potential for abuse is alarmingly clear. When the 
unemployment insurance system is not used as it was initially 
designed, Canadians suffer because the present inequities in the 
UI system which have developed permanently lower disposable 
income of those who hold full time jobs in regions of some 
economic strength.
<P>
	It permanently depresses the rate of job creation among all the 
firms whose costs are increased by the UI payroll tax. It 
subsidizes the immobility of labour in ways that seriously hurt 
the younger generations as parents do not face the incentives 
they should to move to regions where private sector job 
opportunities are much more numerous and diverse.
<P>
	According to the figures provided by my hon. colleague for 
Restigouche-Chaleur, the implementation of this amendment 
to the Unemployment Insurance Act, the changing of only six 
words, would add in the neighbourhood of $2 million to $3 
million to the unemployment insurance claims. A $2 million to 
$3 million tab would be absorbed by employers and employees 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8736"> 8736 </A></B>
<P>
across the country. They are already losing nearly 40 per cent of 
their pay cheques through one type of taxation or another.
<P>
<B>(1835) </B>
<P>
	I truly question the willingness of Canadians to absorb this 
sum of money, especially when considering our fiscal situation 
where we as a nation are nearly $535 billion in debt and are 
paying nearly $40 billion in interest payments annually to 
service this astronomical debt.
<P>
	It is for this reason that if employers and employees who pay 
for the UI program had a say in how their money was being 
spent, I do not think they would agree to provide benefits to 
claimants while they are serving on a jury.
<P>
	The law is simple, clear and concise. If a UI claimant is 
serving on a jury they are not available for work and therefore 
not entitled to unemployment insurance benefits. For too long 
now the fundamental insurance principles have been 
compromised so that unemployment insurance is seen more like 
a form of welfare than a form of insurance.
<P>
	In the words of Tommy Douglas: ``We are not interested in 
paying able bodied people merely because they were not able to 
find work. We proposed social aid for those who are unable to 
work because they were crippled, aged or mentally ill. Those 
who are able to work would participate in public work projects''.
<P>
	Welfare and unemployment insurance are not a right in 
Canada and furthermore unemployment insurance is exactly 
what the name indicates. It is an insurance program and not a 
seasonal employment or special compensation package.
<P>
	Workers should only be entitled to unemployment insurance 
provided they qualify and meet certain obligations. One of these 
obligations is that they are ready, able and willing to work; work 
immediately, not tomorrow or the next day or the next week, but 
immediately.
<P>
	As I mentioned earlier the unemployment insurance program 
must be returned to a true insurance program. We should look at 
other insurance programs to see how they operate and perhaps 
we as a government could learn a lesson or two from the private 
sector. Perhaps our national unemployment insurance program 
should indeed be based on a user pay system such as household 
or automobile insurance where the more we use our insurance 
the more our premiums increase and, conversely, the less we use 
our insurance the less our premiums become.
<P>
	This type of user pay based system is not solely for 
employees. It would also relate back to employers as those 
employers who regularly lay off workers would also have to pay 
higher premiums as well.
<P>
	It is clear that this bill is taking us down the wrong direction. 
We should be looking at ways to make the unemployment 
insurance as well as government programs sustainable and 
self-sufficient. Bill C-216 is not even close to achieving this 
goal or even starting us down the right path.
<P>
	I want to state clearly that while there may be a problem of 
fair compensation to individuals who serve on a jury regardless 
of their employment status, we do not believe that minor 
changes to the Unemployment Insurance Act is the way to 
accomplish or change this inequity.
<P>
	We are not the only ones with this view. In fact a few of our 
supporters include the policy experts at the department of 
unemployment insurance and research branch of the Library of 
Parliament. The department of unemployment insurance 
comments that the problem is not with the UI rules but rather the 
poor compensation provided for jurors. The Library of 
Parliament wrote: ``The primary issue in this matter seems to be 
adequate remuneration for jury duty and that is the 
responsibility of the provinces rather than the employers and 
employees who contribute to the unemployment insurance 
program''.
<P>
	Ultimately then, rather than adjusting the Unemployment 
Insurance Act the Reform Party proposes that judges should use 
their discretion to excuse UI claimants from jury duty as has 
been done in the past. Again, I think it is crucial to state the 
obvious which is those who serve on jury are perhaps not fairly 
compensated. On this point I am sure all of us in this House can 
agree.
<P>
<B>(1840) </B>
<P>
	As my hon. colleague from Yorkton-Melville stated in the 
House it is inexcusable that jurors are asked to work for days, 
weeks, and in some cases even months for $15 or $20 a day. I 
believe, as does the Reform Party, in equality and fairness and 
above all common sense. For that reason it is clear that this issue 
of appropriate compensation for jurors must be addressed.
<P>
	However, we also believe in decreasing overlap and 
duplication between governments. Essentially we believe in 
staying out of the provincial arena and the issue of juror 
compensation falls 100 per cent under provincial jurisdiction. 
For these reasons we will be unable to support this bill.
<P>
	Finally, I would like to move:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That the motion be amended by striking out all the words after the word 
``That'' and substituting the following:</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>``Bill C-216, an act to amend the Unemployment Insurance Act (jury 
service), be not now read a third time and that the order be discharged, the bill 
withdrawn, and the subject matter thereof referred to the Standing Committee 
on Human Resources Development.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The Chair should indicate that the 
motion is receivable.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8737"> 8737 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Arseneault:</B> I rise on a point of order, Mr. Speaker. I beg 
to differ. I do not want to challenge the Chair on that but the 
matter has already been referred to the resources development 
committee and it came back without amendment. I would say 
that the Reform Party is stalling for time with private members' 
business and I am very concerned with that.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Silye:</B> I rise on a point of order, Mr. Speaker. That is just a 
matter of debate.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Colleagues will appreciate that the bill 
as was indicated by the member for Restigouche has gone to 
committee, has been gone through clause by clause, and has 
come back.
<P>
	To the hon. member for Restigouche, the motion proposes to 
discharge the bill and refer the subject matter. Therefore the 
amendment would appear to me to be in order.
<P>
<B>(1845) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Garry Breitkreuz (Yorkton-Melville, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, since this private member's bill was first introduced 
various things have come up which probably would now make it 
necessary for the bill to be referred to the committee again. One 
major thing that has come up is that the Minister of Human 
Resources Development ordered a review of some of the 
programs under the Department of Human Resources 
Development including unemployment insurance.
<P>
	As there are no members of the Human Resources 
Development committee present since they are presently 
holding hearings in Quebec and across the country, it is only in 
order that we allow the bill to be referred to committee again.
<P>
	The bill is contrary to true insurance principles. The minister 
made the point that the changes he is proposing would bring the 
Unemployment Insurance Act back to a true insurance act. It 
would very much change what we are doing here, and that is why 
I am supporting the amendment my colleague has made.
<P>
	If we are to return unemployment insurance to true insurance 
principles there are various matters in the bill I would like to 
address that should be referred back to committee to be 
corrected. If the members opposite would listen to what I have to 
say, they would agree with that.
<P>
	If the bill were passed it would be the first time in history that 
a private member's bill would require the government to spend 
more money, in the neighbourhood of $3 million. I think 
members opposite would agree and would probably oppose it for 
that reason.
<P>
	As I have mentioned, the people on the Human Resources 
Development committee are not here now to present what they 
are hearing in the consultations across the country. I have been 
travelling with the committee for three weeks and there have 
been many presentations that would run contrary to the spirit of 
the private member's bill. For that reason we should be delaying 
it.
<P>
	They will be going against the wishes of their Minister of 
Human Resources Development. The report that will come 
down in February will indicate that. It would be wise to refer this 
back to the committee and let it have another look at it.
<P>
	Some of the things we are hearing that would run contrary to 
the bill are the following. The people who are coming before the 
committee as witnesses would like to see reduced the 
duplication that is presently taking place between the federal 
and provincial government.
<P>
	The bill actually does the opposite. It infringes on an area of 
provincial jurisdiction, that is the area of justice. Even as the 
member who proposed the bill admitted, the problem is not with 
unemployment insurance. The problem with serving on duty as a 
juror falls on the justice system. It should not fall on the 
unemployment insurance system.
<P>
	Another thing we are hearing is that the unemployment 
insurance system should be run more as a true insurance system 
and should be economically viable. It is not. It should be 
financially sustainable; we are hearing time and again that 
unemployment insurance should be self-financing.
<P>
	Many people are telling us that we need to go back and 
establish it on true insurance principles. The bill is contrary to 
that and is why it should be referred back to the committee. The 
committee now has new insights from what it is hearing from 
Canadians and would like to probably evaluate the bill with 
regard to them.
<P>
	I have a couple of more points. The consultations indicate that 
Canadians should be treated more equally across Canada. The 
bill does not do that. Self-employed people would be 
discriminated against under the bill. They would not be eligible 
to be compensated by unemployment insurance. They could be 
sitting beside somebody else on a jury and would not have the 
same access. There is an equality problem in that regard.
<P>
<B>(1850 ) </B>
<P>
	It will open up the system to more abuse. The Minister of 
Human Resources Development has stated explicitly that he 
would like to reduce the amount of abuse. Costs will escalate at a 
time when we cannot afford it. In fact we would be approving a 
history making government expenditure of $3 million because 
of a private member's bill.
<P>
	Would it be possible to somehow look at the bill, send it back 
to committee and see if some of these things could be addressed? 
I believe it is and for that reason I am supporting the motion. I 
hope members opposite and members of the Bloc will support it 
as well.
<P>
	The people from whom we are hearing in this consultative 
process are saying that we have to reduce the number of 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8738"> 8738 </A></B>
<P>
opportunities for abuse, not increase them. For that reason I 
support what my colleague has put forward.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Harvard (Winnipeg St. James, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, originally I did not intend to enter into the debate. It 
was my intention from the beginning to rise and pay tribute to 
the member for Restigouche-Chaleur for bringing forward his 
private member's bill.
<P>
	However I must admit that I am appalled by the remarks made 
by the two previous speakers from the Reform Party. I did not 
think it was possible for members of Parliament to be so 
meanspirited.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Epp:</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. The words 
just used characterizing the Reform Party are not parliamentary. 
I would ask the member to withdraw them.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> I have researched the matter. It was a 
minister who used those words and she was required to withdraw 
them. I would invite the member for Winnipeg-St. James to 
withdraw those words immediately.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Harvard:</B> Mr. Speaker, I am more than happy to 
withdraw them if they are unparliamentary. How do I convey my 
disgust? Is that unparliamentary as well? I am left absolutely 
disgusted by the remarks.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The member has withdrawn the 
offending words that have been ruled within the last two weeks 
as being unparliamentary. I would ask the hon. member to 
continue his speech.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Harvard:</B> Mr. Speaker, I am more than happy to continue 
with my speech.
<P>
	What is the intent of the private member's bill? Its intent is to 
remove an injustice, to remove a wrong. These people are ready, 
willing and able to work. They happen to be on unemployment 
insurance. They have been mandated by the state. They have 
been mandated by the government. They have been obliged by 
society to serve jury duty.
<P>
	It is not their fault. It is not abuse as suggested by the previous 
speakers from the third party. They are following the duty 
imposed upon them by the Parliament of Canada. They are not at 
fault. These are good people. They do not want to violate the 
Unemployment Insurance Act, but they have benefits owing to 
them. They are obliged to serve on the jury but in the process 
they have to give up their benefits, their compensation.
<P>
	In the name of fairness and justice surely we cannot ask them 
on one hand to serve on a jury and at the same time to give up 
their unemployment insurance compensation. It is wrong. It is 
an injustice. The intent of the bill is to remove that injustice, to 
correct that wrong.
<P>
	Do we not have the compassion or the decency to show these 
people that we care for them? On one hand we want them to 
follow the law of the land and to serve on juries and at the same 
time we should not take away their unemployment insurance 
benefits, their compensation. If parliamentarians cannot 
understand this simple concept, this simple piece of justice then 
I do not understand what is going on.
<P>
<B>(1855) </B>
<P>
	In conclusion all I want to say is this piece of legislation is 
justified in the name of fairness. The arguments brought forward 
by the previous speakers are red herrings. This has been 
examined by the committee. There are no more questions. We 
should be settling this now in the name of justice.
<P>
	I pay tribute to the member for Restigouche-Chaleur. He has 
done the right thing. In the name of justice and fairness and in 
the name of God let us pass this bill now.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Elwin Hermanson (Kindersley-Lloydminster, Ref.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I am not going to speak for long but I hope to speak 
a little more calmly than the previous speaker did. A number of 
points he brought forward actually reiterate what my colleagues 
are trying to do in having this subject matter referred back to 
committee.
<P>
	We must view this in light of the review of all of our social 
programs and proposed reforms to be introduced hopefully later 
and not that much later in this Parliament. We are going to be 
looking at the unemployment insurance system and hopefully 
reviewing it with a view to making it a true insurance program. 
Also when we are talking about jury duty we may be talking 
about other jurisdictions such as the provincial jurisdiction as it 
affects the criminal justice system.
<P>
	There are so many complications and so many other angles to 
this whole situation which have not been adequately presented 
both in this House and to the committee nor for the provinces to 
have their input. This underscores the fact that before we hastily 
implement this private member's bill which will cost taxpayers 
some money and which will broaden the scope of unemployment 
insurance rather than narrow it to its original function, it would 
be wise not to bind the hands of the government and the Minister 
of Human Resources Development on proposals that will have 
to be undone at a later date.
<P>
	I speak on behalf of rational Canadians who want to look 
carefully and make wise decisions rather than rant 
uncontrollably and emotionally without having put one's facts 
together ahead of time in order to make smart decisions rather 
than foolish ones. We have seen past Liberal governments build 
up the unemployment insurance program and our social safety 
net to the point that we have to look at reform, restructuring, 
redirecting them back to their original purposes so that they can 
help those Canadians they were supposed to help.
<P>
	Certainly if people are called to jury duty and there are some 
financial implications, that needs to be looked at. I do not think 
my colleagues in the Reform Party are saying this is not a valid 
issue to bring forward in the House. We are saying that perhaps 
unemployment insurance is not the correct vehicle to deal with 
this issue. Also a precedent is being set where a private 
member's bill is going to cost taxpayers dollars. That is why the 
<P>

<B><A NAME="8739"> 8739 </A></B>
<P>
Secretary of State for Parliamentary Affairs had to get up and 
make rather an elaborate statement to the House.
<P>
	This is a precedent setting incident. We need to look a lot 
more cautiously in the light of the total deficit of $540 billion. 
Every penny must be accounted for. This House has to take more 
responsibility over that expenditure. We should not hasten to 
make short two minute speeches and try to slip these bills 
through without proper consultation and without proper debate 
in the House.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Is the House ready for the question?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Question.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The question is on the amendment. Is it 
the pleasure of the House to adopt the amendment?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> No.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> All those in favour of the amendment 
will please say yea.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Yea.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> All those opposed will please say nay.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Nay.
<P>
<B>(1900) </B>
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> In my opinion the nays have it.
<P>
	<I>And more than five members having risen:</I>
<P>
	Pursuant to Standing Order 45(5)(a) the deputy whip has 
asked me to defer the vote until tomorrow at which time the bells 
to call in the members will be sounded for not more than 15 
minutes.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Catterall:</B> Mr. Speaker, I think that given the way the 
votes are planned for this week you might find unanimous 
consent in the House to further defer the division until Thursday 
at 5.30 p.m.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Is there unanimous consent?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hermanson:</B> Agreed.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.

<H2 ALIGN="CENTER">ADJOURNMENT PROCEEDINGS</H2>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	A motion to adjourn the House under Standing Order 38 
deemed to have been moved.
<P>
<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="CANADIANSECURITYINTELLIGENCESERVICE">CANADIAN SECURITY INTELLIGENCE SERVICE</A></H4>
	<B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier-Montcalm, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I think that for the adjournment debate I will give some 
background to put things in context. On September 20, 1994, I 
questioned the Solicitor General of Canada regarding 
everything that had gone on in the Bristow and McInnis affairs, 
the infiltrations of political parties and unions, the 
investigations of the Canadian Jewish Congress in Toronto and 
Montreal. The questions were very clear.
<P>
	In particular, we asked the government to establish a royal 
commission of inquiry to shed light on the whole matter. I also 
asked who controlled the monster that the Canadian Security 
Intelligence Service seemed to have become, since no one 
seemed able to control it anymore or to identify those really 
responsible, the people committing public funds, taking action. 
There does not seem to be anyone responsible for it in 
Parliament.
<P>
	We rarely obtain any answers to this question, as you well 
know, and so we turned to SIRC, the Security Intelligence 
Review Committee. Since September 20, there have been 
discussions in the sub-committee, witnesses have been called, 
the CSIS inspector is conducting an investigation, the 
Sub-committee on National Security has heard witnesses, and 
so on. And now, on December 9, we are told, SIRC will be 
submitting its report to the Solicitor General of Canada.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, you know that we have our reservations about 
SIRC, stacked as it is with political appointees, the majority 
being Conservatives who are looking into activities that were 
conducted in the 1990s by Conservatives. One cannot be judge 
and jury at the same time. Our reservations notwithstanding, we 
are looking forward to reading SIRC's report very attentively.
<P>
	What I am asking the Solicitor General of Canada this evening 
is that he submit the complete text of this report to the 
Sub-committee on National Security, with no deletions, in its 
entirety, so that we ourselves, given our solid representation on 
the sub-committee, may judge whether the work has been done 
properly, whether SIRC has carried out its mandate, which is to 
reassure us that it has looked into what was done in the cases I 
mentioned earlier, with respect to Bristow and anything to do 
with infiltration activities by CSIS.
<P>
<B>(1905) </B>
<P>
	What I am requesting, and I hope that we are going to obtain 
it, is an unaltered copy so that our representative on the 
Sub-committee on National Security can question people and 
obtain satisfaction in this matter.
<P>
	I think that it is extremely important, given that we have not 
been able to have a royal commission of inquiry established, 
that we at least be able to examine this report in its entirety.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Patrick Gagnon (Parliamentary Secretary to Solicitor 
General, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, in 1984, when the CSIS Act 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8740"> 8740 </A></B>
<P>
became law, Parliament achieved two very important 
objectives. First, it created a civilian security  intelligence 
agency, accountable through the Solicitor General to 
Parliament, and ultimately, to the Canadian people.
<P>
	Second, in support of an additional measure of control and 
accountability for the activities of this agency, Parliament 
created an external review body-the Security Intelligence 
Review Committee, or SIRC.
<P>
	SIRC has the legislative mandate to perform two kinds of 
functions. The first is to act as an administrative tribunal to hear 
complaints against the security service. The second, relevant to 
the issue before us, is to review the performance and activities 
of the Service.
<P>
	Section 38 of the CSIS Act authorizes SIRC to review how 
CSIS performs all its duties and functions. More specifically, 
under section 54, SIRC can investigate any matter relating to 
CSIS's activities and then provide the Solicitor General with a 
special report of this investigation.
<P>
	SIRC is entitled to obtain any information, including 
documents, reports and explanations from CSIS and the 
Inspector General to carry out its responsibilities. Clearly, SIRC 
has the authority and enabling powers to properly fulfil its 
mandate.
<P>
	In conclusion, it would be in no one's interest, and certainly 
not the Canadian public's, to establish another review body to do 
what SIRC is already authorized to do.
<P>
	Therefore, I would suggest that we put this suggestion of a 
royal commission to rest and await the report of the Security 
Intelligence Review Committee.
<P>

<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="TRADE">TRADE</A></H4>
	<B>Mr. Wayne Easter (Malpeque, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
question posed to the Minister for International Trade was 
prompted by concerns expressed from a number of agricultural 
organizations that Bill C-57, an act to implement the World 
Trade Organization, was deficient and needed to be amended.
<P>
	My question focused on one area of concern, namely the issue 
of tariff levels and supplemental quotas on supply managed 
commodities. However, there are concerns in other areas as 
well: clauses referring to the Western Grain Transportation Act 
and comparisons to the United States implementation 
legislation.
<P>
	There is absolutely no question in my mind that the U.S. 
implementing legislation has more teeth in it and retains a 
greater degree of political control.
<P>
	On November 28 the minister responded to my question 
concerning the issues of tariff levels and supplemental quotas on 
supply managed commodities by stating that amendments to the 
Customs Tariff Act, et cetera, would be introduced ``if 
necessary''.
<P>
	The minister did not respond to my satisfaction or to the 
industry's satisfaction by either stating that there was no cause 
for concern or that given these concerns legislation to amend the 
act would be forthcoming.
<P>
	According to a paper prepared for the standing committee on 
agriculture by the research branch of the Library of Parliament 
on Bill C-57, the issue of supplemental quotas was outlined as 
follows, and I quote: ``Even though this clause 109 of C-57 may 
appear necessary to allow additional imports in the case of 
emergencies, it is not clear what the tariff would be on those 
supplemental imports''.
<P>
	The research document continued further by stating that: ``It 
has been mentioned that artificial shortages can be created that 
would necessitate supplemental imports that could displace 
domestic products permanently. So far officials have not been 
able to give an appropriate answer on the level of the tariffs 
affecting the supplemental imports''.
<P>
	In testimony before the international trade committee, the 
Canadian Federation of Agriculture echoed those concerns as 
well.
<P>
<B>(1910) </B>
<P>
	This point must be addressed. As I said in previous debates, a 
situation could occur in which a processor shorted the demand. 
For example, in hatcheries the hatcheries control the purchase of 
the breeder birds so it is not difficult for them to plan to be short 
and need supplementals.
<P>
	As a result of shorting needs, they demand supplementals. 
The manufacturer would apply for same and would be granted 
tariff free supplemental import permits and that would go a long 
way to breaking the supply management system.
<P>
	The question remains why has the minister not introduced the 
appropriate amendments to the Customs Tariffs Act to address 
the concerns expressed. My grave concern as well is that if these 
amendments are not encompassed in legislation and are just 
encompassed in regulation it becomes very easy for some 
minister down the road who does not support supply 
management to the extent that this government does to allow 
that little weakening in terms of the legislation to see the supply 
management system destroyed over time.
<P>
	The only other point I want to make and question the minister 
on is that Bill C-57 contains no provisions to ensure that 
exporters of grain have any warning with respect to when the cap 
on volume or the cap on expenditures under the WGTA and the 
new requirements of the GATT will be reached. This result could 
be that commitments and sales made by the Canadian Wheat 
<P>

<B><A NAME="8741"> 8741 </A></B>
<P>
Board at a set price could well be negatively impacted if the caps 
are attained prior to the movement of grain involved.
<P>
	How will this issue be addressed and what would be the 
impact on the marketing of the Canadian Wheat Board, its 
ability to market at top dollar and access supplies? I raise those 
questions to the minister out of a deeply felt concern.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mac Harb (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
International Trade, Lib):</B> Mr. Speaker, the government has 
stated that the new tariff rate quota regime for agricultural 
products will include provisions for supplementary imports for 
various purposes. All stakeholders in the supply managed areas 
have agreed such access is necessary. However, legimitate 
questions have been raised as to the terms on which access for 
the specific purpose of preventing a market shortage should be 
allowed.
<P>
	On the one hand, it is said that processors are increasingly 
able to control the level of production, especially in the poultry 
sectors, and so can artificially create a market shortage if they 
know they have guaranteed access to supplementary imports in 
such cases. Since this would reduce returns to primary 
producers, some argue there should be a higher duty on such 
supplemental imports than the one provided for within the tariff 
rate quota, so as to discourage such behaviour.
<P>
	On the other hand, poultry and egg processors argue that they 
must guarantee price and supply to their costumers if they are 
not to lose contracts. They point out that their 
industries-including producers-face competition from other 
food products, and irregularities of price or supply will cost 
everyone market share.
<P>
	There are also many misunderstandings about what is 
involved in the supplementary access scheme envisaged in Bill 
C-57. Perhaps I can dispel some of them.
<P>
	First, current and prospective provisions of the Export and 
Import Permits Act enable supplementary imports but do not 
impose them. The government has no intention of letting in 
additional quantities at duty rates below the ``high'' MFN rate 
where this would be against the Canadian interest.
<P>
	Second, imports for market shortages are not ``within access 
commitment'' under the proposed legislation, and will not result 
in permanent increases in market access. On the contrary, such 
imports are and will be let in at the discretion of the government.
<P>
	Third, nothing in Bill C-57 prevents the government from 
examining the issue and introducing new rules.
<P>
<B>(1915) </B>
<P>
	In fact, Bill C-57 basically rolls the current system of 
supplementary access over in order to furnish an immediate 
means of allowing supplementary imports for a variety of 
reasons, including enhancing export competitiveness.
<P>
	Finally, the situation calls for careful analysis and broad 
consultation. Should the government determine that additional 
duties on supplementary imports of supply managed products 
are advisable, we will take all appropriate measures to institute 
such a system, including legislation, if necessary. However, 
changing Bill C-57 to effect this would short-circuit the 
consultative process, and is not in the government's plans.
<P>

<P>
<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="VIOLENCEAGAINSTWOMEN">VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN</A></H4>
	<B>Mrs. Sue Barnes (London West, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I wish 
to elaborate on a previous question that I put to the Minister of 
Justice on December 1, 1994 in the context of this day being 
recognized as a national day of remembrance and action to end 
violence against women. I asked what measures are being 
implemented to ensure that women are protected from violence.
<P>
	On this day of solemn commemoration we are invited to 
recognize the many women who have died as victims of violence 
and abuse and we are reminded that thousands of others live 
every day in danger and in fear. For this day to take on its full 
significance I would like to see this House act even more 
comprehensively.
<P>
	Until recently the issue of violence against women was hidden 
within the private sphere and as such was generally ignored or 
trivialized. Fortunately we are coming to realize that violence 
against women is in clear violation of human rights. It robs 
women of their self-esteem, dignity and in some cases their life.
<P>
	Since Statistics Canada conducted its first national survey on 
violence against women in 1993, which is the first one of its kind 
worldwide, the gravity of the situation has been brought to light. 
According to the survey, as many as 51 per cent of Canadian 
women have experienced at least one incident of physical or 
sexual violence since the age of 16. Almost 45 per cent of all 
women experience violence by men known to them, their dates, 
boyfriends, marital partners, friends, family or neighbours. 
Whereas a woman is shot every six days in Canada, firearms are 
the weapon of choice for spousal homicides. During the period 
between 1974 and 1992, 42 per cent of the women killed by their 
spouses were shot.
<P>
	As shattering as these statistics are they only account for part 
of the problem since Statistics Canada defines violence as 
experience of physical or sexual assault. It does not touch upon 
the other dimensions of violence to which many women are 
subject.
<P>
	Three other areas were identified in the 1993 report, 
<I>Changing the Landscape, Ending Violence, Achieving Equality</I>. 
They are psychological violence which encompasses various 
tactics to undermine a woman's self-confidence; financial 
violence, whereby a woman's access to employment or 
investment opportunities are denied by her partner or family 
members; and 
<P>

<B><A NAME="8742"> 8742 </A></B>
<P>
piritual abuse in which the cultural or religious beliefs are 
destroyed through ridicule or punishment.
<P>
	A wide range of indicators give evidence that this societal ill 
is pervasive and systemic. As a result, women from all walks of 
life are targets of various acts of violence.
<P>
	Not only are the causes and the forms of violence against 
women extremely insidious, but so too are their effects. Such 
violence scars not only women but also the children and the men 
around them. It marks the body, but it also deeply wounds the 
mind and the spirit of those affected. As a result of having been 
abused a woman's physical and/or mental health can be at stake. 
Her chance of advancement in her working life may be 
jeopardized and her interpersonal skills generally deteriorate.
<P>
	As well as having these devastating effects on the women 
concerned, such violence is proven to seriously destabilize the 
children who witness it. Boys who are brought up in an abusive 
household are more likely to become violent fathers and girls 
are more likely to become victims at the hands of their future 
partners.
<P>
	Canada has played a leadership role internationally in 
initiating the UN declaration on the elimination of violence 
against women, recognizing the urgent need for the universal 
application to women of the rights and principles with regard to 
equality, security, integrity and dignity of all persons.
<P>
	The red book called for a justice system that will work to 
ensure safe homes, safe streets. While other ministries of this 
government will play important roles, I ask the Minister of 
Justice today, how does he intend to address this very important 
issue of ending violence against women?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Patrick Gagnon (Parliamentary Secretary to Solicitor 
General of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, today marks the sad 
anniversary of the murder of 14 young women at l'École 
polytechnique in Montreal.
<P>
	The government recognizes the devastating effects of 
violence against women and is striving to improve its response 
to help victims and to stop the offenders. As examples of the 
work being done in the Department of Justice to address the 
issue of violence against women let me mention the following.
<P>
	The new firearms initiatives will provide a clear and effective 
response to try and prevent women from being killed by guns. 
Bill C-42 proposes amendments to the Criminal Code which 
would allow police and others to apply for a peace bond on 
behalf of a person at risk. Bill C-41 proposes sentencing 
reforms and would make abuse of a position of trust or authority 
in the commission of an offence an aggravating factor in 
sentencing. Dealing with violence against women remains one 
of the government's highest priorities in the justice area.
<P>
	At the end of the week consultations will take place with 
women's groups on how to respond to the Supreme Court's 
decision to allow defence of extreme drunkenness, where a man 
had sexually assaulted a woman while intoxicated. The Minister 
of Justice has already indicated his intention to respond to the  
problems arising from the Daviault decision and is looking at a 
criminal intoxication proposal.
<P>
	Dealing with violence against women remains one of the 
government's highest priorities in the justice area.
<P>
