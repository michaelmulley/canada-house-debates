	The House resumed, from March 2 consideration of the 
motion that Bill C-73, an act to provide borrowing authority for 
the fiscal year beginning on April 1, 1995, be read the second 
time and referred to a committee.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stéphane Bergeron (Verchères, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
welcome this opportunity to speak to the budget that was 
brought down Monday by the Minister of Finance.
<P>
	Not that I am particularly pleased with the provisions it 
contains, far from it. Nevertheless, I feel it is my duty as a 
parliamentarian to engage in a critical analysis of the budgetary 
measures proposed by the government and to report on my 
conclusions in this House. I admit it was not very difficult to be 
critical of a budget I would qualify as insidious and inequitable.
<P>
	This budget is disappointing in several respects, and perhaps I 
may elaborate.
<P>
	I think that first of all, it can be said that the budget contains 
no specific measures for economic recovery and job creation, 
which is unusual, to say the least, considering the government's 
emphasis on these issues. Need I recall that during the election 
campaign in 1993, the Liberal Party promised it would 
champion job creation and fight unemployment?
<P>
	My constituents, Quebecers and Canadians are still waiting 
for this vigorous recovery and the jobs promised in the Liberal 
Party's red book, which the Prime Minister brandished 
repeatedly as a sure fire recipe for prosperity. There is nothing 
new in this budget to create jobs and worse, the Liberal 
government has, without any compunction, made cuts in the 
only sizeable job creation program it managed to come up with 
so far, and I am referring to the infrastructure program.
<P>
	This program was supposed to create nearly 45,000 
jobs-temporary jobs-over a period of three years. The budget 
intends to cut about $200 million from this program over the 
next three years, which will inevitably result in the withdrawal 
of equivalent amounts by participating provinces and 
municipalities. So altogether,  $600 million less will be spent on 
job creation over the next three years.
<P>
<B>(1005) </B>
<P>
	What is more, the government is virtually cancelling out the 
expected effects of the infrastructure program by laying off 
some 45,000 public servants over the next three years. This is 
exactly the number of temporary jobs that this program was to 
create, before it was announced that the program would be 
spread over five years.
<P>
	Clearly this budget is continuing the practice instituted by the 
previous government of going after the unemployed instead of 
tackling unemployment itself. For instance, despite a 
significant surplus in the unemployment insurance fund, the 
government is announcing cuts of 10 per cent in the 
unemployment insurance budget. Needless to say the federal 
government is on the wrong track if it thinks that this sort of 
measure will help find work for the some 800,000 people who 
are unemployed and looking for work in Quebec.
<P>
	While the fight against the deficit is being waged on the backs 
of the unemployed and public servants in the government's 
budget, and I will definitely come back to this point later on, we 
must also recognize that it is being waged at a cost to the 
provinces.
<P>
	With its brief passages in French alluding clearly to the 
referendum, the Minister of Finance's speech spoke of the 
dynamic and changing nature of Canadian federalism based on 
the pseudo decentralization project, which is nothing more than 
a hollow promise and a huge operation to dump the federal 
deficit into the laps of the provinces. They will have no choice 
but to cut public services and increase income or other taxes or 
pass the cost on to the municipalities.
<P>
	Not wanting to spoil its chances in the upcoming referendum, 
the federal government is taking great care to put off its sinister 
plan to make massive cuts in transfers to the provinces until next 
year, that is, until after the referendum. It will be cutting $2.5 
billion in 1996-97 and $4.5 billion in 1997-98. And the $7 
billion cuts announced in the 1995 budget will be in addition to 
the $48 billion cuts in transfers to the provinces since 1982 and 
the $2 billion cuts in the 1994-95 budget.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10310"> 10310 </A></B>
<P>
	The worst part of it all is that the provinces will have to 
continue to meet the standards defined by Ottawa. Those that 
fail to do so will be immediately deprived of what remains of 
federal funding, that is an increasingly paltry amount.
<P>
	Furthermore, this so-called decentralization program will 
certainly not eliminate duplication, there will always be two 
ministers of health, two ministers of natural resources, of the 
environment, of revenue, etc. The alleged project to give more 
power to the provinces is hollow, because the federal 
government is not withdrawing from areas that come under 
provincial jurisdiction in exchange for a share of the taxes we 
pay to Ottawa. Is federalism cost effective?
<P>
	For Quebec in 1996-97, these forecasts represent a reduction 
of almost $700 million or 27.1 per cent of the cuts made to all the 
provinces. The federal government's way of proceeding in this 
regard will obviously have a definite impact on public finances 
in Quebec. Deprived of part of its revenues, which I might add 
were earmarked for welfare, health and post-secondary 
education, the Quebec government will be left no alternative 
other than to make drastic cuts in its own spending, not to reduce 
its own deficit, but simply to make up for the shortfall due to the 
drop in federal transfers. Quebec will obviously not be spared in 
the round of cuts planned for 1997-98. In looking at the Martin 
budget, the more one reads the more one realizes that it is more 
of a curse than a blessing to the people of Quebec.
<P>
	The same can be said for the federal public service and more 
specifically for the Outaouais which feels it has been given an 
especially rough ride by the federal budget. The government has 
shown itself to be extremely insensitive in announcing the 
elimination of 45,000 jobs in the Canadian public service over 
three years. Of these 45,000 jobs to be cut during the next three 
years, some 14,000 will be in the Hull-Ottawa area, nearly one 
third of jobs cut in the whole country. It is easy to see that this 
decision would have a direct and very negative impact on the 
economy and social life in the area.
<P>
	Of the cutbacks expected to total $29 billion over the next 
three years, the federal government intends to cut nearly $16.9 
billion from the management and operations of its programs. So 
the federal deficit will to a large extent be reduced on the backs 
of federal public servants, especially those in the Outaouais 
region.
<P>
	Even more unacceptable is the fact that the federal 
government knowingly made the Outaouais region 
economically dependent on it. Seeking to generate in Quebec 
and especially in the Outaouais a sense of belonging to Canada, 
the federal government began by creating the National Capital 
Commission in 1958. Pierre Trudeau's Liberal government, 
eager to give concrete proof of French Power as a means of 
hampering the sovereignist movement in Quebec, proceeded to 
implant a large number of federal government buildings on the  
Quebec shore of the Ottawa River in the 1970s. Probably taking 
the region for granted, the federal government seems to have no 
qualms about leaving the region to fend for itself in the wake of 
the disastrous cuts it announced. To repeat the jest made by the 
Quebec finance minister, which I feel hit the mark, the federal 
government is acting like a guy who gets a girl pregnant and then 
takes off.
<P>
<B>(1010) </B>
<P>
	I agree with the Coalition des associations économiques de 
l'Outaouais, which is of the opinion that the federal government 
must assume responsibility for the region. It must help to absorb 
the shock of budgetary decisions on the Outaouais region, just 
like it does when there is a shortage of fish in the Atlantic or a 
drought in the Western prairies, by giving the region a one-time 
payment to be put in a fund for diversifying the region's 
economy. Unless I am mistaken, the budget makes no mention 
of such a compensation which, by rights, should be paid to the 
region. Does the government intend-and I see that the Minister 
of Intergovernmental Affairs, who is responsible for looking 
after the region, is sneaking out-does the government intend to 
give-
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Order. As we all know, the 
rules of the House stipulate that no comment can be made either 
about the presence, and most especially about the absence, of 
members of the House, in view of all of the various demands and 
responsibilities of our positions.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bergeron:</B> Mr. Speaker, I apologize. Unless I am 
mistaken, the budget makes no mention of this compensation 
which, by rights, should be paid to the region. Does the 
government intend to make good on the request made by the 
Coalition des associations économiques de l'Outaouais? We are 
still waiting for an answer, and from what I can gather, we will 
not get one today either. Obviously, these massive public service 
staffing cuts are underhanded and pernicious, because they were 
made unilaterally in an autoritarian way.
<P>
	In the months leading up to the budget, the government 
obstinately refused to reach an agreement with the Public 
Service Alliance of Canada, which represents 70 per cent of 
federal public servants. This union, however, was ready to 
negotiate and to hammer out what could have been a mutual and 
fair agreement with the government. No matter, the government 
rejected the union's proposal out of hand, not even bothering to 
negotiate.
<P>
	The people are justifiably concerned about the quality of the 
services they are entitled to, which will now be provided by a 
heavily mortgaged public service. Would it not have been better 
for the government, instead of slashing its own public service as 
it did, to put in place mechanisms allowing it to stop wasting 
Quebec and Canadian taxpayers' money?
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10311"> 10311 </A></B>
<P>
	What does the government do to avoid wasting public funds, 
duplication and overlap? Of course, the government did not 
take any action to achieve this goal. That is why I strongly 
believe that, had it been otherwise, the cuts in the federal public 
service could have been less severe.
<P>
	To get back to the glaring contradictions and questionable 
priorities in the federal budget, I note that the Liberal 
government has announced a $532 million cut in the 
international aid budget. This decision is quite surprising, since 
he himself pointed out very recently in his foreign policy 
statement that international aid was crucial to meeting three 
objectives: prosperity, employment and international security.
<P>
	Having cut the international aid budget by over 25 per cent, 
how can the government claim it is adhering to the principle of 
moral responsibility toward international aid for developing 
countries, in order to reduce poverty? The fact is, it cannot, Mr. 
Speaker.
<P>
	Furthermore, how can they favour international trade 
development, when Canadian businesses are subsidized so that 
they are kept artificially dependent on the government? In fact, 
these subsidies hurt their competitiveness at the international 
level. This leads me to believe that because he did not have the 
courage to go further in reducing business subsidies, the 
minister will help keep these businesses in an unhealthy state of 
dependence that will hurt their development and hinder access 
to international markets.
<P>
	In closing, I would like to say a few words about the budget 
measures with respect to agriculture. Clearly, the federal budget 
does not affect all farmers across Canada the same way. The 
federal government announced the abolition of the $560 million 
Crow rate subsidy that helps finance Western grain transport.
<P>
<B>(1015) </B>
<P>
	However, this measure comes with a financial compensation 
package in the order of $1.6 billion for losses in land values, as 
well as $1 billion in credit guarantees for grain purchases. In 
addition, Western farmers affected by the cancellation of the 
Crow rate subsidy will receive $300 million over five years to 
facilitate the transition. On the other hand, Canadian milk 
producers, almost 50 per cent of whom are in Quebec, will see 
their federal subsidies cut by 30 per cent over the next two years.
<P>
	I find it hard to understand the logical basis for compensating 
Western farmers for the loss of the Crow rate subsidy, while 
industrial milk producers, most of whom live in Quebec, will 
not be entitled to any compensation from the federal 
government. Is this a case of double standard? I am afraid so.
<P>
	After crying wolf for several months to prepare the population 
for draconian budget measures, the Liberal government finally 
gave birth to a budget that is neither flesh, fish, nor fowl, that 
defers until later many of the  real solutions, and that insidiously 
ignores many of its potentially perverse and negative effects.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Marcel Massé (President of the Queen's Privy 
Council for Canada, Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs 
and Minister responsible for Public Service Renewal, Lib.): 
</B>Mr. Speaker, I must say that I was really disappointed with the 
Bloc's presentation. Perhaps nothing more should be expected 
from someone speaking on behalf of a party which has already 
made fundamental choices for ideological reasons and is 
therefore impervious to the truth.
<P>
	The truth is that, last year, 433,000 new jobs were created in 
Canada. This is actual job creation, not just idle talk. In Quebec, 
116,000 jobs. In the National Capital Region, a net total of 
16,600 new full time jobs were created in 1994. These are the 
facts, not a bunch of unsubstantiated claims like those made by 
the previous speaker.
<P>
	Yesterday, when the hon. member for Verchères said 14,000 
public service jobs would be lost in the Outaouais region, he 
showed his profound lack of understanding of the region. The 
truth is that the total job loss resulting from the budget over a 
three year period will be approximately 3,000, not 14,000.
<P>
	In all of Canada, 45,000 jobs will be cut but this does not mean 
people actually losing their jobs because in many cases these 
jobs will be filled by other employees reassigned as a result of 
the attrition process. I cannot expect the hon. member opposite 
to have deep knowledge of government, but I would ask him to 
at least stick to the facts and analysis. The truth about the budget 
tabled this week is that it is the only way to promote job creation 
in the long term.
<P>
	When the hon. member says that this budget will result in the 
loss of a few thousand jobs throughout the National Capital 
Region, he makes it sound like job creation would necessarily 
ensue if the deficit in the federal budget were allowed to 
continue to build up. If that were true, Canada would have 
achieved full employment a long time ago, given its 
accumulated deficits.
<P>
	The truth is that this is the only way to avoid hitting the wall 
like New Zealand did. In just a few months, New Zealand had to 
cut its public service by two thirds, not a mere 14 per cent like 
us. Our public service will continue to operate with 86 per cent 
of its employees in three years. Because New Zealand acted 
along the lines of what the hon. member opposite recommends, 
it had to cut its public service by two thirds. These are historical 
facts, not empty words like those spoken by the hon. member.
<P>
	By shrinking the size of the federal government, which was 
long overdue, by forcing ourselves to streamline and downsize 
government, we are ensuring that the 1994 job creation effort 
can continue.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10312"> 10312 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1020) </B>
<P>
	If we had carried on with the deficit that we had, the rise in 
interest rates would very quickly have prevented investments in 
the private sector, thereby also preventing the creation of jobs. 
What we did was to foster the economic climate which will 
promote investments and new jobs in the private sector.
<P>
	The member opposite has no idea of what is going on in the 
Outaouais, which is my region, when he says that the federal 
government is keeping it in a state of dependency. If you look at 
the 1971 census figures, you will see that, back then, one third of 
all the jobs for our region were in the public service. By 
comparison, last year only one fifth of the jobs in the Outaouais 
were in the public service.
<P>
	In other words, 80 per cent of the jobs in our region are not in 
the public service. In the national capital region, there are more 
jobs in the service sector than in the federal government. It is 
based on that necessary economic diversification that our 
government developed a plan for the region which will allow the 
private sector to create jobs that are needed and that will reduce 
the excessive burden on taxpayers, since the federal public 
service had become too big.
<P>
	I have a question for the member opposite regarding dairy 
producers. Quebec provides 48 per cent of the milk production 
in Canada and it exports that production elsewhere in the 
country. Should the province separate, where would it sell its 
milk, which costs two to three times more than the milk which 
we could get from the United States? It goes without saying that 
the rest of Canada would buy its milk at a cheaper price. 
Quebec's separation would totally destroy its dairy industry. 
While the federal government adjusts prices at the national level 
over a certain period of time, the member opposite wants to 
destroy the dairy industry in Quebec.
<P>
	As regards public servants, the actual number is 3,000 for the 
Outaouais, taking into account the five provincial and three 
federal ridings. We are told that Quebec would absorb the 
federal public servants, there are 50,000 of them, plus the other 
50,000 public servants they already have. They put the 3,000 
public servants from the Outaouais and the 100,000 for all of 
Quebec in the same boat. These people would want us to believe 
that they will absorb all these public servants, a measure which 
would cost them $4.4 billion.
<P>
	Given the analysis made by the hon. member, my question is 
this: Does he know Quebec sufficiently well to hope to create a 
better future than the one that we, federalists, have found to be 
adequate for over 125 years?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bergeron:</B> Mr. Speaker, I have a problem with the 
minister's somewhat sweeping statements. When he says that 
more than 400,000 jobs were created across Canada, when he 
says that thousands of jobs were created in Quebec, he implies 
that it was all thanks to the federal government.
<P>
	Last year, the federal government did not set up a single job 
creation program, with the exception of the infrastructures 
program, which is a program of temporary jobs. The 
government is just riding the wave of economic recovery. Jobs 
are being created and it says: Look at that, we created those jobs. 
This is entirely misleading. The federal government had nothing 
to do with it, and I think it is rather absurd that the minister 
should go around bragging that they created those jobs.
<P>
	The government planned to create 45,000 temporary jobs 
through the infrastructures program and then turns around and 
cuts 45,000 jobs in the Public Service. I heard the minister say 
that only 3,000 jobs would be lost in the Outaouais. I hope he is 
right. We are going to keep tabs on those figures and the region 
will as well. We can only hope the cuts will not go over 3,000.
<P>
	However, that does not deal with the real problem. The 
minister says he knows the Outaouais area well, but if he took a 
more active part in the activities of the Commission on the 
future of Quebec in this area, he would realize that his 
knowledge of the Outaouais is partisan and incomplete, since a 
number of people who appeared before this commission kept 
telling us-these are not my words-that the region's economy 
was dependent on the federal government.
<P>
	The minister quoted some figures just now. He said that, at 
one time, one of every three jobs in the Outaouais was in the 
federal public service. It is now one out of five. With the cuts 
being made by the government, it may go eventually down to 
one out of ten. My point is that considering the economic 
dependence the federal government has artificially created in 
the Outaouais, is the federal government-and the minister did 
not answer this question-is the federal government prepared to 
offer financial compensation by investing in an economic 
diversification fund, to compensate for the number of jobs lost 
in the public service? To get back to the notorious question, if I 
can call it that, because it is more like, I will not use the word 
misleading, but a very-
<P>
<B>(1025) </B>
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> Very pernicious.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bergeron:</B> -pernicious, thank you, a very pernicious 
statement that sovereignty would destroy Quebec's dairy 
industry. First of all, I want to say that I am dismayed at the 
minister's lack of confidence in Quebec's dairy industry, and 
furthermore, the minister ought to know that the milk produced 
in Quebec is probably the best quality milk in North America. 
There are no two ways about it. It is the best. No doubt about 
that. If you want to buy a quality product, no problem. Milk from 
Quebec can meet the highest standards in the world.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10313"> 10313 </A></B>
<P>
	That being said, this can work both ways, since in Quebec 
we eat a lot of beef from Western Canada, which is probably 
more expensive than beef we could buy elsewhere. In the event 
of a sovereign Quebec, if the market dries up for Quebec dairy 
producers, we will buy our beef elsewhere. Business is 
business.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Order! Before we 
proceed, I must inform the House that at the beginning of 
today's sitting, we forgot to inform the House of the absence of 
the Speaker. I therefore order the clerk to make the appropriate 
entry in the <I>Votes and Proceedings</I>. Resuming debate. The 
minister of Intergovernmental Affairs.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Marcel Massé (President of the Queen's Privy 
Council for Canada, Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs 
and Minister responsible for Public Service </B><B>Renewal, Lib.): 
</B>Mr. Speaker, I am delighted to participate in this debate. This is 
a budget of very strong measures, because this is what it takes to 
break the deficit's hold on our policies. This budget contains the 
most draconian measures taken by a government in 50 years.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The budget achieves our deficit goal without increasing 
personal income tax rates. For the second year in a row the 
government has refused to reduce the deficit on the backs of 
individual Canadians.
<P>
	I am particularly pleased to have the opportunity to explain 
the process and significance of the program review, one of the 
core elements of the budget.
<P>
	Last September in Quebec City the Prime Minister outlined 
the four key elements of the government's jobs and growth 
agenda. This week hon. members have witnessed with the 
unveiling of the 1995-96 budget the details of one of those 
fundamental elements, the program review.
<P>
	Last year the Prime Minister asked me to lead, in 
co-operation with my cabinet colleagues, the most fundamental 
review of government operations in two generations. The review 
was meant to be and was an exhaustive examination like none 
ever undertaken before of every government program and 
service, with a view to getting government back to basics and 
focusing on the priorities of Canadians.
<P>
	I worked closely with my colleagues and I want to take this 
opportunity to congratulate them once again for their 
commitment to the exercise designed to get government right.
<P>
	Unlike previous governments we listened to Canadians and 
the result we have seen in the budget tabled by my hon. 
colleague, the Minister of Finance, demonstrates that we have 
the courage to set the country on a new, much more secure 
course.
<P>
	I believe the Canadian people will agree that the budget and 
the program review results are ushering in a new approach to 
government.
<P>
<B>(1030 ) </B>
<P>
	It will be a dramatically changed national government. It will 
be a government that is getting back to basics, a government that 
reflects the priorities of average Canadians, a government that is 
affordable, a government that protects the most vulnerable, and 
a government that responds to the true needs of Canadians.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The Prime Minister detailed our intentions last September 
before the Quebec City Chamber of Commerce saying that 
control over the size and cost of government was vital to 
economic growth and job creation. It was in this perspective that 
the program review was developed and became one of the basic 
components of the budget.
<P>
	This review will enable the federal government to focus on its 
major priorities, to return to basics while enabling it to reduce 
its expenditures in an orderly fashion. The review was guided by 
three objectives.
<P>
	First, to strengthen public administration of federal programs 
and services; efforts in this regard will lead to a smaller but 
more efficient federal administration, which will provide the 
programs Canadians consider important. Secondly, to help 
modernize Canadian federalism; the government should provide 
only those programs and services it is best suited to provide. 
Thirdly, to help the government attain its financial objectives.
<P>
	This involved, therefore, totally rethinking what government 
did and what Canadians could allow themselves. In the future, 
departments will have to drop all but fundamental 
responsibilities. They are amalgamating like programs and 
services found within a department or spread among several 
departments. They are eliminating job duplication and costly 
overlap. They are reducing the operating costs of programs 
through new approaches, while raising standards of service. 
They are funding necessary programs through cost recovery and 
user fees.
<P>
	It must be stressed that the aim of the program review was not 
to identify or make cuts solely in response to financial needs. On 
the contrary, we asked each minister to review their programs 
and activities according to six criteria.
<P>
	First, public interest: Does the program or activity continue to 
serve the public? Second, the role of government: Is it necessary 
or legitimate for the government to be involved in the area of the 
program or activity? Third, federalism: Is the present role of 
government appropriate, or should consideration be given to 
transferring it to the provinces? Fourth, partnership: What 
programs or activities could be transferred wholly or in part to 
the private or volunteer sectors? Fifth, efficiency: How could 
the efficiency of the  program or activity be improved? Finally, 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10314"> 10314 </A></B>
<P>
financial capability: In financial terms, can we afford all of the 
resulting programs and activities?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	I can briefly summarize at this point that we undertook an 
unprecedented review of government activities because this 
government believes first and foremost it is crucial that we get 
our own house in order. As we have seen, this budget focused on 
cutting spending, not on raising taxes. Second, we began from 
the premise that the priorities of the government must reflect the 
priorities of Canadians. We did not want a blind slash and burn 
exercise.
<P>
	The approach we took in our program review was guided by 
three fundamentals: one, its fundamental objective to sustain 
growth and job creation; two, its fundamental challenge to get 
the economy right; and three, its fundamental requirement to 
refocus government on priority roles.
<P>
<B>(1035 ) </B>
<P>
	Program review encompassed about $52 billion worth of 
government spending. The result is that over the next three years 
program spending will decline by almost 19 per cent, more than 
$16 billion. Some departments will see their spending cut in 
half.
<P>
	The Department of Transport over three years will be cut by 
50 per cent. The Department of Natural Resources over the same 
three years will be cut by 49.8 per cent. The public service will 
be reduced by 14 per cent, 45,000 positions over three years.
<P>
	Program review will lead to long lasting structural change in 
what the government does. These are not, as my hon. colleague 
the Minister of Finance stated Monday, the phoney cuts we saw 
so often in the past, measures that pretended to define a slower 
rate of increase in spending as actual cuts.
<P>
	The cuts in this budget are real cuts in real dollars. They were 
accomplished by refocusing government programs on basics, 
eliminating overlap and duplication, improving the efficiency 
of our operations and shifting market interventions away from 
direct subsidies. Let me give some examples.
<P>
	In the past, agricultural subsidies have been tied to specific 
commodities which resulted in a large number of programs. The 
emphasis will now shift from income support to income 
stabilization.
<P>
	Fisheries and oceans will focus its resources on science and 
regulation to ensure conservation and sustainable fish stocks. 
We will discuss with the provinces the possibility of eventual 
devolution of freshwater fisheries management.
<P>
	Finally, assistance to business will be considerably reduced. 
Assistance will shift to repayable loans.
<P>
	In many departments there will be fundamental change in how 
programs and services are delivered. For example, an 
immigration fee will be charged to newcomers and sponsors will 
have to provide financial guarantees.
<P>
	Environment Canada will concentrate more on science and 
policy and finding new ways to deliver services. Environmental 
protection remains a priority in order to ensure the health and 
safety of Canadians. Pollution prevention will become a priority 
in partnership with the provinces, territories and industries.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	A large number of specific measures are based on a common 
philosophy and foundation.
<P>
	For example, we have taken important measures in this 
budget to substantially reduce business subsidies offered under 
all government programs. Subsidies will be reduced by close to 
60 per cent over a three year period. Some programs will be 
discontinued or drastically reduced. For example, we will be 
eliminating the transportation subsidies offered under the 
Western Grain Transportation Act, the Atlantic Region Freight 
Assistance Act and the Maritime Freight Rates Act.
<P>
	Some programs will be restructured or merged, for example, 
regional development organizations will be more geared to the 
needs of small and medium size businesses. Some activities will 
be transferred to other public administrations. For example, 
several responsibilities concerning inland waters will be turned 
over to the provinces; recreational harbours will be divested to 
municipalities; the forestry and mining development 
agreements with the provinces will be revoked, since the 
provinces have indicated that development of these resources 
falls under their jurisdiction; the operation of airports will be 
transferred to local authorities.
<P>
	Some activities will be commercialized or privatized: the 
remainder of the government's share in Cameco and 
Petro-Canada, Canadian National, the Air Navigation System, 
Canada Communication Group. Cost recovery and user fees will 
be implemented for some services.
<P>

	Treasury Board will put in place a new spending management

<P>
	The program review has allowed us to put our house in order 
in order to tackle the challenges of the next century. It 
fundamentally changes not only what we do but how we do it. 
The program review allows us to restore fiscal health to the 
nation's 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10315"> 10315 </A></B>
<P>
finances and also to make necessary spending reductions in an 
orderly way. The program review actions in the budget only start 
what  will be an ongoing process of reform and renewal of the 
federal government.
<P>
	Clearly, as announced in the budget, these results will have a 
major impact on the public service. All regions of the country 
are affected by the cutbacks and reductions. This is no less true 
for the national capital region. I want to say that as the Minister 
responsible for Public Service Renewal and as a member of 
Parliament in the national capital region, I am particularly and 
acutely aware of the difficult period many public servants across 
the country are going through at this time.
<P>
	The departure of employees who over the years have 
demonstrated loyalty, professionalism and dedication is the 
most painful part of any restructuring process. Decisions that 
affect people's livelihood are the most difficult to make. 
Departures are never easy. Let me reiterate this government's 
commitment to deal with employees in the fairest and most 
sensitive way possible. We will continue to work with the unions 
and local governments to ease the transition. We hope to keep 
layoffs and the number of employees on unpaid surplus status to 
an absolute minimum.
<P>
	Some individuals will be accommodated through normal 
attrition. Some will take advantage of the departure and early 
retirement incentives announced by the President of the 
Treasury Board. Some individuals will transfer to the private 
sector as some operations are being privatized. Others will find 
work in the private sector. No doubt there will be a period of 
change and uncertainty as we move to what I firmly believe will 
be a revitalized public service in the coming years.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	I deplore the fact that the representative for the Outaouais 
region, Mr. Blais, and some members of the opposition are 
misleading the local population and are creating more 
uncertainty. They are proclaiming that the budget cuts 14,000 
public service jobs in the Outaouais region.
<P>
	In fact, the total number of jobs that will be affected in all of 
the national capital region, on both sides of the river, will be 
12,000 to 13,000 over the next three years. This means, 
therefore, that the real number of public servants in the 
Outaouais region that will be affected is more like 3,000. I 
cannot accuse them of telling untruths, since the difference 
between their current claims and the true figures is only one job 
to five, which is about par for them.
<P>
	I am happy that regional players, including Hull mayor 
Ducharme and Outaouais urban community president Croteau, 
have taken a clear, credible and realistic stand on this budget.
<P>
	With the various measures I mentioned and the co-operation 
of the private sector and all economic stakeholders in the region, 
we will manage to minimize job losses while at the same time 
diversifying the region's economy.
<P>
	As the member of Parliament representing Hull-Aylmer, I 
have had the privilege of rubbing elbows with people of this 
area. I was able to observe how imaginative they are and how 
enthusiastically they tackle new challenges. I want to salute 
their courage in these tough times.
<P>
	The budget is further proof of the flexibility of federalism; it 
is not stuck in status quo. The budget stresses our commitment 
to provide the people with good government in Canada. And this 
entails the challenge of bringing the deficit down and 
streamlining government. As part of our commitment, no region 
will be receiving preferential treatment nor be subjected to more 
cuts than the others.
<P>
<B>(1045) </B>
<P>
	The new Canadian social transfer combines into one 
lump-sum transfer three formerly separate transfers, thereby 
lightening the administrative burden of the provinces. This 
transfer will ensure maximum flexibility in developing 
provincial programs suited to the needs of the regions. The new 
lump-sum transfer limits the restraint the federal government 
can impose in exclusive provincial jurisdictions.
<P>
	This new and more flexible formula does not affect the quality 
of services provided to Canadians.
<P>
	The terms and conditions set out in the Canada Health Act will 
be maintained and the provinces will have to abide by the 
provisions of the act with respect to health care.
<P>
	At the same time, we remain committed to fiscal equalization, 
one of the cornerstones of the Canadian federal system, through 
which Quebec receives nearly $4 billion per year.
<P>
	The budget marks the beginning of a new era, an era in which 
the federation will be managed differently. Management will be 
simpler, more efficient and, yes, more sensitive to provincial 
jurisdictions. The budget give provincial governments full 
scope to meet the needs of the people.
<P>
	The budget is convincing evidence of the fact that the federal 
system is a progressive, co-operative and dynamic system. Less 
than a year and a half into this Parliament, we have already 
tabled two budgets to substantially reduce public expenditures, 
something Ontario and Quebec will also have to do. We also 
restructured government organization. The measures outlined in 
this budget are the most stringent federal measures in fifty 
years.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	We have abandoned the across the board cuts used by previous 
governments which proved to be  counterproductive and 
ineffec-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10316"> 10316 </A></B>
<P>
tive. This budget is a rational way to bring the size and structure 
of government into line with our needs.
<P>
	We agree with Canadians that a balanced budget is the goal 
and we will get there by setting realistic and achievable targets. 
This budget leads by example. We are cutting government first.
<P>
	We believe this budget truly marks the beginning of a new era.

<P>
	<B>Mr. Ghislain Lebel (Chambly, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have 
been listening to budget speeches for at least 30 years. Except 
for a brief 8-year period of Conservative government, the 
Liberals were in office for most of those 30 years. I have yet to 
see a Minister of Finance table a budget in this House and say 
that it is not a good one. All were guided by the same concern for 
fairness and justice. Not one of those ministers said that what he 
was proposing was not good. What I do not understand is that, 
after 30 years of good budgets, the end result is bad.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Lebel:</B> I was never able to understand that equation: the 
sum total of the good is a negative figure. And right now that 
figure is almost $600 billion. The Minister of Finance tells us 
that all those who were here before him were in the wrong and 
that what they suggested made no sense. He adds that his budget 
is a real one and a good one. Sure. However, one the 
predecessors of the finance minister is the current Prime 
Minister, who also contributed to the growth of the deficit.
<P>
	The minister just told us that there are people in the national 
capital region, in Ottawa-Hull, who are happy about the cuts 
made in the public service. The minister more or less acted the 
way he did with Saint-Jean. He eliminated 400 jobs and, at the 
very last minute, he managed to save 20 and claim that it was a 
miracle on his part. Let the minister bring those Hull and Aylmer 
residents and ask them in front of us whether they agree with the 
loss of 45,000 jobs in the public service. Let me give you an 
example. At the taxation data centre, in Saint-Hubert, there is a 
6-month backlog to process the returns of businesses 
conducting R &amp; D.
<P>
<B>(1050) </B>
<P>
	Currently, there are businesses on the verge of experiencing 
major financial problems because they are not receiving their 
due from the federal government. The public servants cannot 
process their claim. And the minister would want us to believe 
that the budget tabled on Monday is the greatest thing since 
sliced bread. I do not believe that and let me tell you something 
else. Next year, the minister will once again say: ``The others 
before me, including myself, did not do well. However, I know 
what I am doing this time''.
<P>
	The minister should explain certain things. I remember one 
month when the unemployment rate dropped one tenth of one 
per cent. The Minister of Finance was elated. The economy was 
picking up and everybody was happy. The following month, 
economic activity rose by one per cent. Now, that was even 
better; things were really looking up. But I simply cannot 
understand these people. How did the minister manage to fool 
Outaouais residents and make them accept the elimination of 
45,000 jobs, when in fact such a loss is a terrible thing. I would 
appreciate an answer from the minister.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Massé:</B> Mr. Speaker, I am very happy that opposition 
members have asked me these questions, because they will give 
me the opportunity to set the record straight. Over the years, 
Canadian budgets may have resulted in a large deficit but, at the 
same time, they have produced what the UN calls the best 
country in the world, with one of the highest rates of income per 
capita in the world, a country that enjoys considerable peace and 
harmony compared with other nations, a country where life is 
good and incomes are high. That is what successive Canadian 
budgets have given us.
<P>
	During the quiet revolution that took place in Quebec in the 
sixties, we as Quebecers managed to change our structures, 
values and policies within the federation as it was back then. 
This gave us the country we now have and want to keep, because 
it served us well. Speaking of the last budget, 433,000 jobs were 
created in 1994, including 116,000 in Quebec. What are the 
factors involved in creating jobs in a country?
<P>
	Most jobs are not created directly by governments, whether it 
is Ontario, Quebec or the federal government. However, 
government policies produce a climate allowing the private 
sector to create jobs. Clearly, the confidence generated and the 
policies adopted by the Liberal government last year allowed the 
economy to create over 400,000 jobs, including more than 
100,000 in Quebec. That is what our government has 
accomplished.
<P>
	I am so pleased that the hon. member has brought up the 
matter of Saint-Jean, a community where we had reached with 
the former Liberal government in Quebec an agreement that the 
local population found acceptable, which would have kept the 
college open and continued to create jobs, which was, in fact, a 
hope for the future. When the new government, of which our 
Bloc colleagues, under the direction of their leader, are a mere 
extension, arrived on the scene, it decided, for its own 
ideological reasons, that it wanted no part of any agreement. 
These ideological reasons were disclosed by a minister, who has 
kept a pretty low profile since then.
<P>
	In one month, we met with local representatives who know 
that the region needs the college and whose goal is not to 
promote their ideology but to create jobs and generate economic 
activity in the region. We agreed with these people to keep the 
college open and maintain the core that will eventually become a 
<P>

<B><A NAME="10317"> 10317 </A></B>
<P>
dynamic institution that will continue to benefit the region. I am 
still very  proud of what we did in Saint-Jean, despite the Parti 
Quebecois government and its ideology.
<P>
<B>(1055) </B>
<P>
	Third, I was asked if people in Hull agree. In fact, people in 
Hull think about what is happening in their community. They 
know how to evaluate the role of government, how to use it and 
how to enjoy one of the lowest unemployment rates and one of 
the highest rates of income in Quebec. They have voted Liberal 
for decades because they know which party has best served their 
economic, political and social interests.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Gouk (Kootenay West-Revelstoke, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, during the last election the Reform Party ran in many 
ridings where civil servants would be affected by layoffs. The 
Reform Party was very honest and said we do have to downsize 
government. There will be some changes.
<P>
	The Liberal Party ran against us in those ridings and said: 
``That brutal Reform Party. We would never do that. The poor 
civil servants. We would protect their jobs''. The word that 
comes to mind is hypocrisy.
<P>
	The minister is going to downsize his department. He is 
quoted in the Ottawa <I>Sun</I> this morning as saying that job cuts 
based on race or sex are illegal according to the charter of rights.
<P>
	He says that the department recognizes the need for 
employment equity, respecting the various proportions that 
exist now and if possible will increase them.
<P>
	Is the minister going to use this downsizing of the government 
to try and bring in some form of equity balancing, or is he going 
to do it by merit the way the laws of the land say he has to do it?
<P>
	The article suggests that he is asking the department how it is 
going to do it. Who is in charge? Is it the minister or is it the 
bureaucrats? I would like to hear his answer.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Massé:</B> Mr. Speaker, once again these are questions I am 
glad to answer. In my own campaign in Hull and Aylmer I 
indicated-the speeches and the transcripts are there for you 
see-the government would have to be downsized.
<P>
	I was criticized by part of the electorate but in the end this was 
not hypocritical, this was the truth. It was told government had 
to downsize. Knowing the truth, it elected me with more than 53 
per cent of the vote in the area. It knew what it was facing and 
agreed this had to be done.
<P>
	On the second question, we have here two objectives that have 
to be realized. The first one is that equity in its largest sense has 
to be satisfied. There is no doubt that we have to apply equity 
when we do any move in government, including restructuring 
government.
<P>
	However, it is quite clear, and this is what I indicated to the 
<I>Sun</I> yesterday, when we make an exercise like that in a 
government, the managers who have the responsibility to 
manage that department will make the choices according to 
merit and ability that will keep with them the best civil servants.
<P>
	There is no doubt also that whatever the categories of people, 
by sex or creed or colour, merit is distributed very equally in the 
population and that heads of personnel will come to a result that 
I am sure will conform to the principles of equity.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> It being 11.00 a.m., 
pursuant to Standing Order 30(5), the House will now proceed to 
Statements by Members pursuant to Standing Order 31.

	As our markets become increasingly global, we will depend

order to compete in the North American market.

Quebecers and swiftly recognize the new country.

	<B>Ms. Hedy Fry (Vancouver Centre, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is 
important for me to bring to the attention of the House that 
March 6 to March 11 is Vision Awareness Week in Canada. This 
year's theme is ``Hope is in sight: good vision and literacy, there 
is a clear connection''.
<P>
	It is a sad fact that many Canadians cannot read well simply 
because they cannot see well. One in six children has a vision 
problem that makes learning and reading difficult. If our 
children cannot focus on the chalkboard or on words in a book, 
how can we expect them to learn to read?
<P>
	This problem is not unique to children. Three-quarters of 
adults with poor literacy skills also have problems with their 
vision.
<P>
	The difficulty is that not all vision problems are easily 
detected. We know the earlier problems are detected and 
corrected, the faster we can get children and adults alike on the 
reading track and the faster they will be literate.
<P>
	Awareness is the key. I ask my colleagues to join me and 2,800 
optometrists in reminding Canadians-

	<B>Mrs. Pauline Picard (Drummond, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
income security minister Jeanne Blackburn yesterday 
denounced in no uncertain terms the federal government's 
withdrawal of funding for provincial welfare, education and 
health programs. In spite of the $7 billion lost over three years 
due to federal cuts, the government of Quebec will still have to 
provide assistance to 240,000 children whose parents have 
turned to welfare as a last resort.
<P>
	Like a blind executioner with an axe in hand, the federal 
government is hacking away at social programs without 
realizing the impact these cuts have on people. With a single 
stroke of the pen, Ottawa is forcing the Quebec government to 
make painful choices among social services without so much as 
suffering the terrible consequences of its decisions.
<P>
	It is high time for Quebecers to protect themselves from such 
unilateral cuts. The only solution available to us is to repatriate 
the taxes we pay to Ottawa and then decide among ourselves 
how much of the joint assets we shall share.

	<B>Mr. Jim Silye (Calgary Centre, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
Minister of Human Resources Development has fumbled the 
ball on his plan to reform the child care system in Canada.
<P>
	Various child care programs cost over $8 billion per year, yet 
many still live in poverty and our courts are filled with charter 
challenges by families fighting the discriminatory nature of 
government policy.
<P>
	My private member's Bill C-247 provides for a 
straightforward tax deduction per child to any taxpaying parent, 
regardless of the method of child care chosen or marital status. 
By empowering people to take more responsibility for 
themselves, the bill will give them tax free money to do so.
<P>
	In the social reforms paper the minister addressed day care 
spaces and flexible work arrangements for parents but said 
nothing about current taxation inequities, charter challenges or 
stay at home parenting. ``Such a move'', he said, ``would have 
been too racy'', with which I am sure the member opposite 
would probably agree. I fail to see what is so racy to the member 
for Halifax about a tax break for overburdened parents.

<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="THEBUDGET">THE BUDGET</A></H3>
	<B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, over the past decade, individuals have been called upon 
to assume a heavier tax load than corporations. This week's 
budget perpetuates this state of affairs by imposing a higher 
increase in taxes on the middle class than on corporations, in 
particular through increased excise taxes on gasoline. In 1995, 
individuals will pay four times more income tax than 
corporations.
<P>
	My question is for the acting prime minister. Will the acting 
prime minister acknowledge that the budget calls upon 
individuals to assume a heavier tax burden than businesses, 
since 65 per cent of all of the income tax increases it contains 
will hit individuals?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. David Walker (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am very surprised that the hon. 
member has so misinterpreted the budget. We are very proud of 
the fact that this budget has absolutely no increase in personal 
income tax rates.
<P>
	We have taken several steps to increase the contribution from 
the corporate side to the basic revenue structure of this country. 
We have made changes in the large corporate income tax rate. 
We have made changes in taxation with the banks. For the first 
time, given also the increase in profits in the private sector, I 
think we will find there is a tremendous shift to the corporate 
side away from the average family.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, that was exactly what I was talking about. How can the 
parliamentary secretary talk about a fair budget when we know 
that the only additional effort being required of banks and 
financial institutions is a temporary tax of some $100 million 
staggered over two years, although the combined profits of the 
six biggest banks were $4.3 billion last year alone? When is the 
government going to impose a real minimum tax on the earnings 
of profitable large corporations?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. David Walker (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, this government is making every 
effort to make sure the banking industry and the financial 
institutions pay their fair share.
<P>
	A number of measures that were first introduced last year 
have been reinforced this year. The tax structure is not 
temporary but permanent. These institutions will be paying their 
fair share. We will insist upon it.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the Minister of Finance himself talked about 
implementing a minimum tax on the profits of corporations 
during the last election campaign.
<P>
	Considering the finance department's commitment to closing 
tax loopholes and creating a fair budget, how can the 
parliamentary secretary justify that the 1995 budget does not 
touch tax havens, nor does it touch flags of convenience, which 
allow rich taxpayers and large corporations to avoid paying their 
fair share of tax, or that the budget does not tighten up family 
trust rules until 1999?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. David Walker (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, in rapid succession the member 
has been able to misinterpret about three different measures in 
the last budget.
<P>
	First, starting with the capital base of corporations, we have a 
tax structure now which eliminates many of the loopholes 
whereby corporations managed to escape taxes on the income 
side. Second, we did not sign any tax treaty with any country 
which provides for a tax haven. It is just the opposite. We ensure 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10322"> 10322 </A></B>
<P>
taxes are collected from Canadians and Canadian businesses 
doing business overseas. Third, measures involved with the 
family trust take place immediately. The other ones on the 
capital tax side take place in 1999.
<P>
<B>(1120) </B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Daviault (Ahuntsic, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, after 
getting themselves elected on a promise to create jobs and 
restore hope, the Liberals have literally broken their promises in 
the 1995 budget and, like the Tories, they feel that the 
unemployment problem will only be solved by eliminating the 
deficit. There are no jobs in the finance minister's two small 
clouds.
<P>
	Since we still need over 800,000 jobs in Canada to reach the 
pre-recession employment rate, how can the Acting Prime 
Minister justify the total lack of active job creation measures in 
the budget?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. David Walker (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, again the opposition has 
misinterpreted the budget. We announced measures starting last 
year with the infrastructure program.
<P>
	We have been very aggressive in creating jobs. With the better 
climate we have provided in Canada over 443,000 jobs have 
been created. I am sure the hon. member would like to read the 
red book more carefully than he has in the past. On page 16 and 
again on page 19 we emphasized the double track our new 
government had to take. That is to say, we had to create jobs and 
reaffirm our commitment to Canadians and at the same time we 
had to begin the deficit reduction program.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Daviault (Ahuntsic, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, given the 
current employment situation, how can the Acting Prime 
Minister justify the fact that the only program introduced to 
stimulate employment, the infrastructure program, has been 
extended until just before the next election campaign, thus 
cutting federal job creation funds by $200 million this year?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. David Walker (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, one of the prime reasons we have 
extended the infrastructure program and pushed $200 million of 
work into the future is the very sensitive issue of environmental 
assessment. I am sure there is no member in the House of 
Commons who would wish us to ignore environmental 
assessments and to push projects through without their being 
properly evaluated. As these projects are properly evaluated, 
they will come onstream as originally planned.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stephen Harper (Calgary West, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, in 
spite of all the spin doctors and all the puff pieces, there is 
growing evidence that the financial markets have not been 
fooled by the budget. This week the Canadian dollar has fallen 
steadily and dramatically. Interest rates have risen on all forms 
of Canadian government securities.
<P>
	Today the <I>Globe and Mail</I> says that the finance minister calls 
the cuts good politics. Will the minister tell us why the 
government has chosen good politics when the situation 
requires good economics?
<P>
	<B>Mr. David Walker (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, if the opposition member would 
care to read through both the financial press and the general 
public press and look at the opinion polls such as Angus Reid 
presented this week, he will see that the budget has been 
accepted widely by Canadians as well as by financial experts. In 
fact, only yesterday Standard and Poor's reaffirmed our AAA 
rating. We are very proud of the reception we are getting.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stephen Harper (Calgary West, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
Moody's, Standard and Poor's, and other financial firms 
continue to provide warnings about the financial situation of the 
Government of Canada. They continue to evaluate our 
securities.
<P>
	Yesterday, Standard and Poor's lowered its outlook on our 
foreign currency debt from negative to stable, saying that it 
reflects the possibility of a downgrade should the slow pace of 
deficit reduction fail to ease the government's debt and interest 
rate burdens over the next few years. The budget does not get the 
job done.
<P>
	Will the minister admit that the cuts in the budget are 
inadequate to control the growth in debt and interest payments?
<P>
	<B>Mr. David Walker (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is just the opposite. We all 
remain very concerned about the debt. That is why we took the 
dramatic actions we did on Monday. I want to remind the 
member that Standard and Poor's addressed itself to the 3 per 
cent foreign currency debt. On the other 97 per cent it gave a 
AAA.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stephen Harper (Calgary West, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
government knows the cuts are inadequate. Yesterday in Toronto 
when the Minister of Finance was asked about additional cuts to 
the CBC, he joked: ``Is this being televised? Because if it is, it is 
a very different answer''.
<P>
	What additional cuts are being planned to deal with the failure 
of the budget? Cuts to the CBC, cuts to old age security, cuts to 
unemployment insurance, cuts to health care. Why will the 
government not tell Canadians about these cuts in public and on 
camera?

	<B>Mr. David Walker (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of

due to the failure of the budget because the budget is not a 
failure.
<P>
	The Minister of Finance and the Prime Minister have 
indicated that as one goes about reviewing an organization as 
large as the Government of Canada, naturally one will 
continually come across better ways of doing things. We will 
continue to do things better.

	<B>Mrs. Christiane Gagnon (Quebec, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
Monday afternoon, heritage deputy minister Michel Rochon 
communicated to CBC president Anthony Manera the Cabinet's 
budget decisions for the next three years, I repeat, the next three 
years.
<P>
	Does the Minister of Canadian Heritage continue to deny that 
budget decisions have been made concerning the CBC's fate in 
the next three years? If not, does this mean that he has once 
again failed to honour one of his commitments, namely to 
provide the CBC with multi-year funding?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Michel Dupuy (Minister of Canadian Heritage, 
Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, I think that our hon. colleague still does not 
understand the difference between a budget decision and the 
program review. It would seem this is where the confusion stems 
from. I have publicly explained these matters both in and 
outside this House.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Christiane Gagnon (Quebec, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, how 
can the minister justify logically and rationally his decision to 
strike a committee of wise men and women to look at the CBC's 
mandate, after giving members of Parliament the mandate to do 
just that last August?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Michel Dupuy (Minister of Canadian Heritage, 
Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, our colleague does not seem to grasp too 
well what was referred to the heritage committee. Had she done 
me the courtesy of listening, perhaps she would understand 
better. This may explain why the hon. member and her 
colleagues never understand anything: they do not listen.
<P>
	I think that our colleague has a gift for telling the future. We 
had not yet outlined how we intend to review not only the CBC's 
mandate, but also that of the National Film Board and Telefilm 
Canada. This means she will have to wait for the review mandate 
to be clearly spelled out. I can assure her that it will not be the 
same as the mandate given the House of Commons heritage 
committee.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Elwin Hermanson (Kindersley-Lloydminster, Ref.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, it is time to clear the air on the CBC issue.
<P>
	On Tuesday the Minister of Canadian Heritage stated that the 
president of the CBC resigned for personal reasons, but last 
night Mr. Manera directly contradicted the minister. He 
resigned not for personal reasons but because the minister has 
secret and specific plans for cuts to the CBC over the next three 
years.
<P>
	Given that the budget is a three-year document and given that 
we have a copy of the minister's plans precipitating the 
president's resignation, how can the minister justify not coming 
clean with Canadians about his plans regarding the CBC?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Michel Dupuy (Minister of Canadian Heritage, 
Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am asked to deal with two issues in the 
question, one on the motivation of Mr. Manera's resignation. I 
am not speculating about the motivation for his resignation. He 
can speak for himself.
<P>
	As to the second matter, I think I have been clear in the House. 
The budget contains some indication for the next fiscal year. It is 
4 per cent which amounts to $44 million. The figures for the 
second and third year are derived from the program review.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Elwin Hermanson (Kindersley-Lloydminster, Ref.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, it seems very odd that the president would resign if 
that in fact were the case.
<P>
	When budgetary information is withheld from Canadians, it 
creates uncertainty and confusion. In this case, it has caused the 
resignation of the president of the CBC who accused the 
minister of failing to disclose the information to Canadians 
about future cuts to the CBC. The minister denies it. They 
cannot both be telling the truth.
<P>
<B>(1130) </B>
<P>
	Since this is the second time the minister has placed himself 
in a compromising position, will he clear the air and promptly 
submit his resignation to the Prime Minister.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Michel Dupuy (Minister of Canadian Heritage, 
Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like to know where our colleagues in 
Reform are coming from. One day they say they want to destroy 
the CBC. They want to privatize it. They do not want to see it any 
more.
<P>
	I stand here saying we will defend the CBC. It will be a strong 
institution. It will be on the information highway and we are not 
going to have privatization. This is what I stand for.

	<B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier-Montcalm, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Justice.
<P>
	Yesterday, we learned that the RCMP's lack of co-operation 
with Swiss authorities had resulted in the release of two 
Canadian nationals who had been charged with money 
laundering and detained for six months in Switzerland.
<P>
	Today, for the second time in a year, the U.S. State 
Department indicated that Canada is one of the countries where 
money laundering is most prevalent and easiest to do.
<P>
	Since Canada is truly a sieve when it comes to money 
laundering, what is the government waiting for to legislate and 
put an end to that illegal activity?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney 
General of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, with the ease of 
international money transfers, money laundering by the 
underworld is a concern for all industrialized nations.
<P>
	Through the inference of the Solicitor General, Canada is 
collaborating with other nations around the world to form a 
united front against this insidious threat to our economic 
security and, frankly to our laws against crime.
<P>
	The Solicitor General, through his collaboration with the 
United States of America and European nations, is working 
closely with authorities abroad to take effective steps to deal 
with money laundering in Canada.

[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier-Montcalm, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, as was confirmed yesterday, the Canadian government 
is certainly not co-operating with Swiss authorities. I also urge 
the minister to read the U.S. State Department's report. It has 
plenty to say about this issue.
<P>
	Does the minister realize that, because of the lack of 
legislation, each year $10 billion are being laundered in Canada, 
and does he realize that his failure to act only encourages such 
illegal activity?

abroad to make sure that effective steps are taken in that case.
<P>
	In so far as legislative change is concerned, we believe that 
the legislation in place at present is sufficient to meet the 
challenge. As I have said in the past, the Solicitor General,

	<B>Mr. John Williams (St. Albert, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
minister of public service renewal acknowledged that job cut 
decisions based on race or sex are illegal under the charter of

	Yet he indicated that government personnel managers might 
turn a blind eye to the charter and it is more likely that 
minorities will keep their jobs when the government implements

Mr. Speaker, it is very easy to indicate exactly what the facts are 
before questions are asked.
<P>
	The newspaper quotes me verbatim as saying: ``Mr. Massé 
said he had been assured workers' rights will be respected. `The 
charter of rights indicate when you are doing a restructuring in 
industry you have to designate your surplus workers on totally 
objective reasons,' he said. `You cannot use equity reasons of 
that type in order to designate them''.
<P>
	That indicates exactly what was said. It is totally in 
conformity with the charter of rights and with our policies.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Williams (St. Albert, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
minister is trying to obfuscate the problem because the charter 
of rights does not allow discrimination based on sex and gender 
and that is exactly what he has said in the article.

<P>
	In its budget, the government intends to spend $3.5 billion to 
compensate Western grain producers for eliminating the Crow 
subsidy which totals nearly $600 million annually. This 
compensation will be a direct incentive for the diversification of

	<B>Mr. David Walker (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of

the agricultural front dealing with both the WGTA and the dairy 
subsidy. I remind hon. members these are two different 
agricultural sectors. We had a question from the Reform Party 
yesterday from a different perspective.
<P>
	We are working with each of these communities to make sure 
that we do things properly. The dairy subsidy is being 
approached in an entirely different way than the grain 
transportation subsidy. As we work our way through the 
communities we will continue making announcements to make 
sure these subsidies are both reduced and properly looked after.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean-Guy Chrétien (Frontenac, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
may recall this is a ratio of 6 to 1. How can the Liberal 
government justify this inequity which deprives Eastern 
producers of any form of compensation, although they will be 
the first to suffer as a result of competition from Western farm 
producers who are being subsidized by the federal government 
to diversify their production?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Lyle Vanclief (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Agriculture and Agri-food, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would 
remind the hon. member for Frontenac that the changes made to 
the Western Grain Transportation Act are one time and final. As 
of August 1 this year the western grain transportation support 
will be over and done with. The dairy support-it is one of the 
hon. member's concerns-will still be 85 per cent in place as of 
August 1, 1995.
<P>
	The changes we have made to the agriculture and agri-food 
budget have been fair and equitable. They will be effective.
<P>
	I would also remind the hon. member that Quebec has not 
been unduly affected by the budget. If I look at the changes in 
the research branch, the reduction in staff in the province of 
Quebec at the end of all this-

meet the deficit target.
<P>
	Would the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Finance

<P>
	<B>Mr. David Walker (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of

question from the hon. member for York-Simcoe gives me to 
tell the House that the economy is coming along quite well.
<P>
	Statistics Canada said this week that the economy has 
improved and that we have had the fastest growth rate in five 
years. It was 4.5 per cent throughout the year. For the first time 
in 40 years we are now competitive with the United States on 
every measure. That is why our exports are driving the economy.

appreciate this-finally consumer confidence is growing. With 
a 7 per cent increase in retail sales I believe every Canadian feels 
he or she is participating in the renewal.

	<B>Mr. Jim Silye (Calgary Centre, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, let us not 
forget what we have learned today, that the Liberals now define 
spending cuts as a better way of doing things.
<P>
	The Liberals' two-tier pension plan through trough regular 
and trough light will continue to make millionaires out of 
defeated cabinet ministers. On Monday, the President of the 
Treasury Board acknowledged that members of Parliament 
contribute double what is normal in the private sector to their 
own plan. He said that in the House.
<P>
	How can the Liberal government justify this double standard 
of asking Canadians to sacrifice while most ministers continue 
to stuff their mattresses?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (President of the Treasury Board

Speaker, it is funny that members of the third party talk about

<HR>
<B><A NAME="10326"> 10326 </A></B>
<P>
stuffing mattresses. They do not say anything about double 
dipping, even though a few of them understand it quite well.
<P>
	The cuts we announced in the budget of 19 per cent over the 
next three years are very substantial cuts. In one year, we cut the 
MP contribution by 33 per cent. On top of that, salaries of 
members of Parliament have been frozen for six years. 
Therefore the compensation package overall for members of 
Parliament has been going down.
<P>
	It has been going down to help meet our deficit reduction 
targets, to help get our fiscal house in order.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Silye (Calgary Centre, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, for the 
information of the President of Treasury Board, we would 
support any legislation he introduces to eliminate double 
dipping.
<P>
	On Monday, the Prime Minister said he cannot reform the MP 
pension plan retroactively because ``there is a rule in democracy 
that we do not pass retroactive legislation''.
<P>
	Considering the fact that the Liberals applied retroactive 
legislation to the Pearson contract, public service contracts, the 
EH-101 contract, the Canadian taxpayers working overseas, can 
the minister explain why the Liberal fat pack is not subject to the 
same rules as those Canadians?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (President of the Treasury Board 
and Minister responsible for Infrastructure, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it has been said many times in the House why the 
Pearson deal and others were changed. It was a bad deal for 
taxpayers.
<P>
	What is a good deal and a show of leadership is when the 
members of the House cut their compensation packages. That is 
what has happened in the case of MPs' pensions.

comments of the hon. member for Guelph-Wellington were 
taken out of context.
<P>
	She was referring to the fact that we have had the most open 
budget making process in Canadian history. The Minister of 
Finance should be congratulated for consulting widely, not just 
with his parliamentary colleagues but with industry and all 
Canadians.
<P>
	She was referring to the fact it was well known because my 
colleague, the President of the Treasury Board and the Minister 
of Intergovernmental Affairs had talked about the downsizing of 
the public service. It was in the public domain. It was not a leak 
of the budget.

Mr. Speaker, yesterday the Minister of National Defence 
announced an eventual 20 per cent cut to his general staff by 
1998. This is too little too late. Canada will still have a ratio of 
generals to troops double that of Germany or the United States.
<P>
	Can the minister justify the fact that even his target reductions

<P>
glad that the Reform Party is supporting what we are doing in 
terms of streamlining the Canadian Armed Forces from top to 
bottom. I welcome that.
<P>
	The previous government did announce a reduction at the 
general officer level by 20 per cent in 1991 and that has now 
gone through the system. We announced, consequential to the 
white paper and from the budget, that there would be a further 
reduction of 25 per cent at the general officer level and 20 per 
cent of the colonels.
<P>
	Contrary to what the hon. member said, this does bring us 
more into line with our NATO allies with respect to the officer to 
general ranks ratio.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Hart (Okanagan-Similkameen-Merritt, Ref.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, let us take a look at that.
<P>
	Currently we have 12 generals per 10,000 troops in the 
Canadian Armed Forces. The United States and Germany have 5 
generals per 10,000 troops in their forces. With the 
government's reductions that ratio will change to 11 generals 
per 10,000 troops.
<P>
	Does the minister really expect the Canadian people to 
believe this is a cut at the top?

the United States. We were given assurances by the Americans 
that would not be the case.

is for this reason, as he well knows, that the federal government 
will be meeting with provincial counterparts in the fall to 
discuss the issue of pensions.
<P>
	It is interesting the hon. member would mention the 
principles but would not speak to the fact that some of the 
principles include undiminished protection for the less well off

control of program costs.

assault with a weapon in 1990, and drug trafficking in 1994. Day

<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>I don't think so. There were some MPs who were told beforehand if major 
cuts were coming to programs in their ridings. They asked for that in caucus so 
they could prepare to ask questions.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	I will just repeat the words because they are serious: ``some 
MPs were told beforehand''. Needless to say, I find this 
statement very troubling. I want to explain why I find it 
troubling but I also want to explain why I feel this to be a prima 
facie violation of my rights and privileges as a member of 
Parliament.
<P>
	I want to quote another parliamentarian on this same issue 
who outlined the importance of the budget being confidential 
until budget night. By the way there is some real irony in this 
quote. This is a quote that I draw from the <I>Debates</I> at page 2283 
of <I>Hansard</I> of December 12, 1979. It reads:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The confidentiality in which the details of a budget are kept secret is a 
constitutional practice which forms an integral part of a parliamentary system. 
Such practice is based on the principle that no individual, whoever he may be, 
must know in advance the details of a budget which he could use for personal 
gain.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>(1205) </B>
<P>
	That quote is from the right hon. Prime Minister, speaking in 
the House of Commons in 1979. I am sure the Prime Minister 
intended to include the Liberal caucus in his designation when 
he said ``whoever''.
<P>
	To facilitate your work, Mr. Speaker, I also reviewed the past 
occasions when the House had to deal with budget leaks. Not to 
undermine the seriousness of any budget leak allegations, I am 
sure you will also agree that with the incidents of the past came 
also odd and unusual circumstances.
<P>
	You will remember a photographer having snapped a picture 
of the Minister of Finance at the time, Mr. Lalonde, reviewing 
budget documents, and that incident being the object of debate 
in the House and another question of privilege. I also remember, 
Mr. Speaker, and I know that you were in the House at the time, a 
colleague of mine who had one of his documents fall into the 
hands of the media before the formal announcement of the 
budget.
<P>
	In the past, when dealing with such rather isolated incidents, 
your predecessors ruled: ``There was some doubt whether the 
convention of budget secrecy falls within the area of privilege''. 
In fact, that is a quote which can be found in <I>Jurisprudence 
parlementaire de Beauchesne</I>, with which I am sure other 
members are familiar.
<P>
	I quickly realized, and I am sure you will too, Mr. Speaker, 
that the very nature of this revelation makes this case a 
precedent which stands by itself. Never have we had, as far as I 
know in any research that we have done, any situation where a 
specific member of Parliament has boldly admitted to having 
obtained privileged information relating to the budget before it 
was formally announced. Nor are there any precedents where a 
whole caucus of this place, according to the statement made by 
the hon. member for Guelph-Wellington, was actually 
informed in advance of the contents of the budget. I have not 
found any precedents in that regard.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, we have nowhere to turn but to you. We are not in 
the presence of a leak of a titbit of information to a controlled 
number of people for what has never been more than a very short 
period of time, like the situations we have faced in the past. 
Neither have we ever been in the presence of what I reasonably 
fear to be a  concerted effort on the part of someone to give a 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10331"> 10331 </A></B>
<P>
great deal of information to the largest body of members in the 
House, namely the Liberal caucus, at a day and time we can only 
yet still ignore.
<P>
	I will not get into all the questions that this situation brings 
up, and you will know that there are many dimensions to this 
question. They are all very grave. Most of the time they have 
called for the resignation of the Minister of Finance.
<P>
	I want to raise a very specific issue in regard to this principle. 
I am putting this question of privilege because I believe that the 
matter I am talking about poses a grave hindrance to my ability 
to accomplish my duties as a member of Parliament for the 
riding of Sherbrooke.
<P>
	It is greatly troubling to me, should such actions be found to 
be true, that the people of my riding and all Canadians would 
find disrepute and maybe even contempt for this place. In such 
circumstances I fail to see how any of us would be able to 
accomplish our work properly. That is surely a question of 
privilege for myself and for every person here.
<P>
	Even more sad is what this could mean for free speech. I 
respectfully ask that you consider in your ruling whether debate 
in this House can be truly free, frank and sincere if members are 
led to believe that the contents of the budget that are supposed to 
be secret for all, without exception, when in the end the truth is 
revealed to us that the members of the governing party were 
privy to a special complicity with the Minister of Finance.
<P>
<B>(1210) </B>
<P>
	The budget is at the heart of why we sit in Parliament. It is at 
the very heart of what this parliamentary institution is all about. 
We are here to vote on behalf of our constituents the moneys that 
allow us to live in a democracy and not pursuant to the whims of 
an all powerful despot.
<P>
	That is why the first Commons took away powers from the 
monarch and that is why this member is claiming back those 
privileges today. I respectfully ask that you consider this matter, 
Mr. Speaker, with great attention, urgency and severity.
<P>
	In conclusion, what we are facing today as a question of 
privilege is a situation where certain members of the House of 
Commons, namely the Liberal caucus, according to a public 
admission by the member for Guelph-Wellington, received 
privileged, secret information before budget day to the 
detriment of the members who sit on the opposite side of the 
House.
<P>
	Based on that fact, Mr. Speaker, I ask you to rule on this 
question of privilege.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Don Boudria (Glengarry-Prescott-Russell, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, there are two issues before the House. First, is this 
a legitimate question of privilege? Second, was there a breach of 
the secrecy of the budget?
<P>
	I will deal with these two issues in reverse order. We should 
all be reminded that the member who has just raised this 
question of privilege knows about cabinet secrecy. I would have 
hoped that in his remarks he could have borne that in mind a 
little more than he did. I am sorry that he failed in that regard.
<P>
	I wish to bring to members' attention the question of the 
secrecy of the budget. There was no breach in the secrecy of the 
budget. On reading the article yesterday in the newspaper, I 
telephoned the hon. member for Guelph-Wellington and spoke 
to her about her comments in the <I>Hill Times</I>.
<P>
	I asked her to put her response in writing and to send it to me 
so that I could share it very briefly with the House today. In the 
memorandum she sent to me, which I am perfectly willing to 
table with the Clerk later with the consent of the House if such 
were forthcoming, is the following:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>To: Don Boudria, Chief Government Whip<BR>
From Brenda Chamberlain, M.P.<BR>
Re: Our Conversation</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>In reference to your question, I was referring specifically to the caucus 
briefing which was held approximately one hour prior to the tabling by the 
President of the Treasury Board of measures to deal with downsizing in the 
federal public service.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	That downsizing document was tabled on February 21. It has 
nothing to do with the budget document. There may well have 
been issues tabled by the President of the Treasury Board that 
were later reflected in budget decisions.
<P>
	That may be so but it was not information that was given to 
Liberal members of Parliament and denied to anyone else. As a 
matter of fact, the tabling occurred at ten o'clock that morning. 
That is easily verifiable and I am sure all hon. members, 
including the member in question, were here that morning.
<P>
	The hon. member remembers well that the document was 
tabled. I read from the letter in question:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>This announcement took place one week before the budget and dealt with 
downsizing in the federal public service, which was part of the federal budget. If 
you have any further questions please do not hesitate to contact me.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	I will certainly table the letter if it is the wish of the House.
<P>
	The second issue is the following. Is it in fact a question of 
privilege? I wish to bring to members' attention <I>Beauchesne's</I> 
sixth edition, page 13, citation 31(5) which says:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Budget secrecy is a political convention, and if breached,</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10332"> 10332 </A></B>
<P>
	It was not as we have just identified:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>-the Minister may be attacked through a substantive motion, but not through 
a question of privilege.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>(1215 ) </B>
<P>
	That was ruled that way on April 19, 1983.
<P>
	In addition, Mr. Speaker, I wish to bring to your attention the 
following decision made on November 18, 1981 by the then 
Speaker, the late Madam Sauvé: ``Certainly the matter of budget 
secrecy is not dealt with through questions of privilege and there 
are very important precedents which I will recall to hon. 
members''. She then cited a whole number of cases where it has 
been ruled not to be an issue of privilege.
<P>
	In summary, there has not been a case of breach of budget 
secrecy and there is not a question of privilege now before the 
House.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier-Montcalm, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I would have preferred to speak before one of the 
government members replied, who would then have been able to 
respond to my comments as well.
<P>
	Like the hon. member for Sherbrooke, I wanted to quote what 
was said by the Prime Minister when he was in the opposition, 
on a similar question concerning a budget leak. I will not repeat 
the same quote, but I would like to quote what was said by the 
hon. member for Saint-Maurice in <I>Hansard</I> of July 24, 1975:	``The tradition of secrecy ensures that all Canadians will be kept at the same advantage or disadvantage with respect to any budgetary matter and that any announcement will be made first in
<P>
	When, as the hon. member for Sherbrooke pointed out, we 
look at what was said by the hon. member for 
Guelph-Wellington, the members of the Liberal caucus must 
have known how the budget would affect their respective ridings 
before it was brought down.
<P>
	I do not think a member of Parliament should have advance 
knowledge, before Parliament and members of this House, of 
the consequences of budget cuts for his or her own riding. This 
raises a number of questions for me, as a parliamentarian, and 
my constituents will have a few as well.
<P>
	If it is true that the Liberal caucus had advance knowledge of 
this budget, there must be Liberals who obtained some personal 
or political gain from that knowledge. They were able to prepare 
answers for their constituents before anyone else, and that is a 
personal gain.
<P>
	Furthermore, what assurances does Parliament have that the 
minister did not, following his presentation of the budget to the 
Liberal caucus, change parts of his budget in response to undue 
pressure from members of his party? How can we be sure? We 
cannot.
<P>
	I do not, and the official opposition does not think the hon. 
member's response to the comments by the hon. member for 
Shefford was satisfactory. Mr. Speaker, correct me if I am 
wrong, but in the past, when there were leaks or alleged leaks, 
the matter was usually referred to a committee of the House for 
clarification.
<P>
	Considering that the hon. member's reply fails to satisfy 
members on this side of the House, I would like the Chair to take 
the matter under advisement and refer it to a committee, for 
thorough clarification of an issue that goes to the very core of 
the Canadian parliamentary system. It is the government, 
through such practices, that is making trouble in this 
Parliament.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Elwin Hermanson (Kindersley-Lloydminster, Ref.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for Sherbrooke for 
bringing this matter to the attention of the House. It certainly is a 
very serious concern in light of citation 31 of <I>Beauchesne's</I>:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Budget secrecy is a political convention and if breached, the minister may be 
attacked through a substantive motion, but not through a question of privilege.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Certainly this is a very serious matter.
<P>
<B>(1220 ) </B>
<P>
	Representing the Reform Party in this House we ask questions 
of a general nature regarding rumours around the budget and we 
are told that the specifics or even generalities could not be dealt 
with in this House until the budget was tabled.
<P>
	It comes as some shock to me to find out that one caucus in 
this House was made privy to the details of the budget. 
According to this article in the paper, the question is whether 
there is too much secrecy surrounding the budget, not the 
documents that the hon. government whip was talking about. 
This is a very serious matter.
<P>
	Never at any time was our caucus approached by the 
departmental officials of finance or the minister on whether we 
would want a briefing on details that would affect even our 
individual ridings.
<P>
	Were I as a member of Parliament to have known that there 
would be a Crow buyout in the budget prior to its tabling, I could 
have communicated to people back in my riding of this matter. It 
affects the value of land. It affects the transactions between 
farmers who may have been actually selling their land at that 
time. It is a very serious matter with millions of dollars at stake.
<P>
	I am rather shocked and I want to assure this House that my 
caucus was not made privy to any of the details of the budget in 
any manner, particularly as it related to situations of cuts that 
would affect our riding.
<P>
	I add my concern and ask the Chair to deal in a very severe 
way with this important matter.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10333"> 10333 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Peter Milliken (Parliamentary Secretary to Leader of 
the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I will deal very directly with the allegation made by 
the hon. member for Kindersley-Lloydminster, supported by 
the hon. member for Sherbrooke. There was absolutely no 
question of a budget leak in this case.
<P>
	There is no evidence that has been adduced by the hon. 
member to support that, absolutely no evidence.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Charest:</B> Read the <I>Hill Times</I>.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Milliken:</B> I have read the <I>Hill Times</I> and I know the hon. 
member read the <I>Hill Times</I>. The answer that was given has been 
fully explained in a reply, given in writing, by the hon. member 
for Guelph-Wellington which was read by the chief 
government whip a few moments ago.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> I have listened 
attentively, as all members have on this issue. A question of 
privilege is an important matter and a serious matter for all 
parliamentarians. I would ask that we keep the discussion in the 
parliamentary fashion that we have thus far, that we might 
conclude this matter.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Milliken:</B> Mr. Speaker, certain hon. members of the 
opposition were invited to a briefing on the budget well in 
advance, a briefing that was not provided to government 
members. I had no idea what was in the budget until I walked 
into the House and heard the budget being delivered.
<P>
	That was not the case with certain members of the opposition 
who were invited to a briefing. That is standard practice and 
there is no suggestion in the answer that was given by the hon. 
member for Guelph-Wellington as explained in the 
memorandum that she has tabled here that there was anything 
but that procedure followed. She has explained that the 
procedure she was talking about when she answered the question 
dealt with events long before budget day.
<P>
	I refer once again to citation 31 of Beauchesne's which has 
already been quoted. I need not read it again. I want to remind 
the Chair that when we had a case of a budget leak with the hon. 
Michael Wilson during the last Parliament, a major leak in 
which the whole document got out, there was a question of 
privilege raised and debated for an entire day in this House on 
that very issue.
<P>
	There was never anything referred to a committee. The Chair 
never made a finding that there had been a breach of the 
privileges of the members of this House, even though there had 
been a complete leak of the budget. I think the hon. member for 
Sherbrooke was in the cabinet at that time.
<P>
	What I am saying is that there is no evidence of any leak here 
today in respect of the budget. If there were, according to the 
citation of Beauchesne's and in accordance with the practice 
followed in respect of Mr. Wilson's major leak, the whole thing 
went out. In light of the precedent established then, I submit 
there is nothing that the House should do to take note of this 
unless the  hon. member for Sherbrooke wishes to set down a 
motion condemning not the member for Guelph-Wellington 
but the Minister of Finance for allowing any information to get 
into her hands.
<P>
	In the face of the denial, I suggest such a motion is not 
supported by any evidence and it would be a waste of the time of 
this House, as is the question raised by the hon. member.
<P>
<B>(1225 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> The Chair will recognize 
the hon. member for Sherbrooke for a final comment, but I wish 
to apprise the House that I would hold that comment to a 
minimum amount of time. The Chair does not want to restart the 
whole debate. I have listened attentively. It is an important, 
serious matter. It will be dealt with as its seriousness requires.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Charest:</B> Mr. Speaker, thank you for your patience. I do 
not want to rehash past events. For the benefit of all members of 
the House, let us focus on what is really at issue here. I feel 
compelled to stress this because there is a very important 
distinction in the situation we are facing today relative to 
precedent.
<P>
	The precedents referred to are on the notion of confidentiality, 
budget secrecy as applied at large. We are facing a new situation 
today in which certain members of the House of Commons were 
informed beforehand according to this bold admission.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, that is the evidence you have. May I point out 
according to precedent that is the prima facie evidence you have 
before you today. That is the reason I think you will find here a 
question of privilege.
<P>
	The parliamentary secretary has hoisted himself on his own 
petard when he rises in this place to say there is no evidence and 
then goes on to explain the rebuttal of the evidence that happens 
to be in front of this House. To make that statement is so gross as 
to deny that this statement actually exists in a document that was 
distributed to the public at large.
<P>
	This is the last point I want to make. Let me read the quotation 
because it goes directly to the heart of this matter. The member 
for Guelph-Wellington said: ``I do not think so. There were 
some MPs who were told beforehand if major cuts were coming 
to programs in their ridings''.
<P>
	The last phrase goes to motive: ``They asked for that in caucus 
so they could prepare to answer questions''.
<P>
	My colleague from the Bloc Quebecois-
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Order. I think the Chair 
has heard all the arguments from the members who participated.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="10334"> 10334 </A></B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	As I said earlier, I realize that a question of privilege is a 
serious matter for all parliamentarians. As is customary, the 
Chair will certainly prefer to wait until the hon. member for 
Guelph-Wellington is present to hear what she has to say.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The Chair will certainly want to give an opportunity to the 
member for Guelph-Wellington to express her point of view 
more before making a definitive ruling.
<P>
	I want to thank the well experienced hon. member for 
Sherbrooke for raising this question of privilege and the chief 
government whip, the member for Berthier-Montcalm, the 
member for Kindersley-Lloydminster and the member for 
Kingston and the Islands for their participation.
<P>
	The matter raised by the hon. member for Sherbrooke, if 
founded, is more an issue of contempt that a question of 
privilege. That being said, the Chair will take the matter under 
advisement, review the hon. member's comments as well as all 
related parliamentary practice and precedents, and report back 
to the House as soon as possible.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Charest:</B> I rise on a point of order, Mr. Speaker. The hon. 
government whip kindly offered to table a document that the 
member for Guelph-Wellington apparently sent to him. I 
suggest to the House that there be unanimous consent so that 
document could be now tabled.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Is that agreed?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.

	<B>Mr. Peter Milliken (Parliamentary Secretary to Leader of 
the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, pursuant to Standing Order 36(8), I have the honour to 
table, in both official languages, the government's response to 
certain petitions.
<P>

<P>
<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="INTERNATIONALWOMEN'SDAY">INTERNATIONAL WOMEN'S DAY</A></H3>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Finestone (Secretary of State 
(Multiculturalism) (Status of Women), Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
next week, on March 8, women and men around the world will 
celebrate International Women's Day.
<P>
	This day was designated in honour of these early campaigns to 
improve working conditions for women. This day has become a 
global celebration of women's accomplishments and 
advancements. But it was born when women were struggling to 
achieve the very basics of equal rights.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	In the ensuing years women have made many important gains, 
overcoming many obstacles to achieve through merit their 
rightful place in the workforce. They have overcome 
professional barriers in virtually every field of human 
endeavour. They have overcome many stereotypes and have 
excelled in fields where doors were closed before such as 
medicine, law, politics, cultural industries, military, business 
and so on.
<P>
	Women have demonstrated conclusively that no task is 
beyond them, given fair and equitable access. Women have also 
achieved success in the business world. A recent study 
conducted by the Canadian Federation of Independent Business 
found that almost 40 per cent of small businesses are operated 
by women, up from 30 per cent in 1981.
<P>
	Women have steadily progressed in closing the wage gap. The 
average Canadian woman now makes 72 cents of what a man 
earns. More important, for university graduates the gap is gone. 
Young women and young men starting out in their careers with 
the same university education earn the same salary.
<P>
	Although women have made inroads into almost every 
profession they still face multiple challenges. Sexual 
harassment in the workplace continues to undermine and 
marginalize the position of women. Many still face obstacles to 
advancement: either the famous glass ceiling that stops 
women's progress at middle management levels or the corporate 
philosophy that is overly hostile to family considerations.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The recent Statistics Canada study on the wage gap was quite 
revealing on this point. While young women start off on an equal 
footing, wage-wise, when they graduate from university, they 
steadily lose ground as they get married and have children.
<P>
	Even most of the independent and ambitious women who go 
boldly into the business world hit the wall of sexual 
discrimination. And a study by the Canadian Federation of 
Independent Business revealed that 42 per cent of women 
entrepreneurs experience difficulty getting financing. This 
despite the fact that women entrepreneurs are generally more 
successful than men.
<P>
	We must address these issues. After all, women work for the 
same reasons men do-they want and they have to. Women's 
contributions to our economy, and to our society, are 
indisputable and indispensable.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	It is estimated that if all employed women were to leave the 
workforce, the number of low income families  in Canada would 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10335"> 10335 </A></B>
<P>
more than double. Given their key role, I think it is time society 
recognized their worth. We must pursue a fair distribution of 
unpaid work in the home where women still carry a 
disproportionate burden of work.
<P>
	We must persuade industries to develop family friendly 
workplaces to help root out sexual harassment and 
discriminatory practices. We must urge banks in particular and 
the financial community in general to recognize the 
achievements of women entrepreneurs and give them the fair 
and equitable consideration and support they deserve.
<P>
<B>(1235 ) </B>
<P>
	Women do not want a free ride. They want their fair share. I 
think that has become fairly obvious. Governments must 
continue to have a role in the drive for women's equality, even in 
the face of restrictive fiscal constraints.
<P>
	Violence against women, sexual harassment, inequalities and 
inequities in employment opportunities, the wage imbalance 
and gender discrimination must all be addressed. I am pleased 
the government is continuing to push forward on all these fronts.
<P>
	I congratulate my colleague, the Minister of Justice, for such 
initiatives as the sentencing reform bill, the firearms control 
legislation and his quick action to address the defence of 
extreme drunkenness.
<P>
	I congratulate my colleague, the Minister of Finance, for his 
budget commitment to remove barriers to the success of small 
businesses and to provide practical assistance to them to survive 
and grow. It is essential that small businesses have access to the 
financing they need to continue being Canada's number one 
creator of jobs.
<P>
	To this end the budget announced that the government would 
be working with the banks to develop meaningful performance 
benchmarks for small business financing, benchmarks that will 
be used to monitor future progress which will include women.
<P>
	We must also continue to support women in their family 
responsibilities. The new Canada social transfer announced in 
the budget offers the potential for a more flexible framework for 
child care funding. We need improvements in the accessibility 
of child care and in the quantity and quality of child care, public 
and private, in all regions of the land and based on choice in 
those areas.
<P>
	As my colleague, the Minister of Human Resources 
Development, begins his work with the provinces to develop 
shared principles for the transfer, I know he plans to focus on the 
needs of women and their families in general and on their 
requirements for child care in particular.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	I will also continue to work with my colleagues to ensure that 
government policies and programs are examined through a 
gender equality lens, so that their  impact on women is 
considered at every stage of the policy development process.
<P>
	A particular focus must be on the needs of women from 
different ethnocultural communities, aboriginal women, women 
with disabilities, and those living in rural or remote areas. We 
must continue to help them achieve their independence. These 
are all challenges that we must confront if we are going to 
achieve our ultimate goal of fairness and equality. This 
September fourth's United Nations World Conference on 
Women will be a unique forum for advancing women's equality. 
It will produce a global Platform for Action to accelerate 
progress towards equality.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	I look forward to working with the men and women of the 
world at this conference as we lay the groundwork for 
eliminating the barriers facing women around the globe. More 
important, to all my colleagues I say I look forward to coming 
home from the world conference, getting to work and 
collaborating with all our stakeholders at the regional, 
provincial, federal, private and public levels to implement the 
platform of action for Canada. Our society, and that includes all 
Canadian men and women, has a responsibility to begin laying 
the further groundwork for equality right now.
<P>
	The ongoing push for equality may be entering its most 
difficult phase. It will require that women stand up for 
themselves and boldly take the position that is rightfully theirs. 
It cannot be done by government alone. It cannot be done by one 
voice, by the voice of opposition on either side of the House.
<P>
	It will require them to be forceful and advance their views. It 
will require men to play their role as full partners in this 
adventure in growth and development. At the very least I would 
suggest that men acknowledge the current of history. They must 
recognize that from now on society will be that of equal partners 
because we have earned that right from the very start.
<P>
<B>(1240) </B>
<P>
	While some men may still resist this idea, I say to them that 
equality of the sexes is not only attainable but is desirable from 
all points of view and for all concerned. Is this not what we all 
want both for our sons and our daughters?
<P>
	We need to leave behind the battle of the sexes where 
women's gains are interpreted as men's losses. We have to 
accept that when women finally achieve equality everyone will 
be better off. We will all stand to gain.
<P>
	I close in reminding everyone that it is purely mathematical 
because when women who make up 52 per cent of our population 
are able to make a full contribution to society, 100 per cent of the 
population will benefit.
<P>

[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Christiane Gagnon (Québec, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, on 
March 8, women from Quebec, Canada and the world over will 
celebrate International Women's Day. Some of us will spend the 
day with our loved ones, our families, our colleagues from work 
or with the women's groups and organizations that we are 
involved in.
<P>
	Others will watch from the sidelines, wondering when 
governments are going to stand up and take action to improve 
the living conditions of women.
<P>
	The federal government would have us believe that it is 
attentive to women's needs. However, its daily actions speak 
louder than its words, speeches and policy statements. Let us 
call to mind just some of the Liberal government's acts.
<P>
	The Liberals' first budget, February 1994, announced 
unprecedented cuts to the unemployment insurance system. 
With one stroke of the pen, they took more than $5.5 billion out 
of the pockets of the unemployed over three years.
<P>
	The Liberals decided to take their unemployment insurance 
cuts in a totally new direction and to hit workers with unstable 
jobs, who cannot do without unemployment insurance. This hurt 
women most of all. Women have the dubious honour of holding 
the majority of unstable jobs.
<P>
	They reduced the benefit rate and access to them. They 
dramatically shortened the length of time that benefits can be 
claimed. They took drastic measures, asking the unemployment 
insurance fund to foot a disproportionate chunk of the deficit 
fighting measures.
<P>
	In his proposed social program reform, the Minister of Human 
Resources Development went as far as suggesting that 
eligibility for benefits be subject to a family income test. Since 
we know that women earn about 72 per cent of what men earn, 
we know very well who will be penalized by such a measure.
<P>
	We know that women earn less than their partners and that 
they often hold unstable jobs. Often, they are the ones who lose 
their jobs and go on UI. They are maintained in this dependent 
condition. What a move towards equality.
<P>
	Women immediately saw what the minister was driving at: 
women whose spouse's income is above a certain limit are 
disqualified in spite of the fact that they have been contributing 
to the UI fund. Attacking financial independence dearly won 
over the years, the government now wants to turn women into 
second-class citizens having to depend on their spouses for their 
every need.
<P>
	That is why so many women came forward when the Standing 
Committee on Human Resources Development held its hearings 
on the social reform package.
<P>
	They unanimously denounced the minister's proposal, 
forcing the committee to recommend that he not pursue this 
issue. We will see in the fall if the minister will choose to ignore 
the committee's recommendation and implement his proposal 
anyway. In that case, he can expect fierce opposition on the part 
of women and the Bloc Quebecois.
<P>
	Monday's budget also speaks volumes about what this 
government has in store for women.
<P>
<B>(1245) </B>
<P>
	The Liberals strike again. Monday's budget contains further 
cuts, cuts totalling at least $700 million in UI funding and $7 
billion in transfer payments to the provinces for welfare, health 
and education. In reality, what will be hacked is cash transfers to 
the provinces, with a 40 per cent cut in direct federal 
contributions to health, education and welfare.
<P>
	What will these blind cuts translate into in actual fact? Either 
cuts in health and education services or cuts in welfare, which 
will mean yet more women losing theirs jobs. Pension reform 
was also announced. Again, the government is contemplating 
tying old age pension benefit entitlement to family income. This 
government is certainly bent on subjugating women to their 
spouses. Poverty is obviously a sin for which this government 
wants to make women pay dearly.
<P>
	The number of public service positions was cut back. Again, 
women at the lower echelons will be penalized. Also, what is the 
use of reviewing the Employment Equity Act if it will not be 
enforced? Coloured, disabled and native women are highly 
likely to lose their jobs, as they are at a disadvantage to begin 
with and at the lower echelons. The 160,000 Canadian women 
on UI and 230,000 Canadian women on welfare were not smiling 
on Monday night, they were afraid. The 100,000 single parents 
who rely on social assistance shivered when they realized that 
they might be deprived of what little they have left.
<P>
	What about the election promise made by the Liberal Party 
regarding the creation of 150,000 new day-care spaces? The 
1994 budget provided that $120 million would be invested as 
early as this year. Today, all we know about that promise is that 
the Minister of Human Resources Development is discussing 
with the provinces. If these discussions are anything like the 
ones the minister is having regarding the social program reform, 
the Holy Spirit will have to step in to ensure that this promise is 
fulfilled.
<P>
	Another measure directly affecting women is the increase in 
the fees for adult immigrants who apply for permanent residence 
in Canada. This is more or less tantamount to an immigration tax 
of $975 for immigrants, a number of whom are women, in 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10337"> 10337 </A></B>
<P>
addition  to the basic amount of $500 which they must pay just to 
have their application looked at.
<P>
	This government wants to mark International Women's Day. 
Great! However, the government is hiding the plight of many 
women and the fact that it is not giving them any chance to 
improve their lot. Women must always fight to be treated with 
fairness and ensure that the organizations which represent them 
get meagre financial support. By the way, these organizations 
face new financial constraints, with government cuts of close to 
$1.5 million directly affecting them. How will they survive? The 
government could not care less.
<P>
	I should point out here the courage and the determination 
displayed by women's organizations in their daily struggle. We 
have to constantly urge this government to act rather than to 
make nice speeches, or at least to act according to its rhetoric. 
This government proclaims to be an international leader in the 
promotion of equality for women, but it should first ensure that 
Canadian women are not victims of backward measures because 
of its own decisions. This government seems to deny women's 
reality and we wonder about its strategy to ensure that women 
have better working conditions and can make gains in the 
workplace?
<P>
	Some positive measures are needed, including job-creation 
programs designed for all Canadians, not just 48 per cent of 
them, such as the totally inadequate infrastructure program.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Ms. Val Meredith (Surrey-White Rock-South Langley, 
Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is my pleasure to speak on International 
Women's Day. As the secretary of state mentioned in her 
remarks, this day was designated in honour of early campaigns 
to improve working conditions for women. I would like to take 
this opportunity to acknowledge the efforts of some of these 
women.
<P>
<B>(1250 ) </B>
<P>
	In December 1993 the Manitoba legislature granted Dr. 
Charlotte Ross a licence to practise medicine. What makes this 
event unusual is that Dr. Ross obtained her medical degree 118 
years earlier. Charlotte Whitehead Ross has links to this House. 
Her father, Joseph Whitehead, was the member of Parliament 
for the constituency of Huron North in the Confederation 
Parliament of 1867.
<P>
	After being refused entry to any medical school in Canada 
because she was a female, Charlotte Ross obtained her medical 
degree in Pennsylvania in 1875. She practised medicine in 
Quebec for five years and then in Whitemouth, Manitoba, for 
another 32 years. She was the first female physician in both 
provinces.
<P>
	The Manitoba legislature denied a request to license her in 
1887 but she continued to practise unlicensed until 1912, four 
years before her death. She was a true female pioneer, a woman 
who was forced to confront state sponsored chauvinism with no 
employment equity or human rights legislation to protect her. In 
the proud tradition of western pioneers, Dr. Ross did what so 
many other prairie settlers did when confronted by arcane 
government regulations, she ignored them. Charlotte Ross' 
defiance undoubtedly helped make it easier for other women to 
follow in her footsteps.
<P>
	In marking International Women's Day I am extremely proud 
to acknowledge the accomplishments of my great-grandmother.
<P>
	Another woman who deserves recognition for her 
contributions in pioneering a role for women in the workforce is 
a constituent of mine, a friend and a mentor, Mrs. Ivy Pat Dillon. 
Prior to World War II at a time when the only job most women 
could get was as a secretary or a clerk, Mrs. Dillon worked as a 
manager for a company in the fledgling aerospace industry. She 
did not get there because of any affirmative action program or 
government initiative. Pat Dillon was a success because of her 
talents and her abilities.
<P>
	Many other women of that era had to leave promising careers 
because they were expected to leave the workforce when they 
got married and raise a family. My mother was one of those 
women. She chose to give up a nursing career to raise a family of 
nine children. While she may not have climbed the corporate 
ladder, she made an enormous impact on her family, friends and 
community in many ways as a wife, a mother and a volunteer 
worker.
<P>
	These women all overcame the challenges of a society that 
was very different from today's. Was it discriminatory? Without 
question, but societies evolve. It is just that some things take 
longer than others.
<P>
	The greatest single factor in changing men's attitudes about 
equality in the workplace is not legislation. Rather, it is the fact 
that women have shown that they can compete with men on 
equal footing.
<P>
	As a female baby boomer I have experienced amazing 
changes in the attitudes of both men and women toward the 
concept of equality. My working career has taken me from a 
clerk typist earning $210 a month to being an owner-operator of 
a small business, to a senior government administrator, to a 
self-employed realtor and finally, to a parliamentarian. During 
my career I have faced a wide variety of attitudes from males 
and females.
<P>
	In her speech the secretary of state commented on the fact that 
women entrepreneurs experience difficulty getting financing. I 
can attest to that personally. When I approached a bank in 1980 
to get financing to expand my business, I was shocked to learn 
that it wanted my husband to co-sign for the loan. This was 
required despite the fact that my husband had nothing to do with 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10338"> 10338 </A></B>
<P>
the business, despite the fact that the business was successful,  
and despite the fact that I had been mayor of that community for 
three years.
<P>
	I am happy to report that this attitude has changed. Perhaps it 
is because women are now in management positions. The last 
two managers of my local Royal Bank have been female.
<P>
	However some attitudes have not changed. One of the most 
chauvinistic individuals I have ever encountered I met last 
month. This gentleman was of the opinion that no woman who is 
married should be permitted to work. He thought that married 
women who work are responsible for unemployment among 
men. Not surprisingly, he did not get a very sympathetic ear 
from me.
<P>
<B>(1255 ) </B>
<P>
	What I did find extremely sad about this attitude was the fact 
that the male who held these opinions was only 29 years old. He 
is a product of affirmative action mentality. He believes that as 
government has legislated more opportunities for women, it has 
been at his expense. He views himself as a victim of 
discrimination.
<P>
	We cannot legislate attitudes. For women to show their male 
colleagues that they belong, they have to prove they can 
compete with them on a level playing field.
<P>
	I am proud of the fact that to gain my seat in this House of 
Commons I proved I could compete on a level playing field. 
Unlike some of the female members from the government side, I 
was not appointed as a candidate. To secure the Reform Party 
nomination in my constituency, I ran against five male 
competitors. At a nomination meeting attended by over 600 
voting delegates, I won a first ballot victory. In the subsequent 
election, all other candidates from the major parties were males. 
Obviously, I won that election.
<P>
	There was no special consideration because I was a woman. I 
competed on a level playing field. That is the way it was 
supposed to be and that is the way it has got to be. If we want a 
society where men and women are viewed as equal partners, we 
cannot accomplish this by punishing young men of today for the 
sins of their grandfathers.
<P>
	I am pleased to see the statistics that women graduating from 
university today will earn the same salary as their male 
counterparts. It is a reality that these women will lose ground 
when they absence themselves from the workforce to have 
children. The logical way to address this problem is for these 
women and their spouses to draw equally upon their registered 
personal savings plan to make up the difference.
<P>
	The alternative would be for medical science to develop a way 
for men to share the joy of childbirth. However, even if science 
could develop the technology, it would not be of much use. I 
think all mothers would agree that men do not have the pain 
threshold to survive childbirth.
<P>
	In this celebration of International Women's Day, I share with 
the secretary of state the goal of true equality of the sexes. I just 
do not accept that legislation is the way to accomplish it. It gives 
the impression that women are incapable of obtaining equality 
solely based on their performance.
<P>
	Yes, women today will experience chauvinism and 
discrimination in their lives. But as one of my staffers says, a 
woman has to work twice as hard as a man to get half the credit. 
Fortunately, this is not particularly difficult. I believe it is a 
good sign on the road to equality to know that this quote comes 
from a male staffer.

ministerial statement, Government Orders will be extended by 
28 minutes.

	The House resumed consideration of the motion that Bill 
C-73, an act to provide borrowing authority for the fiscal year 
beginning on April 1, 1995, be read the second time and referred 
to a committee.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10341"> 10341 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> I want to remind the 
House that pursuant to Standing Order 74 we are now at the 
next stage of debate in which members will be entitled to a 
10-minute maximum intervention without question or 
comment.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Williams (St. Albert, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, Bill 
C-73 is the Borrowing Authority Act of 1995-96. Unfortunately 
it is becoming an annual event in the House of Commons that we 
debate the Borrowing Authority Act every year after the budget.
<P>
	Every year since the early 1970s we have had to introduce a 
borrowing authority in order for the government to carry out the 
intentions and the policies introduced by the Minister of Finance 
in his budget.
<P>
	During these last 30 years or more the borrowing authority 
has now increased our indebtedness up to $550-odd billion. We 
know unfortunately that we are going to be doing the same again 
next year as we increase the borrowing authority another 
$30-odd billion, $25 billion the subsequent year, and on and on.
<P>
	When will it stop? That is what we want to know. We have 
been asking questions in the House of the Minister of Finance, 
of the Prime Minister, of any member of the government who is 
prepared to give us a simple, straightforward answer. When can 
we expect this budget to be balanced?
<P>
<B>(1310 ) </B>
<P>
	In due time, the Liberals say. We have been waiting for over 
30 years. They created the problem in the 1970s which was 
carried on by the Tories in the 1980s. They are going to 
perpetuate it in the 1990s. How long before we stop having this 
annual rite of debating borrowing authority to dig ourselves 
further and further into the whole?
<P>
	One day foreign lenders and the international investment 
community will not worry about our borrowing authority. They 
will say that we are not going to get it. They are the ones who are 
going to say it is all over. It is not going to be this House of 
Parliament that is going to say we can go out and borrow more 
money. The international lenders will say that is it, we are cut 
off. Then what?
<P>
	The Reform Party has been trying to tell this House to balance 
the budget in three years. If foreign lenders tells us there is no 
borrowing authority we will be balancing this budget in three 
weeks. The Minister of Finance and the Prime Minister refuse to 
balance the budget or even tell us when we are going to stop this 
annual fiasco of more and more borrowing.
<P>
	We had the Minister of Finance table a budget the other day. 
This was the toughest budget we have had since the second 
world war. This was really going to cut the fat and get down to 
the real nitty-gritty of managing the nation's finances.
<P>
	The following day the President of the Treasury Board tabled 
the estimates and guess what, spending is going up again. Even 
though this was the toughest budget since the second world war 
spending is going up again. Let us stop fooling the Canadian 
people and let us get the job done. That is all we ask.
<P>
	The polls are now showing that half of Canadians took one 
quick look at the budget and felt it was not tough enough and not 
quick enough to balance the budget. They said for goodness 
sake, can this government get its act together and get the job 
done.
<P>
	All the Minister of Finance could do was increase taxes again; 
more taxes again on gasoline which affects every person in this 
country more or less, certainly almost every family. Remember 
that we have no inflation in this country any more. That means 
when the government increases taxes on gasoline it is going to 
affect every family because virtually every family has a car.
<P>
	This means that these families are going to have to squeeze 
their budget because the government is going to take more from 
them. They will have to do with less and adjust their budgets 
downward in order for them to accommodate the fact that the 
government is reaching further into their pockets because this 
government cannot do its job of living with less, doing with less 
and spending less. It has said that it needs more money and 
Canadians are going to give it whether or not they like it. That is 
the fault of the way in which this country has been managed for 
the last 30 or more years. The government could also tap the 
taxpayer for more money. That is not going to work any more.
<P>
	We could always tap the international investor for money but 
that is not going to work any more. The day is rapidly 
approaching when we are going to have to say that we have to 
live within our means. We must do it now or or we must do it as 
soon as we can to get the budget balanced and be able to return to 
some idea of prosperity in this country.
<P>
	There was another budget introduced about 10 days ago called 
the taxpayer's budget. The Reform Party said the job can be 
done in three years. Not only can the job be done in three years, 
it can be done without increasing taxes period.
<P>
	Let us compare the taxpayer's budget with the Liberal budget 
which spends more money liberally and leaves the taxpayer with 
less money. Remember I said the taxpayers were going to have 
less money. There is no inflation in this country. The taxpayer is 
now going to have less money because the government wants 
more. It will squeeze $9.9 billion out of the taxpayers this 
coming year. Next year it will be $1.3 billion. The subsequent 
year it will be $1.4 billion. These are the figures of the Minister 
of Finance, by the way.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10342"> 10342 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1315) </B>
<P>
	That will carry on ad infinitum until the date we can turn 
things around and say: ``Here is a tax decrease''. The extra $1.4 
billion a year will carry on every year. That should be compared 
to our taxpayers' budget which said the job could be done and 
there would be no more taxes.
<P>
	What about the deficit? According to the figures of the 
Minister of Finance, in the year 1995-96 the deficit will be 
$32.7 billion. The Liberal government has been around for 18 
months. The deficit was $40-odd billion when it arrived. After 
this draconian or toughest budget since the second world 
war-and this is the minister's second budget-he will only get 
it down to $32.7 billion.
<P>
	The following year it should be $24.3 billion and maybe $20 
billion after that. Who knows after that as the country goes into 
an economic decline, with UI and other costs like welfare going 
up and tax revenues going down? They know that will happen. 
My goodness, are there no business people over there? Tax 
revenues will go down, expenditures will go up and we will have 
lost control of the budget again.
<P>
	What about the taxpayers' budget? The figure in 1996-97 
would be $23 billion, not the $32.7 billion of the Liberal 
government. In the subsequent year we would be down to $11 
billion, while they would still be up at $24.3 billion. And, 
hallelujah, in the following year at the end of 1997-98 we would 
be down to zero, a balanced budget, and the Liberals would still 
be around $20 billion.
<P>
	If they are still over there in that year, we will still be over 
here talking about another borrowing authority. However if we 
are over there and they are over here they will not have to worry 
about borrowing authority speeches after all. We will not need 
them.
<P>
	What will the Liberal budget do for job creation? We already 
know that it is not too rosy in the public sector. There will be 
45,000 less jobs. In the private sector there is more debt and less 
jobs. That is fairly simple. We know that already. Whereas in our 
budget we acknowledge there will be a negative impact on the 
public sector because we will have to do what those folks are 
doing because we will have to fix the problems you created.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> I would ask the hon. 
member to direct his comments to the Chair. I feel left out again.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Williams:</B> Mr. Speaker, I would not want you to be left 
out. I apologize. If the Liberal government remains over there it 
will have its work cut out. Jobs will be denied because of the fact 
that debt will still be mounting.
<P>
	On it goes. We produced a 58-page document, almost as big 
as the one the Liberals produced with all the masses of the public 
service, statistics and budget analysis right across the country as 
they spent millions of dollars. What did it all matter? We now 
find out that the big  consultation before the budget was at the 
Liberal caucus just before the budget was brought down. 
Perhaps that was the big consultation that influenced the 
Minister of Finance. All this consultation across the country was 
for show.
<P>
	A borrowing authority as an annual event has to stop. That is 
what we are saying. We cannot afford any more. Therefore let us 
make a commitment or let us make a real resolution in the House 
that we may have this one and perhaps two more debates on 
borrowing authority and no more.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Andy Mitchell (Parry Sound-Muskoka, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I appreciate having the opportunity to talk about the 
budget. I would like to start by congratulating the Minister of 
Finance.
<P>
	The Minister of Finance has put forward a responsible, well 
developed and, something members opposite have a hard time 
with, fair budget.
<P>
<B>(1320 ) </B>
<P>
	It is a fair budget, a responsible budget and a good budget 
because the government recognizes that it has a dual 
responsibility when dealing with Canadian affairs. It recognizes 
that it has a fiscal responsibility. That is why the budget is 
prudent. It recognizes that we operate in a businesslike way but 
recognizes that we are not a business. It recognizes that we need 
to get full value for each of the dollars we spend.
<P>
	In addition, the government recognizes that it has a social 
responsibility and that certain things are done in government not 
just to earn a profit but because they are the right things to do. 
We do them because we recognize as a government that we have 
responsibilities and obligations to individual Canadians. We 
intend as a government to adhere both to our fiscal 
responsibility and to our social responsibility.
<P>
	I do not think there is any question in terms of fiscal matters 
that our responsibility has been carried out and carried out well. 
For the first time in almost a generation a Minister of Finance 
established a deficit target last year. Not only did he hit that 
target. He did far better than what he said he would be able to do.
<P>
	Second, the minister set a medium term objective of 3 per cent 
of GDP in the next two years. He set out a strategy that will see 
us do that. It is a clear and concise strategy. It is an achievable 
plan that will see our deficit reduced to 3 per cent of GDP.
<P>
	Despite what members opposite might say, this is not a smoke 
and mirrors budget. These are real cuts. This is not what 
happened in the past where the talk of reduction was simply that 
we would spend a little less than the increase we had planned. 
These are real cuts in actual spending and they are being done 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10343"> 10343 </A></B>
<P>
with no personal income tax increases. They are real reductions, 
despite what the member opposite said.
<P>
	In the first year we will cut expenditures by $3.9 billion. In the 
following year, 1996-97, it will be $5.9 billion. In the third year 
of the plan it will be $7.2 billion. That is a decline in a 
three-year period of almost 19 per cent. It is the largest decrease 
in government since we demobilized after the second world war.
<P>
	The minister in establishing the budget did two very 
important and prudent things. First, his estimations in terms of 
growth and interest rates were very prudent. In terms of growth 
he projected a smaller amount than what the average private 
sector suggested. In terms of interest rates, both short and long 
term, he set his projections higher than what the private sector 
was suggesting. He built in a cushion to ensure that the budget is 
fiscally responsible.
<P>
	Second, he set up contingencies in the next two years: a 
contingency of $2.5 billion in the first year and a contingency of 
$3 billion in the second year. He has made what I believe is an 
important commitment, that if he does not need the 
contingencies to achieve his deficit reduction targets the 
moneys will be used to further reduce the debt.
<P>
	The minister has gone about setting a budget like we do when 
we set our household budgets or our small business budgets. He 
has taken what was in front of him, set out a reasonable plan over 
a reasonable period of time, built in contingencies and come up 
with a strong, workable plan.
<P>
	In addition to the fiscal responsibility the minister has 
recognized the social responsibility. Although we are to cut 
some funding from social programs, it is important to remember 
than when the budget is fully implemented we will be spending 
as a government more than $50 billion on the social safety net of 
the country, more than $50 billion to protect the men, women 
and children of Canada. That is an important principle which the 
minister understands. It is an important Liberal principle and I 
am proud to sit with a government that recognizes it.
<P>
	It is a budget that is fair and equitable because it asks all 
segments of Canadian society to participate in the exercise. It 
does not ask one part of Canadian society to carry an unfair 
burden. It is not suggesting that some segments should not have 
to participate at all. That is why the budget covers a wide range 
of areas.
<P>
<B>(1325) </B>
<P>
	Large corporations have been asked to participate by 
providing some increased revenue. They have been asked to 
participate by a decrease in subsidies going to businesses.
<P>
	The federal government is putting its own house in order first. 
It is going to cut its expenditures by 19 per cent. That is the 
largest part of the cut.
<P>
	Individuals have been asked to participate as well, as they 
should, not through increased income tax, not through taxing 
RRSPs, not through taxing dental and health benefits, but 
through a modest tax on gasoline.
<P>
	He asked the provinces to participate as well. He asked them 
for a 4.4 per cent participation which is only half as much as 
what the federal government is doing itself. I think that is 
important. It is absolutely ludicrous when provincial premiers 
suggest that we as a government should totally exempt them 
from participating in the deficit reduction exercise.
<P>
	Finally, as members of the finance committee which did a 
prebudget exercise unlike what the member opposite suggested, 
we adhered to the three principles that came out of the 
committee meetings. The first was that expenditures should be 
the largest portion of the action, not taxes. We did that with a 7:1 
ratio. Second, we had to get our own house in order first. We did 
that with a $29 billion three-year cut in our own expenditures or 
a cut of 19 per cent. The third was that we would be fair and 
equitable. We did that by having all segments of Canadian 
society participate.
<P>
	In conclusion, let me say unequivocally that I support the 
budget. I support the Minister of Finance. I support the 
government. We have achieved the dual objectives of fiscal 
responsibility and social responsibility. I am proud of what the 
minister has accomplished.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Pauline Picard (Drummond, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
thank you for this opportunity to comment on the budget tabled 
by the Minister of Finance last Monday. Beyond the rhetoric and 
eloquent speeches, a cold hard look at this budget uncovers the 
extent and consequences of the federal system's inability to 
reform and to respond adequately to the aspirations of 
Quebecers and of Canadians.
<P>
	Author Jean-François Lisée recently published two works 
whose titles are evocative of the con job the government has just 
pulled, the havoc it has wrought, and they are in the back of my 
mind as I analyse the unseen side of the finance minister's 
budget, the hidden aspects of its condescending rhetoric which 
does not tell us the truth about what is really at stake.
<P>
	First of all, this budget misleads Canadians when it purports 
to be hard on everyone. This is not the case. It attacks the 
neediest members of our society, who will bear the brunt of the 
major cuts, and leaves undisturbed the large corporations and 
banks. Large corporations will still be able to escape the tax 
man, and banks will be taxed very minimally, compared to their 
astronomical profits.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10344"> 10344 </A></B>
<P>
	Second, this budget misleads Quebec and the provinces, 
when it claims to be courageously attacking the federal deficit, 
when in fact it is offloading the greater part of that deficit onto 
the backs of the provinces. Seven billion dollars in expenses 
have been transferred in this manner, but no power went with 
it.
<P>
	Third, this budget is destructive of social programs, and in 
particular health programs. The official speech conceals the 
truth of the matter, when it implies that the principles 
underlying the Canada Health Act are not affected and remain 
unchanged. Some treat when the federal government orders the 
meal for Quebec and the provinces and leaves them to pay the 
tab.
<P>
	Fourth, and this is the most disturbing, this budget flies in the 
face of the government's claim to be embracing flexible 
federalism, the latest version of its favourite theme. There is no 
flexibility in this budget, other than that demonstrated by the 
Minister of Finance when he sidesteps his responsibilities and 
dumps them onto the provinces. Everything else remains 
unchanged. National standards, spending authority, overlapping 
of departments in areas of provincial jurisdiction.
<P>
<B>(1330) </B>
<P>
	With this new budget, the government is once again waging an 
all out war on the least fortunate members of society. For the 
second year in a row, the unemployed and the small wage 
earners are bearing the brunt of the cuts, while major 
corporations and banking institutions go nearly unscathed.
<P>
	The finance minister announced new cuts to the 
unemployment insurance program, while he will only 
temporarily increase capital tax for major banks. He will beg 
banking institutions for a paltry $100 million, while, in 1995, 
the Royal Bank alone recorded profits of around $1.2 billion.
<P>
	Moreover, this government refused to listen to all those, 
including the Bloc and the Conseil du patronat du Québec, who 
were asking for the elimination of all business subsidies. The 
finance minister chose instead to cut $300 million from social 
housing instead of using the $1.5 billion still earmarked for 
business subsidies.
<P>
	Is this the federal approach?
<P>
	Major corporations and banks can rest easy. The finance 
minister clearly indicated in his budget that, once again, the 
unemployed and the poor will be stuck with paying the bill for 
the inefficiencies of this unworkable federalism; at the same 
time, he maintains, until the end of the century, the privileges 
enjoyed only by the rich through family trusts.
<P>
	The budget is very clear: within the next two years, the federal 
government will deprive the provinces of 7 billion dollars worth 
of transfer payments for health care, post-secondary education 
and the Canada Assistance Plan for which provinces will have to 
pay out of their own pocket. This is what we call offloading your 
deficit onto the provinces. Indeed, the federal government  
should put its financial house in order, but not at the provinces' 
expense.
<P>
	Quebec is being loaded down with a big chunk of Canada's 
deficit, while, for its part, the federal government keeps 
interfering in Quebec's jurisdictions. Quebecers will keep on 
paying the cost of all the duplication inherent to the federal 
system. We will still have two health departments, two human 
resources development departments, and two environment 
departments, to name only a few.
<P>
	This is the new Canada promised by this bad budget. This 
so-called decentralizing budget is, in fact, nothing but an empty 
shell, since the federal government will continue to intervene in 
areas of jurisdiction belonging to the provinces.
<P>
	The irony in all this masquerade is that, while cutting by 27.1 
per cent the transfers to Quebec, the federal government 
continues to impose to the provinces the same national 
standards, in particular those coming under the Canada Health 
Act.
<P>
	In 1979, when that bill was proclaimed, the federal 
government was paying 45 per cent of health and 
post-secondary education costs. Since transfer payments where 
frozen in 1992, the federal share has been reduced to 29 per cent. 
With the new measures contained in this budget, the share of the 
federal government will be down to a new record low of 15 per 
cent.
<P>
	How can the minister have the nerve to want to impose 
national standards when the federal share of health care has 
dropped 35 per cent since 1979, despite a substantial increase in 
health care costs, and will decrease again more than 55 per cent 
with this new budget?
<P>
	It seems to me that the federal government will have no choice 
but to leave to the provinces complete management of the health 
care system.
<P>
	I said earlier that this budget will mean the floundering of our 
social progams as we know them today. We all know that Quebec 
and the provinces are faced with very steep increases in the costs 
of health care. This is mainly due to the following factors: aging 
of our population, new and more expensive medical 
technologies and a substantial increase in the cost of drugs.
<P>
	Just like previous budgets when the government froze all 
transfer payments, in this budget, the government announces 
massive cuts to transfers to Quebec and the other provinces of 
funds earmarked for health.
<P>
<B>(1335) </B>
<P>
	It does not matter if these transfers are combined with others 
to create one single envelope, the result will be the same: there 
will be less money for health care and the government will be 
jeopardizing the fundamental principles of our health care 
system.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10345"> 10345 </A></B>
<P>
	The finance minister should have been honest and open with 
the Quebec and the Canadian people. He should tell them that 
these cuts to the provinces mean the end of our health care 
system as we know it now, because that is the real issue here.
<P>
	Look, for example, at the recent statements made by the prime 
minister and the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs, who 
contradicted the Minister of Finance who said, and I quote: 
``The conditions of the Canada Health Act will be maintained. 
For our government, those are fundamental.''
<P>
	How can the Minister of Finance still imagine and argue that 
Quebec and the other provinces will be able to continue to 
deliver the same quality of health care services to the people? 
How can Quebec and the other provinces implement the five 
principles of the Canada Health Act imposed by Ottawa when 
the Minister of Finance passes on to them billions of dollars of 
deficit by means of cuts to the social programs?
<P>
	The Minister of Finance should have shown courage and tell 
upfront to his fellow Canadians: ``Unfortunately, because of the 
errors we have made, mainly in the Chrétien and Lalonde 
budgets, we can no longer afford our health care system as we 
know it now''.
<P>
	Instead of assuming his responsibilities, the finance minister 
is trying to get out from under them. The government shuns its 
responsibilities when it passes its deficit on to Quebec and the 
other provinces. This government is misleading the Canadian 
people by not telling them that the health care program is 
doomed because of this budget.
<P>
	Let me conclude by saying that this budget is misleading, 
since it does not mention the cuts that are still to come. It widens 
the gap between the rich and the poor in our society and puts an 
end to a good number of features of our social programs.
<P>
	Canadians must know that. Quebecers in particular must be 
aware of it before they make a final judgment on the federal 
regime, which obviously fails to solve its own problems and, 
even more, to renew itself according to the expectations of 
Quebecers.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Lyle Vanclief (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Agriculture and Agri-food, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is certainly a 
pleasure to comment for a few minutes this afternoon on the 
budget that was presented this week.
<P>
	I want to start by passing on the comments that I made to 
members of the press in my riding when I spoke to them on 
budget night. When asked what my reaction was I said it was one 
of excitement because this is not the first budget that I have 
seen. I certainly have not been present for the considerable 
number that some members in the House have, but this is the 
seventh one.
<P>
	This budget fulfils the expectations and hopes for the majority 
of Canadians. I have been telling my constituents for the last 
number of weeks and months as they offered suggestions to the 
government that our challenge was to meet the requirements out 
there with fair and equal treatment for everyone along with 
being effective. We met those criteria.
<P>
	We know that two situations in Canada today are clouding the 
issue. One is the uncertainty of the future of the province of 
Quebec. I am pleased to say that the majority of the people in 
Prince Edward-Hastings say: ``My Canada includes Quebec''.
<P>
	Fortunately for all of us, more and more Quebecers are 
realizing that every day and they have every reason to. More and 
more Quebecers are realizing that a strong central government is 
what is good for this country and what is good for everybody. All 
of us will be better off as Canadians and as human beings if we 
are part of the family we call Canada.
<P>
	The finance minister pointed to the second cloud which is the 
debt and the deficit. I do not have to remind anyone of the size of 
that: over $500 billion in debt, a $42 billion deficit a year ago, 
some $80,000 a minute to cover the interest on it, and I could go 
on.
<P>
	I need to say no more in emphasizing the fact that the 
government has a tremendous challenge. Our country has a 
tremendous challenge. This challenge can only be successfully 
met with competence, compassion, reform and hope. We made a 
great step toward that on Monday night with the budget.
<P>
	We have been honest with Canadians by saying that we too 
know there is a lot more yet to do. What we did on Monday night 
was done by pushing the needed measures as close to the edge as 
possible and doing it without playing havoc with the economy 
which is growing at a faster rate than just about any other 
country in the world. Certainly it is the fastest of any of the G-7 
countries. Things are on the move. Perhaps they are not moving 
as fast as we would like but they are certainly on the move and 
they are going in the right direction.
<P>
	We knew we were being watched. We were being watched by 
the international community, by the money markets, the 
domestic financial institutions, the domestic money markets, 
the business community. We were being watched by everyone, 
including all Canadians.
<P>
	We did what was needed but we did not enjoy it. I can say we 
did not want to do it because it is not nice to say that we are going 
to reduce employment, that we are going to have to make some 
changes. When I say we did not want to do it, it was not because 
it did not need to be done. It did need to be done. As the Prime 
Minister has said so clearly and so often, we did it because it was 
necessary.
<P>
	It reminds me of some advice I gave to the finance minister 
leading up to the budget and the slogan used by the prominent 
company, Nike: Just do it. And we did it. We did it by making $7 
worth of cuts for every $1  increase in revenue. We did it after 
<P>

<B><A NAME="10346"> 10346 </A></B>
<P>
having listened to Canadians in the greatest consultation process 
that has ever taken place leading up to a budget.
<P>
	We did it without increasing income tax. We did it without 
taxing dental and employer provided medical plans. We did it 
without making many changes that would affect to any great 
extent registered retirement savings plan contributions.
<P>
	We did it without taxing lotteries. Many people thought we 
would. A number of people said not to tax lottery winnings. I 
told them that if they were to win a million dollars and had to pay 
tax on it but did not want to, I knew some people who would take 
their ticket for them.
<P>
	We did it without changing the capital gains tax for small 
business and farmers. In so doing we again recognized the 
importance of small business and farmers in the Canadian 
economy.
<P>
	Yes, we did it on the revenue side by increasing the tax on 
gasoline 1.5 cents a litre. I think that is fair and equitable from 
coast to coast. We also did it by cutting the size of government. 
Yes, I recognize that people in Prince Edward-Hastings riding 
in the civil service will have to contribute and will be 
contributing.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Order. It being 1.43 p.m., 
pursuant to Standing Order 73, it is my duty to interrupt the 
proceedings and to put forthwith every question necessary to 
dispose of the bill now before the House.
<P>
	Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the motion?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> No.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> All those in favour of the 
motion will please say yea.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Yea.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> On division.
<P>
	(Motion agreed to, bill read the second time and referred to a 
committee.)
<P>
<B>(1345 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Boudria:</B> Mr. Speaker, because of the ministerial 
statement we should be starting private members' hour in 15 
minutes. However, if members are agreeable and with 
unanimous consent perhaps we could start private members' 
hour immediately.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> The Chair might be of 
some help if the chief government whip would approach the 
Chair for a moment.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Boudria:</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. Pursuant 
to what we discussed briefly earlier, if you were now to seek 
unanimous consent you would find that instead of suspending 
the House for 15 minutes, which is what we would normally do 
at this time, we could perhaps start immediately with private 
members' hour, as no other bill is before the House.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> The House has heard the 
suggestion of the chief government whip. Is there unanimous 
consent?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> It being 1.50 p.m., the 
House will now proceed to the consideration of Private 
Members' Business as listed on today's Order Paper.

	<B>Mr. Jim Silye (Calgary Centre, Ref.)</B> moved that Bill 
C-247, an act to amend the Income Tax Act (child care 
expenses), be read the second time and referred to a committee.
<P>
	He said: Mr. Speaker, I rise today to present my private 
member's bill C-247, an act to amend the Income Tax Act on 
child care Expenses.
<P>
	This bill would give all parents a tax deduction of $5,000 or 
$3,000 per child to assist them with the increasing costs of 
raising their children while at the same time eliminate the 
current tax discrimination against stay at home parents and 
those who do not use day care. All parents would have the same 
deduction available to them regardless of their incomes, status, 
marital status, labour force, or chosen method of child care.
<P>
<B>(1350) </B>
<P>
	I would like to read an excerpt from a discussion paper that 
was sent to me, not by a special interest group but by Cheryl 
Stewart and Sandra Evans of Ontario. It reads:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>We are Canadian mothers who work at home full time nurturing our children.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>We both had successful careers in the paid workforce prior to choosing to stay 
home and raise our children.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>We are concerned about the direction that this process is taking toward 
institutionalized child care and how it is virtually ignoring other forms of 
care-particularly those who choose to care for their own children.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	According to Statistics Canada, 68.5 per cent of women in 
two-parent families with children under three, and 62 per cent 
with children between the ages of three and five, remain at home 
on a full time basis or work part time. When all women in 
two-parent families with children under 16 years of age are 
taken into consideration, 57.6 per cent have decided to either 
remain at home full time or work part time.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10347"> 10347 </A></B>
<P>
	These figures show us there is a large percentage of women 
who have made their choice to stay at home with their children. 
Despite this fact, they are not entitled to the same tax treatment 
as those who use day care.
<P>
	As a direct result, our courts are filled with cases of 
individuals and families alike who feel that the Canadian 
income tax system discriminates against them. Calgarians, Jim 
and Laurie Boland, for example, were told in Federal Court that 
a parent that chooses to be at home with a child is not entitled to 
the same privileges as those who pay for child care.
<P>
	The judge ruled that the Income Tax Act admittedly denies the 
Bolands equal benefit under the law but because stay at home 
parents are not ``a discrete and insular minority'' they are not 
protected by the charter of rights and freedoms.
<P>
	This is just one example of people fighting a system that does 
not reflect the realities of society. Currently provisions in the 
Income Tax Act make the child care expense deduction only to 
families who pay institutions to look after their children. The 
deduction can only be claimed by the lower income spouse of a 
married couple, which makes it useless when one parent stays 
home to raise the children.
<P>
	In other words, if you put your child in receipted day care, the 
government will reward you, but if you opt for a different 
arrangement like most Canadians do, you are on your own. It is 
just a matter of time before the courts overrule this decision. 
Maybe it is time for the legislatures in Canada to set the agenda 
as opposed to responding to court decisions.
<P>
	You only have to look at how the Thibaudeau decision on 
child support payments sent the Minister of Justice scrambling. 
The fact is that this legal discrimination must and should stop. 
As the dynamics of the family continue to change, parents 
should be free to choose the method of child care that best suits 
their situation, as opposed to having government reward one 
choice over another. It is the choice that I am trying to 
emphasize today. Flexibility and freedom of choice should be 
the key elements of our approach to child care.
<P>
	It is obvious that people cannot afford non-subsidized day 
care and have limited choices other than to stand in line and wait 
for a spot in a subsidized program. Why not give them the 
financial means and the options to choose other forms of child 
care? Provide all families with the $5,000 tax deduction, leave 
the money in their hands and let them choose whether to stay at 
home; unregulated day care, nannies, relatives or friends are the 
best options for them.
<P>
	Interest groups all talk about the need for more flexible child 
care. Here we have true flexibility. Leave more money at the 
source and stop financially encouraging families to choose 
outside receipted child care.
<P>
	Let us look at this from a different perspective, a different 
angle. Currently there are 360,000 child care spaces in Canada, 
150,000 of which are subsidized for low income families. Is the 
answer more spaces as the Liberal government thinks, or is it 
more choices as I think?
<P>
	The purpose of my bill is to amend the Income Tax Act to 
allow the deduction of a fixed amount of $5,000 or $3,000 as 
child care expenses, depending on the age of the child, 
regardless of the income of the parent and the amount of child 
care expenses actually incurred. Quite simply, the bill provides 
for a straightforward income tax deduction per child, up to age 
14, to any taxpaying parent regardless of the method of child 
care chosen.
<P>
<B>(1355) </B>
<P>
	Therefore, Bill C-247 is based on three fundamental 
principles: funding the family, not the institution; giving 
freedom of choice to parents for their preferred method of child 
care; addressing the shortcomings of our current system and the 
subsequent increases in the financial burden on Canadian 
families.
<P>
	The fact is that Canadian families have been taxed to the hilt. 
With Bill C-247 parents would be free to choose how to best 
spend their money. If they choose to send the kids to day care, so 
be it. If they choose to have one parent stay at home to raise the 
children, let us give them the freedom to make that decision. My 
main concern is to treat everyone equally. Leave money in the 
hands of the people who earn it and need it, and let them make 
their own choices on how to run their lives.
<P>
	The vast majority of federal funding for children's programs 
in Canada is provided in the following ways. There are actually 
six different mechanisms by which people get assistance.
<P>
	The child tax benefit went into effect in January 1993, 
replacing the former family allowance program as well as the 
refundable and non-refundable child tax credit. This program 
delivered benefits of $5.2 billion between July 1993 and June 
1994.
<P>
	The Canada assistance plan, which comes under the human 
resources department, shares in the cost with the provinces and 
territories of providing social assistance and welfare services. 
This program delivered benefits totalling $2.8 billion in the year 
1993-94.
<P>
	The third mechanism is the child care expense deduction. It is 
a tax measure intended to assist parents with the cost of 
receipted child care. This program cost Revenue Canada just 
over $330 million in fiscal 1993-94.
<P>
	The fourth mechanism is the equivalent to married tax credit, 
which is a non-refundable tax credit available to single parents 
to help ease the burden of raising children alone. Only one child 
can be claimed. This program cost the federal government just 
over $565 million in fiscal 1993-94.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10348"> 10348 </A></B>
<P>
	The fifth mechanism is the goods and services tax credit of 
$213 million per year.
<P>
	In addition, the Liberal government in the red book promised 
to spend an additional $1.4 billion with the provinces to create 
150,000 regulated, non-parental child care spaces over the next 
three years. This is apparently on hold with the latest budget. 
Hopefully that will be confirmed later on today.
<P>
	Currently in Ontario there are about 7,000 vacant child care 
spaces in non-subsidized day care, while 25,000 people are on 
waiting lists for subsidized day care. If we put stay at home 
parents or any families that do not use outside receipted day care 
on the same financial footing as those who do, then some of 
those child care spaces would be freed up as parents choose 
different options and the list of 25,000 would shrink.
<P>
	The government could then take part of the revenue that it was 
going to spend on more spaces and target it specifically at the 
poor families in the form of subsidies and benefits. That would 
be a true social program for the truly needy, a welfare assistance 
program that helps people who are in need, if it is a 
demonstrable need.
<P>
	We are considering spending billions of dollars to apply a 
national program and national standards to families that are 
different in composition, situation, work and educational 
schedules, income, age, cultural and linguistic profiles, urban 
and rural settings, and the list goes on. The only common 
denominator I can see is that these people all have children.
<P>
	Does it not therefore make sense to give families the 
economic tools to make their own decisions depending on their 
own specific needs? Let us consolidate the list of programs 
which I outlined and adopt Bill C-247 for all wage earners and 
introduce a social welfare package that, I submit, would be of 
significantly less cost.
<P>
<B>(1400) </B>
<P>
	If one totals the programs I have mentioned, it is over$8 billion. We can certainly have a two-level plan and make the 
cost for the social and welfare programs a lot less.
<P>
	Using Revenue Canada statistics, using the government's 
main statistics bank, for taxes filed in 1993 it is estimated that 
Bill C-247 would cost the federal government $3.6 billion in tax 
revenue losses. One can call them tax expenditures.
<P>
	The government may come up with another set of figures that 
says $6 billion but maybe the cost is $4 billion or $5 billion. 
What is a billion these days? People seem to throw it around like 
it does not matter.
<P>
	The question that begs to be asked, however, is where that 
money comes from. Where does the money come from for this 
new program that everybody gets a deduction? The answer, 92 
per cent of my bill is related to families with incomes above 
$30,000.
<P>
	Simply put, one needs income to claim a tax deduction. Last 
year the $5.2 billion child tax benefit which was designed to 
help lower income families paid out $2.1 billion to families with 
incomes in excess of $30,000.
<P>
	If members narrow the targeting of the child tax benefit to 
those making $30,000 and under, that would free up $2.1 billion 
to pay for Bill C-247. Do not forget I said there is a two-tier 
system, over $30,000 and under $30,000. We have just freed up 
$2.1 billion to help cover the costs of Bill C-247.
<P>
	Where does the additional $1.5 billion come from? If I stick to 
my $3.6 billion in costs, which I could round up to $4 billion if 
the government would like me to, a portion can come from the 
$1.4 billion. We have found $2.1 billion now. A portion can 
come from the $1.4 billion that will be spent on subsidized day 
care, the future spending they will not have to spend. Leave the 
current day care facilities in place and reduce that list of 25,000 
people who are waiting. They can go to the ones that are empty 
in the private day care centres or they might choose other forms 
of day care.
<P>
	Eliminate the need for the equivalent to married tax credit, the 
$565 million, because quite simply with Bill C-247 single 
parents would be left with more of their own money and be able 
to claim more than one child as is currently the case.
<P>
	They would not need this assistance because as the recipients 
of child care payments, they would have the offsetting deduction 
to eliminate the tax payment. There is another $560 million.
<P>
	The final costs would be made up through the elimination of 
handling charges on the money that is redistributed by Ottawa 
through tax credits. The beauty of a deduction is that the money 
stays at the source, leaving more disposable income for people, 
lower processing fees for Ottawa and greater netbacks for 
everybody.
<P>
	I believe that the power of the lobby for day care is overly 
evident in governmental policy to date. In his social reforms 
discussion paper, the Minister of Human Resources 
Development addressed day care spaces and flexible work 
arrangements for parents but said nothing about current taxation 
inequities, charter challenges or, more specifically, stay at home 
parenting.
<P>
	One of the biggest single problems that this government has is 
that it always fails to identify the right problem, just like the 
deficit and the debt. It wants to lower the deficit. However that is 
just a contributing factor to the debt. It should be attacking the 
debt and how to solve that problem.
<P>
	Such a move would have been too racy, the Minister of Human 
Resources Development said on a Calgary talk show, to consider 
a proposal of deductions for children. I fail to see what is so racy 
about a tax break for people who work just as hard in the home, 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10349"> 10349 </A></B>
<P>
but it is obvious that someone with a different view has the 
minister's attention.
<P>
	The red book deals once again with the day care spaces but not 
with other significant issues affecting families in the 1990s. For 
example, it specifically addressed a child care system that 
enables parents to participate fully in the economic life of the 
country. That is on page 35, for members opposite.
<P>
	In other words, do not stay at home, work. What about people 
who choose to directly participate in the lives of their child? Is 
this not valuable? When the Tories were in power they proposed 
Bill C-144 which basically stated that parents of children six 
and under would be able to double the child care expense 
deduction of $2,000 in 1988.
<P>
<B>(1405 ) </B>
<P>
	For the benefit of larger families the plan would have 
removed the $8,000 family limit for child care expenditures.
<P>
	Parents staying at home to care for their children or those 
without receipts for child care expenses would have been able to 
claim an additional $100 tax credit per child in 1988 and $200 in 
years after that; not significant amounts, but recognition of the 
problem was a step in the right direction.
<P>
	Bill C-144 was hammered by the lobby groups for 
subsidizing for profit care and spending money on tax breaks as 
opposed to subsidized spaces. It died on the Order Paper, on 
October 1, 1988.
<P>
	Day care advocates continue to claim that true equality for 
women cannot be achieved until a universal day care system is 
in place. I argue that a balance must be struck to encourage a 
system that enables parents to participate fully in the economic 
life of the country and/or if they so choose to participate fully in 
the raising of their children.
<P>
	The key word and the key problem this bill is attempting to 
resolve is choice, eliminating the discrimination. The current 
legislative agenda does not recognize that people want the 
freedom and resources to choose what is best for their children. 
They are tired of governments and government bureaucracy 
trying to influence their actions through old-fashioned social 
engineering.
<P>
	I recognize that child care comes under provincial 
jurisdiction. This is the federal contribution to that system. In 
conjunction with provinces they could discuss the various ways 
and means of developing the social safety net to target those who 
are truly in need.
<P>
	Bill C-247 is of national interest as it addresses the highly 
contentious issues of national child care, funding for child care 
spaces, the discriminatory aspects of the Income Tax Act for 
individuals using non-receipted child care, the stay at parent. It 
encourages the focusing of social spending to the truly needy 
and provides families that are not in need of social programs 
with tax incentives to spend their money the way they see fit.
<P>
	The time has come to bring tax laws up to speed with the 
modern era. We must modify present tax laws, not only to bring 
about greater fairness but to reflect the changes that have 
occurred in our society.
<P>
	The Bolands from Calgary challenged the discriminatory 
nature of the Income Tax Act. The Schachtschneiders 
challenged the discriminatory nature of the Income Tax Act in 
its apparent favourable treatment of common law couples as 
opposed to married couples. Ms. Thibaudeau challenged the 
discriminatory nature of the Income Tax Act in its treatment of 
child care payment recipients.
<P>
	Unless we act now the only way these issues will be truly 
addressed in the House is if the Supreme Court or the federal 
courts render a decision that contradicts or negates existing 
legislation. We have an opportunity as legislators to initiate 
discussion and action on this issue which, after all, is how things 
are supposed to work.
<P>
	The Income Tax Act is by no means perfect. Bill C-247 would 
go a long way in addressing the reasons for the charter 
challenges. Contributions to the work force should once and for 
all be on the same level as contributions in the home. I 
recommend that we stop playing one off the other and start 
giving stay at home parents financial, political and social 
respect. They deserve the opportunity to work not only in the 
home but in the workplace as well. They deserve the opportunity 
to live the lifestyle they choose to live on their own without 
having to consider tax implications and the costs, the netbacks 
or the net benefits they are receiving.
<P>
	As I mentioned, the five or six existing programs are just like 
the Income Tax Act. They make up part of the Income Tax Act, 
with 2,137 pages of convoluted, mixed up mishmash that is 
difficult to understand. If we took those six programs, combined 
and consolidated them to make two, one for over $30,000 and 
one for under $30,000, this government and parliamentarians 
would be proud to present a system of child care better than what 
we currently have.
<P>
<B>(1410 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. David Walker (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for 
Calgary Centre for the opportunity to present the views of the 
government on this issue. I appreciate the time being set aside 
during private members' hour to give him, his colleagues and 
other interested people the perspectives that I, as parliamentary 
secretary, can bring to bear on this issue.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10350"> 10350 </A></B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Members will recall that the Reform Party's alternative 
budget presented last week called for massive spending 
reductions, including $15 billion on social programs.
<P>
	It is surprising, therefore, that Bill C-247, tabled by the 
Reform Party member for Calgary Centre, proposes action that 
would increase federal and provincial tax revenue costs by a 
whopping $6.5 billion annually. That is right, an extra $6.5 
billion a year at a time when all Canadian governments are 
striving to reduce both their deficits, and Canadians' tax bills. 
Maybe the The Taxpayers' Budget should have been entitled Out 
of The Taxpayers' Pockets.
<P>
	Bill C-247 is also surprising given that Reform's budget says 
that government must ``build on the Canadian tradition of 
self-reliance-and make assistance available only to those who 
are genuinely incapable of providing for themselves''. 
However, Bill C-247 does not limit assistance to those who need 
it. Rather, it would allow fixed child care expense deductions of 
$5,000 or $3,000 for all, regardless of the income of the parents 
or the amount of child care expenses, if any, actually incurred.
<P>
	In effect, Bill C-247 would actually create a new child tax 
benefit. And sadly, because it would depend on a taxpayer's 
marginal tax rate, the benefits would actually be greater for 
those in high income brackets than for those in lower brackets.
<P>
	Unlike the measures proposed in Bill C-247, the current child 
tax benefit targets substantial assistance to low and middle 
income families with children.
<P>
	Delivered monthly and tax free, it provides a basic annual 
credit of $1,020 per child, plus $75 for the third and each 
additional child.
<P>
	That assistance is reduced by 5 per cent-2.5 per cent for 
one-child families-of family net income over $25,921. Also 
included is a work income supplement of up to $500 per family 
with net family income under $25,921. This helps to meet the 
extra costs associated with participating in the work force.
<P>
	A supplement is provided for parents who choose to remain in 
the home to raise their pre-school-aged children. This year, the 
supplement is $213 for each child 6 years old or younger. 
Assistance for families is also provided through the child care 
expense deduction.
<P>
<B>(1415) </B>
<P>
	It recognizes for tax purposes the child care expenses that 
taxpayers must incur in order to earn income, to attend a 
recognized educational institution full time or to take a 
vocational training course.
<P>
	The deduction acknowledges that these taxpayers have less of 
a capacity to pay taxes than other taxpayers with an identical 
income, but who do not have child care expenses. As a result, up 
to a limit, income used to pay for child care expenses is not 
taxable.
<P>
	The deduction is applied to earned income in order to ensure 
that tax assistance is provided for child care expenses incurred 
to earn that income.
<P>
	This reflects the general view that parents not employed 
outside the home are expected, and indeed have a responsibility, 
to look after their children.
<P>
	Bill C-247 would completely change the nature of the current 
deduction. It would also be prohibitively expensive at a time of 
fiscal consolidation. As such, we can neither afford, nor should 
we even entertain, the amendments proposed by the member for 
Calgary Centre. I therefore urge this House to deny passage of 
this bill.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Osvaldo Nunez (Bourassa, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to speak to Bill C-247, an Act to amend the Income Tax 
Act (child care expenses) tabled on May 6, 1994 by the member 
for Calgary Centre.
<P>
	The purpose of this bill is to amend the Income Tax Act to 
allow the deduction of a fixed amount of $5,000 or $3,000 as 
child care expenses, regardless of the income of the parents and 
of the amount of child care expenses actually incurred.
<P>
	The existing statute does not apply to stay at home parents. 
Only those families whose children attend profit making 
establishments are allowed the child care expenses deduction.
<P>
	The bill means that parents can decide how they want their 
children cared for and deduct a fixed amount of $5,000 for 
children seven and under and $3,000 for those aged eight to 
fourteen, regardless of their income and the actual expenses 
incurred.
<P>
	Upon initial examination, this bill seems to make sense. 
However, I would like to have more detailed information on 
what it will cost, given that the deductions now allowed 
represent the major part of day care costs for the government. I 
would also like to know how many families and children would 
benefit from this bill. The government must manage its 
resources wisely. Given their scarcity, I would think that 
priority must be given to women who work.
<P>
	That being said, statistics show that in 1961, in 65 per cent of 
families with a child under the age of six, one parent stayed at 
home. In 1991, this sort of family structure represented only 12 
per cent of families. Nowadays, over 70 per cent of pre-school 
age children attend day care regularly while their parents work.
<P>
<B>(1420) </B>
<P>
	Child poverty is increasing dramatically. The government's 
cuts in social programs have further worsened the situation.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10351"> 10351 </A></B>
<P>
	In addition, the cost of raising children at home is rising. 
Who would dare to say that those parents who stay at home are 
not working? And yet, the monetary value of this work is not 
recognized.
<P>
	In this sense, the bill provides a modest financial benefit for 
families in which one parent stays at home to care for the 
children. We know that there are very often no more vacancies in 
day care centres.
<P>
	The present income tax regime is unfair to single income 
families. The child care expenses deduction applies only to 
two-income families, whatever the total. Families may claim a 
maximum of $5,000 per child, for children less than seven years 
old, and a $3,000 deduction for children 7 to 14 years old. No 
deduction is allowed for one-income families because the 
legislation assumes they have no child care expenses to pay. 
These are the families who need financial support, particularly 
single parent families which, in most cases, are mother and 
children units. Children in those families are the first ones to be 
struck by poverty.
<P>
	In our modern world, we can see that, for a great many 
families, it is vital for the mother to work outside the home. This 
participation in the workforce is sometimes threatened by the 
lack of child care services.
<P>
	Under certain circumstances, women are forced to stay home 
and that can cause serious problems. These women suffer from 
isolation and lack of social recognition. Therefore, the 
government should take the necessary steps to ensure their 
social and economic equality. Years spent at home caring for 
children result in a considerable loss of income and great 
difficulties when reintegrating the labour force.
<P>
	According to what I have just heard the hon. member for 
Calgary Centre say, it seems the Reform members support this 
bill for very old-fashioned reasons. Even though I tend to agree 
with this bill, I cannot share the philosophy and the line of 
thought of the hon. member sponsoring it. His objective seems 
to be to promote a more traditional and conservative view of the 
family. He would like to see women stay home in greater 
numbers. I think this would be a move backwards that would 
profit neither the women themselves, nor society which would 
no longer benefit from their valuable contribution in important 
areas.
<P>
	On the other hand, we must examine this bill in the current 
context of the government social policy which is very 
regressive. There is a blatant lack of an overall and fair child 
care program. And if we consider that a great number of women 
choose to stay at home to raise their children, the bill proposed 
by the hon. member for Calgary Centre makes sense, of course, 
if that is the free choice of these women. Then, the government 
must respect this choice, recognize the economic value of the 
work of these women at home and give them this modest 
financial benefit.
<P>
<B>(1425) </B>
<P>
	This bill is far from being the ideal solution, but it gives the 
opportunity to revive the debate on child care.
<P>
	Our society wants children, but parents who have them and 
raise them are penalized.
<P>
	I support this bill only inasmuch as the mother or the couple 
choose that kind of child care of their own free will. If they do 
so, they should not be unduly put at a disadvantage by the 
federal tax system.
<P>
	Surveys show that the general public supports some kind of 
government financial assistance to families where one parent 
stays home to take care of children.
<P>
	The government and our society should find a comprehensive 
solution to that problem. I certainly hope the Minister of Human 
Resources Development will examine this whole issue of 
assistance to families and particularly children, because it is 
urgent. The federal government should work hand in hand with 
the provinces to provide more child care services.
<P>
	I should add that comparative studies in the United States, 
Canada, and Europe suggest that it is inadequate and unfair to 
hand out money to families to pay for child care instead of using 
tax dollars to fund a child care system, which is probably the 
way of the future.
<P>
	In conclusion, I would like to say that, eventually, we should 
also examine the issue of assistance to families who take care of 
the elderly, the chronically ill, or the handicapped.

<P>
	<B>Ms. Margaret Bridgman (Surrey North, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am very pleased to have been asked by my colleague 
from Port Moody-Coquitlam to present some aspects of our 
position in the debate on Bill C-247, an act to amend the Income 
Tax Act relating to child care expenses.
<P>
	As stated earlier, the purpose of the bill is to amend the 
Income Tax Act to allow for the deduction of a fixed amount of 
$5,000 or $3,000 according to the age of the child, regardless of 
the income of the parents and the amount of child care expenses 
actually incurred.
<P>
	The bill allows the deductions to be claimed by one parent, 
either parent where the child is living with both parents or each 
parent when the parents are living apart and the child spends 
some time with both parents. In the case when parents are living 
apart, the deduction would be split between the two parents 
according to the amount of time each parent spends with the 
child. The real purpose of the bill is to allow parents the freedom 
to choose the method of child care for their children.
<P>
	Today's economic realities mean that the role of government 
has to be entirely rethought. Thirty years of more and more 
government social spending has only produced less and less 
security for Canadians. We in the House must face the challenge 
<P>

<B><A NAME="10352"> 10352 </A></B>
<P>
of turning our welfare state into a secure society which requires 
a new philosophy of social security.
<P>
	In discussing the issue of child support payments, it is best to 
lay out some principles and then determine if the bill adheres to 
the principles. There are five principles that we should be 
following in the debate.
<P>
	The first one would be the self-reliance of Canadians and to 
recognize the family as the primary caregiver.
<P>
	The second one would be to empower families, community 
and charitable organizations to play an increasing role.
<P>
	The third one would be to focus social spending on the need.
<P>
	The fourth principle would be to entrust resources and 
responsibilities to the level of delivery where it is most effective 
or decentralized.
<P>
	The fifth would be to reduce spending and limit government 
spending.
<P>
<B>(1430 ) </B>
<P>
	On the first principle we must realize the increasing 
importance of families and their role in the nurturing of children 
and the viability of the economy.
<P>
	Reformers support policies that allow families to be 
recognized as serving a unique and important role and to be 
given a choice in the method of child care their children receive.
<P>
	There is a clear and fundamental philosophical difference 
between the Liberals and the Reformers on the whole child care 
and day care debate. Liberals believe in a state run day care and 
promised $120 million for day care in their red book, which 
incidentally was not met in the recent budget. This promise was 
essentially fuelled by special interest forces and would result in 
increased cost to all taxpayers. It is also an anti-family choice.
<P>
	Reformers oppose a state run day care. We believe that day 
care is most efficiently run by the private sector and that 
government subsidization of day care, the nanny state, is not 
financially sustainable. In these views we are supported by a 
majority of Canadians who according to a recent Maclean's poll 
prefer to raise their children in the home. They also believe that 
parents must have the right of choice.
<P>
	The second principle to follow is that a dollar left in the hands 
of a family is more effective, more efficient and more desired 
than in government programs. The present child care expense 
allowance is intrusive. It interferes with parental decision 
making by discriminating against those with families where one 
parent stays at home to raise children. The bill would empower 
families with a real choice.
<P>
	The third principle is focusing on social spending on need. It 
may appear that the bill does not focus on need since the bill 
provides a deduction regardless of the income of the parents. It 
should be noted that the bill is intended to work within a flat tax 
system.
<P>
	The fourth principle is to entrust resources and 
responsibilities to the level of delivery where they are most 
efficient and most effective. Under this principle it would be 
prudent to eliminate the child tax credit and replace it with a tax 
deduction.
<P>
	Why should more money be sent to Ottawa, churned through 
the government bureaucracy and then funnelled back to 
Canadians? This results in less money being available to those 
who are really in need.
<P>
	Under a tax reduction the parents would determine the best 
use for the money. They could apply it to their own needs. It 
would make them choose responsibly and they would see the 
direct result of the money.
<P>
	The fifth principle the bill addresses is the reduction of 
government spending because the cost of a tax reduction would 
be offset by the elimination of the tax credit. The bill would 
allow parents to stay at home resulting in greater employment 
opportunities. There would be no need for a national day care 
program. Savings would also result because funding would be 
directly to individuals and families and not to institutions and 
professionals.
<P>
	In conclusion, the bill recognizes that families are the best 
hope for a bright future and that healthy families, not 
dysfunctional types, are a source of strength for future 
generations.
<P>
	The bill moves away from the folly of state run day care 
programs generated by special interest groups that favour 
government intervention and social engineering. We must 
rethink our responsibilities and our priorities.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> The member for Calgary 
Centre had given an indication that he wanted a few minutes 
under right of reply.
<P>
	The House must understand that no other member can speak 
after the member closes under right of reply. I hope he can do 
this in the matter of two to three minutes.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Silye (Calgary Centre, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, there are 
two comments I would like to make, just to wrap up. When we 
heard from the Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Finance, 
basically he said that the program would cost an extra $6.5 
billion.
<P>
	I want it entered into the record that what he is not doing and 
has failed to recognize in my comments is that this bill would 
consolidate the current existing programs which add up to 
slightly over $8 billion and offset the cost of this program. Even 
if we use $6 billion as the cost, what he has failed to do in his 
budgetary planning is to recognize that those people who make 
$30,000 or more get $2.1 billion of the child credit out of that 
$5.2 billion. We must subtract that from the $6.5 billion.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="10353"> 10353 </A></B>
<P>
	With the lack of need to spend the $1.4 billion on future day 
care facilities, given that the present ones would be sufficient 
to handle the demand for the waiting list of 25,000 people, 
those would be additional funds that would be available. 
Although the Liberals now are not going to spend that money, 
which they promised they would in the red book. It looks like 
another broken promise from their election trail.
<P>
	In summary, it is an important mathematical dollar item to 
consider. We have to consider whether the current system with 
six different ways of providing child care assistance in this 
country is sufficient. Is it meeting the needs of the people? My 
presentation today has shown sufficient cause for the need to 
address this. It is not sufficient.
<P>
	There are some solutions. I have offered some. It may not be 
the total answer, but it offers a solution through consolidation 
and giving people the choice, helping to put the money in the 
families' hands and letting them decide how to spend that 
money. After all, they earned it in the first place. They should 
know better how to spend it, not the state and not funding 
institutions.
<P>
	This government should consider a method of child care 
support and child care payments in its social engineering and its 
social package that would truly leave more money available for 
people. Let them have the choice. Also, reduce the overall cost. 
Despite what the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of 
Finance said, if we consolidated this plan it would save this 
country $1 billion.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> There being no further 
members rising for debate, and the motion not being designated 
as a votable item, the time provided for the consideration of 
Private Members' Business has now expired. Paper.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Silye:</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. For those 
members present in the House, I would like to seek unanimous 
consent. I know this bill is non-votable and was deemed as such 
by the subcommittee. However, after due consideration by all 
members in this House, would the members give unanimous 
consent to make C-247 votable?
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Is there unanimous 
consent?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> No.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Silye:</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. I would like 
to move that the bill be not now read a second time, but because 
of discriminatory challenges to the Income Tax Act and 
Parliament's commitment to end child poverty by the year 2000, 
that the subject matter of the bill be referred to the Standing 
Committee on Human Resources Development and that 
accordingly the bill be withdrawn.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Is there unanimous 
consent?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> No.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Accordingly the order is 
dropped from the Order Paper. It being 2.40 p.m. the House 
stands adjourned until Monday, March 13, 1995 at 11 a.m., 
pursuant to Standing Orders 28 and 24.
<P>
	(The House adjourned at 2.39 p.m.)
