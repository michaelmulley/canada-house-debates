dealing primarily with protective custody inmates. It now houses 
a greater percentage of non-protective custody offenders who are 
defiant, aggressive and organized. Past incidents reflect this 
aggression with numerous staff assaults, two hostage takings and 
two riots since August 27.

Kingston Pen are not conducive to managing these maximum security 
offenders.  Staff now work in extremely hazardous situations.

their own cost effective solutions.  Once again it is the

see destruction, both physical and human, that will put the $3.1

licensed to operate the Expressvu direct to home satellite

business with exports, and who have the Liberals named as chief 
of team Canada?  Why, BCE chairman Lynton Wilson. Surprise. 
Surprise. And who has contributed over $70,000 to the Liberals in 
the past two years?  BCE.  Surprise.  Surprise. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So listen up small business.  Here is how to get preferential 
treatment from the Liberals.  Become a subsidiary of BCE and 
donate liberally to the Liberal Party of Canada.

many members have spoken recently on the subject of breast 
cancer, a devastating disease that has become the leading cause 
of death among women 35 to 55 years of age. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Breast cancer has had a profound effect on my own family.  My 
grandmother had breast cancer 35 years ago and survived.  While, 
I lost my mother to breast cancer five years ago, I am very proud 
to say that one of my sisters is now doing leading edge research 
at the University of Ottawa. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Every 30 minutes another Canadian woman is diagnosed with breast 
cancer and more than 5,400 women die of the disease every year. 
While these statistics are alarming, we have made great strides 
in the fight against this disease. The benefits of extensive 
awareness programs and early detection screening are starting to 
be felt as mortality rates for breast cancer in Canada have begun 
to decline. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>October is breast cancer awareness month.  Let us all wear the

</I></B></P><P align=left>A mere mention of these two events is sufficient to remind us 
of the immensity of the disasters which struck these areas and the 
immensity of the needs they created. These unprecedented natural 
disasters led to the greatest expression of generosity and

Canadians being trampled under the hooves of a government that 
clearly prefers dictatorship to democracy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By the introduction of closure on Bill C-2, the Liberals are 
saying one of two things:  that the Liberals just do not care if 
the Canadian people are concerned about the biggest tax grab in 
the history of this country; or that the Liberals just do not 
want the Canadian people to find out exactly how destructive 
these new pension proposals are. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Whatever their agenda, the bottom line is that these Liberals 
are refusing to allow enough informed and constructive debate to 
clearly show Canadians what this is all about.  The last time I 
checked, this was a democratic country.  It is obvious today that 
those Liberals do not believe that.

regret that the government has fouled that good start by moving 
to closure on a major national policy issue after only one day of

very strength of this system of consultations in connection with the 
transitional job creation fund is that my department checks with Ms. 
Harel, based on our government's spending commitments to the Société

about each of the proposals.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier—Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jason Kenney (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
the House is now debating the single largest tax increase in 
Canadian history, a $10 billion tax grab that will take 10% off 
the paycheques of every Canadian and will forever make the future 
of young Canadians poorer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My question is for the Prime Minister.  Why is he shutting down

<P><A NAME="LINK83"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
the hon. member refers, as have his colleagues, to the 9.9%.  He 
says that this is a very large increase and it is.  It is however 
substantially lower than the 13% increase that would arise from 
the alternative plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since the hon. member will have the opportunity to ask a 
supplementary question, will he stand in the House now and tell 
us how much the Reform cost premiums will be?  Will they be 13% 
or will they be higher?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jason Kenney (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker,

disdain with which the government treats the Canadian people”. 
That was said by the Minister of Foreign Affairs in 1993 when the

terrible.  Shame on the government”.  That is what the House 
leader said in 1991. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My question is for the Prime Minister.  When the Mulroney Tories

my question is for the Prime Minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In his previous answers the Prime Minister, I am sure, made an 
honest mistake when he implied that all the provinces had agreed 
to the CPP changes.  The fact is that the NDP governments of 
B.C., Saskatchewan and the Yukon did not agree, precisely because 
they shared our concerns about the effects of the changes on 
women, the disabled, survivors, etc.  It is precisely because of 
those concerns that we moved an amendment to make debate on this 
possible.

</I></B></P><P align=left>There are two ways to destroy the Canada pension plan.  One is 
to confront it like the Reform.  The other way is to do what the 
NDP is doing, which is to refuse to recognize the absolute need

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg—Transcona, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
the finance minister knows that it is intellectually dishonest in 
the extreme to suggest that we want to destroy the Canada pension 
plan.  It is precisely because we want to strengthen it that we 
want a debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My question is for the Prime Minister.  He said it was the 
amendments that caused him to move closure.  Is he saying or will 
he say now that in the absence of such amendments on future 
legislation there will be no closure, there will be no time 
allocation and we will be able to debate legislation until such 
time as the matter is confirmed or dismissed?

plan then why will they not let it go to committee where there 
can be debate?

can get on to track two where we can deal with mandatory credit 
splitting, where we can deal with a number of issues that were

across the country attended by my colleagues in agriculture and 
the minister responsible for the wheat board.

<P><A NAME="LINK110"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lorne Nystrom (Qu'Appelle, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise 
to say a few words in tribute to Mr. Claude Ellis who was a 
member of Parliament elected for the CCF in the city of Regina in 
1953 and again in 1957. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately Mr. Ellis passed away on October 1 of this year at 
the age of 77.  He served two terms in the House.  He was well 
known as a dedicated member of Parliament who served his 
constituents very well.  He was also a superb educator and 
teacher.  As a matter of fact, he was one of my professors when I 
first attended university back in the mid-1960s. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Ellis was also one of the founders of the CCF in 
Saskatchewan in the 1930s, 1940s and 1950s.  He was very active 
in the educational movement, in the trade union movement and in 
the formation of the CCF both provincially and federally. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At this stage I pay tribute to his wife Bessie who has been an 
activist for many years, to his three sons and his daughter and 
to their spouses, to his grandchildren and great-grandchildren, 
and to his friends. 
<P><A NAME="LINK111"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Ralph E. Goodale (Minister of Natural Resources and 
Minister responsible for the Canadian Wheat Board, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, like the member for Qu'Appelle I was saddened to hear of 
the passing of Mr. Claude Ellis, a former member of Parliament 
for Regina City from 1952 to 1958 representing the CCF. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Ellis' interest in politics started very early in life.  As 
a youth he served on his party's provincial council in 
Saskatchewan and as youth president in the late 1930s.  His 
political involvement continued through his university years at 
the University of Saskatchewan.  Mr. Ellis also showed his 
aspirations to serve very early on in life, being elected prime 
minister of the university parliamentary forum for two years 
running. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During that time Mr. Ellis was very well served by his excellent 
speaking ability, an ability for which he won both oratory prizes 
and debating trophies, culminating in a trip to Guelph, Ontario, 
where he walked away with the Canadian debating championship. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the House of Commons Mr. Ellis was an advocate for the less 
well off in society, in particular in the areas of housing and 
health care, helping to form the caring society that Canada has 
become, a tradition that all of us from Regina would aspire to 
continue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Ellis is survived by his wife Bessie, three sons and one 
daughter.  On behalf of the Government of Canada I would like to 
offer our sincere condolences to the Ellis family.

Claude Ellis and the work he did in the Canadian parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister mentioned that he was involved at a very young age. 
He was involved at 16 years old.  How many of us were thinking

career.  Think of the thrill he must have felt as a young man 
when he appeared on the same stage as J. S. Woodsworth, one of 
the founders of the CCF, and Mr. J. Coldwell, the national leader 
at that time.  What a thrill it must have been for that young 
man. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He was elected in 1953 and again in 1957.  On a personal note, 
my great-grandfather, Ted Applewhait, was in the 1953 to 1957

that does not matter.  They served in the House. They were 
parliamentarians during that parliament.

express our deepest condolences to his entire family and to tell them 
that we are keenly aware that there were lengthy periods during which 
they had to manage without Mr. Ellis, because he had to be here in 
Ottawa to serve his constituents.  They have our sympathy and our 
deepest respect for the sacrifices they were willing to make so that he 
could do his work in the House.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Elsie Wayne (Saint John, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today in tribute to Claude Ellis, former CCF member of Parliament 
for the city of Regina.  While I did not have the privilege of 
knowing Mr. Ellis, I have to say the tale of his 77 years is 
quite unique as lives of MPs go. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although he was a long time resident of Regina, the city he 
represented in the House of Commons, Mr. Ellis was born in 
Weyburn, Saskatchewan, the son of Bill Ellis and Peggy Dawson 
Gibson.  He was educated at public schools and Scott Collegiate 
in Regina, moving on to teachers college.  From this Claude Ellis 
enjoyed a lengthy career as an educator, teaching in Manor, 
Saskatchewan, and at his alma mater of Scott Collegiate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Ellis' impressive career came to an end at the University of 
Regina where he was awarded the title of professor emeritus. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Claude Ellis did take some time from teaching to represent the 
city of Regina in the House of Commons.  He was first elected in 
1953 and re-elected in 1957, during which time he actively 
articulated the needs and concerns of his constituents.  Even 
when he did not serve as an elected MP, Mr. Ellis remained a 
strong supporter of the CCF movement and later the New Democratic 
Party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He formed a vibrant partnership with his beautiful wife Bessie, 
who for many years has been a tireless worker in the community. 
Together they raised three sons and one daughter, who in turn 
blessed Claude and Bessie Ellis with five grandchildren and two 
great-grandchildren. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When Claude Ellis passed away on October 1, parliament lost a 
former member, Saskatchewan lost a distinguished educator, but 
most important the Ellis family lost a husband, a father, a 
brother, a grandfather and a great-grandfather.  We could only 
hope that they find solace in the wonderful life he lived and the 
contributions he made to education and to the public service. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On behalf of the Progressive Conservative caucus I offer my 
condolences to members of the Ellis family on their loss.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Solomon (Regina—Lumsden—Lake Centre, NDP):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I too would like to join with colleagues in the House of 
Commons to pay tribute to Claude Ellis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I had the honour and privilege of knowing Claude Ellis for the 
last 24 years.  I represented him and his wife Bessie in the 1993 
to 1997 term. Throughout that period Bessie and Claude were 
advisors to me.  They sat on my executive and were very wise 
counsel on many issues, in particular when in the last parliament 
the New Democratic Party did not have a lot of resources. Their 
experience and counsel were very important to us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I had occasion to have supper with Mr. Ellis about 18 months ago 
when he was in Ottawa with his wife Bessie and we talked about a 
lot of important issues affecting our country.  Even during the 
last couple of months in Regina he was always very keen on 
ensuring that New Democrats represented citizens well in 
parliament.  He was very keen on ensuing that issues such as 
pensions were a priority and he asked us to ensure that the 
principles and fundamental issues which are important to all 
Canadians remain on the agenda of parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to join with members in acknowledging Mr. Ellis' 
contribution to the city of Regina, the province of Saskatchewan 
and to our country.   As citizens we have suffered a great loss 
as a result of his passing.  I appreciate the opportunity to 
extend my condolences to his widow Bessie and their family.

<P><A NAME="LINK117"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Greg Thompson (Charlotte, PC):</B>   Mr. Speaker, the 
citizens of New Brunswick and the constituents of the former 
federal riding of York—Sunbury are mourning the death of 
long-time resident and friend, John Chester MacRae.  The former 
member of Parliament and D-Day veteran died this past Sunday 
after a brief illness. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>John Chester MacRae was born in Hope-Town, Quebec, received his 
education at Campbellton High School and the provincial Normal 
School in Fredericton.  He taught in the public school system 
until 1940 when his regiment was called out to active service. He 
served in Britain and France, going into France on D-Day. For 
service in France he was awarded the Military Cross and after his 
return to Canada received the Efficiency Decoration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>J. Chester MacRae continued his interest in the military after 
the war and throughout his life with his final appointment being 
honorary Colonel of the First Battalion, the Royal New Brunswick 
Regiment (Carleton and York). 
</I></B></P><P align=left>J. Chester MacRae was elected to the House of Commons in 1957, 
won five subsequent elections and retired undefeated in 1972. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Former New Brunswick Premier Hugh John Flemming once described 
Chester MacRae as being a man who it was a privilege and pleasure 
to know, stating that “he was a great Canadian, distinguished in 
everything he's ever undertaken”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>People from the Fredericton area will always remember Chester 
MacRae for his dry wit.  He once said “My relationship with the 
Conservative Party was a happy and cordial one, although 
elections to me were agony.” 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a long-time member of the Royal Canadian Legion he served as 
branch president, provincial president, grand patron and a life 
member of the St. Machar Masonic Lodge, Aberdeen, Scotland. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In one of his final speeches in the House 31 years ago, he 
reflected on a wide range of matters, some of which are very 
relevant today.  He spoke on the issue of the population 
explosion, of the need for peace in the world, on the equality of 
all races, and the matter dearest to his heart, the veterans of 
Canada and, indeed, the veterans of all countries.  He stated in 
this Chamber that those veterans who were prisoners of war 
underwent greater hardships than perhaps any of the rest of us 
who were privileged to serve in World War II. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The people of Fredericton and the people of New Brunswick will 
long remember J. Chester MacRae for his dedication, his service, 
his kindness and that rare quality, his heroism. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Chet MacRae is survived by his wife of 64 years, Mina Catherine 
Gerrard MacRae, one daughter Marjory Ann and her husband Jack 
Patterson of Vancouver, one daughter-in-law Darlene MacRae of 
Saint John, 10 grandchildren and six great grandchildren.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Andy Scott (Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I am honoured, humbled and saddened to pay tribute to 
Chester MacRae.  He was a friend of my father's although I did 
not meet him until I was going door to door during the 1993 
election campaign.  He brought the futility of my exercise to my 
attention. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Being the wonderful gentleman that he was, after the election he 
came to visit me.  We spent a wonderful afternoon discussing the 
difference between being a member of Parliament in 1993 and being 
a member of Parliament in the late fifties and early sixties.  He 
spoke of travelling to Ottawa on the train and being away from 
home so much of the time.  It was remarkable for me as a brand 
new member who had not yet been to Ottawa to have that kind of 
discussion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I had the good fortune two years later on Remembrance Day as a 
member of Parliament to lay wreathes on behalf of the government 
in our communities, often in many places at the same time.  I 
asked Chester to represent the Government of Canada and to lay 
the wreath in Fredericton.  This was the last Remembrance Day 
before the onset of his illness. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During the campaign I had the opportunity to drop in and visit 
Chester at the DVA in Fredericton.  He was very alert.  He 
advised me that my success in 1993 was surely a fluke.  I will 
remember him fondly for the rest of my life. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The people of the community of Fredericton know what a 
contribution Chester MacRae made in war, in peace, as an 
educator.  They remember what he did for the Legion, for veterans 
and for his community.  He will be missed.  All his family and 
his friends in Fredericton have our condolences.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Randy White (Langley—Abbotsford, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I rise in this House privileged to pay tribute to Chester MacRae. 
Chester MacRae was the finest example of a dedicated 
parliamentarian, having won six federal elections and retired 
undefeated after 15 years of service. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The dedication one puts toward the goal of improving one's 
country is the mark of a great person.  Chester MacRae worked 
tirelessly toward the improvement of Canada for future 
generations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Not only did Chester MacRae serve Canada and Parliament but he 
was a decorated war veteran who served in both England and 
France, having participated in the D-Day invasion of France.  For 
his service he was awarded the Military Cross. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Just yesterday I walked through the visitor's welcome centre to 
see Chester's name on a plaque that commemorates those who 
preceded us in this House.  In addition to his honoured name we 
all remember his qualities of integrity, compassion and devotion, 
in particular toward the interests of Canada's veterans. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Chester MacRae will be sorely missed but never forgotten in this 
House.  We offer our condolences to the members of his family, to 
his friends and colleagues and our sincere regrets in his 
passing.

were saddened yesterday to learn of the death of Chester MacRae, 
who, for 15 years, from 1957 to 1972, was a Conservative member of 
this House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I did not know Mr. MacRae personally, but everyone I talked to 
described him as a devoted individual and member of the 
Conservative Party for 15 years, and especially as a devoted 
officer in the Canadian army.  Mr. MacRae was considered a hero in 
the second world war.  He even took part in the landing in France. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although a Conservative, Mr. MacRae was known as an ambassador 
of peace, mutual assistance between peoples, and equality. 
It was more likely the vision of Lester B. Pearson that he carried 
abroad than the Conservative vision of things.

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>PRIVILEGE 
</H3><P align=left>
<P><A NAME="LINK123"></A></P>
<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>TIME ALLOCATION 
</H4><P align=left>

<P><A NAME="LINK124"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg—Transcona, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
my question of privilege arises out of the motion that the 
government intends to move with respect to time allocation on 
Bill C-2. It has to do with what I regard to be the 
responsibilities of the Chair to protect the rights and 
privileges of members of this House of Commons to engage in 
adequate debate on matters of national importance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Chair will know that the time allocation motion has to do 
with the amendments to the Canada pension plan.  This is a 
national social program, an income security plan which is very 
rarely before the House, very rarely debated, very rarely 
amended. This is one of those occasions when it is being amended, 
therefore, it is a unique opportunity for members of the House of 
Commons to put their views on the record on what our national 
pension plan system should look like. We will disagree with each 
other about that.  The Reform Party will have its position, as 
will the NDP.  The government will have its position, as 
reflected in the legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My concern is that the Chair consider, before seeing whoever it 
is who will be moving the motion on behalf of the government—we 
have notice that the motion will be moved—not seeing the mover 
of the motion as a way of using the power of the Chair to 
intervene on behalf of members of Parliament, both collectively 
and individually, in a situation where our right to adequate 
debate is being violated by the government's rush to judgment on 
the appropriateness of time allocation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Others have said in the course of comments during question 
period that somehow the amendments that were moved by the 
opposition were an attempt to close off debate.  Quite the 
contrary. We know these motions are procedurally designed in such 
as way, whether a six-month hoist or whatever, and are often 
moved in order to create the possibility of more debate so that 
the government cannot move to the question on the main motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a bit disingenuous for the government to say that this was 
an attempt to close off debate.  It was, rather, to prevent or to 
act in a preventive way against the government moving to the 
question right away by not putting up speakers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>An amendment was moved, a subamendment was moved and right after 
the subamendment was moved the government gave notice of closure. 
How long did we debate this motion?  We debated it for one day. 
We did not debate it the next day in the morning because we were 
debating Bill C-4. 
Then we moved to Bill C-2 and we were hardly into the second or 
third hour and the government moved closure.

<A HREF="#LINKT18"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, I know that for you to do something about this 
would be to break with Canadian precedent.  I am aware of the 
significance of what I am asking you to do.  I have only asked a 
Speaker to do this once before and it was Speaker Fraser in the 
context of the North American Free Trade Agreement. But you will 
know that at Westminster and in other Parliaments, Speakers have 
sometimes taken upon themselves the responsibility of ensuring 
that the rights of Parliament collectively are not abused by a 
government which moves too quickly to closure or to time 
allocation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is precisely what I am asking you to consider here today, 
that this is an occasion where very early in this Parliament 
there is no reason to believe that the debate would have gone on 
and on. All we wanted was an opportunity to have our amendments 
considered, to have a full airing of the subject, which is what 
second reading used to be before we got the kind of rule changes 
that we got in a previous Parliament in 1991 and which this 
government having condemned these changes now uses to the full. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think it is the wrong way to start off this Parliament.  We 
were doing just fine. We were getting along even though we 
disagree with each other politically.  For the government to move 
at this time as I suggested earlier is a very unfortunate thing. 
But it is an unfortunate thing that could be remedied by the 
Chair taking, admittedly, new responsibilities but not 
responsibilities that are totally out of character with what 
Speakers have done in other Parliaments, to intervene on behalf 
of the collective rights of parliamentarians to adequate debate 
on a matter of obvious national importance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, I rest my case and I ask you to consider the matter 
and to consider it urgently because obviously if you were to 
intervene you would have to do it when the motion was about to be 
moved.  Sometimes Speakers can be given to a judicious blindness 
when it comes to motions being moved or to breaking new ground by 
actually arriving at a judgment on this in time to prevent this 
very unfortunate reaction on the part of the government to the 
fact that there was lively, informed and concerned debate about 
CPP reform and it moved to choke it off in the way that it did. 
<P><A NAME="LINK125"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I would like to speak briefly in support of this 
member's point of privilege and lay before you two additional 
pieces of information which may assist you in responding to this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First I refer to Beauchesne's sixth edition, citation 3 which 
outlines some elements of the Constitution Act: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Without further elaboration, Canada thus was ensured a 
responsible cabinet system with the assumption that there will 
always be a recognizable government with a legislative program. 
If the electorate so wishes, the system also presupposes an 
opposition ready and willing to attack the government in an 
attempt to have its legislation altered or rejected—. More 
tentative are such traditional features as respect for the rights 
of the minority, which precludes a government from using to 
excess the extensive powers that it has to limit debate or to 
proceed in what the public and the opposition might interpret as 
unorthodox ways. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I suggest that is what we have happening here today.  The 
government is closing off debate on the bill that the opposition 
and the public honestly feel is a tax increase and a massive 
rip-off of young Canadians. We need to express those views and the 
views of Canadians on this issue before the principle of the bill 
is adopted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To limit that debate is to permit in effect taxation without 
effective and adequate representation.  One of the fundamental 
functions for which Parliament was created was specifically to 
constrain arbitrary taxation and actions by the executive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One further piece of reference for your consideration was 
referred to by the hon. member.  On April 14, 1987 Speaker Fraser 
felt it necessary to make this comment to the House on this very 
same issue: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is essential to our democratic system that controversial 
issues should be debated at reasonable length so that every 
reasonable opportunity shall be available to hear the arguments 
pro and con and that reasonable delaying tactics should be 
permissible to enable opponents of a measure to enlist public 
support for their point of view.

<A HREF="#LINKT19"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Speaker Fraser felt that the Speaker had a role to play in these 
matters.  He made this statement as a result of protest from the 
opposition.  Ironically one of the most vocal opponents to this 
abuse at that time was the very minister who has given notice and 
intends to close off debate on Bill C-2 after only eight hours of 
debate on the very first bill to hit this floor, a bill that is 
over 100 pages long and extremely technical and a bill that 
happens to have attached to it a schedule which imposes a payroll 
tax rise of 73% on millions of Canadians and employers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The debate has only just begun and we are confident that a 
reasonable debate will enlist public support for our point of 
view and that of taxpayers and young Canadians who have little or 
no voice in this debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As Speaker Fraser said, it is essential to our democratic 
system, and therefore essential for you, Mr. Speaker, to protect 
the opposition and delay even for one day the government from 
moving to close off debate in this manner. 
<P><A NAME="LINK126"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough, PC):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I would also like to add a few words with respect to the 
point of privilege raised by the member from the New Democratic 
Party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The very first principle of parliamentary law as set out in 
Beauchesne's states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The principles of Canadian parliamentary law are:  to protect a 
minority and restrain the improvidence or tyranny of a majority; 
to secure the transaction of public business in an orderly 
manner; to enable every member to express opinions within limits 
necessary to preserve decorum and prevent an unnecessary waste of 
time; to give abundant opportunity for the consideration of every 
measure, and to prevent any legislative action being taken upon 
sudden impulse. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are very telling words used in this very first section of 
parliamentary procedure.  This is not an untimely debate in any 
way, shape or form.  There are important issues that have to be 
considered and discussed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also bring to the Speaker's attention the fact that the 
government House leader has brought forward a motion pursuant to 
Standing Order 78(3) which is, as you know, predicated on the 
House leader's not being able to reach an agreement for the 
allocation of time for a stage of a bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to bring to the Chair's attention that at no time did the 
government House leader raise the subject of a time allocation 
agreement at our meetings.  There was no consultation.  He did 
ask if a number of our members were prepared to debate further, 
but there was no consideration given to the fact that there was 
going to be further debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, pursuant to Standing Order 78, I would ask you, in 
your capacity as Speaker, to rule on the motion and rule it out 
of order, keeping in mind that there were no actual attempts to 
reach agreement between the House leaders.  That may or may not 
be possible but the government House leader has an obligation to 
ask the question to the other House leaders and permit 
consultation. 
<P><A NAME="LINK127"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Don Boudria (Leader of the Government in the House of 
Commons, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I would like to respond briefly 
to the question of privilege raised by the House leader of the 
New Democratic Party and supported by two other members of this 
House earlier this day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think the Chair will need to consider two issues.  One, is the 
House leader of the New Democratic Party correct about what he 
has alleged this afternoon?  Two, is he also correct in the 
purpose of the amendment that he has offered to the House along 
with other members? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me take the points in reverse.  The amendments that are 
before us today, just to remind the Chair, are as follows.  The 
amendment offered in the name of the member for Calgary Southwest 
reads “that this House declines to give second reading to Bill 
C-2” and so on.  That amendment is further amended by a 
subamendment in the name of the hon. member for Halifax West. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In his presentation, the hon. member from the New Democratic 
Party conceded to the fact that the purpose of the amendment was 
to prevent the bill from proceeding.  He said it in this House 
some moments ago.  In other words, the amendment is specifically 
designed to prevent us from having the committee study of the 
bill.  That is what he admitted to on the floor of this House.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Having established that the opposition has admitted today and 
possibly in its speeches over the last couple of days that the 
purpose of what it is doing is to prevent the bill from 
proceeding to the next stage, I believe that any reasonable 
person would claim that the government has an equal right to 
propose measures to ensure that the bill does proceed in good and 
proper form. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Hon. members across are heckling, very rudely I might add, at 
this moment but they should be listening in particular to the 
judgment that Mr. Speaker will no doubt be giving in a few 
moments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It has been alleged that there was no consultation.  Let me 
remind the Speaker of the rules of the House to that effect. 
Standing Order 78(1) refers to the procedure as follows:  “When 
a minister of the crown, from his or her place in the House, 
states that there is agreement” and so on.  Standing Order 78(2) 
states, “When a minister of the crown, from his or her place in 
the House, states that a majority of the representatives—have 
come to an agreement—” and finally, Standing Order 78(3) is 
the procedure when an agreement cannot be reached. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yesterday afternoon at 3.30 there was a meeting in which I asked 
all members present, and all parties were present, whether or not 
they intended to put more speakers.  Only one of the four 
opposition parties, I believe it was the Bloc Quebecois, 
indicated a definite number of speakers that it wanted to put up. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Shortly afterward after having held the consultation in which I 
did not get a commitment from all parties represented pursuant to 
Standing Order 78(1) and (2), then on the floor of the House 
moments later, a further dilatory motion was produced within 
minutes of the end of our meeting, this time proposed by an NDP 
member, the purpose of which was again to further delay 
proceeding on the bill.  That was after the consultation was 
held. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, later yesterday afternoon before I proposed a motion on 
the floor of this House I even informed my counterpart in the 
official opposition which I believe was the good and proper thing 
to do so a motion would not be introduced behind his back.  That 
was done in good and proper form at a meeting at which Your 
Honour was present. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, you must judge whether an amendment that you will 
be receiving later is in order.  Of course the House has not been 
seized of that motion yet, which could come later this day.  Once 
you receive such an amendment, if one is forthcoming, the Chair 
will have to decide whether the amendment is in order and 
acceptable to this House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, I submit to you that on the third day of debating 
this bill, the purpose of which is to refer it to committee after 
years of consultation in the public generally, to move it to 
committee so we can hear witnesses on this federal-provincial 
agreement is not wrong.  To send it to committee for detailed 
study is not wrong.  It is the good and appropriate thing to do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the opposition to produce two different amendments, the 
purpose of which is dilatory as admitted on the floor of this 
House today, and the purpose of which is only to make the same 
hon. members speak not once, not twice but even three times on 
the same bill at second reading is nothing short of a dilatory 
measure. It is quite legitimate for the government and for this 
House to want to listen to ordinary Canadians, people from the 
private sector and the provinces as to why this measure is 
necessary in order to ensure a pension plan for our children and 
grandchildren.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Randy White (Langley—Abbotsford, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
there are two points which must be clarified in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government House leader is incorrect in his assertion that 
the amendments may be an avenue to limit debate.  The fact of the 
matter is that our amendment in and of itself is debatable, and 
that is what we want to do in the House.  We want to debate the 
merits of the bill through our amendments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our amendment reflects a difference of opinion in the House, an 
alternative to be debated.  I question the point of sending the 
bill to committee if the government is already showing its 
indifference to any other opinion but its own by shutting down 
debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Furthermore, the government House leader indicated today that 
adequate and reasonable notice was given to me in the House.  As 
it happened, yesterday I was at a meeting of the Board of 
Internal Economy.  I was called outside the door and given notice 
that he was on his way downstairs to give notice to the House.  I 
hardly call that adequate and reasonable notice in this day and 
age of democracy. 
<P><A NAME="LINK129"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Solomon (Regina—Lumsden—Lake Centre, NDP):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I rise on the same question of privilege to provide some 
clarity.  In my view the government House leader has partially 
misinformed parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government House leader and all members know that it is 
standard procedure for the opposition, and maybe another 
opposition party or two, to move amendments and subamendments on 
important bills.  This is not out of the ordinary.  The purpose 
is to provide fuller debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I was at a meeting yesterday with the government House 
leader, other House leaders and whips, they asked us how many 
more speakers we had and we said about five.  The government 
House leader has forgotten that number. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He also said that the motions we have passed with respect to the 
amendments would allow each member of Parliament to speak three 
times.  The majority of New Democratic Party members have not had 
an occasion to speak once on the bill, never mind three times.  I 
have not spoken on the bill and I want to speak on the bill.  I 
stepped aside for members of Parliament who have not had an 
opportunity to speak yet.  I would like to do that at some point. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The final point I want to make is quite outrageous.  It deals 
with what the government House leader said.  He failed to give 
New Democrats notice of this motion.  That is absolutely 
incredulous in view of our co-operative parliament and the way we 
have made progress in the first three weeks of parliament as five 
official parties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He has failed his unofficial pact, denied the pact, or abandoned 
the pact to provide some co-operation to deal with issues of a 
substantive nature. 
<P><A NAME="LINK130"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
have new and relevant information on this issue.  I am vice-chair 
of the House of Commons finance committee.  The government's 
premise that it is important to get this legislation to committee 
for debate is simply false. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Not only has this not been discussed, but the House of Commons 
finance committee strikes out next week to go on a tour across 
the country to hear from Canadians on completely different 
issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The clerk and chairman of the committee made it very clear in 
the discussions we had that in the nine days after that when we 
will be sitting up until the middle of November we will be 
hearing witnesses on a completely different issue, the pre-budget 
hearings. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the House leader opposite says this legislation is being 
pushed into committee, I can assure that is absolutely false. 
<P><A NAME="LINK131"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jack Ramsay (Crowfoot, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I have one 
piece of information of which I would like you to be aware.  I 
have not spoken to the bill and I want to speak to the bill.

question of privilege.  I want to thank all hon. members who have 
taken part in giving me the information I have before me now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With regard to what the member for Winnipeg—Transcona said, I 
am aware and I understand full well the serious nature of this 
request and the rather innovative way that he suggests it might 
be resolved. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At this point, unless I have more direction from the entire 
House and in view of the fact that Speakers have consistently 
ruled since 1968 that they would not intervene in the quality of 
whatever discussions took place on either matter, I am left to 
decide this on what is in the standing orders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At this point I hesitate to go down the road where you would put 
this kind of discretionary power into the hands of your Speaker. 
Therefore I would rule at this time that there is no question of 
privilege.

when we were making tributes today to Chester MacRae and to 
Claude Ellis, the House leader for the Liberal Party was

was not the Liberal who is sitting over here now.  God bless him; 
he is a nice young man.  Nevertheless he was. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we are giving tributes, and I know that you, Sir, have 
brought this matter to our attention before, I think we should 
all sit and show respect for the families of those to whom we are 
paying tribute.

all have to say in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not want to go into a debate on this issue.  It is just a

each other the respect that is due a member of the Canadian

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>FISHING INDUSTRY 
</H4><P align=left>

<P><A NAME="LINK154"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Matthews (Burin—St. George's, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I rise today to ask for leave to put forward a motion for a 
special debate, pursuant to Standing Order 52, to discuss the 
critical situation facing the fishing industry on the Pacific 
coast and in Atlantic Canada and recent events which are causing 
the government to revise its policies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Just yesterday the auditor general reported his findings to the 
House.  He drew attention to the fact that he could not find 
anywhere a clearly defined national fisheries policy on 
sustainable fisheries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Furthermore, in the past few weeks there have been suggestions 
and allegations of interference with DFO science, the twisting 
and manipulation of scientific data.  The ability of the 
department has been called into question as to whether the 
Department of Fisheries and Oceans can effectively manage the 
fisheries resource.  Of course, that is a matter of debate right 
across the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government's handling and its management of the fishery has 
given rise to confrontation and civil disorder in British 
Columbia.  Relationships between the federal government and the 
Government of British Columbia have reached such a stage of 
disharmony that other federal-provincial matters are threatened 
and the federal-provincial relationship between Ottawa and 
British Columbia is at an all-time low. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As well, the auditor general stated the obvious yesterday when 
he said that fish stocks in Atlantic Canada are not regenerating. 
There are not enough fish in the water to sustain a viable 
fishing industry.  He also stated the very obvious, in particular 
to those of us from Atlantic Canada, that there are very few jobs 
and employment opportunities in the hundreds of rural communities 
in Atlantic Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is more compelling is that even since the moratorium was 
announced in July 1992, this government, being in power now for 
four years, has not developed or implemented a strategy or a plan 
to deal with 35,000 to 40,000 Atlantic Canadians after May 1998. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have had an historic day today.  My submission to you, Mr. 
Speaker, is that if we as elected members of Parliament to this 
House of Commons are going to have ample opportunity to debate 
the fisheries crisis on both coasts of our country, we are going 
to need to do it soon.  It is a matter of urgent public interest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before the anticipated, hopefully, national policy on fisheries 
I think every member of this House should have an opportunity to 
debate the present fisheries crisis on the west and east coasts. 
They should be heard.  The government can undertake to listen to 
all members and to hopefully consider and incorporate some of the 
ideas that might flow from my proposed debate into a national 
fisheries policy, especially as it pertains to sustainable 
fisheries and the difficulties that are being faced by fishers on 
the west coast, in particular because of the salmon dispute and 
in the Atlantic because of the decline in our fish stocks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, Mr. Speaker, I would like to submit to you that 
this matter in my estimation is very urgent and is of great 
public significance and importance.

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>CANADA PENSION PLAN INVESTMENT BOARD ACT 
</H3><P align=left>

<A NAME="LINK163">&nbsp;</A>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed from October 7 consideration of the motion 
that Bill C-2, an act to establish the Canada Pension Plan 
Investment Board and to amend the Canada Pension Plan and the Old 
Age Security Act and to make consequential amendments to other 
acts, be read the second time and referred to a committee; of the 
amendment; and of the amendment to the amendment.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  When the House last considered the 
matter, the hon. member for Renfrew—Nipissing—Pembroke had the 
floor.  He has four minutes remaining in his speech. 
<P><A NAME="LINK164"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Hec Clouthier (Renfrew—Nipissing—Pembroke, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, it is a pleasure for me to be in this hallowed House 
participating in this debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is rather interesting to note that the party opposite has a 
void in its argument on the Canada pension plan debate and it was 
evinced by their void in not being here for the democratic vote. 
Hopefully we will not be indulging in this vituperative political 
rhetoric but I guess they will persist.  It reminds me of last 
night when I left this hallowed Chamber and thought of the 
viciousness of their attack.  It made me think that this is the 
last refuge for the vaguely talented on the opposite side. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Having said this I notice that one of their main points of 
contention in the debate is that this is a payroll tax.  That is 
utter rubbish and nonsense.  It is a pension plan.  It is a 
contribution to a pension plan.  It is not in any way shape or 
form a payroll tax. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We do have an employment insurance tax but we are doing 
everything we possibly can, and have done so since we were 
elected, to reduce the employment insurance tax not once, not 
twice but thrice.  We will continue to reduce the employment 
insurance tax whenever we have the opportunity and the fiscal 
responsibility to do so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One thing that we will not reduce is our commitment to Bill C-2. 
Why?  Because this has not been a cursory commitment.  This has 
not been a commitment just in the last week, the last month, the 
last year or the last five years.  This has been a commitment for 
about 40 years.  One of the great icons of Canadian political 
history and it certainly endeared myself to him to know that he 
was also one of the great icons of the Liberal Party, the late 
Paul Martin Sr., was part and parcel of the genesis of this 
wonderful bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is rather remarkable to know that a very close relative of 
Paul Martin Sr., our current finance minister, continues that 
strong legacy.  I am sure that Paul Martin Sr., being up in the 
hallowed house in the celestial heavens with the other saints of 
political history such as Sir Wilfrid Laurier and Mackenzie King 
and Lester Pearson, would be smiling broadly knowing that his 
legacy has lasted with the truly great finance minister in this 
Liberal Party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I notice that members of the Reform Party used an acronym, CPP. 
We know it stands for Canada pension plan, but they cared to 
indulge in some kind of fanatical rhetoric.  I do not remember it 
because it is not worthwhile remembering what that acronym stood 
for.  I would say to hon. members that perhaps CPP stands for a 
commitment to Paul's plan.  We are committed to the duty of 
government and we most certainly recognize the fact that the 
challenge of any government is to build a road for its citizens 
that will lead to a sense of self-satisfaction, a sense of 
self-esteem and a sense of fulfilment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This coruscating Bill C-2 most certainly rises to that 
challenge. May I even be so bold as to say that this is a 
bodacious bill.  Hon. members can look up that word. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I notice I have one minute left, Mr. Speaker.  One further 
minute to expound upon the great magnanimous qualities of Bill 
C-2.  This bill not only rises to the challenge, it supersedes 
it.  It eclipses the challenge not only for today, not only for 
tomorrow, but for weeks and possibly decades to come.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  I should remind hon. members that it 
is contrary to the rules to refer to the absence of members from 
the Chamber.  I would ask hon. members to bear that in mind in 
the course of their remarks. 
<P><A NAME="LINK165"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bob Mills (Red Deer, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the last 
member gave us a history lesson.  Let us just review very quickly 
some of the history since 1993.  We nearly lost Canada in a 
Quebec referendum.  We are $100 billion deeper in debt.  There 
are $26 billion in increased taxes.  Youth unemployment stands at 
17%.  Patronage appointments abound everywhere.  We have job 
equity.  The deception is that somehow our financial problems 
have been fixed although we have a $50 billion interest payment. 
Now comes the most severe tax grab that we have ever had where 
the tax will be raised from 5.6% to 9.9% of a person's income. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To show the total disrespect for democracy, we now have closure 
being used on this bill that affects almost all Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us go back in history to 1966 when this experiment in 
socialism was started.  We were told that deductions would never 
go above 5.5%.  However, with mismanagement we now have a pension 
plan that is underfunded by $560 billion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us talk about the pension plan as hon. members across the 
way want to keep talking about it.  Let us talk about young 
people.  They are the people who are going to be affected by this 
the most but let us also include seniors who have children and 
grandchildren. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are going to destroy the incentive of these young people.  We 
are going to rob them of their jobs because of these payroll tax 
deductions.  The small businessman is going to be put further 
down the line and his chances of survival are that much less. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During the last election I made up a little card.  This little 
card refers to exactly what this plan is all about.  I talked to 
many young people, particularly, in the workforce at their places 
of work.  I said to them “Let us think about what this plan is 
really about.  In the next six years you are going to go from a 
$935 maximum deduction if your income is $35,000 to a point where 
you are paying $1,645.  Your employer will have to match it. 
This is roughly $3,300.  If you are 30 years old you are going to 
paying that $3,300 for 35 years until you are 65.  At the end of 
that time you will get $8,800 provided you don't have too high an 
income.  If you have too high an income the government is going 
to claw it back from you.  Maybe what you are doing is really 
investing $3,300 a year for 35 or more years to get nothing”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What would be a better way?   Obviously, a better way would be 
to take that $3,300 and invest it in almost any kind of 
securities or program if it was compulsory.  If it was at only 
6%, at age 65 that very same person would have a $275,000 nest 
egg and would have an annuity that would pay $26,000 until death. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What kind of investment are we asking our young people to make? 
We are asking them to be robbed.  We are asking them to be part 
of this deceptive scheme that will take six years to implement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us come to the present.  The government is saying “We are 
very early in our mandate and so let us get the dirty things done 
quickly and then maybe people will forget about it.  Maybe the 
electorate will forget about it”. All of us in this House had 
better dedicate ourselves to making sure that the electorate 
knows what kind of robbery this is for our young people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to read some quotes.  I really think these are 
fitting.  Mr. Axworthy, who was a member of Parliament, was 
quoted on April 1, 1993 as saying “It displays the utter disdain 
with which this government treats the Canadian people,” when he 
talked about closure.  The House leader said on November 16, 1992 
as quoted in <I>Hansard</I>  “I am shocked. This is just terrible. 
This time we are talking about a major piece of legislation. 
Shame on those Tories across the way for using closure”.

<A HREF="#LINKT29"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, with all respect I must quote you on April 23, 1993 
from <I>Hansard</I> when you said “This is not the way to run 
Parliament.  This is an abuse of the process of this House”. I 
say to the government, it is a disgrace what it has just done, 
using closure on a piece of important legislation.  Mr. Speaker, 
we agree with you totally.  I tell you, they should go up in our 
caucus room because you are right. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know that you are close to the people of your riding and to 
the people of Canada, Mr. Speaker.  That is what the people are 
saying about this charade that we saw taking place today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government will continue to move closure.  That is the sad 
part about it.  This is just the beginning.  In the last House 
the government used closure 29 times, the most in the whole 
history of Parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The last member said “Hey, this is an honourable place”. This 
place has lost its democratic reason to exist. This place is a 
disgrace because of those people across the way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I trust that all of us are going back to our ridings and I trust 
that the people in those ridings are going to say “How can you 
shut down debate?  How can you not listen to us telling you about 
this robbery that is going to take place of every Canadian?” 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What are the options?  The government would like us to think 
that there are none.  But let us just quickly talk about those. 
There are many options.  Within six years I believe the 
government will admit it was wrong.  Of course it will not be the 
government at that point but when the government members are 
sitting across here they will say “That was probably the worst 
mistake we made in this House”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What are the options?  The options are obvious.  Let young 
people set up a private plan.  Let us take a look at what Britain 
is going to be doing.  It is going to that sort of a plan. The 
U.S. is pretty much committed to going to that plan within the 
next two years.  Australia and New Zealand have already done it. 
Chile has been on that plan for 16 years. Let us examine those. 
Let us see what other countries are doing so that we can do the 
same for the people of Canada. There are options out there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So that the hon. finance minister cannot continue to misquote 
the Reform position, let us tell people today that all of those 
people who have paid into the CPP will be paid out in a credit 
system whereby they will get a prorated pension plan for the 
years of contribution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It will take time to phase in this plan but we have to start it 
now.  All of us know that in time if we stay with the plan we 
have we will be going back for more contributions, more money, 
more tax grabs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to look at these options.  We have to present them in 
the House. They need to be debated here, but the government has 
closed down that option.  As we heard from the finance committee 
they do not even have it in their schedule to discuss this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we know from the last Parliament. the government will think 
nothing of using closure in committee, using closure at third 
reading and ramming this legislation through because it has a 
deadline of January 1.  When the workers start to realize that 
their contributions have gone from $935 to $1,645, we had better 
believe they are going to let people know and we better believe 
they will let the members across the way know.  Four years from 
now it should be time and it should have moved well enough along 
that the results will be at the ballot box. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, today has been a dark day for our country.  It 
has been a dark day for young people.  It is up to us to 
communicate that across the country.  All of us on this side of 
the House had better dedicate ourselves to that job.

Speaker, most in the House, indeed most Canadians, will 
understand very clearly the commitment that the government made 
to ensure that down the road we have a pension system that is not 
only fair to people today, but is fair to those who will need it 
later. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not news to members, certainly on this side of the House, 
of the wisdom that was shown by the hon. Minister of Finance in 
providing a new regime that will ensure sustainability of the 
pension system.  Most of us here campaigned on this.  It was an 
issue we discussed in the last Parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is very clear at least from the perspective of many members, 
certainly from Ontario and right across the country, that what we 
said is what we are about to do.  I have no trepidation in saying 
that in years to come I will be glad and so will many of my 
constituents that the benefits and fruits of this nation will be 
shared for generations to come. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not think one has to go too far to understand how we wound 
up in a situation where the initiative of this government and of 
several provincial governments who agreed to this formula came 
about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reality is that over the years this was a situation that we 
allowed to happen.  We simply allowed it to transpire.  We knew 
that the demographics of this country were changing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With the benefits of a health care system brought by, in many 
respects, the father of the hon. member and finance minister, and 
as a result of the medicare system which this party introduced 
many years ago, people are living longer.  The standard of living 
is high, very much as a result of the progress and the 
initiatives taken by the Liberal Party of which I am a proud 
member. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In order to sustain that program, in order to ensure that we 
have a viable pension system, someone had to take the bull by the 
horns. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am therefore rather proud of the initiatives taken by this 
government to ensure the survival of our pension program. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>No one in the House will be surprised to know that if nothing 
had been done by the government in Bill C-2, it is conceivable 
that in a few years the pension system, the program that helps 
our seniors, the disability benefits, the maternity leave which 
many, including my wife, take, would not be there. It would not 
be there in our time, in our generation, and perhaps even within 
the life of this Parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have heard hon. members opposite lamenting and saying “This 
could have better invested.  We could have done a lot of other 
things differently,” but the reality is that I do not think we 
walk around with a crystal ball in our hands anticipating what 
the problems are in the future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we strip away the politics of all of this, when we take 
away the partisanship that often clouds a decision that has to be 
taken, we find that what is being done is necessary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As members know, I did not take my MP pension.  Yet I believe it 
is very important to understand that most people of our 
generation would appreciate and would applaud what this 
government is doing today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am pleased to speak to the issue.  I am pleased to speak to 
the very necessary changes that are about to take place over the 
next little while. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are in a period of transition.  It must be clearly 
understood that, if we want to move into the new decade, the new 
millennium that is approaching, it is absolutely vital that we 
recognize problems before they arise. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The provinces that were involved in the negotiations dealing 
with the changes to CPP earlier this year also recognize and gave 
approval to the need to move ahead.  I do not think that what we 
are doing here is extraordinary.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I know there are those who believe that we should be doing other 
things, that there are all sorts of wonderful proposals out 
there.  It is far different to be sitting in the opposition 
knowing that you do not have to take seriously the reality of 
government than it is to be in a position where you are governing 
and you have to make decisions that will count, decisions that 
will stick and decisions that will sustain themselves over the 
years to come. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have one of the youngest communities, myself and the hon. 
member for Whitby—Ajax who I am very pleased to say has done a 
spectacular job as a member of Parliament and previously as a 
councillor.  I know we share in the common view that short term 
pain sometimes means long term gain, but in this instance we are 
not talking about gain for some.  I think that is what separates 
us from the opposition, the Reform Party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are here to ensure there is a modicum, a standard and a 
benchmark by which Canadians at the lower end of the economic 
spectrum will never be let down. That is a commitment that goes 
to the core of the Liberal Party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is one of the reasons that we also understand that we cannot 
get mired down in some of the wacky ideas that we can somehow 
spend our way out of these problems.  We understand people.  We 
understand the economics of the country in the 1990s as we go 
into the new millennium.  We also understand that if we want to 
sustain and we want to maintain programs that help people in a 
way that ensures equality, we have to take decisions that are 
sometimes tough decisions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am prepared to say today as a member who is often very 
outspoken on a number of issues that this is an initiative that I 
can support.  I support it because, and it may be trite to say, 
it is the right thing to do.  Members from across this country in 
years to come, in particular some of the members on the other 
side who are a little lighter in age as I am—well, I do have 
until next week at which point the age of wisdom kicks in—will 
appreciate that colleagues of their own, friends of theirs and 
neighbours will be taken care of and the initiatives taken by 
this government at this time in our lives helped.  They helped to 
bring people together, they helped to make sure those people had 
the very basics. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I noticed a smile from my hon. colleague in the New Democratic 
Party.  I can say that it is very very good to see so many 
shining beaming faces.  It is great not to be a rookie.  I know 
that hon. members in the short term will be very happy after the 
next election because I am sure that a pension will not be too 
far away for them.  There will be an opportunity for them to 
enjoy the very things we are putting forth today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The economy is growing.  There is no doubt the result of the 
decisions taken by the Minister of Finance with respect to 
bringing down interest rates is giving the engine of the economy 
the kind of drive that is taking place.  In communities where we 
once saw many closed shops and people out of work, we are now 
seeing a full recovery in bloom.  That did not just happen by 
accident. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We could also compare ourselves with what happened provincially 
with our counterparts in the province of Ontario who believe that 
to slash and burn is the way to go about things and at the same 
time wind up at the end of the day continuing to perpetuate a 
deficit.  We chose the balanced approach and we found lo and 
behold after our commitments in 1993 and 1997 that the balanced 
approach does indeed work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There will no doubt be much controversy surrounding any decision 
taken by a government that dares to lead and dares to challenge 
the wisdom of those who would like to say “Let us leave things 
the way they are, let us maintain the status quo”, but this is a 
government that is prepared to move ahead.  This is a government 
and a minister that are prepared to seize the agenda for the 
future and to seize an agenda that puts in its first instance all 
the interests of Canadians, particularly those who are the most 
vulnerable in our society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was just told by the member for Whitby—Ajax that that is the 
Liberal way.  I could not put it more eloquently and I terminate 
on that.  Let us move ahead with this bill.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In February of this year, the Minister of Finance introduced 
in this House the first version of the legislation on the Canada 
pension plan.  Its provisions were improved through the 
observations and comments made. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The changes put forward by the federal government were 
approved, as the act provides, by at least two thirds of the 
provinces representing two thirds of the population of Canada.  In 
all, eight provinces, including Quebec, approved the proposed 
changes.  Only British Columbia and Saskatchewan abstained. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-2, which the Minister of Finance introduced on September 
25, provides for a reform of the Canada pension plan, among other 
things.  There are three main thrusts to the reform.  The first 
is to increase funding of the system, to take it from two to five 
years, as proposed by the minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second thrust is to maximize the rate of return through 
the establishment of a Canada pension plan investment board.> 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, the bill will change certain benefits, such as 
disability benefits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-2 must follow the parliamentary process and be passed 
by Parliament in order to come into force.  Next the supporting 
orders in council must be approved by two thirds of the provinces 
representing two thirds of Canada's population.  The Minister of 
Finance expects all these changes to take effect on January 1, 
1998. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In order to assess this reform, let us take a brief look at the 
history of the Canada pension plan. It was established in 1966, and nine 
provinces joined, Quebec having its own retirement pension plan, the 
Quebec pension plan, commonly known as the QPP, which, incidentally, is 
also under review. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canada pension plan pays out approximately $17 billion a year 
in benefits. This amount includes survivor and disability benefits. The 
value of the pension fund is equivalent to 2 years benefits, or roughly 
$39 billion. Of course, this reform will have far-reaching effects on 
the premiums paid by those contributing to the Canada pension plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Employer-employee premiums will increase over the next six years to 
reach 9.9%, while the maximum contribution will rise from $975 to 
$1,635. Nevertheless, the actuarial report on which the government based 
its reform shows that, at this rate, the fund may run dry by the year 
2015 and contribution levels should be 14% instead of the current 5.85%. 
That is a 240% increase. You will understand that, between a 240% 
increase and the proposed 73% increase, I definitely prefer the latter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While being strongly in favour of this legislation, I must say 
that the reform affects Canadians more than Quebeckers, since 
very few Quebeckers get CPP. As of last August, there were 
between 12,000 and 13,000 Quebeckers in this situation.  These 
beneficiaries are Quebec residents who worked all their lives in 
another province and who only contributed to the CPP, such as a 
person living in Hull but who worked in Ontario and paid 
contributions in that province; members of the Canadian Armed 
Forces and the RCMP who reside in Quebec but paid contributions 
to the Canada pension plan, to the extent that they only 
contributed to that plan; and those people who receive CPP 
benefits but have settled in Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the critic on youth issues, I took a close look at the first 
two points I mentioned earlier, namely the funding of the plan 
and its optimal rate of return. The latter will be easier to 
achieve through the Canada pension plan investment board.  This 
board is essentially similar to Quebec's Caisse de dépôt et 
placement, except that it will not have any economic mandate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Its primary responsibility will be to achieve the best possible 
rate of return, so that today's young people stand a better chance of 
enjoying a retirement pension. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Moreover, having a reserve equivalent to five years of benefits 
instead of just two will provide a major fund with more money than is 
currently the case, thus ensuring that Canadians, and particularly 
people of my generation, will receive retirement benefits when the time 
comes.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although our party is in favour of this reform, I would like to 
mention a few observations and questions that will have to be addressed 
at the committee stage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To begin with, we all agree that premiums will increase under this 
plan.  These increases will be absorbed in part by my generation.  Will 
young people also see a decrease in their pension benefits?  Given 
comparable premiums in constant dollars, will the pensions young people 
receive on retiring be comparable to those of people now receiving 
benefits under the plan?  I would like these questions to be addressed, 
for there is a cloud hanging over intergenerational equity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As party critic, and as a young person myself, I find it 
interesting that the focus is on the future to ensure that future 
generations will have the same rights as today's generation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To give a better idea of where I am coming from, I would like to 
describe briefly the situation facing this country's youth.  Each year 
the rate of unemployment is somewhere between 16 and 17% and the 
activity rate for young people between the ages of 15 and 24 is 
dropping.  All the Liberal promises to create jobs for young people are 
slow to materialize, as is very clear from the rate of unemployment and 
the decreasing activity rate among young people since this government 
came to power.  The Bloc Quebecois is strongly in favour of 
responsibility for youth employment programs being returned to Quebec 
and will do everything in its power to bring this about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have said this over and over again, and I will keep saying it for 
the rest of this Parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Because of the Conservatives' successive restrictions on 
unemployment insurance and the Liberals' employment insurance reform, 
fewer young people are able to take advantage of this program.  This is 
yet another reform that served present generations in the past, but that 
will be inaccessible to my generation in the future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Employment insurance, as it is now known, is a measure that is 
almost completely inaccessible.  There are, of course, certain 
interesting adjustments, but for seasonal workers or young people 
graduating from university, this reform is completely inaccessible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, the principle followed by the Liberals with regard 
to premiums is simple: hold the line on premiums but cut back on 
accessibility. Increases in tuition fees are the result of cuts 
to provincial transfer payments for post-secondary education that 
were imposed by this government. Finally, poverty is an 
ever-increasing problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am greatly concerned about the future, about environmental 
questions, about a lot of issues, but one in particular which 
this House must discuss, namely the widening gap between the rich 
and poor. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For some years now, since 1980, in fact since the fall of the 
Berlin Wall, we have seen that capitalism is growing by leaps and 
bounds.  The rich are getting richer and the poor are getting 
poorer, with the government across the way and its reforms, 
particularly the employment insurance reform, which is 
impoverishing the poor still further. I think this is cause for 
concern. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I recently saw statistics indicating that the number of 
millionaires in the world has doubled.  This is cause for concern. 
This is probably one of the consequences of the notion of the 
global village, the world market, which makes it easier for the 
rich to get richer, and more easily. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Markets are opening up increasingly toward Asia.  The world is 
becoming one huge global market.  Will this accentuate the 
difference between the rich and the poor?  I am sounding an alarm, 
and I believe that considerable thought must be given to this. I 
think we shall be able to find a way out, but at what price? 
Tenacity and perseverance will be needed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What I wanted to show with my speech is that the Bloc Quebecois 
is not here to oppose anything that moves, everything the 
government does.  On the contrary, we are delighted with the 
pension reform.  As a member of the Standing Committee on Human 
Resources Development, I shall make it my duty, along with my 
colleagues, to ensure that all the reforms will apply equally to 
the coming generations and that everyone will be able to benefit 
from these services.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Jean Augustine (Etobicoke—Lakeshore, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I am pleased to participate in the debate to amend the 
Canada pension plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Etobicoke—Lakeshore there are many seniors who have written, 
who have spoken with me and who have attended consultation 
meetings where we discussed the changes and the need for changes 
to the Canada pension plan.  The plan is a primary source of 
income on which many Canadians rely in retirement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Indeed, Canadians are greatly concerned about any changes to the 
plan which might have an adverse effect on their economic 
stability. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As members of Parliament, it is our duty to ensure that the 
financial future of all Canadians is secure and that Canadians 
will continue to have confidence in the Canada pension plan.  The 
Liberal government is taking the responsibility for the future 
direction of the plan seriously by initiating the proposed 
changes.  The changes are reflective of the Liberal government's 
belief in assisting, providing and protecting those in need. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I support Bill C-2, the legislation to amend the plan because 
that legislation will ensure that we have an improved and 
effective public pension plan that protects individuals in 
retirement.  In an age where a wide variety of financial 
instruments are available to Canadians to prepare for retirement, 
not all Canadians can afford or have the protection of RRSPs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Experts on CPP have drawn the government's attention to the fact 
that in light of national realities such as an aging population, 
the decline in population growth, that the plan needs to be 
tailored to match the demographic realities of our country. We 
are facing up to the demographic realities by securing the future 
of the CPP. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The proposed changes were the result of a lengthy consultation 
process with provincial and territorial governments, 
professionals in the actuarial and insurance professions, 
representatives of social planning organizations, seniors, young 
people and other Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>From this process, one thing was clear:  Canadians want a 
national pension plan even if changes are necessary to ensure its 
viability in the future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It has been established by repeated government studies that 
payouts lagged behind the contributions.  We need to have payouts 
and contributions in line so that Canadians can have a plan 
beyond the year 2015.  This means that in order to maintain the 
current benefit structure, contribution rates need to increase by 
14% of income by the year 2030. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is interesting that the consultation which I held in 
Etobicoke—Lakeshore, individuals were talking about 15%.  A 14% 
increase in CPP premiums is a rate that most Canadians would find 
difficult to manage.  There needs to be a middle ground in 
relation to what Canadians are willing to pay into and receive 
from the plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under the legislation, marginal increases to contribution rates 
will be slowly phased in over a seven-year period.  Contributions 
will be increased by .4% of income this year and will go to 9.9% 
of income by the year 2003 as compared with the current rate of 
5.85%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As evidenced, the increase in contribution rates will not be 
dramatic and therefore Canadians can have a secure CPP that is 
affordable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to reiterate the facts of the proposed changes that 
the hon. Minister of Finance has given on numerous occasions in 
the last Parliament and which are echoed in this Parliament by 
many colleagues.  My constituents would like to hear that current 
benefits such as CPP retirement pensions, disability benefits, 
survivor benefits or combined benefits are not affected by the 
amendments in Bill C-2.  Any Canadian over age 65 as of December 
31, 1997 who elects to receive CPP as of this date their pension 
will not be affected. 
Likewise all benefits under the CPP except death benefits will be 
fully indexed to inflation.  If Canadians choose to retire at age 
60 or 65 or up to age 70, these ages of eligibility for 
retirement will remain unchanged.

<A HREF="#LINKT35"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are the principal tenets of the CPP that will remain 
intact.  As the government embarks on rebuilding a sound CPP 
plan, Canadians who are not now in receipt of CPP need to know 
that there will be future changes.  Future beneficiaries who will 
be in receipt of retirement pensions will see a change in 
benefits because calculations will be based on five years of 
pensionable earnings instead of the current three years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The disability component of CPP will be affected by the proposed 
changes.  An applicant who is eligible to receive disability 
benefits would have to contribute to the CPP in four of the last 
six years instead of two of the last three years or five of the 
last ten years which is the current contribution requirement. 
Benefits for these applicants will be calculated based on the 
applicant's maximum pensionable earnings at the time of 
disablement instead of at age 65. I know that these are issues 
that many of us deal with in our constituency offices. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Changes will be made to payments of death benefits.  CPP 
contributors will continue to receive death benefit payments 
under the plan, but again the benefit will continue to be based 
on six months of retirement benefits. They will see a decrease 
and this decrease is due to the fact that we want to address the 
problem of income disparity by ensuring that low income Canadians 
are not adversely impacted by the proposed changes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These proposed changes to the CPP will ensure that Canadians 
will continue to have an economically viable and stable pension 
plan that meets their future retirement needs.  The intent of 
these changes is to give us better options and to ensure the 
viability of the plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I call on all members at this point in time to support this 
initiative for the benefit of all Canadians.

vulnerable and difficult. 
This is why I wish to react to the changes proposed to the Canada

creation of an independent agency to administer the plan and a 
reduction in benefits to those least well off in our society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In his press release on the new bill, the Minister of Finance 
said that the changes would ensure the plan's long term viability, 
while making it fairer and more affordable for future generations 
of Canadians.

changes. They must be given an opportunity to express their views. When 
one is elected to this House, one is supposed to be able to participate

</I></B></P><P align=left>The changes proposed in this bill hurt Canadians.

least four out of the past six years to be eligible for CPP disability 
benefits. If this bill is passed, one will be required to have worked 
during two of the past three years or five of the past six to be 
eligible for disability benefits. With the proposed changes, some people 
who are currently eligible would no longer be eligible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another problem is the whole issue of survivor and death benefits. 
At present, the maximum is set at $3,580 for a person receiving survivor 
benefits. 
These have been reduced to $2,500 with the maximum being frozen, and 
this will be especially harmful to widows and separated women who live 
alone for a longer time. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-2 also freezes the low level of earnings that is exempt 
from CPP contributions.  This back door increase of CPP 
contributions is regressive because it affects people with low 
levels of earnings the most.  The year's basic exemptions, the 
first $3,500 of earnings, is no longer indexed to inflation which 
means that the low income workers, many of whom are women, would 
have to pay more in contributions. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill also includes amendments to the CPP's financial provisions 
and changes the plan into an additional tax and a make-work project for 
bankers, who are good friends of the Liberals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-2 speeds up the planned increase in the contribution rate to 
the CPP. The rate, which is currently set at 5.85%, will rise to 9.9% by 
the year 2003, a 73% increase over a six year period. This rapid 
increase in the contribution rate is a concern for several reasons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, the CPP will be refinanced at the expense of low income 
people, particularly women. 
To shift responsibility for refinancing the CPP to those who are least 
able to do so, as our Liberal friends are proposing, is irresponsible 
and will have a harmful impact on future generations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This tax will also have to be paid by small businesses, many of 
which will have a hard time meeting a 73% increase. It will prompt some 
of them to go underground when it comes to managing their business or 
hiring employees. Creating an environment that makes the underground 
economy more attractive is harmful to all Canadians, and this concerns 
me a great deal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition to their ill-conceived idea of increasing contributions 
at the expense of the poor, the Liberals will establish the Canada 
pension plan investment board, whose role will be to manage the reserve 
fund so as to maximize revenue. 
However, the Liberals are not telling us that the board will not have 
the mandate to promote investments in our domestic economy. I support 
job creation programs, but I have a serious problem when I see that 
friends of the Liberals, namely bankers, are the ones who will benefit, 
while ordinary Canadians are still waiting for the Liberals to fulfill 
their commitments and create jobs for them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This government keeps promising jobs for all Canadians, but its 
proposed changes to the CPP's financial provisions mean more power for 
the big wigs and more hardship for ordinary people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me give an example. Why does the government accept that, when 
an accident occurs in the workplace, the CPP provides benefits for the 
injured worker, instead of the workers compensation board? 
It is a way of abusing the system and still keeping an eye out for their 
friends.

</I></B></P><P align=left>We must also come to the defence of the universal public pension 
system.  An older population does not mean we must adopt an 
individualized approach or that we must privatize our public pension 
system.  On the contrary, our European friends offer good examples of 
societies with older populations that now have public pension plans. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals have manufactured a crisis around the CPP in order to 
be able to attack the concept of the universality of our pensions and to 
save money on the backs of society's weakest members. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian public pension system is a crucial part of the 
Canadian social security net.  The CPP and the OAS have been 
particularly important for lower and middle income seniors.  It 
embodies the values Canadians share and ensures a fair 
redistribution of wealth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Thanks to public pensions Canada has made tremendous gains in 
overcoming poverty among senior citizens and has provided much 
better prospects for retirement with dignity.  In the three 
decades since the CPP was adopted, the poverty rate among 
Canadians 65 and older fell to 10.9% in 1995 from 33.5% in 1980. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The battle against poverty among seniors is far from over. Today 
one of every five elderly persons still lives in poverty. In 1993 
the poverty rate for seniors increased over the previous year in 
almost every province.  Scaling back CPP and OAS benefits will 
hurt low and middle income seniors.  We have a responsibility to 
present and future senior citizens to oppose this legislation and 
protect our public pension plan. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The health of the CPP is directly tied to the rate of economic 
growth and a good level of employment, which increases the government's 
revenues.  This government's many cuts, high interest rates, the present 
high rate of unemployment, and modest incomes have done more damage to 
the CPP than the aging of the population. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is terrible to see a government that calls itself democratic 
refusing to let the debate continue, in this House, to get to the 
bottom of things.  It is unacceptable.  We were elected to this 
House to debate legislation. The CPP is of real importance to all 
Canadians, and the Liberal government turned its back on them 
today by refusing to allow the debate to continue.  That is 
regrettable.  What the Government of Canada has done today is 
truly shameful.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Maloney (Erie—Lincoln, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to be able to join in the debate on the Canada pension 
plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In February of this year the Liberal government acting with the 
provinces took the lead to place the Canada pension plan on a 
solid financial footing.  The recent changes to the Canada 
pension plan will do two important things.  It will secure its 
sustainability and will stabilize the contribution rates. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We should not forget that the plan is jointly managed by the 
federal and provincial governments, and changes can only be made 
to it if approved by two-thirds of the provinces representing 
two-thirds of the population.  All provinces, with the exception 
of British Columbia and Saskatchewan, support the reforms. Yes, 
let us look at it.  The reforms are supported by Newfoundland, 
Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, Prince Edward Island, Quebec, 
Ontario, Manitoba and Alberta. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The consultation process was very extensive.  During the 33 
sessions held in 18 cities throughout the country, more than 270 
formal presentations were held to find out what Canadians thought 
should happen to their plan.  Canadians had no hesitation.  They 
asked to have the plan preserved, its finances strengthened and 
its investment practices improved. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those who advocate scrapping the CPP and moving to a privatized 
system with mandatory retirement savings plans do not understand 
two things.  First, Canadians want the CPP to remain. Second, the 
CPP provides protection not available through private RRSPs, such 
as disability benefits, provision for women of childbearing age 
and survivor and death benefits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The CPP premiums are insurance premiums paid by working 
Canadians into a public pension plan from which they draw 
benefits when they retire.  To insinuate otherwise by calling the 
rate increase in contributions a tax grab is misleading and 
confusing. The CPP revenues are not revenues of the Government of 
Canada. The fund is jointly administered by the federal and 
provincial governments for the benefit of citizens, not for the 
benefit of governments.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Critics who maintain that the CPP is an insufficient public 
pension plan conveniently forget that it is only one of three 
pillars of our retirement system.  The old age security and 
guaranteed income supplement system and private retirement 
savings plans such as RRSPs are the other two pillars.  Action 
has already been taken by this government to consolidate the OAS 
and GIS into what we call the proposed seniors benefit which is 
designed to help those most in need. Taken together, these 
systems provide a good balance of government and individual 
responsibility for retirement income security. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These changes in the CPP reflect the long held Liberal values of 
providing stability for and protecting those in need. It is a 
balanced approach. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today the 5.85% legislated CPP contribution rate is shared 
equally between employees and employers.  Contributions are 
levied on earnings between $3,500 and $35,800.  Under the 
existing legislation, rates were to rise to 10.1% by the year 
2016.  Yes they were to rise to 10.1%, although people forget 
that.  However the chief actuary of the CPP indicated that 
without these changes the CPP fund would be depleted by the year 
2015 and contribution rates would have to increase to 14.2% by 
the year 2030 to cover escalating costs. Clearly the CPP was not 
sustainable and something had to be done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal and provincial ministers agreed on a three part 
approach to restore the financial sustainability of the CPP and 
make it fair and affordable for future generations.  They did 
this by moving to fuller funding by accelerating contribution 
rate increases now so they will not have to exceed 10% for future 
generations.  We have come in at 9.9%  They are improving the 
rate of return for the CPP fund by investing it prudently and by 
having a diversified portfolio of securities at an arm's length 
from the government.  They are slowing the growth in costs by 
tightening the administration of benefits and changing the way 
some are calculated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Speaking about fuller funding, when the CPP was introduced in 
1966 it was financed as a pay as you go system.  The prospects of 
rapid growth in real wages and labour force participation 
promised that the CPP could be sustained and remain affordable. 
As well, building up large reserves in a world of real low 
interest rates would not have been much help.  The pay as you go 
CPP system made sense given those circumstances. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since then however the slowdown in wages and workforce growth 
and higher real interest rates have completely changed the 
circumstances in which the CPP must be financed.  The pay as you 
go financing is no longer fair, appropriate and possible. 
Building up a larger fund, fuller funding, and earning a higher 
rate of return through investment in the market will help pay for 
the rapidly growing cost that will occur once baby boomers begin 
to retire. Accordingly the CPP will move from a pay as you go 
financing system to fuller funding to build up substantially 
larger reserve of funds.  The fund will grow in value from about 
two years of benefits currently to about four or five years of 
benefits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Indeed contribution rates will rise in steps over the next six 
years from the current rate of 5.85% to 9.9% of contributory 
earnings and then remain steady, instead of rising to 14.2% by 
the year 2030 as projected by the chief actuary.  In dollar terms 
an employee earning $35,800 a year now pays about $945 in annual 
contributions.  In 2003 that employee will contribute about 
$1,635.  This is $450 more than what is currently legislated for 
that year.  However by 2030 an employee would be paying $565 less 
a year than if we had not acted now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Increasing rates more rapidly now will cover the cost of each 
contributor's own benefits plus a uniform share of the unfunded 
burden that has built up.  These costs will not be passed on to 
future generations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At present the CPP has a fund equal to about two years of 
benefits. Funds not required immediately to pay benefits are 
invested in non-marketable provincial government securities. 
Provinces pay interest at the federal long term bond rate when 
the bonds are purchased. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Fuller funding of the CPP means that the fund will grow 
substantially from about two years of benefits to about four or 
five over the next two decades.  A new investment policy is 
required to secure the best possible return for contributors.  A 
higher investment return on the fund will keep contribution rates 
down.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Thus our ministers have agreed that the CPP funds will be 
invested in a diversified portfolio of securities in the best 
interests of contributors and beneficiaries, much like private 
sector plans. The fund will be managed professionally at arm's 
length from government by an investment board accountable to both 
the public and government through regular reports. The board will 
be subject to investment rules similar to other pension plan 
funds in Canada. The foreign property limits of the pension funds 
will also apply to the CPP fund. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the provinces now borrow from the CPP, they will pay the 
same rate of interest that they do on their market borrowings. 
This is a very welcome step. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us review some of the changes to the benefits and their 
administration I indicated earlier.  The formula for adjusting 
previous earnings in calculating retirement benefits will be 
based on the average of the year's maximum pensionable earnings 
over the last five years instead of the three currently, prior to 
starting the pension. The amount of the pension will continue to 
depend on how much and for how long a person contributes to that 
plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To be eligible for disability benefits, workers must show 
greater attachment to the labour force. They must have made CPP 
contributions on earnings over $3,500 in four of the last six 
years prior to becoming disabled.  Prior to 1987 disabled 
coverage was available to those who had contributed for at least 
five of the last 10 years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Retirement pensions for disability beneficiaries will be based 
on the maximum pensionable earnings at the time of disability and 
then fully price indexed to age 65.  This measure is consistent 
with how other CPP benefits are calculated and will apply only to 
the people not yet over the age of 65. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The death benefit will be equal to six months of retirement 
benefits, up to a maximum of $2,500.  Currently the maximum is 
set at 10%, $3,508 in 1997.  The option of eliminating the 
benefit was rejected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Stewardship and accountability was a concern that has been 
responded to.  To improve stewardship for the CPP and provide for 
more accountability so that the sustainability of the CPP will no 
longer be at risk has been accomplished as follows. 
Federal-provincial reviews will be required every three years 
instead of every five. Any future improvements will be fully 
funded. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There have been criticisms to which I would like to respond. 
Some say these payroll taxes are job killers and why are we 
planning on increasing the CPP contributions by almost 70% over 
the next six years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Governing is about making choices and sometimes these choices 
are difficult.  If the CPP is going to be there for young 
generations, we have no choice but to start paying our way for 
the CPP now rather than passing on an insupportable burden to our 
children.  As I pointed out, if we did nothing, CPP contributions 
would rise to 14.2% by the year 2030.  We have held them to 9.9%. 
The increase in the contribution rate is being phased in over six 
years to minimize the impact on the labour market. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unlike the CPP contributions that are a savings toward pensions, 
EI premiums are an additional payroll tax that finance current 
expenditures. We have also said that we will bring down the EI 
premiums as soon as and as fast as it makes sense, and we are 
doing that as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This legislation represents a significant step forward to 
fulfilling our commitment to a secure Canadian retirement income 
system. These changes will strengthen our pension system so it 
will continue to give Canadians the opportunity to build 
sufficient incomes for their retirement.

party is profoundly disappointed with the lack of vision 
demonstrated by the government with Bill C-2. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With Bill C-2 the government had an opportunity to demonstrate 
courage and vision for Canadians.  The government had an 
opportunity to stop taxing, especially payroll taxes which are 
killing jobs in Canada.  They have been demonstrated around the 
world as being the single biggest impediment to the growth of 
jobs not just in the Canadian economy, but in the U.S. and the 
U.K. economies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even the Netherlands in 1983 had an unemployment rate in excess 
of 13%.  In 1983 the Government of the Netherlands recognized 
that high taxes kill jobs. As such the government reduced payroll 
taxes, reduced general taxation and reduced regulations on small 
business.  It has achieved a reduction of 15% to the extent that 
now in the Netherlands the unemployment rate is less than 7%.

Canadians and what we need to do to ensure the sustainable growth 
of the Canadian economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I come from a small business background.  Most of my family has 
been in small business for the last three generations.  One thing 
we recognize in small business is when we only have so much 
coming in, in terms of general revenue, we can only afford to do 
so much with that amount.  It is not a limitless pit as the 
government might feel. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It stands to reason when payroll taxes are increased small 
businesses will not be able to hire as many people as they would 
otherwise want to hire. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Subsidies designed by the government to entice people toward 
particular actions and to move them in particular directions are 
the exact opposite of taxes.  This in itself should demonstrate 
to the government that reducing payroll taxes would help 
stimulate growth in the Canadian economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-2 and the $11 billion tax grab on ordinary Canadians 
without reducing employment insurance premiums will create 
further impediments to job growth.  This is unacceptable to 
Canadians, especially to young Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I speak to the students with whom I went to university and 
hear their stories of graduating with degrees and significant 
student loan debts, my heart goes out to them.  I feel very badly 
for their circumstances.  While the government through words says 
that it shares this pain and wants to do something about it, when 
given the opportunity to act decisively it consistently fails to 
demonstrate the vision these young people need. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Trade is a tenet of our party's policy.  It is something that we 
have been consistent on in terms of supporting the values of free 
trade.  We have consistently recognized the importance and the 
opportunity that trade provides to Canadians.  In a country where 
trade provides 40% of our GDP we should recognize that when we 
overtax Canadian companies and individuals we create a 
significant impediment to our ability to help companies to be 
competitive internationally.  This will create a further 
disincentive to the creation of jobs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are a trading nation, yet we have higher payroll taxes than 
our major trading partners.  Perhaps this explains why we in 
Canada have over twice the unemployment rate of the U.S.  We have 
a significantly higher unemployment rate than that of the U.K. We 
have three times the unemployment rate of Japan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How will young Canadians move forward with a government that 
continues to hold them back? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-2 is another example of a government that does not trust 
its own people to make decisions with its own money.  When 
government takes money from people through taxation, it is 
essentially saying that it is in a better position to determine 
what to do with that money than the individuals.  The government 
has demonstrated unequivocally that they have not earned the 
right to make those decisions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Consistent with that lack of trust in the Canadian people, the 
government continues to fail to give them an opportunity where 
they invest their RRSP savings.  To limit Canadians opportunities 
to invest internationally and to maximize their returns to 
provide for their families for their futures is unconscionable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this day and age we have an opportunity through history to 
learn the lessons of economics, especially the economics over the 
last 30 years.  It demonstrates without hesitation or 
equivocation how taxation or any barrier placed by government on 
small and medium size business, especially in a trading 
environment, prevents jobs.

</I></B></P><P align=left>This government cannot claim ignorance to these facts.  I find 
it unacceptable that this government continues to move in this 
direction without recognizing this.  My constituents and in 
particular the small business community have expressed this to 
me.  I come from Atlantic Canada where many small businesses are 
struggling to survive.  They would very much like to expand and 
hire more people but this government continues to put barriers in 
their way to this type of job growth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Flexibility of the workforce is very important.  As we enter the 
21st century it is critical that governments understand that 
people and businesses need more flexibility in hiring practices 
and the transferability of benefits, all the things that 
economists agree on.  We have not yet been able to convince this 
government and instead of listening and responding to the needs 
of Canadians and to basic economic truths, it is going to ram 
Bill C-2 through this House and continue to force Canadians to 
endure longer sustained high unemployment in this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We do believe in ensuring a sustainable future for the Canada 
pension plan.  There are some members of this House who do not 
think it is important to protect 225,000 disabled Canadians 
through the Canada pension plan.  However we recognize that the 
Canada pension plan is an important vehicle for those people in 
our society who need us to provide a level of support for them 
because they cannot provide that for themselves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For many Canadians the single biggest difficulty that lies in 
front of them is a government that refuses to allow them access 
to the tools of job growth.  Small business, especially a small 
business that is involved in international trade, is going to be 
and should be the engine of job growth in this country. Why this 
government insists on preventing small business people and young 
people from taking their rightful place in the international 
business community instead of providing them with opportunities 
to succeed and to ensure that future generations of Canadians are 
successful, we do not understand. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It takes courage sometimes to make the right decision.  It takes 
vision and it takes a level of understanding and intelligence. We 
sincerely hope that the Canadian people in the next election will 
try to seek the type of leadership that will provide Canadians 
with this type of government.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Elinor Caplan (Thornhill, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is 
an honour and a privilege to rise in this House and speak to an 
issue that I believe was of concern to all of the residents of 
Thornhill, the young and the old. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I begin, I would like to tell this House a little bit about 
the riding of Thornhill.  Thornhill is a newly created riding, 
created by redistribution.  For the very first time since the 
1970s, we see Thornhill put back together again. The provincial 
government had divided Thornhill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If one visits the riding one will find that old Thornhill 
straddles both sides of Yonge Street, part of it in the town of 
Vaughan and part of it in Markham.  Now for the very first time 
with the creation of the new federal riding of Thornhill, 
Markham, Vaughan, Concord and all of the wonderful communities 
within those entities have come together under the name of 
Thornhill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Thornhill is a vibrant riding with many businesses.  I have to 
say that the businesses are very aware of the need for fixing the 
Canada pension plan and the problems that have plagued the Canada 
pension plan for many years.  Each one who works in a business or 
who owns a business understands the importance of the Canada 
pension plan to Canadians and to Canadian values.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Within Thornhill is a very young community.  As I knocked on 
doors and met people from all over the world, one of the things 
that was clear was that people in Thornhill are concerned about 
whether or not we will have in place in the future programs and 
plans like the Canada pension plan to protect them when they get 
sick and need disability insurance. Many were aware of the 
problems that have existed for some time with Canada pension 
plan.  Many were aware of the need for the plan to be fixed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I approached Bill C-2 from the following perspective.  The first 
question I asked was, is there a problem?  The answer to that 
question is yes, there is a problem.  The problem is not a new 
one.  It has existed for a long time. We could stand, we could 
point fingers and we could say “During the years of the 
Conservative government it did nothing to fix the plan”.  That 
would not be productive, although it would be true. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The response of the government has been that there is a problem. 
What did it do about that?  It did two things. The first thing 
it did was consult Canadians to make them aware of the problem. 
The people of Thornhill are very aware that there are problems 
with the Canada pension plan.  They are aware that if it is left 
untouched and unchanged, the plan will implode. It will not be 
there for future generations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not think that many of the young people in Thornhill 
believed that the Canada pension plan would ever be there for 
them.  The seniors in Thornhill were very concerned because they 
said “How will changes to this plan impact me?” 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important that these questions be answered.  Not only did 
the government consult widely with Canadians, it also sat down 
with the provinces.  While the Canada pension plan is a federal 
pension plan in the eyes of the people, the reality is that it is 
a federal-provincial plan. Changes can only occur if a majority 
of the provinces approve and recognize that a significant 
majority of the people of this country approve the changes. In 
other words the federal government could not unilaterally make 
these changes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To those constituents in Thornhill who, when I knocked on their 
doors, said “Isn't it possible for governments to work 
together,” I say to them and to everyone in the House that Bill 
C-2 is an example of governments working together. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Was it unanimous?  Absolutely not.  Did they get a national 
consensus?  Yes, I believe the governments did.  A majority of 
the provinces, including Ontario, representing a significant 
majority of the population of Canada, have signed an agreement to 
make changes to the Canada pension plan that will solve the 
problem. The plan will be fixed and I will be able to say to the 
next generation, to the young people of Thornhill and to the 
young people of Canada, that the Canada pension plan will be 
there for them in future generations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is the commitment of the government and that is what Bill 
C-2 accomplishes.  It fixes a problem that has been identified 
and it ensures that the plan is viable into the future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The next test and the next question that I asked on behalf of 
the people of Thornhill was “Is this done fairly?  Is it done 
with accountability to the people who rely on this plan and want 
to know that it is there?”
