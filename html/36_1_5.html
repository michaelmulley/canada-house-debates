<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>RESUMPTION OF DEBATE ON ADDRESS IN REPLY 
</H4><P align=left>

</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed from September 25 consideration of the motion 
for an address to His Excellency the Governor General in reply to 
his speech at the opening of the session and of the amendment. 
<P><A NAME="LINK4"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Walt Lastewka (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Industry, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, it is a great pleasure for me 
to rise in the House today to speak for the first time in the 
36th Parliament and to talk about what is important to this 
session of Parliament and Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before I do so I would like to congratulate you on your 
appointment and I am sure that during the many deliberations that 
this House will be having we will keep you on your toes from time 
to time but, as the Speaker has said, this is Friday and things 
are a bit different on Fridays. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First and most important I want to take this opportunity to 
thank my constituents, the people of St. Catharines, for choosing 
me to represent them here in the nation's capital in the House 
of Commons once again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remind my colleagues, both new and old, that we are 
representatives of Canadians like those in St. Catharines who 
have concerns about jobs, about health care, about their children 
and grandchildren. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My riding of St. Catharines is known as the garden city.  We 
have gentler winters and warmer summers than we have here in the 
nation's capital and that is why our tender fruit is so sweet and 
our wine is just right.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It also makes for good times for watching the ships slide 
through the Welland canal or to go rowing on Martindale pond, the 
future site of the 1999 world rowing championships. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition to thanking my constituents for their continued 
support I want to warmly welcome the new members to the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am also honoured to stand before you as the recently appointed 
Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Industry.  I see this 
not only as a challenge but as a wonderful opportunity to work 
with all my colleagues in this House, to help Canadian businesses 
to succeed, to help them grow to create jobs and to make Canada 
the best country in the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Speech from the Throne, which we are debating today, marks 
the next stage in our government's commitment to work with 
Canadians and Canadian businesses to create and seize 
opportunities in the global knowledge based economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada's solid economic foundation is something that we put in 
place with the help and sacrifice of many Canadians.  I want to 
remind the House that over the last four years we have also been 
working hard to promote innovation, advance the information 
highway, increase trade and create opportunities for Canadians in 
the new economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I take this opportunity to outline some of our recent 
initiatives in the industry portfolio and how we will continue to 
improve the various department endeavours. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Over the last four years we have been getting Canadians 
connected and putting them on the information highway.  This 
strategy calls for a high quality, low cost information network 
that will give Canadians access to employment information, 
education, health care, entertainment, investment and wealth 
creating opportunities in the technology sector. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The strategy seeks to promote job creation through innovation 
and investment, reinforce Canadian cultural sovereignty and 
identity and to ensure that we have universal access to the 
information highway wherever we are in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, the Strategis program and Industry Canada's on-line 
business information service have been demonstrated to business 
owners and managers at special events throughout this country at 
trade and information shows.  Almost 13 million documents have 
been accessed through Strategis, which is available to Canadians 
instantly on the Internet. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The community access program is designed to connect rural and 
remote areas and aboriginal communities to the Internet.  As 
stated in our throne speech, the mandate before 2001 is to 
connect well over 5,000 rural communities across Canada to the 
Internet to help them to get information at home or at their 
business. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The SchoolNet program will encourage the connection of some 
16,500 schools, 3,400 libraries and 450 first nation schools to the 
Internet by the end of 1998-99. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For everyone's information, well over 9,500 schools and 1,200 
public libraries have been connected.  Each day across this 
country new libraries are being connected to this excellent 
program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another program called computers for schools redirects surplus 
computer equipment to schools and public libraries throughout the 
country.  To date close to 40,000 computers and 60,000 software 
packages have been delivered to schools across this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The student connection program hires university and college 
students to teach small businesses how to use the Internet 
because everybody needs to get on line and it takes time and 
effort for each of these businesses to do what has to be done in 
the new economy.  It helps them improve their competitiveness and 
create new opportunities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my province alone, Ontario, well over 2,200 firms have been 
assisted by our students to be connected to the Internet.

<A HREF="#LINKT2"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, the industry portfolio has been working to realize 
our international potential.  The department has been working 
with its many partners to help existing exporters identify and 
access new trading opportunities and provide at the same time 
perspective exporters with the information, the skills and the 
tools they need to be export ready. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have a number of international trade centres across this 
country, including one in my province, the one in Toronto. It 
serves as a focal point for the delivery of market information, 
counselling and other support to potential exporters across the 
province. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1996 the centre responded to well over 10,000 requests.  In 
addition, Industry Canada and foreign affairs have established an 
active networks of trained executives across the country, those 
people who can assist small businesses, in fact any businesses, 
whether home business or even large businesses, in export. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The National Research Council's industrial research assistance 
program has been helping SMEs right across this country. IRAP 
helps members of Parliament in their ridings to help their 
businesses which then create jobs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my area of Niagara where we have some 31 cottage wineries a 
partnership with IRAP has created a special wine industry, known 
worldwide, receiving many medals. That was an initiative with 
IRAP, the grape growers and the wine industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Later next month we will be opening up an oenology and 
viticulture institute at Brock University, an excellent endeavour 
for the university, its students, its grape growers and the wine 
industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many of our universities across Canada participate in networks 
of centres of excellence where they link together and work 
together for research and development.  This area will be 
improved and will be continually supported by this government 
because of the excellent work that has been going on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I should also point out that the Canada community investment 
program has been an endeavour which 20 communities across this 
country, and all provinces and territories have at least one, 
have been using to improve access to capital. This is another 
area where we must continue on to help those communities that do 
not have major banking centres and financial centres but which 
need access to capital. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe, as set out in the throne speech, that consumer 
confidence is growing and new businesses have been created. There 
is much work to do with all of us working together in our 
communities, our ridings, for the betterment of our country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It will be my endeavour to work with as many members in this 
House and companies and communities across this country in 
assistance to the Minister of Industry to make sure that we are 
continuing on the right track to help us grow as a country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have outlined many initiatives pertaining to people, 
innovators, businesses and communities at work across this 
country.  I believe the Speech from the Throne is a framework to 
lead our country into the 21st century, and the good news is that 
much of our work is already well under way.  We must continue to 
work at it in this mandate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to thank you, Madam Speaker, and again congratulate you 
on your appointment.  I am sure many of us will have many 
discussions with you in the next four years. 
<P><A NAME="LINK5"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jack Ramsay (Crowfoot, Ref.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I too 
would like to congratulate you on your appointment and I can 
assure you that you will certainly get as much co-operation as we 
are able to muster in this House for your administration of the 
affairs of this House in the days to come.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I rise today in response to the Speech from the Throne.  Nothing 
in that speech assures me or the people of this country that the 
integrity of Canada's justice system will be restored by the 
government or the new justice minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many areas in justice should have been addressed in the throne 
speech but were not. We could look at the need for the reform of 
the Young Offenders Act, the elimination of the faint hope 
clause, exempting violent offenders from conditional sentencing 
and, of course, a victims' bill of rights.  These are all issues 
of great concern to Canadians and issues which Reform intend to 
pursue with vigour in this session of Parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>According to a July 1997 Angus Reid poll, 52% of Canadians have 
lost faith in our courts and our justice system. This is a 
serious matter.  Why have so many Canadians lost faith in our 
justice system and particularly our courts?  That is the question 
I would like to focus my remarks on today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians' faith in our justice system can only be further 
shattered by the scandalous affair perpetrated by senior 
officials within the justice department, aided and abetted by the 
federal court and concealed from the people of this country by 
the intentional ignoring or oversight of the facts by the former 
justice minister and the Hon. Charles Dubin. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1996 a series of indiscretions were committed by Associate 
Deputy Attorney General Ted Thompson who deliberately and 
knowingly interfered with the judicial independence of Associate 
Chief Justice Jerome who was conducting a hearing into the 
deportation orders of three suspected Nazi war criminals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In an attempt to protect his close friend from embarrassment, 
Ted Thompson telephoned Chief Justice Isaac to warn him of the 
proposed supreme court reference.  The chief justice of 
the federal court and Judge Jerome's administrative superior 
arranged for Mr. Thompson to meet with him in his chambers to 
discuss the matter further.   An exchange of letters ensued in 
which Thompson outlined the chronology of the court delays on the 
three cases. This was all done without the knowledge of defence 
counsel. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Chief Justice Isaac then called Judge Jerome to a meeting and 
advised him of the threat of a supreme court reference if the 
pace of the hearings into the three deportation cases did not 
pick up.  With Judge Jerome's assistance, Chief Justice Isaac 
responded to Mr. Thompson's letter assuring the assistant deputy 
the cases would be expedited. “I have discussed your concerns 
with the associate chief justice and like me he is prepared to 
take all reasonable steps possible to avoid a reference to the 
Supreme Court of Canada on these matters.” This too was done 
without the knowledge of defence counsel. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Following this horrendous act of interference into the judicial 
independence of Judge Jerome, justice department officials sought 
to minimize the damage by deliberately creating a false scenario 
designed to mislead defence counsel and Canadians into believing 
that Ted Thompson has approached Chief Justice Isaac for the 
innocent purpose of discussing the scheduling of 12 future 
deportation cases and had inadvertently discussed the three 
deportation cases being handled by Judge Jerome. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In an effort to cover up this deceit, these justice officials 
recognized the need to keep Ted Thompson from testifying when a 
motion for a stay of proceedings was entered on the basis of 
political interference into the judicial independence of the 
court. This deceit and the object of deceit is revealed in secret 
justice department documents which justice officials were ordered 
to file in the Supreme Court of Canada.  One of these documents 
is a memo to Mr. John Sims, the assistant deputy attorney general 
responsible for citizenship and immigration dated May 10, 1996, 
from Mr. Chris Amerasinghe, senior general counsel for the 
Attorney General of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Amerasinghe states in his memo that if Ted Thompson 
testified in court “The damage done to the image of the 
department, the attorney general and the court will be 
incalculable for all time and the consequences could be far 
reaching, going far beyond the immediate concern for these three 
cases.  It could precipitate the resignations of the minister and 
the chief justice. More importantly, the reputation of the 
government and the court will be irreparably damaged if all the 
evidence were to come out.” 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The contents of this one secret document alone is shocking and 
beyond belief, yet it gets worse.

</I></B></P><P align=left>In a second memo dated May 12, 1996 Mr. Amerasinghe states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately there are several problems in calling Ted 
Thompson—Bayne—one of the Defence Counsel—will soon realize 
the extent of the friendship between Ted Thompson and the Chief 
Justice and will be able to demonstrate that the real reason Ted 
went to see the Chief Justice was to alert his close friend to an 
impending Reference which would embarrass the Chief Justice and 
seek ways of avoiding it, and that the story about the concern 
for the 12 cases was false and is a cover-up. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Justice officials were not the only ones who advised Thompson 
not to testify.  During a private conversation in Montreal in 
early May, Judge Jerome provided Thompson with the same legal 
advice, not to submit an affidavit.  Chief Justice Isaac was at 
the same Montreal rules committee meeting, again an unbelievable 
revelation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As unbelievable as this is, Mr. Amerasinghe clearly and 
accurately describes the story being put forward by the justice 
department as false and a cover up, and this assessment is not 
denied by any justice official in the documents filed with the 
Supreme Court of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The most outrageous and reprehensible part of this whole scandal 
is the realization that this false story, this cover up, was 
extended either knowingly or unknowingly into the House of 
Commons by the former justice minister who on May 29, 1996 said 
this in <I>Hansard</I> regarding the meeting between Thompson and 
Isaac:  “The meeting was for the purpose initially of discussing 
concerns with the pace of litigation generally in the federal 
court”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The former justice minister is here parroting the false story 
and cover up detailed by Mr. Amerasinghe in a secret memo to John 
Sims.  Mr. Amerasinghe said in relation to Ted Thompson's motives 
and the real reason for approaching his friend was not to discuss 
general administrative matters but to alert his close personal 
friend of the proposed supreme court reference which would 
embarrass Chief Justice Isaac who had been working to improve the 
reputation of the federal court. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I invite all Canadians to look at the facts, to review the 
evidence.  I am confident a reasonable person would reach the 
same shocking conclusions.  I am confident ordinary Canadians 
would recognize that aspects of what the former justice minister 
reported in this House were incorrect and misleading and that the 
finding of Charles Dubin concerning the conduct of Ted Thompson 
is at best deficient and at worst a deliberate whitewash as he 
had access to all the damning information contained in the 
documents filed in the supreme court, and that the Canadian 
Judicial Council's examination of the conduct of Chief Justice 
Isaac is also inadequate and deficient.  However, this was to be 
expected, given that the council did not have access to all the 
information contained in the secret and confidential justice 
department documents that were later filed with the Supreme Court 
of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It appears that the Canadian Judicial Council depended solely on 
the word of Chief Justice Isaac who told them among other things 
that he never discussed Judge Jerome recusing himself from the 
cases, although the justice documents say exactly the opposite. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yesterday the Supreme Court of Canada, although dismissing the 
stay of proceedings motion, clearly stated that both Chief 
Justice Isaac and Associate Chief Justice Jerome were tainted by 
this affair and should have nothing further to do with these 
cases. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What are Canadians to think when they witness this type of 
conduct from our justice officials and our judges, the very 
people entrusted to protect our rights and freedoms and who are 
to uphold the rule of law to the very highest standards?  What 
are they to think when they see pertinent information being 
withheld from the Canadian Judicial Council, the one body 
entrusted to ensure that courts and judges remain independent of 
outside pressures so citizens can rely on the fact that they will 
receive fair and impartial hearings? What are they to think when 
they hear and see this kind of conduct on the part of these 
officials?  What are Canadians to think when they hear all the 
damning evidence which clearly points to such inappropriate 
conduct?  And there is more. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In a secret memo to John Sims, the Assistant Deputy Attorney 
General, dated December 14, 1995, Chris Amerasinghe states this: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am appalled at the irresponsible manner in which the associate 
chief justice, who is responsible for the proper functioning of 
the federal court trial division conducts the business of the 
court. It is a travesty of justice that these cases proceed at a 
snail's pace and that Jerome acquiesces in every attempt by 
counsel for the respondents to delay them rather than pushing 
counsel to deal with them speedily.  He does not seem to care 
what happens. Apparently the Chief Justice of the Federal Court 
either has no power to influence the conduct of the Associate 
Chief Justice or does not wish to do so.

behaviour to the state of his health.  I quote from the same 
memo: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>He appeared to be misled as to the nature to the privilege which 
we were claiming—the rather disjointed manner in which he spoke 
caused me serious concern as to the state of his health. More 
disturbing was the fact that he did not appear to appreciate that 
Bayne was misleading him as to the law. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>These comments are not only in contempt of Judge Jerome and his 
court, they are designed to spread this contempt into the minds 
of anyone who read them, including the Assistant Deputy Attorney 
General of Canada, John Sims.  So bitter was Amerasinghe's attack 
on Judge Jerome that John Sims blacked out those portions of 
Amerasinghe's memo before he passed it on to the members of the 
litigation committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If Mr. Amerasinghe had justification for his attack on Judge 
Jerome, the proper body to take it before was the Judicial 
Council of Canada, instead of sowing seeds of contempt in the 
minds of his superiors within the Department of Justice and yet 
that is exactly what he did.  It is outrageous and unacceptable 
that this has happened within the highest levels of the justice 
department. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the words of a defence counsel before the Supreme Court of 
Canada, the Department of Justice, the former minister of justice 
and the Hon. Charles Dubin exacerbated Ted Thompson's flagrant 
breach of judicial independence with their “concerted pattern of 
lack of candour and outright deception”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On May the 29, 1996 the former justice minister stood in this 
House and stated: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to note at the outset that as soon as the department 
became aware that Mr. Thompson and Chief Justice Isaac had met, 
and as soon as the correspondence came to light, the department 
provided copies of that correspondence to the lawyers acting for 
the three persons involved in the revocation cases pending before 
the Federal Court. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister's statement was wrong and is wrong.  Counsel for 
the applicants received copies of the correspondence on March 7, 
1996.  Yet we know from Mr. Amerasinghe's diary notes and from an 
e-mail dated March 1, 1996 addressed to Mr. John Sims from Mr. 
Amerasinghe both these men knew of Thompson's letter six days 
before it was forwarded to counsel. 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I phoned Ted Thompson's office and was told by his secretary 
that he had written to Julius Isaac.  I have no doubt he will 
advise you. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The contents of faxed messages between Mr. Amerasinghe, Mr. John 
Sims and the deputy attorney general clearly reveal that these 
officials were aware of this issue or problem days before the 
letters were sent to defence counsel and is a direct 
contradiction to what the former justice minister stated in this 
House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The former justice minister not only submitted information that 
mislead the House of the facts of this case, he also withheld 
information for almost three months regarding this matter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Ted Thompson committed this breach of judicial independence on 
March 1, 1996 and yet it was not brought to the floor of the 
House until the end of May of that same year.  Why was this 
matter not reported the moment the minister knew of it?  Why did 
he wait until the matter became a subject of public interest in 
the media before he notified the House of what was happening 
within his department?  That is unacceptable and is shameful.  It 
is shameful that the former minister stood in this House on more 
that one occasion and stated: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>From the moment that it came to the attention of the justice 
officials that Ted Thompson had been to see the chief justice, 
steps were taken to find out exactly what happened, to get copies 
of the correspondence and put them in the hands of the lawyers 
involved in the three cases. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yet we waited for three months before he notified us of what was 
going on within his department. It is unacceptable that the 
former justice minister refused to remove Ted Thompson for his 
professional and unethical misconduct despite Reform urging him 
to do so.  It was the only proper course of action to clear the 
air and assure Canadians that the justice department is not 
staffed by individuals who will violate the judicial independence 
of our courts. Instead the minister turned the matter over to the 
former chief justice of Ontario, Charles Dubin, a person, and I 
quote the minister, “whose experience and integrity in such 
matters is beyond question”.

<A HREF="#LINKT6"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>On October 1, 1996 the minister publicly embraced Mr. Dubin's 
findings when he stated “We took the trouble to have a person of 
unquestioned reputation look carefully through all the facts of 
this matter.  He took the trouble to look through all the facts 
carefully, speak to the people involved, examine the documents 
and consider them carefully in accordance with appropriate 
principles.  He concluded there was no basis to fire Ted 
Thompson”.  I say nonsense.  Absolute nonsense. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the former justice minister believed this, why did he order a 
new investigation into this issue when the contents of the secret 
documents filed with the Supreme Court of Canada were made public 
during the last week of the federal election?  Those were the 
very documents Mr. Dubin had access to during his investigation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The confidential documents clearly call into question Mr. 
Dubin's findings and suggest an enormous deficiency in his 
conclusions and in his recommendation that left Ted Thompson 
within the justice department. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my opinion, Mr. Dubin's report was a whitewash.  He 
completely ignored or glossed over the facts and despite 
overwhelming evidence to the contrary, maintained that Mr. 
Thompson's conduct although inappropriate was properly motivated 
and within his jurisdiction. Throughout his report he maintains 
the charade that Mr. Thompson's meeting was to discuss general 
administrative matters involving 12 pending revocation cases and 
that three current cases were mentioned inadvertently.  This is a 
false story and a cover-up described within Mr. Amerasinghe's 
internal documents to his superiors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Ted Thompson and Chief Justice Isaac committed one of the 
most serious breaches of judicial interference ever experienced 
in this country.  The true facts surrounding this enormous 
violation have been ignored and some say covered up and have 
just been revealed recently. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the words of defence counsel quoting Lord Denning, “Had 
this occurred in England, it would have brought down the 
government”.  But not in Canada because in Canada political 
interference in the judicial process has become a way of life and 
the hallmark of the Liberal government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We witnessed political interference in the Airbus affair and in 
the Krever inquiry.  Can we imagine setting up an inquiry such as 
the Krever inquiry and then creating legal roadblocks, as it has 
done, interfering with Krever's mandate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then there was the Pearson airport contract.  A bill was rammed 
through the House which denied the injured people due process to 
file a grievance within our justice system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the Somalia inquiry not only was there interference, it 
stopped the inquiry completely.  There was not only political 
interference, the judicial process was stopped completely and 
Canadians were denied the full facts and truth about the horrible 
wrongdoing and cover-up within the Canadian military. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is it any wonder that over 50% of Canadians have lost 
faith in our courts and in our justice system after witnessing 
the arrogant attitude that tampering with justice and the rule of 
law is acceptable.  And if you get caught, nothing happens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the case of Mr. Thompson, he was transferred to somewhere 
else in the department.  The Prime Minister moved the former 
justice minister out of justice and into health and this House 
cannot hold him accountable for the scandal which he has left in 
the justice department. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In summation of this scandalous affair, it is clear that this all 
occurred because these people did not want to suffer the 
embarrassment of a reference to the Supreme Court of Canada. They 
chose instead to violate the independence and the impartiality of 
the courts and betray the faith and trust of Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These people have to go.  They do not belong in our justice 
system.  They have proven by their actions that they are unworthy 
of belonging in our justice system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In view of this terrible government interference which runs like 
a current through our justice system on a regular basis, I have 
forwarded a complaint to the Law Society of Upper Canada asking 
for an immediate investigation into the conduct of Ted Thompson, 
John Sims and Chris Amerasinghe. In the light of yesterday's 
Supreme Court remarks regarding Isaac and Jerome, I have also 
written to the Canadian Judicial Council requesting a more 
thorough review of Chief Justice Isaac's actions as well as an 
examination of the conduct of Associate Chief Justice Jerome as 
referenced in the justice department documents filed in the 
Supreme Court of Canada.

these inadequacies and injustices that have occurred on this 
particular point. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know that the hon. member has a great deal of practical 
experience within the justice system.  I just want to comment 
that I as well look forward to keeping this government in check 
in particular in the area of justice and these atrocities, some 
of which the hon. member has mentioned, areas such as the Krever

with him in seeing that this government is held accountable.

that his words have reflected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I appreciate very much his comments and look forward to working 
with him and reflecting the standard of integrity within this 
House and within our institutions of government that the people 
of Canada are demanding and have not been finding, particularly 
in the justice system, as clearly revealed by the Angus Reid poll

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Forseth (New Westminster—Coquitlam—Burnaby,

when he talked about public confidence in the court system.  I 
recall that last year the member travelled the country and 
listened to average Canadians, especially around their lack of 
confidence in the Young Offenders Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like him to comment on what is the real mood in the 
community and what are the mainstream Canadian values that 
Canadians hold which seem to be somewhat different than what they 
actually get from the justice system.  There seems to be a great 
gap between the mentality and the inside language and the inside 
operations of the justice system and where they are at and where 
the public is act.  There is great dissatisfaction and the polls 
are showing that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like the hon. member to comment on what he found when he 
travelled the country, the difference between what Canadians want 
and what they are actually getting from the justice system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jack Ramsay:</B>  Madam Speaker, we spent quite a bit of 
taxpayers' dollars on the 12-year review of the Young Offenders 
Act.  When we talked to ordinary Canadians as we travelled across 
this country what we found was that they see a lack of ability 
within the Young Offenders Act to respond adequately to youth 
crime. We heard that over and over again.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also heard that the communities want the authority to deal 
with their own children restored back to them.  Families want 
restored back to them the authority to raise their children in a 
manner that they think is in the best interests of them, their 
communities and this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no question that the Young Offenders Act has formalized 
to a great extent simple acts that would normally be dealt with 
by a high school principal or a teacher in the classroom by the 
discretion of a peace officer.  That discretion has been removed 
by the formalization of the system.  Families want this right, 
this responsibility and this authority to look after their own 
children returned to them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We saw program after program, such as the Sparwood program in 
Sparwood, B.C., coming from the people.  People, in spite of all 
the money and interference by the government through legislation 
like the Young Offenders Act, were bringing forward programs to 
protect their children and to keep them out of the criminal 
justice system.  At the same time we see obstacles being placed 
in the way by the components within the justice system that have 
a vested interest in maintaining the status quo in an industry 
that spends $10 billion a year on youth and adult crimes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is much to do in amending our laws in this country, 
including the Young Offenders Act, in order to regain the 
confidence of Canadians and place back into their hands the 
authority and responsibility to raise their own children in a 
manner they think is in the best interests of themselves, their 
children, their communities and this country.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Allan Kerpan (Blackstrap, Ref.):</B>  Madam Speaker, 
again as many before me have, I would like to offer my 
congratulations and best wishes to you and all those who will 
occupy the Chair through this 36th Parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the things that the member for Crowfoot talked about in 
his address and also in the questions and comments is the 
frustration that Canadians have with our legal system. We have 
seen just this past summer things like the section 745 hearings 
for people like Clifford Olson who is a self-admitted child 
killer of 11 children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wonder if the member would like to comment on how things like 
the section 745 hearings have an effect on the people's 
frustration with the justice system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jack Ramsay:</B>  Madam Speaker, when we pass laws that 
destroy the peace of mind of citizens, what are we doing?  It is 
one thing to see the interpretation of the law that affects the 
sense of justice of our people.  It is another thing to see the 
law itself create that feeling where the peace of mind is 
destroyed, where they cannot be at peace knowing that the justice 
officials are not going to interfere with the judicial 
independence of a judge that they may have to appear before and 
that they will get a fair hearing, that the individual who 
commits a crime will be punished in a manner according to the 
circumstances surrounding the offence.  We are hearing this all 
across the country.  The polls are reflecting it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I cannot understand why the government will not move and support 
the will of the majority in areas as simple as removing section 
745 from the Criminal Code, the faint hope clause that gives 
special rights and advantages to killers in this country, and on 
the other hand punishes innocent people in this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We see Bill C-68 which is so frustrating for millions of 
Canadians.  What is it doing?  Again, it directs punishment to 
innocent, law abiding people while ignoring to a large extent the 
criminal users of firearms.

</I></B></P><P align=left>When we see laws passed and maintained that are punishing the 
innocent and creating inconveniences for the innocent, the law 
abiding tax paying Canadians, while at the same time giving 
special rights and privileges to the offender, there is something 
wrong with the picture and there is something wrong with the 
justice system in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The only way the people can speak is through their elected 
representatives in the House, through the polls, letters to the 
editor, through petitions to this place, letters and phone calls 
to ministers of cabinet.  They are expressing that discontent and 
a degree of frustration that indicates they have lost their sense 
of justice.  It has been destroyed by the actions and the laws 
passed by this House.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. George Proud (Hillsborough, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I 
too would like to congratulate you and the other Speakers who 
will occupy the chair and rule on our debates to ensure that we 
conduct ourselves with the level of decorum that Canadians expect 
of their parliamentarians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also like to ask for the patience of the members in the 
House to thank the people of Hillsborough for returning me to 
this place as their voice in the House of Commons.  It is a great 
pleasure for me to serve my constituents and I plan to serve them 
well. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wish to speak in support of the Speech from the Throne, but 
I also wish to speak of this Parliament. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The throne speech was very up beat. It spoke of the great 
opportunities that await us in the new millennium.  It also set 
the stage for how we as Canadians will prepare our nation to 
enter the new century as a strong and united country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to make one thing perfectly clear. The only reason 
the throne speech took such a positive tone is the successes of 
Canadians over the last four years. The Liberal government with 
the help of all Canadians turned the country's financial books 
around. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It has been said many times that a healthy economy leads to a 
healthy society.  This government also believes that a healthy 
society contributes to a healthy economy.  And it is obvious 
after hearing the throne speech that the government plans to 
deliver both to Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While there are many ways the government can work to improve our 
way of life, it has targeted priority areas such as our youth, 
health care, innovation and national unity. These areas represent 
the greatest potential for Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the prime minister said, our children are our most precious 
resource. The Liberal government will continue to create more 
opportunities for our youth, opportunities for better education, 
more employment opportunities, a healthier lifestyle and a secure 
public retirement income system.  In short, our government will 
secure Canada's future through our youth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the same time, we must maintain a public health care regime. 
There is no escaping the needs of a growing population. This is 
why the Liberal government introduced public health care 30 years 
ago and that is why the Liberal government will secure it for 
another 30 years and beyond. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another chief priority of the government is supporting 
innovation in Canada's economy.  Similar to the theory of 
continuous learning for workers, Canadian firms must continually 
strive to improve and update their processes. Our international 
competitors are not standing still, so neither can we. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government has a role to play in supporting research 
and development and its uses within the business world.  That is 
why I am glad to hear that this government will build on its 
prior achievements of maintaining innovation as one of its main 
priorities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Recently we have seen a slight evolution of the federalist 
approach to the issue of Quebec's secession.  Yes, we must 
illustrate to all Canadians, especially the people of Quebec, the 
benefits of living within Canada.  But we must also bring 
frankness and clarity to any debate on the unity of Canada.  I 
want to make it known that I support the recent initiatives of 
the federal government and the provincial and territorial 
leaders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I mentioned before, I want to discuss more than just the 
Speech from the Throne. As we can all see, the make-up of this 
Parliament is unlike any in Canada's history.  It is 
unprecedented for the House of Commons to have five official 
parties.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since 1993 Canadians have wanted a change in the federal system. 
The presence of so many regional parties is evidence of that 
desire.  Some change has occurred but I think the results of the 
June election illustrate that Canadians are not yet quite 
satisfied. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Just like our industries must be capable of innovation, so must 
our Parliament be ready to change.  By improving our Parliament 
we may better serve Canadians.  In consequence, Canadians may 
better respect this institution and its members. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With such an extraordinary mix of political parties in the House 
I believe the time for change is now. I say to my hon. colleagues 
there will never be a better time than now to change this system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Most of this change concerns increasing the role of an MP.  A 
member who is not in cabinet usually has little opportunity to 
influence legislation and other measures of policy.  But if a 
group of members band together, then perhaps influence can be 
achieved because the rules of the game are stacked against us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of particular importance in this Parliament is the role of 
committees.  There are now 14 committees with each containing 16 
members.  Many of us know from previous experience that all too 
often there is insufficient time for each member to probe the 
issues with questions to the witnesses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As well, there is always the fear that the committees are viewed 
as rubber stamps for the government.  The committees should be a 
second defence for Canadians to be protected from unintended 
implications or oversights, but committees need a sufficient 
amount of time to conduct an effective analysis of government 
policy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Along the same lines is the issue of resources available to 
committees.  Currently each committee must apply for funds for 
each individual study.  A number of committees share a clerk with 
other committees or parliamentary associations.  Researchers from 
the Library of Parliament are assigned to various committees.  I 
do not believe this is good enough. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my opinion we should take some lessons from our neighbours to 
the south.  Committee chairs should have the resources to arrange 
his or her own experts on staff.  They should be in addition to 
research assistants available to other committee members. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Having more resources would allow members time to conduct a more 
thorough study of the issues that come before them.  But we 
cannot provide more resources without allowing the committees to 
actually use them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government must change its approach and be more open to 
change.  We have here a wealth of knowledge.  The collective 
knowledge of all 301 members of Parliament can be a force of 
benefit for Canadians.  As it stands now only the few in cabinet 
have any real opportunity for input. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, I believe there should be more business referred to 
committees.  In recent years it appears that more measures which 
should be in legislation and debated here on this floor are 
bypassing the House by being included in regulations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Any legislation the government introduces is debated here, but 
often it seems that the real meat of the legislation is 
contained in the corresponding regulations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I realize that this approach provides more flexibility to the 
government because it is easier to amend regulations.  I admit 
there are times when it is justified, but this approach can 
easily be abused.  Putting the meat of the legislation in 
regulations does not allow Parliament a direct opportunity to 
investigate government policies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a balance that can be obtained by referring all 
regulations to the appropriate committees.  This will allow them 
to be studied and improve the impact of services to Canadians. As 
well there have been a good number of issues over the years that 
could have been avoided if committees of Parliament were given 
more matters for analysis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, I am sure that if the Standing Committee on 
National Defence and Veterans Affairs had studied the helicopter 
procurement initiated by the former Conservative government, any 
controversy could have been avoided.  Then we would not still be 
dealing with this issue so many years later. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One final point concerns private members' business.  I believe 
there are many improvements that can be made to allow private 
members more opportunity to introduce and pass meaningful 
legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Part of our role here should be to act as legislators. Currently 
really the only legislators here are those in cabinet.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Garry Breitkreuz (Yorkton—Melville, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I wish to offer my congratulations on your speakership 
once again and to all those who will be occupying the chair. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to ask the member, very briefly, to comment on this 
question.  Does the member agree that one of the primary 
functions of government in a civilized society is to provide for 
the peace and safety of its citizens? I was wondering if at the 
beginning of this Parliament he would assure us that he would 
agree with that statement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reason I ask that is I have been here for four years now and 
cannot understand why law and order is not more of a priority for 
this government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to give the House an example.  I am very familiar with 
what is happening at our local high school in Yorkton.  My 
children have attended there and they tell me what is going on. 
There is a serious problem with young offenders.  Many of them 
will attend school the next day and boast about their exploits. 
This has a very negative effect on all the other students.  They 
begin to say “what does it matter what I do, who cares?”  It 
affects their studies.  It affects their job. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unless people realize that the law is made to be respected, they 
lose the thing which holds us together as a society.  The glue 
which holds us together becomes soft. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. George Proud:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member 
for his questions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yes, I believe it is the role of government to provide stability 
within a country.  I have grown up in this country and I believe, 
as others do, that it is the greatest country in the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also believe, along with government, that the individual 
members of society have a role to play in ensuring that we have a 
safe country in which to live. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the problems we have in society today is that too many 
things over the last number of years have been foisted on to 
government and the roles of family members and other 
organizations have gone by the wayside. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe this government should and will continue to look after 
the main interests of society, that being one very important 
interest.

recognize the right, responsibility and liberty of parents to 
direct the upbringing of their children and their right to pursue 
family life free from unnecessary interference from government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many parents feel their rights and responsibilities are 
threatened by the government's attempts to fully implement the 
United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child, a UN 
charter which has never been approved in this Parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Parents are afraid that their rights and responsibilities to 
properly discipline their children are threatened by the 
direction the Liberal government is taking.  They say that if the 
convention is fully implemented government bureaucrats and the 
courts will have absolute power to determine what is in the best 
interests of the child and parents will be powerless. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The problem seems to be that government is paying more attention 
to what the bureaucrats and foreign politicians are saying in the 
United Nations than what parents are saying here at home.

efforts of my constituent and friend, John Cochrane. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>John recently travelled, as a Canadian volunteer adviser, to 
Russia to assist a private company that publishes a newspaper and 
produces stencilled colour printing.  The company which requested 
Mr. Cochrane's assistance was seeking advice on creating a new 
product line and improving efficiency and profit.  Mr. Cochrane 
developed a plan to increase subscriptions and attract additional 
advertisers as well as a new and more aggressive marketing 
strategy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Cochrane, like many other CESO advisers who work as Canadian 
volunteer advisers to business and assist business and 
organizations in Canada's aboriginal communities, developing 
nations and emerging market economies in central and eastern 
Europe. CESO volunteers are skilled Canadian men and women who 
willingly share their lifetime of practical experience with those 
who need it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again I congratulate all CESO volunteers and especially my 
constituent, John Cochrane, on a job well done.

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>GOVERNMENT EXPENDITURES 
</H3><P align=left>

<P><A NAME="LINK44"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, this 
summer when the Liberals were out making election promises they 
swore that any budget surplus would be split 50:50, half would go 
to new Liberal spending programs naturally, and the other half 
would actually go back into taxpayers' pockets or to debt 
retirement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But now that the Liberals are back in power they have changed 
their tune. They used to sing <I>The Taxman</I> by the Beatles, 
now they have changed to another one entitled <I>Hey, Big 
Spender</I>. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the government spends $42,000 on a musical study entitled 
“The Social Origins of the Medieval Latin Lyrical Song,” why 
should ordinary Canadians believe that the government will ever 
be able to give Canadians the tax relief they deserve? 
<P><A NAME="LINK45"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, the Canada Council gives grants to people to do some 
very useful work.  To be knowledgeable about great ancient music 
is very important for some people.  I am not an expert but I love 
Gregorian music.  It was part of the services in the Catholic 
Church when I was a kid.  It is medieval and very good and very 
peaceful to listen to after a good question period. 
<P><A NAME="LINK46"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
am not sure if the Prime Minister was part of a medieval Latin 
song, but he has been around for a while. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I heard the Prime Minister whistling another ditty yesterday.  I 
think it was called “Smoking in the Boys Room”.  Apparently the 
government has decided to spend $1.5 million to subsidize smokes 
for convicts in the Kingston penitentiary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We suspect he has been blowing smoke about this whole budgetary 
surplus thing.  I think that is a given. But does he really think 
that spending $1.5 million to subsidize smokes for convicts is 
the best way to spend the money that he has siphoned out of 
Canadian small businesses? 
<P><A NAME="LINK47"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Andy Scott (Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I thank the member for posing the first question of my 
new position. I want to take advantage of the occasion to commend 
the good work that is done by Correctional Service Canada whose 
300 executives sat in this House last night.  They do good work. 
They deserve to be complimented and I am proud to do it. 
<P><A NAME="LINK48"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
am not sure what they have been smoking, but it was something. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also know that the Prime Minister enjoys a good golf game. 
Heaven knows he has teed off plenty of voters.  But does he 
really have to waste taxpayers' dollars on it?  Did the 
government really have to spend $19,000 last year on golf balls, 
or $500,000 for golf cart bridges at Antigonish, Nova Scotia? 
Did Canadian taxpayers really need to spend $100,000 on a golf 
course at an army base? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My question is obvious.  Are these kind of spending programs 
really more important to the Liberals than offering some prospect 
of tax relief for the ordinary Canadian citizen? 
<P><A NAME="LINK49"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, yes there is a beautiful golf course in the national 
park at Cape Breton which is enjoyed by the thousands of visitors 
who come there in the summer. It is an area of Canada that needs 
economic development. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The golf course was developed a long time ago and it has been 
made adequate for golfers.  The people who play there pay and 
that helps.  On top of that, it helps the tourist industry in an 
area which needs some help.  It is about modernizing a golf 
course a bit for tourists to visit, in one of the most beautiful 
parts of Canada which has some big economic problems.  I think 
the Reform Party should compliment the government for doing 
something for a region that needs it.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I am aware of the news reports this morning about a file being 
asked for by an official at Health Canada.  I have asked officials 
to look into it and when the facts are known I will respond in 
detail. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member should acknowledge in his question, and I know 
he is aware of the fact, that for me and for this government the 
role of the health protection branch is extremely important. It 
protects the safety and the health of Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is for that very reason that this week I took three important 
steps to ensure its continuing strength: first, a moratorium on 
future cuts; second, the appointment of an arm's length science 
advisory board; third—

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Grant Hill (Macleod, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is 
interesting that this minister himself is responsible for the 
cuts that he is now undoing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Dr. Brill-Edwards is an expert.  She says the health protection 
branch is unsafe.  She worked there. Her colleagues agree. Now 
health bureaucrats are trying to ruin her reputation and smother 
the truth. Why is the health minister afraid of this scientist? 
<P><A NAME="LINK54"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
one thing I have tried to make a habit is to get the facts before 
I jump to conclusions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I caution the hon. member to get the facts before he 
characterizes conduct in that irresponsible way.  The reality is 
I have asked officials to inquire into the news reports this 
morning. Let us get the facts first. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The third step I took was to prepare a consultation document to 
involve all Canadians, not just one or two in this discussion of 
the future of the health protection branch. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not have to be told by former employees or by anybody else 
what the role of the health protection branch is.  I am firmly 
committed to making sure it does its job in the most effective 
way.

<P><A NAME="LINK56"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Stéphane Bergeron (Verchères, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, my question is 
for the Prime Minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In his speech in reply to the Speech from the Throne, the Prime 
Minister urged Quebecers to put their trust in the Calgary declaration, 
the ramifications of which became even murkier yesterday with the 
replies the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs gave to our questions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My question is a very simple one: Given its constitutional history, 
what makes the Prime Minister think that Quebecers can trust the Liberal 
government? 
<P><A NAME="LINK57"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Stéphane Dion (President of the Queen's Privy Council for 
Canada and Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
Quebecers are visibly losing faith in the Bloc Quebecois.  This is clear 
from the recent election. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The very great majority of Quebecers want to remain in Canada. 
This is clear not just from the polls, but from speaking to average 
citizens.  And the more they could be convinced that they do not have to 
choose between Quebec and Canada, that these two formidable entities can 
join forces and make them stronger and will be more indispensable to 
them than ever in the next millennium, the more they will turn away from 
the Bloc Quebecois in mistrust. 
<P><A NAME="LINK58"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Stéphane Bergeron (Verchères, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, for the 
minister's information, the Bloc Quebecois still holds the majority of 
seats in Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That having been said, when we hear that being as unique as Pacific 
salmon is the same thing as distinct society, we might well wonder. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How can the Prime Minister hope for Quebecers' trust, when his 
government's only strategy since the last referendum has been to 
threaten Quebec with its clever Plan B?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Stéphane Dion (President of the Queen's Privy Council for

far from making any threats, the government is calling for calm and 
democratic debate of very serious matters:  How does secession square 
with democracy?  There is no model for it anywhere. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me illustrate.  The leader of the Bloc Quebecois and the 
Premier of Quebec gave the example of the recent referendum in Wales, 
noting that 50% plus one was enough.

the debate.  The Tories asked the British Prime Minister not to apply

question is for the future federal minister of education, whoever 
he may be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In his response to the Speech from the Throne, the Prime 
Minister kept for himself the announcement of new meddling in areas 
of provincial jurisdiction.  The Prime Minister announced the 
government's intention to set up a fund to distribute bursaries 
directly to students. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How can the minister play saviour and announce such a fund 
worth $1 billion without blushing, when his cuts to education, 
which will amount to $10 billion, have put students in debt like 
never before? 
<P><A NAME="LINK62"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Stéphane Dion (President of the Queen's Privy Council for 
Canada and Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I will use my example of Wales another time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The announcement for students is excellent news.  You know, the 
Natural Sciences Engineering and Research Council, the Social 
Sciences and Humanities Research Council and the Medical Research 
Council of Canada offered, for the last year available, bursaries 
worth $175 million to 13,359 students.  Many of us benefited from 
them, including perhaps the hon. member.  The member for 
Saint-Laurent—Cartierville did.  If even more students can 
benefit, it will be a good thing for students in Quebec and 
Canada.

to reply. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada has learned the lesson over the last 10 years that doing 
business without agreements and without a level playing field can 
be a very turbulent thing indeed.  Hence, the attempt is being 
made to create the MAI.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
directed my question to the prime minister and I am hoping we are 
going to get an answer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The head of the World Trade Organization has said of the MAI 
process: “We are writing the constitution for a new global 
economy”.  Surely an agreement of this importance deserves the 
same standard of public disclosure, input and consultation that 
Canadians have demanded with respect to their own Constitution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is clear that the government intended to sign, seal and

Rather than his monopolistic all or nothing exclusion and 
inclusion clauses, why does Bill C-4 introduced by the government 
in this House yesterday not provide western Canadian grain 
farmers with real freedom of choice in how they market their very 
own wheat and barley?

important question raised by the hon. member.  It speaks exactly 
to the heart of the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What the minister and this legislation have proposed for the 
first time in a very long time has come from farmers themselves, 
from producers.  Farmers and producers themselves will have a 
direct role in the management of that agency and they will 
control their destiny.  That is the democratic process and I 
think it is a very good piece of legislation.

Speaker, I am glad the parliamentary secretary had the

Looking at the bill it is certainly highly questionable whether 
the board of directors will ever be able to make the Canadian 
Wheat Board voluntary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition to CSIS, another government agency not held 
accountable under access to information is the Canadian Wheat 
Board.  Can the hon. parliamentary secretary explain how the new 
board of directors themselves will be held accountable to the 
farmers who elect them when they will not be able to tell them 
anything about the top secret Canadian Wheat Board operations?

here is a principle of democracy.  The hon. member should 
understand that under the current legislation which is before the 
House of Commons today, clearly two-thirds or 10 out of 15 
members of the board of directors will come from producers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the hon. member does not understand a thing about democracy, 
perhaps he should be talking directly to some of the farmers. I

for producers, right?” Perhaps what the hon. member—

<P><A NAME="LINK107"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rob Anders (Calgary West, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
taxpayers would wind up paying 9.9 percent of their salary as a 
result of the Canada pension plan as proposed by the Liberals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A taxpayer living until 75 would collect a maximum of $8,800 per 
year for a grand total of $88,000.  In contrast, members of 
Parliament only have 9.5 percent of their paycheque go toward 
the gold plated pensions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the minister of heritage had lost her election and lived 
until 75, she would have collected $2.8 million.  How will she 
continue to justify gouging taxpayers? 
<P><A NAME="LINK108"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, the Reform Party obviously does not like the Canada 
pension plan.  Its members made it very clear that they would see 
it destroyed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The question that I would simply ask is what would the Reform 
Party replace the Canada pension plan with?  What they have 
presented so far, their super RRSP would bring in a rate of 13 
percent, roughly 4 percent and 5 percent higher than the premiums 
that we have agreed to with the provinces, including I might 
point out the province of Alberta. 
<P><A NAME="LINK109"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rob Anders (Calgary West, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, somehow I 
knew they would justify gouging taxpayers.  They put themselves 
on a pedestal above taxpayers who pay the CPP, just like the 
leader of the fifth party who is looking forward to a pension of 
more than $4.2 million, just like the Minister of Justice who is 
looking forward to more than $1.5 million. Brian Tobin, the 
former Liberal fisheries minister and the premier of Newfoundland

numbers that the member has just quoted are garbage. Second of 
all why does he not deal with the real numbers?  Why is he afraid 
to stand up here and explain to the Canadian people that if 9.9 
is a gouge, then what is 13 percent which his party has talked about? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this House when it came time to debate the MP pensions, the

it, do not deal with the problems and let it crumble under its

I welcome the hon. member to the House.  I want to work 
constructively with her in what I know is a shared objective of 
ensuring the health of Canadians but she is making it very 
difficult from the beginning. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I told the House earlier that I have asked officials to look

will be in a position to discuss it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As far as the health protection branch is concerned, this is the 
minister who put a freeze on those cuts, this is the minister who 
is going to appoint a science advisory board to give us

protection branch in an open and full discussion of its future.

I have already made it clear that we are going to do whatever is 
necessary to ensure that the health protection branch, which is 
an important service of government, is there to safeguard the 
health and safety of Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I encourage the hon. member to take part in the public 
consultation process we are going to go through over the coming 
months.  We have frozen cuts.  We are going to appoint people who 
know science to give us advice.  I encourage the hon. member to 
contribute constructively to the process.  I hope her involvement 
will go beyond wagging her finger in this House.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Scott Brison (Kings—Hants, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the 
Canada pension plan disability program has an appeal process. 
Currently there are over 4,000 people in Canada waiting for their 
appeal to be heard. Once pension benefits are granted by the 
review tribunal, the government officials have instructed to 
appeal every single case to the pension appeal board. There are 
just 20 federal appeal board judges to handle this huge backlog 
and a waiting period of up to four years for Canadians who need 
this pension. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Will the Prime Minister or the government tell us what their 
plan is to address this injustice to thousands of disabled 
Canadians who are waiting for an answer on this very critical 
issue? 
<P><A NAME="LINK130"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Ethel Blondin-Andrew (Secretary of State (Children and

the government.  We are working very hard on this.  We will get

unanimous consent.

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>THE LATE ALISTAIR FRASER 
</H3><P align=left>

<P><A NAME="LINK137"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Don Boudria (Leader of the Government in the House of 
Commons, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, those of us who have been around 
for a number of years, although not actually in the House of 
Commons, were shocked and saddened earlier this month to hear the 
news of the passing of an officer emeritus of this House, the 
former Clerk of the House, Mr. Alistair Fraser. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Fraser was born into a family that values public service. 
Both of his grandfathers were distinguished statesmen serving in 
Parliament and at the provincial and territorial levels. Both his 
father and one of his grandfathers were lieutenant-governors of 
Nova Scotia and even today, if someone asks an old-timer in 
Guysborough the way to the Fraser summer place, one will be 
directed very clearly to what is referred to as the governor's 
house.

<A HREF="#LINKT25"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Immediately upon graduating from McGill University, Mr. Fraser 
joined the Canadian army, serving until the end of World War II. 
After serving briefly on the staff of the Hon. Brooke Claxton in 
Ottawa, he attended the University of British Columbia law 
school, practising law in Prince Rupert before returning to 
Ottawa as executive assistant to the Hon. James Sinclair. 
Subsequently he served in that same position with the Hon. Ross 
MacDonald and the Hon. Jack Pickersgill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Fraser was twice a candidate for the House of Commons: once 
on the west coast in Esquimalt—Saanich and once on the east 
coast in Pictou. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Fraser was appointed deputy clerk in 1966 and clerk, the 
following year.  He performed his duties with dignity, wisdom and 
an unequalled sense of humour. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although Mr. Fraser served at the clerks' table through the 
most tumultuous years in Canada's history, he maintained excellent 
relations with a number of political personages, including the 
Right Honourable John Diefenbaker, the Honourable Allan MacEachen, 
David Lewis, Réal Caouette, and others unnamed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For myself, I would like to add that Alistair Fraser touched 
the lives not only of parliamentarians, but of the people working 
in the House of Commons during his time there. As you know, I was 
a young employee of the House of Commons at the time and could see 
firsthand the kindness, the wisdom and the intelligence of my boss, 
Alistair Fraser. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When he retired in 1979, more than the clerk left the House of 
Commons.  We lost a mentor, an adviser and, I would say, a friend. 
Following his retirement, Mr. Fraser continued his involvement in 
the area of parliamentary affairs through the publication of two 
editions of Beauchesne's parliamentary rules. In his visits to the 
hill, he always brought along his enthusiasm and his sense of 
humour. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He will be sorely missed.  I offer my condolences to the 
members of his family, to all his friends and, I would add, to the 
employees of the House and the table officers, all of whom shared 
this moment of sadness.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Reynolds (West Vancouver—Sunshine Coast, Ref.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I rise on behalf of the Reform Party of Canada to 
pay tribute to a beloved servant of the House of Commons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Alistair Graeme Fraser was born in Toronto in January of 1923 
into a family distinguished for its political service.  After 
graduating from the University of British Columbia in law and 
practising for a short time in Prince Rupert, British Columbia, 
he moved to Ottawa and worked for 27 years in this place, serving 
as executive assistant to several Liberal ministers, after which 
he was appointed Clerk of the House of Commons for 12 years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Fraser presided as Clerk over some revolutionary 
developments in this House: the creation of the parliamentary 
interns group, the reorganization of the role of pages in the 
House and most important, the introduction of this Chamber to all 
Canadians through live television broadcasts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He possessed an encyclopedic knowledge of the complex rules and 
procedures of this place, so much so that he co-authored several 
editions of Beauchesne's Parliamentary Rules and Forms, the 
commentary on the standing orders of the House that all members 
consult almost daily.  In Beauchesne's we can discover something 
of the personality of its author.  It is the codification of 
common sense.  It tries to strike a balance between the freedom 
of the member to speak and the member's responsibility to abide 
by the rules of decorum and procedure intended to benefit all 
members. It combines firmness with good humour and Mr. Fraser was 
well known for his keen sense of humour. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Pierre Trudeau, who was leader of the opposition on October 9, 
1979, a couple of weeks after Mr. Fraser retired as Clerk said 
this about him: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>When paying homage to someone, one often speaks of “selfless 
devotion”.  That expression has been used so often as to become 
almost meaningless.  Yet I believe it to be an accurate 
description of the way in which Mr. Fraser served the House of 
Commons as an institution and its members as individuals— Those 
who accept the position of Clerk of the House of Commons are not 
allowed to display the range of opinions and emotions which so 
delight the heart of a politician—Rather, they are teachers, 
conciliators and friends.  They do not think of self but bend on 
their will and their stamina to making the House of Commons work.

</I></B></P><P align=left>On a personal note, when I was elected to this House in 1972, 
Mr. Fraser was in the House.  As a 30-year-old member in this 
Chamber it was very nice to have somebody sitting at that table 
who could fill me in on the rules that everybody else knew.  It 
was nice to have somebody to assist me in preparing my private 
member's bills and my questions. I always found that Mr. Fraser 
and all those he taught, many of whom are here today, had that 
fairness and respect for all members of Parliament no matter what 
their politics. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We would like to pass on to Mr. Fraser's family our wishes and 
comfort for the honourable life and tradition of service that he 
brought to this House.  I would like to tell them that we all 
remember him very well.

<P><A NAME="LINK139"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Stéphane Bergeron (Verchères, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I in turn would 
like to join my colleagues who have just spoken in paying tribute to 
Alistair Fraser, who, as has been pointed out in the last few minutes, 
was Clerk of the House of Commons from 1967 to 1979. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although many of us here today did not have the good fortune to 
meet and get to know Mr. Fraser, he served the Canadian public and this 
venerable institution in which we sit for many years, and his memory 
will not soon disappear from its hallowed walls. 
He first came to the House in 1951 as an assistant to the then fisheries 
minister, the Hon. James Sinclair, moving on to take up the position of 
Clerk Assistant, as the Government House Leader pointed out, and then 
Clerk. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On September 1 of this year, he passed away, leaving us all 
saddened.  A lawyer by training, Mr. Fraser came from a Liberal family 
of long standing in his province of birth.  His father and his 
grandfather were lieutenant-governors of Nova Scotia and his grandfather 
was even a member of Parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was through his efforts and those of the present Clerk of the 
House of Commons that the Parliamentary Internship Programme was set up, 
providing an opportunity for numerous Canadians and Quebecers to work in 
this place for the representatives of the public, to achieve a better 
knowledge and understanding of this universally admired democratic 
institution, and to pass that knowledge and understanding on to others. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On behalf of the Bloc Quebecois, I would like to express deepest 
condolences to his family and friends and, as I said at the beginning of 
my speech, to assure them that his memory will remain very much alive in 
this House for many years to come, because the volume to which he 
contributed is something we consult on a daily basis. 
He left his stamp on two editions of Beauchesne, which is something of 
a bible in the work of the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Once again, on behalf of the Bloc Quebecois, I offer heartfelt 
condolences to his family and friends. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>]

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lorne Nystrom (Qu'Appelle, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I too 
wish to join on behalf of our party in expressing our condolences 
to Mr. Fraser's family. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I felt particularly moved when I heard about his passing.  Mr. 
Fraser swore me in as a member of Parliament on four separate 
occasions: in 1968, 1972, 1974 and 1979.

<A HREF="#LINKT27"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>He was extremely well liked and highly respected by all members 
of the House, on all sides of the House, during the time he was 
clerk of this Chamber. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He was also known as the Mr. Rules of this place, along 
with the former member for Winnipeg North Centre, Stanley 
Knowles.  It is rather ironic that the last time my colleague 
from Winnipeg—Transcona encountered Mr. Fraser was at Mr. 
Knowles' funeral back in June.  The two of them were friends and 
colleagues.  The two of them were experts in the rules.  They 
made an immense contribution toward the evolution of this place 
through a fairly revolutionary time.  The rules were changed, 
which radically changed the operation of the institution.  There 
was the introduction of television, which again changed the way 
this place operates. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He was also a great parliamentarian in terms of the real love 
of this place.  He was a great advisor to those of us who were 
members in those days, particularly when we were new members of 
Parliament.  He was always available to give friendly advice as 
to how we should conduct ourselves as members.  He was fair.  He 
was above the partisan battle of the House of Commons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Best of all, he was a friend.  Because of that, on behalf of my 
party, I want to extend to his family and to his friends our very 
sincere condolences on his passing. 
<P><A NAME="LINK141"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough, PC):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, it is with sadness that I rise to add my voice to 
those paying tribute to 
Mr. Alistair Graeme Fraser. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I met Mr. Fraser on several occasions when my father took his 
oath in this House.  He was, like I, a Nova Scotian.  He often 
referred to his field at Guysborough, which was very important to 
him.  His brothers and their families shared that home.  I extend 
my deep condolences to them and all the members of the Fraser 
family in Nova Scotia.  They have suffered a great loss, as has 
this House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On September 25, 1967 the journals of this House recorded the 
announcement of Mr. Fraser's appointment as clerk of the House of 
Commons.  When he retired in 1979 this House was different than 
it is today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Fraser loved this Chamber.  The people who worked in and 
around it were very important to him.  He knew political life 
mattered and that those who practised it, supported it and 
reported it were key to the basic freedoms of this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He saw Parliament Hill as a welcome place for those who sought 
to learn about it and who came to pay their respects. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Someone once said that Mr. Fraser saw this place as a sort of 
university.  He devoted much time to explaining it to the people 
who came here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He was critical to the success of parliament and the 
parliamentary internship program.  He supported the establishment 
of the Canadian study of the parliamentary group and he 
represented this institution in the Parliament of the World with 
distinction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At his retirement he was made an honorary member, officer of 
the House, with a seat at the table before us.  He took this 
honour very seriously.  His counsel remained available to several 
committees and his testimony was given to a special committee 
established following the famous ringing of the bells, which 
remained lively and cogent in his critique of the House of 
Commons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Parliament has too few friends.  Mr. Fraser's death robs us of 
an ally and one of the Commonwealth's great parliamentary 
officers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On behalf of the Conservative Party, I add my voice of 
condolence to the family, to this House and to all Canadians, for 
Mr. Fraser will be sorely missed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  I would like to acknowledge the very 
gracious tributes paid to Mr. Fraser from members of all sides of 
the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I had the privilege of meeting Mr. Fraser in 1967, when he was 
clerk and I was working in this place for the summer.  I 
acknowledge that everything which has been said about him is 
true.  He was a wonderful builder of Parliament and a real 
cornerstone of the House of Commons.  The words which have been 
uttered about him by all hon. members are very fitting.

Prince George—Peace River for seconding this bill.  This is a 
very serious problem in this country, one that touches 160,000 
Canadians every year.  It is a $1.6 billion problem, and that 
problem is auto theft. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our loose laws are encouraging people to break the law, 
especially male young offenders who steal over half the cars 
stolen in Canada, mostly to joy ride and experience a thrill at 
someone else's expense. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The problem is out of control in British Columbia.  In my own 
constituency, as an example, in the city of Chilliwack auto theft 
was up 87 percent last year alone. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My bill would strengthen the provisions of section 335 of the 
Criminal Code, a section under which young offenders are usually 
charged.  It prescribes a minimum and a maximum sentence in terms 
of a fine, a jail term or restitution to the victim.  It also 
states that parents of young offenders who have contributed to 
the delinquency of their child can be held responsible for 
restitution.

incentives for families to abdicate their parental 
responsibilities to the state.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a unique Parliament standing on the threshold of a new 
era. In his remarks this week, His Excellency the Governor 
General drew attention to the fact that we are the last 
Parliament of the 20th century and the first of the 21st century. 
An arbitrary boundary?  An important milestone?  If nothing 
else, it is an opportunity to pause and assess the state of our 
society. From that perspective all of us in this House have been 
entrusted with an important duty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have been given the mandate by our electors to act as 
stewards of their interests as we cross the threshold into a new 
age.  The decisions we make and the actions we take in the next 
four years will shape our society for decades to come.  More 
importantly, they will decide what kind of nation Canada is as it 
begins a new century. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The throne speech demonstrated that the government has a clear 
vision of where it would like to take this country in the course 
of this current mandate.  The speech provides a clear outline of 
where the government intends to dedicate its efforts and most 
importantly, it unveiled an agenda that responds well to the 
suggestions and aspirations voiced by the residents of 
Vaughan—King—Aurora. They have made themselves heard on issues 
like national unity, technology and the new economy.  They have 
participated in town hall meetings on health care, on the 
environment and on social programs. The government knows where 
the people of Vaughan—King—Aurora stand on such issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It has been my pleasure to report to the House on 36 town hall 
meetings to date and a school speaking tour that included over 
25,000 young people and literally thousands of meetings with 
groups and individuals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Speech from the Throne with its emphasis on fiscal 
responsibility, with a promise to balance the budget by 1998-99, 
on job creation with investments in key areas like technology, on 
quality health care with a plan to help Canadians who care for 
family members at home and on youth employment with a commitment 
to continue our successful internship and summer job programs to 
create real opportunities for our young people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are the kinds of initiatives that the people of 
Vaughan—King—Aurora are looking for from the government.  I am 
confident that this Speech from the Throne will meet with their 
approval as we gather for our first town hall meeting on the 36th 
Parliament on October 1. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With that in mind, I want to take a minute to compare the throne 
speech that opened the 35th Parliament and the one delivered on 
Tuesday.  In 1994 the words were cautious, the commitments 
solemn. But this one was different.  It was full of hope, 
optimism and excitement about what the future holds.  The 
Governor General spoke of a country in control of its finances, 
ready to reinvest in its society and optimistic about its future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As someone who as worked on the issue of youth employment for a 
number of years, I am encouraged by the fact that for the third 
time in three months youth employment is up. This is the first 
period of sustained youth employment growth since May 1990. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government's commitment to youth goes back to our days in 
opposition.  In 1992 in the face of the indifference our 
predecessors showed toward youth issues, our party established a 
Senate-Commons committee on youth.  Through national public 
hearings we met with young people, teachers, parents, social 
workers and members of the business community. The end result was 
a final report entitled “Agenda for Youth” which laid out a 
number of steps the government would take to assist young 
Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many of the recommendations we made in that report were 
incorporated into our party's election platform in 1993. 
Following the election we formed the government and the youth 
proposals in our platform were acted on immediately through the 
unveiling of the youth employment and learning strategy.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The strategy has three components: the youth internship program, 
youth service Canada and an improved Canada student loans 
program.  This three pronged approach has proven successful. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since 1994 youth internship Canada has helped nearly 50,000 
young people secure positions and gain professional experience. 
Our figures show that two-thirds of them will find a job within 
one year of leaving the program, usually with the employer they 
interned with. Sixty-eight percent of youth service Canada 
graduates either returned to school or found meaningful work 
within six months of completing their placement.  Over 60,000 
youths participated in the 1997 student summer job action.  In 
all, youth internship Canada, youth service Canada and the 
student summer job program have helped over one million young 
people since 1994. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our internship programs have a 78 percent success rate.  Right now our 
total investment in federal youth programs is approximately $2 
billion.  We have introduced a number of measures designed to 
build on our commitment to helping Canada's youth. The youth 
employment strategy will give over 110,000 young Canadians work 
experience opportunities.  The 1997 budget included measures 
designed to increase federal support for post-secondary education 
by approximately $137 million to make post-secondary education 
more accessible to young people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These programs and measures are only part of the solution.  As I 
said earlier I have spent a great deal of my political career 
listening to Canadians across the country.  I have found that the 
most innovative solutions come from young people.  For this 
reason I encourage members of Parliament on both sides of the 
House to seek input from Canada's youth as we try to address the 
various challenges they face. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to remind the House of something the governor 
general said in the throne speech.  He said “Our challenge is to 
ensure that no Canadian is left behind as the country moves 
forward”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our country is moving forward.  The deficit is vanishing, 
interests rates are low, unemployment is decreasing, productivity 
is up and there is a new sense of optimism.  We must all move 
forward together.  When certain groups are shown to be more 
vulnerable than others, society has a responsibility to lend a 
helping hand. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In our first mandate we began the work of dealing with youth 
unemployment.  By renewing our mandate I believe Canadians are 
saying in part let us get back in there and finish the job. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a member of Parliament I have also seen success at the local 
level.  Last term I was one of the founders of the Vaughan 
Technology Enterprise Centre, a project that identifies young 
entrepreneurs with a knack for high tech and teaches them the 
necessary skills to compete in the business world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Team Canada, a youth service Canada project, placed young people 
in local businesses seeking to expand their export potential. The 
youths explored emerging markets and designed a database of 
identified opportunities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am confident that by working together and by pooling our 
resources and by committing to nothing less than success we will 
overcome this challenge.  Our youth will look to the future with 
confidence and enthusiasm as they should. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a postscript I note with interest that a number of young 
people were elected to this House in the last election.  As 
someone who first entered this Chamber at the age of 28, I salute 
their courage and their determination.  I encourage them and all 
members to join together to deal with the many challenges facing

</I></B></P><P align=left><b>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</b> The hon. member for 
Kamouraska—Rivière-du-Loup. 
<P><A NAME="LINK193"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><b>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska—Rivière-du-Loup—Témiscouata—Les 
Basques, BQ):</b> Madam Speaker, perhaps I may finish the name of my riding, 
which is Kamouraska—Rivière-du-Loup—Témiscouata—Les Basques, 
representing its four regional county municipalities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It will be a pleasure to put my questions and comments to the hon. 
member for Vaughan—King—Aurora. In the past, we travelled across 
Canada together on the committee on employment insurance reform. I have 
a question which to me is entirely reasonable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This throne speech contains not a single reference to the fact that 
we should review the inequities in Canada's current employment 
insurance. A number of regressive measures were put into the system, the 
excuse being that there was not enough money, but by December 31, 1997 
there will be a surplus of $13 billion in the employment insurance fund. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With a surplus of $13 billion, the government nevertheless reduces 
the number of weeks during which people will be entitled to receive 
employment insurance, especially seasonal workers. They pay a penalty of 
1 per cent on the benefits they receive every time they draw employment 
insurance benefits for 20 weeks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In its throne speech, the government said that compassion and 
generosity were the hallmarks of this country. 
But there was not a single word about redressing these inequities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, if anyone should be aware of these inequities, it is the 
Liberal majority, because some of those who were here in the last 
Parliament, especially from the maritimes, and I am thinking of the 
Minister of Defence, are no longer here today. These are the people who 
paid the price for the fact that the Liberal majority did not listen to 
the public consultations that were held across Canada. The public wanted 
employment insurance reform but they wanted humane reform, the kind of 
reform that is a reflection of economic reality and gives regional 
economies a chance to diversify. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the hon. member not wonder why we are faced with this kind of 
situation today? 
Does he not feel like telling his government that it should act on the 
consensus reached by the ten provinces in Saint Andrews, where they 
asked for two things that were strangely similar to what the Bloc said 
in its campaign platform: a significant reduction in employment 
insurance premiums and improvements in the living conditions of seasonal 
workers and new labour market entrants? Is the hon. member prepared to 
tell his majority here in the House that all this is lacking in the 
throne speech and it should be corrected accordingly? 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><b>Mr. Maurizio Bevilacqua:</b>  Madam Speaker, I want to thank the 
hon. member for his question. He was one of the most active 
members of the human resources development committee which I had 
the honour to chair in the last parliamentary session. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am quite surprised that the hon. member did not view some of 
the changes we made to the employment insurance program as 
improvements to the program.  As the hon. member is fully aware, 
there have been great changes in the Canadian economy and with 
change also comes change to programs and institutions as they too 
must reflect the changing dynamics of our economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In reference to lowering the premiums, the hon. member knows we 
have lowered premiums each year.  If we followed the Conservative 
government's legislative timetable, the premiums would literally 
be going through the roof at this point. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I draw the attention of the hon. member to the actuarial report 
that basically stated that this surplus is required in case of an 
economic downturn to offset any of the strain that that may place 
on the federal treasury. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to also make it very clear that the reason why we have 
this so-called surplus is that we have learned from the mistakes 
of the previous government.  What the previous government did 
during the last recession was increase the premiums precisely at 
the time when firms and employees required a relief in premiums. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These issues need to be honestly put forward in this Chamber and 
outside as well, not to mention the reality that unemployment has 
indeed dropped in this country in large measure due to the 
effective partnership we have been able to create with the 
private sector.  Also, there is the fact that we have the 
fundamentals for the recovery well in place.

</I></B></P><P align=left><b>Mr. Paul Forseth (New Westminster—Coquitlam—Burnaby, Ref.):</b> 
Madam Speaker, I am splitting my time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The role of government is to provide a level of social order and 
progress that we cannot individually provide for ourselves. 
Canadians have expectations from government but they also have 
needs.  Therefore the government's throne speech in view of this 
reasonable standard is a disappointment, especially from a 
justice system perspective. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It has been a long voyage for society, from tribalism to this 
Canadian Parliament.  We indeed have accomplishments in Canada. 
We have built a country out of a harsh but bountiful land. 
However nation building is a passage, not an arrival.  Canada 
must continue to live, renew and flourish.  Canada is our home 
and our community but we just cannot take from it.  We must give 
back.  We must respect and nurture what has given us life by 
regarding basic principles. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately a downward spiral of cynicism has gripped many. 
They have given up on politicians because they have come to 
believe that average Canadians are too powerless to change 
anything as large, amorphous and detached as the way things are 
done in political Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the current context of this House, the throne speech is said 
to outline the vision of the new government.  However our society 
needs both sustenance and a hope to go forward.  The throne 
speech sadly is a mere chart for interim crew duty on the ship of 
state and not a bold course for our ship to sail through the 
winds of change. The Liberals have charted a course with their 
statement.  If it is a vision at all, it looks like we are 
sailing into the fog with faulty forecasts, with a ship they have 
not maintained and with an ill-prepared crew.  The bunch cannot 
be trusted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadian democracy as imperfect as it is has nominated this 
Liberal crew and they have now tried to reassure us in this 
throne speech that we are on a voyage somewhere. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a proverb that says that where there is no vision, the 
people perish, but he that keepeth the law, happy is he. Where 
there is no vision, the people get out of hand; blessed are they 
who keep the precept.  Where there is no revelation, the people 
cast off restraint; but blessed is he who keeps the law. Another 
proverb says that righteousness exalteth the nation, but sin is a 
reproach to any people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have risen to respond to the throne speech because I care 
deeply about our country and I despair at the kind of leadership 
and competence observed from the government.  Many Canadians 
watching here today do not feel very good about politics.  They 
have become very cynical about politicians and the process of 
elections.  They do not know who they can trust. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, I say that we can launch out, guided by love for our 
country, our community and a sincere concern for our neighbour. 
Joined together for the common good, we can discover what we can 
give to build this country rather than just calculate what we can 
get from the government which are really just other taxpayers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One thing is for sure.  If we in this House keep doing what we 
are doing, we are going to just keep getting what we are getting. 
It could be so much better. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians do not ask for the impossible.  They have reasonable 
expectations for their representatives. Although historical 
deference to Parliament is gone, Canadians basically expect three 
things: they want members of Parliament simply to be honest, to 
be competent and to have some leadership qualities to inspire. 
It is basic principles that matter, for by living by principles 
and receiving the humility that comes from them, we are empowered 
to learn from our history, act with confidence in the present and 
have vision for the future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First we want our politicians to be honest.  We want leaders to 
be forthright and have character.  We want to be able to believe 
and trust what we hear.  It has been said that character is what 
carries a person beyond adversity to the finish after the initial 
emotional reasons for doing the right things have faded. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians deeply value honesty.  Integrity in political life 
must come first. 
Therefore on this point do the Liberals have any integrity left 
in view of what they did to the Somalia inquiry?

<A HREF="#LINKT36"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, Canadians want competence. We want politicians who are 
qualified to look after our national affairs and to have depth of 
wisdom and a commitment to principles. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When there are no easy answers forthcoming on the issue of the 
day, it has been said that federal politics is conflict 
resolution at the national level but it is also taking care of 
the business of the country in a wise manner for the long term 
welfare of future generations, not short term special interests 
or for only those who currently have the inside track. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have much incompetence in government.  Therefore we need our 
leaders to be competent, to be able to get Canadians to pull 
together and then wisely administer.  However, on the topic of 
competent governance, we have a prime minister who has never 
given the country a balanced budget or had the courage to stem 
the rising tide of hurtful taxation.  And now he wants to lead a 
spending charge again.  Some competence, some leader. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Canada the crime rate is too high.  Victims are still not 
paramount in law and the Young Offenders Act remains in disrepute 
with the public and the provinces only have the broken promises 
of YOA funding. Tragic 745 hearings continue to tear communities 
apart. Our youth are enticed through a wide open legal door into 
prostitution and the supply of dangerous drugs has not been 
stemmed. Immigration fails to protect our borders and Canada is 
embarrassed before the world with the existence of the slavery 
pipeline. Federal jails cannot seem to hold dangerous offenders 
and we cannot even prosecute war criminals. That is the sorry 
Liberal administrative record.  They are not competent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Third, Canadians desire real leadership. We need inspiration and 
leaders who can lift us up.  We need real leaders who can look 
beyond today and inspire us with a vision of substance of a 
better Canada, with hope and real belief that we can do so much 
better than what we have politically. After hearing the feel good 
banalities of the throne speech, does any Canadian really feel 
inspired and believe that we are being wisely led or being 
protected from the criminal and given community peace?  Public 
acceptance for what the courts give is at an all time low. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, there is a reformist alternative of democratic free 
market principles that rigorously defends equality of 
opportunity, denies discrimination in any form to keep a foothold 
and trusts the common sense of average Canadians to do what is 
right and just for the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Reformers say the ultimate authority of the government rests in 
the people and full democratic power should be given to everyone. 
The people are competent.  Average Canadians can be trusted to do 
what is right for the country if they are told the complete truth 
and are finally given real political power. Reformers strive for 
responsible and accountable government rather than merely 
the current representative government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I come back to three things in respect of vision for the 
country, honesty, competence and leadership.  I am part of an 
honest, sincere group of colleagues who are competent and ready 
to govern and who are ready to inspire to take this country to a 
new level of democratic freedom, justice and social and economic 
prosperity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On leadership, I remind my colleagues in the House that there is 
a vision of a new Canada.  It is an exciting vision of a country 
that can finally become fully democratic and forever put aside 
the injustices from the old line political parties. We have a 
vision of a new Canada. Someday it will voters themselves who 
will decide how our country is run rather than four or five year 
dictatorships.  Someday all Canadians will truly be equal when 
there are no more special deals for categories, groups and 
insiders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Someday the justice system will represent mainstream Canadian 
values where we protect our children and properly denounce 
discrimination and violence. Someday the federal government will 
be an enabler rather than an oppressive tax taker.  We can lead 
the way from the scourge of unemployment, for a good crime 
prevention program is low unemployment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Someday we will shape a federation that is attractive enough for 
the discontented who say they want to separate to want to stay be 
fulfilled, lest they are left behind our dynamic and yet diverse 
society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I say we can protect our children from the criminal. We can 
support those who need our help, not with another handout but 
with a hand up.  We can finally say to the world community that 
Canada is a haven of freedom where we can be secure in our homes 
and have every opportunity to be fully engaged in the building of 
our national home. We can make our country fit for heroes to live 
in.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our opposition benches will do their part to lead us to that new 
Canada.  We will compliment the wise government policy, criticize 
the bad and propose constructive alternatives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, I say that the vision for the national voyage 
must be based on honesty, competence and leadership.  May the 
legislation which flows from the government be honestly 
presented.  May the government administer with the highest 
standards, guided by real accountability measures, and may the 
prime minister find himself and begin to lead, for whatever 
enlarges hope will exalt courage, for if he faints from these 
principles the nation knows that we on this side of the House are 
more than ready. 
<P><A NAME="LINK195"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><b>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Ref.):</b>  Madam Speaker, I 
would like to congratulate you on your position as Acting Speaker 
of the House.  It is an honourable position, which I am sure you 
know.  We extend our thanks to you in advance for your 
impartiality, your fairness and the important role which you will 
play in keeping us all in order and on topic. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to the topic today, we have been spending quite a 
bit of time on this side of the House talking about justice 
issues.  Today I was able to table a private member's bill which 
deals with a problem in my riding, joy riding.  Other members of 
the Reform Party have tabled an alternative legislative package 
for Canadians to consider when they see what it was the Liberals 
did not do on justice issues and what the Reform Party would like 
to do and would do if and when it has the chance to form the 
federal government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In August when the justice minister was before the bar 
association she spent some time detailing her priorities for the 
coming session.  She said that her priorities were changes to the 
Young Offenders Act, that she would toughen it up and make it 
tighter.  She said that she would deal with Canadians' concerns 
that the Young Offenders Act has become a leaking sieve rather 
than a catch basin which would look after our justice problems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>She said she was going to get tough on the parole system. She 
said she would look after the people who are slipping through the 
cracks and being released when they should not be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>She said she would deal with violent crime.  She said she would 
find ways to take violent criminals off the street and out of 
society and that public safety would be the number one concern. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last, I remember her saying clearly that she was going to deal 
with victim rights. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>None of those things are in the throne speech.  That is why the 
Reform Party today has spent a good deal of its time questioning 
the government about its priorities and about its sincerity in 
dealing with the issues that the new justice minister said in 
August were going to be the priorities of this government.  That 
is why we see the alternative package. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform member who just spoke gave a global picture of what 
is wrong with the justice system.  He talked about the 
theoretical problems, the problems that will plague the 
government until it fixes them.  He also talked about some of the 
principles which guide us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know he has extensive personal experience in the field. 
This is not simply a theoretical exercise for him.  He has 
experience dealing with juveniles, working in the justice system, 
and he has some expertise and some inside knowledge of what needs 
to be fixed in the justice system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wonder if the hon. member would like to expand a bit more on 
his thoughts on what needs to be done, with some specificity, so 
that we can take those ideas to heart, knowing his expertise. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><b>Mr. Paul Forseth:</b>  Madam Speaker, in the brief 10 minutes 
I was given I did touch, in broad generalities, about 
confidence in government, integrity and so forth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To take one specific example from my riding, when I was a child 
going to school on the streets of New Westminster I did not see 
prostitutes standing at bus stops.  There was a social context in 
my riding, and in most cities of this country, where street 
prostitution was not pervasive because there was a legal context 
which prohibited it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We may not ever remove the problem of prostitution from our 
society, but the law changed and capacity creates its own demand. 
When this Parliament made the mistakes and changed the law, we 
now have street prostitution from one end of the country to the 
other.

<A HREF="#LINKT38"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the last Parliament there was a fairly significant effort of 
the federal government to consult with the provinces and many 
reports were produced and many suggestions for particular amendments 
to the criminal law were made.  One specific one that appears to 
have agreement from all attorneys general across the country is 
simply communicating for the purposes of obtaining sexual 
services in a public place.  That specific offence should not 
merely be a summarial offence but it should be a hybrid offence. 
It should be an electable offence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This would provide the needed tools to the local police forces 
and the flexibility they need to arrest if necessary and allow an 
offender to appear before a justice and be released on some kind 
of recognisance order. It also helps with the identification of 
those on the street. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a very minor first step and I introduced a private 
member's bill specific to this.  I understand the previous 
justice minister acknowledged the need for this but gave the 
excuse of why he did not introduce that he was still consulting 
with the provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is time we begin to take some steps that all provinces across 
the country are asking for. 
<P><A NAME="LINK196"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><b>Mr. Chuck Cadman (Surrey North, Ref.):</b>  Madam Speaker, I 
am honoured to have this opportunity to respond to the throne 
speech, but first let me take this opportunity to thank the 
voters of Surrey North for showing their confidence in me. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Being new to this place I do not really know whether to be 
optimistic or cynical.  Like most Canadians, I continue to have 
hope that each new Parliament will be an improvement but fear 
that we will again be disappointed when our government proceeds 
for political reasons rather than for the best interest for 
Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As an example, it did not take the previous minister of justice 
long to advance his gun control legislation, even though he did 
not bother to determine whether and how registration would 
discourage the criminal misuse of firearms.  He stated repeatedly 
that he had consulted and that he had the support of Canadians. 
Perhaps he consulted with his leader's imaginary homeless friends 
because our aboriginal peoples consistently claim that they were 
not consulted, even though their treaty rights would be 
significantly affected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Consultation with the various provincial authorities is also in 
question, as four provinces and two territories are presently 
before the courts challenging our federal government on this 
legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this week's throne speech the government talked of 
partnerships.  It now states that the federal government cannot 
act alone.  It is indeed unfortunate that the previous government 
did not understand this concept. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then we have victim rights.  On April 29, 1996, after 
encouragement and pressure from the Reform Party, the former 
minister of justice stated in this House: “Although steps have 
been made toward progress in recent years, they have been 
imperfect.  There remains a great deal to be done”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He promised to address this deficiency in our laws.  It may come 
as a surprise but this hon. member either would not or could not 
carry through on his promise.  We must assume one of two things. 
Either it was not a priority on his personal political agenda or 
he was overruled. Regardless, Canadians are still waiting. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was with great disappointment that I noticed the almost 
complete absence of any substance toward rectifying the 
inadequacies of our criminal justice system in the throne speech. 
It is hoped that this government's priorities on justice have 
been inadvertently forgotten.  Otherwise Canadians will also be 
greatly disappointed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We now have a fresh new Minister of Justice.  Once again 
Canadians anticipate the introduction and passage of much needed 
legislation.  Hopefully she will be able to fulfil her promises 
regarding violent young offenders and victims of crime. Hopefully 
she will be interested in the pursuit of what is right for 
Canadians rather than what is right for the Liberal Party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the past Parliament many of the members opposite were most 
interested in passing legislation to provide alternative methods 
of sentencing.  For example, Bill C-41 permitted conditional 
sentencing which, while useful in some cases, is applicable to 
even those who violently offend within our communities. Bill C-53 
extended temporary absence provisions and Bill C-37 actually 
reduced the parole ineligibility for young offenders convicted of 
second degree murder in adult court. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But what did the government do for victims, those who have not 
deliberately decided to offend society's rules but just happen to 
be in the wrong place and the wrong time? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have made my home in British Columbia since 1971.  It is where 
my wife and I met 29 years ago, where we raised our family, where 
we work and where we pay our taxes.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Although my hometown of North Bay is not far from here, each 
time I fly here I pass directly over the place of my youth.  Last 
week I was able to pick out the beaches where I swam, the wharf 
where I fished and the streets where I walked, played and cycled. 
I could not help but to think about that young man growing up 
and the twists and turns his life would take over the next 40 
years which would put him in a jet plane flying to a seat in this 
House of Commons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My life was not that much different from the lives of most 
Canadians of my generation.  Violent crime was something we read 
or heard about, tragic events that happened to others.  That all 
changed on October 18, 1992 when our 16-year old son went to a 
party and never came home.  He was murdered on his way home in a 
random, unprovoked knife attack by a complete stranger, a young 
offender who was violating a court ordered curfew stemming from 
prior charges. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The next week in Courtenay, B.C. a six-year old girl was 
sexually assaulted and murdered by a sixteen-year old neighbour 
who was on probation for molesting a young child one year 
earlier.  The anonymity provisions of the Young Offenders Act 
precluded neighbours from knowing the threat he posed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Two weeks later in my community two women were butchered by a 
man who, because he said he was stoned on cocaine, received 10 
years for manslaughter.  He applied for parole last March.  The 
grass is barely green on the graves of his victims, one of whom 
was pregnant while the other left three young children.  The 
youngest, at the tender age of four years witnessed his mother's 
killing.  Barely three months had passed before a Surrey doctor 
facing a hearing for sexual impropriety had the young complainant 
murdered.  The hit man was free on bail after shooting a man in 
the face six months earlier. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our family spent nearly two years before the courts.  We have 
come to know many families of victims of violent crime and have 
followed many of their cases.  It did not take very long to 
realize that our system of justice is seriously out of kilter. 
Shortly after our son's murder we founded an organization to 
support victims and to work for justice reform through public 
education. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Time is not sufficient to detail our efforts but suffice to say 
that it was the way in which I was treated by the justice 
committee of the previous Parliament during its hearings on the 
youth justice system which propelled me into this arena.  It was 
painfully clear that the previous government was not prepared to 
listen to the views of ordinary Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have come to the House of Commons with the support of my 
constituents.  Along with representing their interests in this 
institution, they have given me a specific mandate to achieve 
better recognition for innocent victims of crime and reform of 
the criminal justice system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For too long society has dealt with justice as merely a 
jurisdiction between the state and the offender, the philosophy 
that an offence against the laws of our land is an offence 
against the state.  Little regard is given to the specific damage 
done to individual law-abiding citizens.  This must change, not 
merely because it may be politically advantageous but because it 
is right, because it is fair and because it is what real justice 
is all about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am serving notice that I fully intend to be particularly 
vigilant on this issue.  I realize that my task will be difficult 
as politicians of the past have been known to talk a good game, 
promising advancements in flowery complicated legal wording.  But 
legislation to do any real good for our communities must have 
substance.  It must be made more accessible, more equitable and 
more sympathetic toward victims of crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am hopeful that the present Minister of Justice will set her 
fellow Canadians at ease by being a breath of fresh air and being 
a saviour not of the rights of our criminals but of the rights of 
our innocent victims.  I am also hopeful that this new minister 
will be much more successful in her consultations and 
negotiations with the provinces.  A great deal of victims 
legislation will have to be co-ordinated with those provinces, 
which have the task of administering our criminal law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Funding for these services to victims will be of utmost interest 
and it is hoped this minister will use her persuasive powers to 
encourage the government to adequately provide those resources. 
She has promised a policy of co-operation with the provinces. She 
has assured us that victims of crime will be accorded better 
treatment within our justice system.  It is noted that she 
promised victims better treatment but at the same time denies 
them and the majority of Canadians their demand to repeal section 
745 of the Criminal Code.  Obviously we will have to work to 
convince her in that regard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I personally attended Clifford Olson's 745 hearing.  There are 
few words available with which to describe it.  Mockery and 
travesty come to mind.  Those who crafted section 745 and those 
who support it should hang their heads in shame. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform Party has been the most active in recognizing 
victims' rights. It is one of the primary reasons why I chose to 
run in the recent election for Reform.  I have been most 
fortunate to be chosen by my colleagues to watchdog this issue. 
The government has put on notice that we intend to aggressively 
pursue righting this wrong in a justice system that, for too 
long, has ignored and failed to adequately consider the rights 
and interests of victims.

the loss of his son but he talked about the particular offender 
in that regard, and a peculiar gap in the law.

committed heinous crimes while they were already before the

</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like him to expand on this issue where we have 
individuals who are law breakers, who are in process.  The

apparently, to stop their cycle of offending while they are still 
before the courts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><b>Mr. Chuck Cadman:</b>  Madam Speaker, I can relate to the 
business that the hon. member mentioned.  In this case, it is a 
section of the Young Offenders Act that I would like to see 
amended.  It would hold parents accountable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a section that holds parents accountable for failing to 
supervise an undertaking.  In in my particular case, this came 
into play because the father did undertake to supervise a curfew 
condition that was, obviously, not supervised properly.  It was 
not followed through in the courts.  It never is.  It could have 
been. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Right now it is a summary offence.  We would like to see that 
moved into something more of an indictable area. Situations like 
that force the families of victims of violence—in particular 
murder victims—into the civil courts which is something that we 
really do not feel they should have to go. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is not a route that should be taken.  It is just one extra 
roadblock on the way to recovery.  We feel many of these things

have, of course, much sympathy for what the hon. member for 
Surrey North has been sharing with us this afternoon.  We were 
all treated to that terrible travesty of justice recently where 
Clifford Olson was brought into our living rooms by television 
and other means to plead his case for early parole. It is the 
insensitivity of the government that has allowed this kind of 
thing to happen in Canadian society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a question for my hon. colleague.  I wonder if, in view 
of the tragic circumstances that his family has endured in the 
past few years, he has any light to shed on whether or not the 
penal system in this country does rehabilitate criminals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><b>Mr. Chuck Cadman:</b>  Madam Speaker, there is certainly a 
place within the criminal justice system, within the corrections 
system, for rehabilitation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I for one do not believe it works all the time.  In fact in most 
cases when dealing with serious violent offenders, with sexual 
predators, it has been shown that it does not work. There have 
been any number of instances of that over the past number of 
years.

better country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would ask the hon. member to comment on the area of victims 
rights.  He mentioned in his remarks the 745 hearings.  Having

really no words to describe it.  You had to be there.

representing eight of his 11 victims.  It was beyond 
comprehension what those families were put through in those four 
days.  It is not much more than what any family goes through when 
dealing with a parole hearing.  However, in the case of a section 
745 hearing, at one point a judge said “life with no parole for 
20” but these families were forced to deal with it at 15 years.

with my family for close to 30 years. The riding of Ahuntsic has 
a long Liberal tradition, and I take great pride in following in 
the steps of women like the Hon. Jeanne Sauvé and Thérèse 
Killens.  I pledge to continue to work hard with my government 
for the well-being of the residents of Ahuntsic, for nothing 
makes me happier than to serve my fellow citizens and all 
Canadians.  I thank the citizens of Ahuntsic for their support.

of our good governance, and because of a climate in which 974,000 
jobs have been created since we formed the government in 1993. 
For the first time in close to 30 years, the Government of Canada 
will not be facing a monumental deficit.  We are once again in a 
position to meet Canadians' priorities without exceeding our 
financial means. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The result is that we can now make strategic investments for our 
children, our young people, our health, and our communities, as 
well as for the sector of knowledge and creativity. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During our first mandate we demonstrated the leadership 
Canadians expect from their federal government.  That is why 
Canadians returned their confidence on June 2 by electing a 
Liberal government to lead them into the 21st century. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have restored their optimism and renewed their hope for the

</I></B></P><P align=left>That is what Liberalism is all about. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also know that the government cannot act alone.  Canadians 
want their government to work in partnership.  We are ready to 
work with all our partners—the provinces and territories, the 
private sector, non profit agencies, the volunteer sector and all 
Canadians—to better equip our country to meet the needs of 
Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are not trying to encroach on the fundamental rights of the 
provinces, as the Bloc Quebecois is accusing us of doing, but 
rather to help my province, Quebec, develop within this flexible 
federation. A more smoothly operating federation is the key to 
our future.  A federation is not static, but rather constantly 
changing.  Together we will decide how it will change. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Speech from the Throne sets out the broad lines of our 
strategy for our second mandate.  Job creation and economic growth 
are and will remain our first priorities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Accordingly, we want to keep our efforts focussed on helping 
small and medium size business develop and market new technologies. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Small and medium size businesses need to make the transition to 
new technologies if they are to survive in today's market. 
Manufacturers make up the majority of industry in my riding of 
Ahuntsic, names like Simon Chang, Tolédano and Christina Canada, 
which most recently received a grant from the federal government 
to help develop a new fibre for bathing suits.  This new project 
will help to create nearly 200 jobs in Ahuntsic. This initiative 
funded through the transitional job fund is an example of the 
success of our job creation commitment, and that is just one 
example in my riding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Investing in our youth has the largest return for Canada. As a 
mother of two young girls this issue is of utmost importance to 
me personally and I believe to all my colleagues in the House. We 
need to give children the best start possible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During our first mandate we established a prenatal program and 
increased the Canada child tax benefit by $850 million a year. In 
our second mandate we will continue to develop a national child 
benefit system to respond to the problems of low income families 
with children. We will also develop a national children's agenda 
and establish centres of excellence to deepen our understanding 
of children's development and well-being.  Who can argue with 
that? 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must do everything to guarantee our young people a better 
future.  The youth service corps and youth internship programs 
were hugely successful in our first mandate.  I had a number of 
projects in my riding and I can testify to their impact on the 
development of young people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Young people want to gain experience in order to overcome the 
obstacles blocking their entry into the labour market. 
Furthermore, this experience revives their self confidence and 
increases their worth with future employers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The youth employment strategy and the public service youth 
internship program will also create opportunities for young 
people in the riding of Ahuntsic and for the students of the 
collège Bois-de-Boulogne, who will certainly benefit from these 
programs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, the $1 billion Canada millennium scholarship endowment 
fund that the Prime Minister announced yesterday in response to 
the Speech from the Throne demonstrates once again our commitment 
to helping young Canadians.  I would like to congratulate the

develop alternatives to incarceration for low risk, non-violent 
offenders such as sentencing reforms, community diversion 
programs and alternative sentencing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My goal in my second mandate is to continue to serve my

</I></B></P><P align=left>I cannot resist the temptation to put, through you, a question 
to our colleague, who is from Montreal and represents a 
constituency similar to mine in that there are very specific 
concerns about Montreal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My question to the hon. member, which I hope she will answer, is 
this: Does she recognize that 20 years ago we were in a situation 
where the three leading federal parties—we tend to forget 
this, but a little over 20 years ago the Conservative Party, the 
NDP and the Liberal Party did recognize the existence of two 
nations or peoples in Canada. Why is it then that, for one reason 
or another, today, only lip service is paid to Quebec as a people 
or a nation, particularly on that side of the House? Is there 
cause for concern? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to ask my hon. colleague, through you, if she 
recognizes Quebec as a people. This is something that can be 
defined objectively. Each people has its own vernacular. In this 
case, it happens to be French. We also have control over a 
territory. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are few examples of federations in the world—and the 
hon. member sitting next to me is an expert on these issues—where 
one nation clearly has control over a territory, as is the 
case in Quebec. When we talk about peoples and nations, it always 
involves a clearly defined judicial system, as is the case in 
Quebec. These terms imply a will to live together, and the hon. 
member for Bourassa is aware of these issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All the objective elements are present so that the word 
“nations” can be used in the plural. Yet, some newspapers and

not Quebec-born. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What I wish to say is that, when the hon. member talks history, 
he must not forget that the two founding peoples include French 
Canadians throughout Canada, and not just in Quebec.  We must 
never forget that there are French Canadians outside Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As for partition, for me there is one Canada, indivisible. There 
is no question of dividing the best country in the world, and I 
have always fought against that during my 25 years in politics. I 
will repeat what I said in my speech.  If the hon. member has 
listened well, what I said was that we must work together for a

</I></B></P><P align=left>My question to her concerns her being Parliamentary Secretary to 
the Minister of Justice. I had occasion to have some people 
insist on having a discussion with me because someone they were 
associated with had been convicted of first degree murder 15

could see that in the eyes of these people when they met with me. 
These people are petrified at the potential of this killer being 
set free after 15 years.

such as in the awful case of Bernardo?  Why should we believe 
that our courts are going to be able to actually see that done?

the integrity of our justice system.

violence.  We cracked down on child prostitution and child sex 
tourism. I think that is proof enough that this government is

effect on people's lives and whose sole purpose is to cut taxes; 
a government that forgets that Canada is a big cold country and 
as John Ralston Saul has said, a country whose people agreed over 
150 years ago that they would have to look after one another. The 
true vision and values of Canadians are Liberal values. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Throughout the throne speech one finds the word 
“partnerships”.  It is an exciting time when government can be 
the catalyst that brings together the private, public and third 
sector to facilitate innovative programs that will have a 
positive effect in the lives of Canadians.  Partnerships require 
good communication and mutual respect. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have been surprised and overwhelmed by the enthusiasm and 
innovation present in our public service and their clear 
commitment to real partnerships.  Yesterday at the Industry 
Canada open house I was thrilled to see Schoolnet and Strategis 
as realities, to see the national graduates registry actually 
putting young Canadians to work on the digital collections and 
consulting small business.  It is quite clear that our young 
Canadians' real facility with technology will be the true 
leveller in our society.  The CEOs of this country are really 
learning directly from the recent grads. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I had the opportunity to see first hand last week one of the 
youth initiatives at HRDC.  Their award winning newspaper 
<I>Canada Prospects</I> is really talking to high school students 
in language they can relate to and it is working.  I was 
privileged to represent the minister at the launch of HRDC's new 
program, career in a box, creating a partnership between the 
federal government, the packaging industry and the CEC union. 
Hopefully this example of partnership will provide a template for 
which other sectors can soon follow. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Initiatives such as getting the volunteer sector on line is 
another true example of partnership and a commitment to make sure 
that Canadians are looked after but government does not have to 
deliver every service.  Organizations like ACTEW and Skills for 
Change in my riding embody the vision and values and have the 
expertise to help realize the potential of those highly motivated 
Canadians who would truly rather be working. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a family physician, my patients and now my constituents have 
made me acutely aware that they are increasingly concerned that 
the health care they need may not be there when they need it.  In 
Ontario the present restructuring is putting at risk the high 
quality care that Canadians wear as a badge of honour.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I support the establishment of the health transition fund that 
will help provincial governments innovate in the areas of primary 
care and provide more integration in the delivery of health 
services and innovative home care and pharmacare. By finally 
moving forward with health care reform we can hopefully begin to 
ameliorate the damage done by the closing of hospitals and 
old-fashioned mergers before resources have been properly placed 
into community care. By improving the health information system, 
we will finally be able to track outcomes and ensure the kind of 
accountability that is required in order to support what up until 
now has only been supported anecdotally. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Throughout North America, health institutions are sharing 
services, saving dollars and proving that restructuring can be 
done without destroying institutions like Women's College 
Hospital and eroding public confidence in the system. In my 
former role as host of <I>Doctor On Call</I> on WTN, I was shocked 
at the disparity of health care across the country.  It is only 
with the facts that we will finally be able to address the 
inequities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The tenets of the Canada Health Act presumed high quality care. 
Accessibility to bargain basement standards is not what was 
intended nor what Canadians expect.  These new initiatives will 
ensure increased accountability and real measurements of quality 
such that we can restore the confidence of Canadians in their 
health care system. We can no longer tolerate benchmarks that are 
not based on quality. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Ontario sending people home from hospital quicker and sicker 
is what seems to be rewarded.  We know the data is flawed and we 
know that readmission rates are not being tracked and that the 
women of this country are being left to pick up the pieces when 
patients are sent home too sick to look after themselves. We need 
to measure the absenteeism of those working women and the real 
cost to our country. Some companies are already convinced that 
partnerships in home care for their employees is just plain good 
business. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Health care delivery may be a provincial responsibility but 
there is no question in my mind that all Canadians hold us, the 
federal government, responsible for the existence and the quality 
of our health care system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For me the sustainability of the health care system is reliant 
upon the recognition of all the determinants of health:  jobs and 
poverty, violence and crime prevention, the environment.  The 
priorities set out on Tuesday of investing in children, building 
safer communities, creating opportunities for young Canadians, 
are all part of our goal of keeping Canadians healthy.  It is 
really about decreasing the demand so that we can guarantee 
adequate supply. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Throughout the summer my constituents have already been 
reassured by the efforts of the Minister of Intergovernmental 
Affairs to bring frankness and clarity to any debate that could 
put in jeopardy the future of this country.  They too believe 
that our future as a country is too precious for us to risk 
losing it through misunderstanding.  The issue of national unity 
continues to be of paramount importance to the residents of St. 
Paul's. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Madam Speaker, I would like to thank you and your office 
personally for the excellent opportunity that your office 
provided at the centre d'immersion at Saint-Jean-sur-Richelieu. 
It helped me become a little more comfortable in our other 
official language.  I also felt that the exposure to Madam 
Gervais and her staff with their frank conversations helped me to 
better understand the point of view that will be important to the 
future of a united Canada. This experience and exposure has been 
invaluable to me as a member of Parliament and has allowed me 
already to help explain to the people of St. Paul's the need for 
even greater understanding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I recommend that all Canadians take any opportunity they can to 
visit Quebec. I hope this sort of exchange among all provinces 
will become a focus for some of our millennium celebrations.  As 
we move toward the millennium I feel extremely proud to be a 
Canadian. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last week I had the opportunity to speak to the Canadian 
Publishers Association which was entertaining a delegation of 20 
Japanese publishers.  I was asked to help them differentiate 
between Canadians and Americans.  I focused on two things, both 
highlighted in the Speech from the Throne: our commitment to look 
after one another and our respect for multiculturalism. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>American author John Irving who with his Canadian wife has an 
apartment in St. Paul's, pointed out that it is the expectation 
of the Canadian social system to look after the people who cannot 
look after themselves.  There is no such expectation in the 
United States.  That is another reason to protect our culture and 
to celebrate the stories of Canadians and by Canadians.  We can 
remember that in <I>Fifth Business</I> Dunstan Ramsay looked after 
Boy Staunton. There is also the wonderful Canadian nurse who 
looked after the English patient.  We are different. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am so proud to be married to Peter O'Brian who with his films 
such as <I>Grey Fox</I> and <I>My American Cousin</I> continues to 
find and produce films that tell our stories.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Our respect for diversity also makes us different.  I suggest 
that perhaps the publishing industry has demonstrated such 
success because of its recognition of the tremendous talent of 
our Canadians with roots around the world:  Ondaatje, Ricci, 
Bissoondath, Kogawa. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we move into this exciting new chapter, I am honoured to be 
part of a government that has accepted the challenge“to ensure 
that no Canadian is left behind as the country moves forward”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I thank my husband and my sons for making my decision such an 
easy one and I thank my parents for their commitment of hard work 
and commitment to the customer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Being a member of Parliament is truly the greatest privilege and 
responsibility.  Politics and the opportunity to be part of a 
good government that can make a real difference in people's lives 
is indeed the highest calling.  I promise that I will do 
everything in my power to continue to earn the trust the people 
of St. Paul's have placed in me.

</I></B></P><P align=left><b>Ms. Angela Vautour (Beauséjour—Petitcodiac, NDP):</b>  Madam 
Speaker, I found it rather unusual that in the member's speech 
she mentioned health care in Ontario, and of how people are sent 
back home too soon as if it was just happening in Ontario. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I guess I just wanted to make members aware that this has been 
happening in the Atlantic provinces for quite a long time, having 
been, myself, a statistic of that.  I had a child 22 months ago. 
She was born on Wednesday and Friday morning I was out.  Friday 
night I was back in with my daughter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Believe me it is not only the problem of the premier of Ontario. 
It is actually the federal government's problem because of the 
cuts transferred to the provinces.  I want to make it clear that 
it is happening in the Atlantic provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><b>Mrs. Carolyn Bennett:</b>  Madam Speaker, I am aware that this 
is a problem across the country.  I believe it is not the fault 
of the transfer payment cuts which I think were very necessary in 
order to be able to reduce the interest payments and for us to 
continue to do good work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do think, though, that the federal government has an ability 
to track these kinds of outcomes and be able to set some 
standards that all provinces can then set as true accountability 
for their performance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We do not really know the readmission rate of maternity 
patients.  We do not really know the readmission rate of people 
being sent home from hospital too early.  We need to know those 
statistics so that we know where to reinvest and how to set 
examples for excellent quality care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What I am most concerned with is that we have to do everything 
in our power to restore the confidence of Canadians in our health 
care system, because otherwise we end up on the slippery slope to 
an American system.  I will do everything in my power to prevent 
that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><b>Ms. Angela Vautour:</b>  Madam Speaker, I guess what I would 
like to know then is how are the Liberals planning on finding out 
those statistics?  What is the plan now? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><b>Mrs. Carolyn Bennett:</b>  Madam Speaker, I think the 
beginning is the health information network.  In Ontario, we have 
the beginning with ICES, a plan for keeping track of certain 
things. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is really important when we start to track information that 
we ask what questions do we want answered and then to go and get 
that information.  I think things like early discharge from 
maternity care, discharge from hospital readmission rates are 
probably the way to go, waiting lists. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need to look at different kinds of problems, such as looking 
at pharmacare and seeing that in certain provinces when drugs are 
cut off the list, the patients have to be admitted to hospital in 
order to get that drug. That is not saving the overall budget any 
money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need to know that those kinds of things are happening.  We 
need to know the kind of absenteeism in the women's workforce 
that is happening because women have to stay off work in order to 
go and look after their sick relatives who have been sent home 
from hospital too early. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think we can get that data, but we are going to need 
everybody's help in finding out what questions we need to be 
asking in order to go and track that data.

</I></B></P><P align=left><b>Mr. René Canuel (Matapédia—Matane, BQ):</b> Madam Speaker, I will 
share the 20 minutes allocated to me with my colleague from 
Kamouraska—Rivière-du-Loup—Témiscouata—Les Basques. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to start by thanking my constituents in 
Matapédia—Matane. The riding is so big it could be a country. I 
say this for the benefit of my hon. friends opposite, because 
many have never set foot in my riding, except to make an 
announcement and wave the Canadian flag during election 
campaigns. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My riding extends from Saint-Moïse to Maria and from 
Baie-des-Sables to Madeleine. This is 750 kilometres. In other 
words, as far as Amqui to Ottawa. It takes about 10 hours or a 
day to travel the perimeter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to thank my constituents for putting their trust in me. 
Some of them reelected me, others elected me for the first time. 
The people of Matapédia—Matane elected me to a second term. This 
is when I made the best showing. I served them well for four 
years, and I got a substantial majority. In Avignon and 
Denis-Riverin it was a little harder, because I was not as 
well-known. So I think we can say that Bloc members have to get 
out there and meet people and also cover a lot of ground. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>People put their trust in me because I was there for them, but 
it is more than that. They trusted the man who defended 
sovereignty during the election campaign. I was very frank. I 
told them that if they wanted to elect a federalist, there were 
some very good ones. There were some outstanding candidates. But 
if they wanted to elect a sovereignist, there was only one 
choice. And today, I am here. Again, I thank the people in my 
riding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These people are not stupid. They are sick and tired of hearing 
meaningless terms like “distinct society” and “unique 
society”. Some people, one of them a fisher, said “as unique as 
Matane shrimp”. What does that mean? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><b>An hon. member:</b> The shrimp come from Sept-îles. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><b>Mr. René Canuel:</b> Yes, they are caught in Sept-Îles and eaten in 
Matane, and they are excellent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In philosophy, we say words are very important, so let us stop 
saying that words like “unique” and “distinct” no longer mean 
anything. Even Claude Ryan said these words were meaningless. 
When we ask our hon. friends opposite whether they are prepared 
to recognize us as a founding people, they all start to stammer 
and stutter. They do not have the guts to say they cannot 
recognize us as a founding people because, when it comes down to 
it, they do not recognize us. Well at least they are consistent. 
They are afraid to come out and say so. That I can understand, 
and I thank them for being consistent. I can follow that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government, however, is doing everything it can to diminish us, 
to reduce us to the level of some ethnic group. I may recall that 
aboriginal peoples were here at the very beginning. Everybody recognizes 
them. Then, we had two founding peoples. Everybody acknowledges that. 
But today, it would be nice if members opposite were able to say yes, 
you are a people.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I was in Vancouver during the holidays. A very nice place, but I 
could not feel at home there.  Perhaps the Vancouverites who come 
to Quebec feel the same.  I respect that. There is something 
missing, however.  Are we treated as equals? I think not.  The 
people down home have a rather colourful way of speaking, and I 
am going to adopt a bit of that.  Such a lovely way of speaking. 
They do not mince words. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They are sick and tired of commissions, of all the different 
commissions.  They are also sick and tired of the attacks on our 
integrity.  They are disgusted, too, by the psychological 
profiles of the premier of Quebec.  They sick and tired of seeing 
the multinationals using tax havens to get rich. They have been 
demanding action on this for a long time. Yet nothing happens. 
They are sick and tired, as well, of seeing the rich families 
protected by family trusts.  Sick and tired of seeing banks 
making billion dollar profits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I asked a big banker “Would you go bankrupt if Canadian taxes 
were raised a little?” He said “Not at all”.  Do you know why? 
Do you know why the rich of this country are protected?  That is 
easy to understand.  Big businesses are the ones contributing to 
campaign funds, and then they find the Prime Minister's door wide 
open to them, the ministers' doors wide open to them.  “We gave, 
so now it's our turn”.  That works out very well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There was an attempt made here to get a little bill passed on 
political party fundraising.  No way would the Conservatives or 
the Liberals vote for that.  Ask yourselves why, ladies and 
gentlemen. My fellow citizens know very well why not. We can see 
that the hands of the members opposite are tied.  The people at 
home and even the people in the Atlantic provinces have not 
forgiven them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Employment insurance, which I call poverty insurance, is causing 
problems at home.  Some people are going to find the winter long: 
910 hours to start.  Some mothers and fathers are short 50 or 75 
hours.  Will they go on welfare?  If they do, as you know, when 
you have children, they will have to sell their house.  Obviously 
it is a last resort.  We are entitled to a few thousand bucks in 
the bank. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That means those people are without hope.  I have seen people 
crying in my office because they found this legislation so 
totally inhumane.  This government has not the heart to change 
it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope that those who do have a little heart will understand 
people living in poverty. What is there in the speech from the 
throne for the rural community?  One little, very little, 
minuscule paragraph: “It is our good intention to—”.  Go ahead 
and read it again.  I have not got time to read it, but read it 
carefully. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is in it for fishers?  Nothing.  What about forest workers? 
Absolutely nothing.  And farmers?  Nothing.  A fine country, 
great and rich.  They are busting with pride. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our people are no fools.  The people in my riding voted 64 per 
cent in favour of sovereignty in the last referendum, and the 
vote will be even higher in the next one, because the government 
is totally inhumane and unfair to rural communities.  It says: 
“Let us feed the rich, because they support us”.

</I></B></P><P align=left><b>Mr. Denis Coderre (Bourassa, Lib.):</b> Madam Speaker, I also 
take this opportunity to congratulate you on your excellent 
appointment. It is once again someone from Quebec, a French 
Canadian woman, who was appointed by the government, through the 
Prime Minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was listening to the members of the club of the outraged, if I 
can put it that way. These people never feel free; they feel hard 
done by. However, given what their head office in Quebec City, 
more specifically the real leader of the Bloc Quebecois, Lucien 
Bouchard, is doing, I hope the hon. member opposite will be every 
bit as critical of his own people. If the member has any human 
sentiment, as he claims he does, he must have little sympathy for 
Minister Trudel, who is doing terrible things to municipalities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was in Chicoutimi last week and, once again, through the 
federal office of regional development and the Minister of 
Industry, we showed that we believe in partnership, that we can 
work with provincial organizations. We provided funding for 
another industrial chair at the Université du Québec in 
Chicoutimi. Again, this initiative will help improve people's 
quality of life. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A general council was recently held in Lévis. French Canadians 
from other provinces were once again left out in the cold. When 
it suits its purposes, the Bloc Quebecois speaks on behalf of 
French Canadians living outside Quebec. However, when it does not 
suit its needs, it just forgets about them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to know if the hon. member recognizes the French 
Canadian people, because the other side often plays the same 
cassette on the concept of people. Is there a French Canadian 
people? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><b>Mr. René Canuel:</b> Madam Speaker, I could answer without 
answering as they do, but I choose not to. There is a people of 
Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><b>An hon. member:</b> That is right. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><b>Mr. René Canuel:</b> And this people, in Quebec, is very responsive to 
all francophones wherever they are, particularly in Canada. We will be 
very responsive. We will listen to them and help them, no doubt about 
it. But start by recognizing us as a people, then we will be able to go 
some distance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>You referred earlier to the club of the outraged. In doing so, 
you have insulted every one of my constituents. You have insulted 
Quebecers because what I was saying is this: the reason Lucien 
Bouchard has to make cuts is that the federal government made 
cuts, billions in cuts to provincial transfers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>You, across the way, are the ones who should take the blame; but 
don't go speaking to us like that. 
<P><A NAME="LINK207"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><b>Mr. Antoine Dubé (Lévis, BQ):</b> Madam Speaker, as always, the 
member for Matapédia—Matane has spoken right from the heart, 
from his knowledge of the particular situation of his 
constituents.  He is most eloquent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since the members across the way have not answered the question, 
I would ask my colleague, who cannot have failed to hear the 
Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Intergovernmental 
Affairs yesterday, when he said in this House:  “We cannot 
recognize you as a people, as the people of Quebec, because that 
would give you rights”, what he thinks of that remark? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><b>Mr. René Canuel:</b> Madam Speaker, I find this unresponsiveness 
particularly disturbing when we have asked so little of Quebecers 
across the way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are asking them if we are a people.  It is not a difficult 
question.  Not a one of the members opposite has replied.  Or 
perhaps they do not understand what the word “people” means. 
Maybe that is the problem.  If you do not understand the meaning 
of the word, perhaps we can explain it to you, but if you do in 
fact understand it, you are being dishonest in your answers.  It 
is twisted, very twisted, and I am sorry but—and I will conclude 
on this—I am anxious to see a Quebecer say: “Yes, you are a 
people”.

</I></B></P><P align=left><b>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska—Rivière-du-Loup—Témiscouata—Les 
Basques, BQ):</b> Madam Speaker, I am pleased to speak today in the 
debate on the Speech from the Throne. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First of all, I would like to thank the voters for renewing my 
mandate as a Bloc MP, and for allowing me to be a member of the 
team of 44 sovereignist members from Quebec out of 75 Quebec 
ridings. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a majority of sovereignist members in this Parliament, 
people who want Quebec to become a country, who received the 
mandate from their public to come and tell the Canadian 
Parliament that Canada no longer meets the needs of Quebec when 
it comes to development that will ensure its autonomy and its 
capacity to grow. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my opinion, the Speech from the Throne ought to be a sort of 
snapshot of the government's plan of action. Not of the program 
of the party in power, but of the government's plan of action. A 
government is supposed to take the election results into 
consideration, and this was an election in which loads of 
Liberals got beaten in the maritimes and vanished from eastern 
Quebec, because they lacked the necessary sensitivity or the 
necessary clout in caucus to get the government to be more humane 
in the way it was applying employment insurance reform. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some of these had been good members of this House, but they had 
to pay the price.  In its Speech from the Throne, the present 
government ought to take that into consideration. Because it is 
the government of all Canadians, it ought to have taken into 
consideration that a message had indeed been sent to it, a very 
clear message, and ought to have said that the old government of 
1993-97 had been forced to behave inhumanely, perhaps because of 
financial constraints.  But today, with the known surplus in the 
employment insurance fund, a surplus of $13 billion as at 
December 31, 1997—this program does not operate on a zero-based 
budget—but a $13 billion surplus— 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those billions were collected from people earning $39,000 or 
less.  The decision was made to lower the ceiling in the 
legislation to $39,000.  So those earning under $39,000 are 
financing the battle against the deficit the most. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today in the Speech from the Throne, having heard the very clear 
message from the people in the maritimes, eastern Quebec and the 
regions hard hit by seasonal unemployment, the government acted 
as if the problem did not exist.  This is one example, but there 
is another even more significant and catastrophic. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The speech says: “The Parliament of Canada is the only 
institution directly elected by all Canadians—”.  That is true. 
This is one reason why I am a sovereignist. When you are a 
Quebecer and you give significant powers to a majority that will 
never be your own people, as in transport, the whole foreign 
affairs question, everything to do with citizenship and 
immigration, any people that decides to give these 
responsibilities to another majority sort of commits suicide, and 
this is what is happening little by little. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the time of confederation, the balance was about 50:50, 
anglophone to francophone.  Today, Quebec represents about 24 
percent of the population.  Francophones have less and less real 
weight. Significant choices were made in Canada's history.  When 
Manitoba was created, for example, a supposedly bilingual 
province, French was prohibited there in order to overturn the 
balance that had existed in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is the sort of historical baggage we find in the Speech 
from the Throne, which invites us to watch in the next millennium 
to see whether this fine and grand country will produce the 
expected results. We are the messengers of the people.  We do not 
come out of a box of cracker jacks. The 44 sovereignist members 
from Quebec were elected by the people to come and tell you that 
there is something fundamentally wrong with Canada.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The speech also says, and I think it is hypocritical in the 
extreme, that “we have the values of sharing and mutual help”, 
but not a single word about the seasonal workers and new labour 
market entrants who have to work 910 hours to be eligible for 
employment insurance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the information of the newly elected Liberal members in this 
Parliament, before employment insurance reform, it took 300 hours 
to be eligible for employment insurance. Today, a first time 
applicant who has finished a CEGEP course in deep sea fishing or 
wild life management where there is a lot of seasonal work, that 
person will pay employment insurance premiums from the first hour 
worked, but he will never manage to work 910 hours during his 
first year. This means that more and more people are paying 
premiums who will never be able to benefit under the system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Between 1990 and 1997, 60 percent of the people received 
benefits under a system to which they contributed one third of 
the funding. We would have expected this kind of behaviour from 
the Conservatives. They said they would do it, and they have 
always done that sort of thing. But we did not expect the 
Liberals to turn around and behave the way they did during the 
last Parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the throne speech they had a chance to correct this, but there 
is no sign they did so. It is pretty obvious this government is not 
listening. It is not getting the messages from the public. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another point I would like to raise is that the government talks 
about making Canada a prime tourist destination. We had a very 
concrete example of how federalist Canada thinks that Ottawa has 
the solutions and that everyone else should understand that they 
are the right ones.  A $500 million program was set up to help 
strong enterprises already successful in the tourism sector to 
develop projects.  This may be worthwhile and significant, but 
this program—and it is the only one—does not help develop 
significant tourism infrastructures outside major centres that do 
not have as solid a financial base.  In other words, people are 
on their own. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For regions looking at overhauling the seasonal industry, the 
federal program is completely inadequate and will only widen the 
gap between large tourist centres and those that have not yet 
built up significant infrastructures. Here again, we see their 
failure to listen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another example, which in my view is indicative of their 
contempt, is the issue of the Canadian social union.  The 
premiers of all provinces except Quebec agreed unanimously on an 
approach to social programs that was never approved by Quebec. 
You can go back to 1971, when Mr. Bourassa, Quebec's premier at 
the time, refused to sign the constitutional amendments in 
Victoria for the very reason that the federal team wanted to 
interfere in Quebec's areas of jurisdiction. Since then, Quebec 
has never, under any of its premiers, whether federalist or 
sovereignist, agreed to the kinds of things which the premiers of 
the other nine provinces are able to accept.  The premiers of 
those provinces all have a similar approach.  But Quebec's 
jurisdiction under the present Constitution is completely 
ignored. They want Quebec to have to comply with national 
standards set by the federal government, and that is unacceptable 
to me. This must be made clear and obvious, and the members of 
the Bloc Quebecois are here to make that point. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to raise another issue, as I feel it is important. 
A gesture of good faith one would expect from the government, 
that could be included in the amendments to the speech, concerns 
the whole issue of regional and local development. The federal 
government has set up a structure similar to the one in Quebec 
with the community futures development corporations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In each of our regions, we have people working for these 
corporations, who are doing their best to help. But at the same 
time there is this other network in place in Quebec: the local 
development committees. The federal government, which does not 
have any responsibility for local development, should just accept 
to withdraw from that area, transferring all responsibility with 
full compensation to Quebec and authorize the amalgamation of 
community futures development corporations and local development 
committees.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I give these examples to show that this throne speech in no way 
responds to the will expressed by a large percentage of the 
population of Quebec and the maritimes in the last election. The 
government is unresponsive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are entering into what really is a period of transition, and 
if there is something that this throne speech says to me, it is 
that, in our vision of the future, Quebecers will inevitably have 
to make a choice. They have the choice of being assimilated, 
which would have the result we are seeing now in francophone 
communities in the rest of Canada. That is a choice we will not 
accept, and we will never be the ones to bring about our own 
extinction within the Canadian fold. We will not let ourselves be 
bulldozed in spite of what all the doomsayers might say. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I invite you all to celebrate the new millennium. Here we are 
invited to celebrate the third millennium, but I invite you all 
to come celebrate with the people of Quebec who will have given 
themselves a new country for the year 2000.

</I></B></P><P align=left><b>Mr. David Pratt (Nepean—Carleton, Lib.):</b>  Madam Speaker, 
congratulations on your appointment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I listened to the hon. member with some interest.  It certainly 
appears he is filling the role of a dutiful opposition member in 
terms of attacking the government.  However, I am sure he is 
aware of some of the news that we have had in Canada over the 
last few years and more recently.  I am thinking of course of 
deficit reduction, taking the deficit from $42 billion down to 
zero, that interest rates are at their lowest levels in 30 years, 
that almost one million jobs have been create, that there have 
been massive increases in Canada's trade surplus, that our 
economic growth is going to be the best in the G-7 and that, of 
course, and we have all heard this before, Canada has been rated 
number one according to the United Nations human development 
index. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would ask the hon. member, with all the things that have 
happened over the last four years and all of the positive 
developments, would he not concede that there have been at least 
a few positive developments in Canada which are going to benefit 
his constituents? 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><b>Mr. Paul Crête:</b> Madam Speaker, I never said that nothing positive 
has happened over the past four years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><b>Mr. Denis Coderre:</b> Hear, hear. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><b>Mr. Paul Crête:</b> However, I noticed, for example, that in the fight 
against the deficit—and I would ask the hon. member for Bourassa, who 
is applauding, to do so in public as well, so everyone will know that he 
thinks my comments make perfect sense. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As regards the fight against the deficit, do you know who paid 
the price? By December 31, 1997, a surplus of $13 billion will 
have been taken from the employment insurance fund. Who paid the 
price for that? The government slashed $42 billion from transfer 
payments for health and education. That is how the federal 
government achieved the results it brags about in its fight 
against the deficit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1993, in case the hon. member has forgotten, the Liberals ran 
on a slogan of “jobs, jobs, jobs”. As far as I know, we still 
have 1.5 million Canadians unemployed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we look at what is right and what is wrong with Canada, we 
realize there are still big changes that need to be made. The 
fact that jobs are being created for those with diplomas and 
relevant training and those who are part of the new economy 
should not obscure the fact that whole generations are being 
sacrificed. This does not mean that a Canada barely out of its 
19th century mentality does not have what it takes to face the 
challenges of the 21st century. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the 19th century, big political entities were needed to 
ensure big markets. Free trade has changed all that. What we need 
today is small nations that can stand up for themselves, prosper 
and compete on global markets. Canada's current structure cannot 
fill Quebecers' needs for the future.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Basically, I think that the Liberal Party of Canada is in a dead

</I></B></P><P align=left><b>An hon. member: </b>There is still some time left. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><b>Mr. Paul Crête:</b> Madam Speaker did not say that my time was up. 
You should respect the mandate of your new speaker. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yes, there have been improvements; you can see improvements 
anywhere in North America or in the world, but it remains that 
some problems have not been dealt with. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The throne speech quotes Sir Wilfrid Laurier. When my 
grandfather voted for the first time he said: “I will vote for 
Laurier because I hope that one day this will bring about 
equality between French Canadians and English Canadians”. Well, 
today, nearly 100 years later, this has not yet been achieved. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The only way we will ever have equality between Quebec and 
Canada, a sound relationship, a relationship between mature 
peoples, is for Quebec to become sovereign. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><b>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Thibeault):</b>  It being 2.30 p.m., the 
House stands adjourned until Monday next at 11 a.m., pursuant to 
Standing Order 24(1).
