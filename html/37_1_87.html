	moved for leave to introduce Bill
					 C-398, an act to amend the Criminal Code (consecutive
					 sentence for use of firearm in commission of offence).</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said: Mr. Speaker, it is my pleasure to introduce
					 the bill entitled an act to amend the Criminal Code (consecutive sentence for
					 use of firearm in commission of offence). The bill could also be known as the
					 10-20 life law because it would provide that for anyone who commits a violent
					 crime and uses a firearm in the commission of that offence an additional 10
					 years would be added to any sentence, 20 years if the firearm is discharged,
					 and life if someone other than the perpetrator of the crime or an accomplice is
					 injured.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is the criminal use of firearms that we should
					 concern ourselves with. The Liberal government should have brought forward a
					 10-20 life law instead of forcing law abiding Canadians to register their
					 firearms.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purpose of the legislation is to fill a void that
					 exists because there are no current laws or provisions within Canada's criminal
					 code that adequately deter someone from using a firearm when committing a
					 violent crime.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, I rise to present another petition from
					 citizens of the Peterborough area who are concerned about kidney disease, which
					 is a huge and growing problem in Canada.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their petition requests that parliament do all it can
					 to explicitly include kidney research as one of the institutes in the Canadian
					 Institutes of Health Research. They suggest that the institute be called the
					 kidney and urinary tract diseases institute.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to point out these citizens are not
					 criticizing the kidney research being done in Canada at the present time but
					 simply the name of the institute under which it is being done. The name of that
					 institute is the Institute of Nutrition, Metabolism and Diabetes. The citizens
					 in Peterborough believe that this institute would be even more effective if the
					 word kidney could be included in its title.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Transportation is an important issue for all of the

					 requesting that the federal government commit to funding for the construction
					 of a bridge linking Tadoussac and Baie-Sainte-Catherine. </p>

				  </b>

	Mr. Speaker, the following questions will be answered
					 today: Nos. 59 and 60.</p>


	<center><b>Question No. 59--</b></center>
		

	Mr. John Duncan:<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How much money has been spent on the software program
					 known as “The Firearm Reference Table”, first to implement it and later to
					 correct its flaws and re-implement it?</p>


	<b>Mr. Stephen Owen (Parliamentary
					 Secretary to the Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada,
					 Lib.)</b>:<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Firearms Reference Table, FRT, has been updated and
					 modified since its inception in the fall of 1997. Generally, an updated release
					 of the FRT is the result of an increased collection of data. The program
					 functionality is also enhanced in newer CD ROM releases of the FRT to improve
					 user friendliness for clients. The information in the FRT must be kept current
					 in order to make it an accurate resource for users. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The continuous addition of information is only one area
					 of responsibility for most of the Canadian Firearms Registry, CFR, staff
					 involved in contributing to FRT development. Therefore, there are no figures
					 available reflecting the cost to date of the FRT. Extensive research would be
					 required in order to calculate these costs. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first release took place in June 1998. There have
					 been seven subsequent releases, with the most recent release taking place in
					 June 2001. In this regard, the client base has grown from approximately 200
					 users to over 6,500 users in 2001. </p>


	<center><b>Question No. 60--</b></center>
		

	Mr. John Duncan:<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the approximately 600,000 “possession-only” firearms
					 licences issued without the mandatory background checks, in order to expedite
					 the process, how many have now had the background checks completed as of May
					 31, 2001?</p>


	<b>Mr. Stephen Owen (Parliamentary
					 Secretary to the Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada,
					 Lib.)</b>: <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Possession-only licences were never issued without the
					 necessary background checks. Public safety checks were performed on all
					 applicants who were issued a possession-only or possession and acquisition
					 licence. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of the high volume of licence applications
					 received at the end of 2000, temporary licences were issued for those who
					 already possessed firearms and who applied for a possession-only or a
					 possession and acquisition licence by January 1, 2001. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before temporary licences were issued, background
					 checks were carried out on each applicant to determine their eligibility in
					 accordance with the Firearms Act. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Temporary licences allowed firearm owners to lawfully
					 possess their firearms and to purchase ammunition while their licences were
					 being processed. The temporary licences did not allow individuals to purchase
					 additional firearms.</p>

					 Canadian Alliance): </b>

	Mr. Speaker, on September 4, 2001, I wrote to you
					 requesting an emergency agriculture debate for September 17. The tragic and
					 horrific events of September 11 have overshadowed all the other issues that we
					 refer to as domestic issues. Some of these domestic issues have reached the
					 point where many people involved in the industry are now facing a crisis
					 situation. The industry I am talking about is agriculture. I had resubmitted
					 the request to have this crucial debate for the evening of September 26, but
					 once again events in the House resulting from the tragedy of September 11 did
					 not facilitate a ruling on my request.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I still feel that these issues must quickly come before
					 the House of Commons. Therefore, pursuant to Standing Order 52, I request leave
					 to make the motion for an emergency debate. Mr. Speaker, you have granted me
					 permission to speak requesting this debate for the purpose of discussing a
					 specific and important matter, which is the drought and the farm income crisis
					 facing grains and oilseed farmers as well as potato growers.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to point out that the drought is severe
					 and it is national in scope. It is not related to just one area. Environment
					 Canada's senior climatologist has stated that he cannot recall a year when we
					 have had such an extensive drought across the country.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last year was the eighth driest for southern Alberta
					 since weather records were started in 1886. Only 50 millimetres of rain fell
					 between April and August. The PFRA out of Medicine Hat, Alberta, has stated
					 that 95% of surface water is depleted. In Saskatchewan this was the fifth
					 driest year on record since the 1800s. Waterloo airport is another example.
					 July was its driest month since measurements were first taken at the Waterloo
					 airport over 30 years ago. Nova Scotia has gone through an extensive drought,
					 with vegetable crops being put under.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many farmers have continued to indicate that the
					 present safety net programs need a lot of revision. By having this debate
					 tonight we can emphasize the crisis we are talking about and provide solutions
					 that cabinet can take note of and which would help alleviate the
					 situation.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, I am indeed pleased to continue with
					 debate on Bill C-6 for 17 minutes.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would of course be tempted to provide a brief summary
					 of my first 23 minutes. I had thought of asking you to provide one, but the
					 person in the chair has changed, so I cannot do that.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What I said, in substance, as my introduction, was that
					 water, like air, is a vital and essential element that we should in no way
					 compromise.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Water is such an essential element that having too
					 little is as bad as having too much. When there is none, things dry up, and
					 when there is too much, things drown. A balance must therefore be maintained,
					 both in quantity and in quality. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I referred to several past experiences which related to
					 water or which had taught me more about it. I said that I was quite quickly
					 introduced to the concept of a water basin involving a good many
					 people.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I spoke of the rights and obligation, again in terms of
					 quantity and quality, each person has toward his neighbours, both upstream and
					 downstream. I also referred to the rights and obligations the municipalities
					 and regions have toward each other, not to mention countries, such as Quebec
					 and Canada. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also said that we tend to think that the water level
					 in lakes and rivers stays the same. This is, however, completely wrong.
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We need only consult my illustrious and eminent
					 colleague from Terrebonne--Blainville on this. A great fisherwoman, she has
					 told me of catching fish whose bellies showed the effects of having to swim on
					 the bottom to keep themselves submerged.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also touched briefly on the entire problem concerning
					 water and the International Boundary Waters Treaty Act.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On average, barely 1% of the waters of the Great Lakes
					 is renewed annually by precipitation, surface water runoff, and inflow from
					 groundwater sources. Under the circumstances, we must recognize that, while the
					 Great Lakes and St. Lawrence River system represents one fifth of the earth's
					 fresh water, this resource is not unlimited.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of climatic risks, increased desertification
					 worldwide, limited supplies of drinking water around the world and energy
					 development based on this resource, the idea of exporting large quantities of
					 water on tanker ships or of diverting rivers has emerged as a serious option in
					 the past ten years or so in Quebec and Canada.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the list of environmental threats to water supplies
					 is added the new and significant threat of bulk water exports and large scale
					 diversion of our lakes and rivers.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a quick overview of Bill C-6, I of course came to
					 the issues involved in this bill. I mentioned that, while most people agreed
					 that water resources need protection, it is far from clear that Bill C-6
					 ensures their increased protection.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is the Liberal government not using the current panic
					 over the issue of water protection to grab powers that are beyond its
					 jurisdiction? That is a legitimate question.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We identified three major problems that could be raised
					 in connection with the bill we are looking at today. The first relates to the
					 definition of a water basin. The second concerns the many powers given the
					 federal minister in connection with exceptions and with licensed activities.
					 The third relates to the usefulness of the bill we are looking at.</p>


	<A NAME="T1020"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1020"><!-- Hour: 10--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1025"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1015"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1020)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of these three elements, Bill C-6 goes beyond
					 federal jurisdictions and infringes on provincial ones.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fact that the notion of watershed is not defined in
					 the bill is of course a source of concern, but the fact that it is up to the
					 governor in council to define it by regulations, on the recommendation of the
					 Minister of Foreign Affairs, is hardly acceptable. This is undoubtedly very
					 dangerous from a jurisdictional point of view and regard to the ownership of
					 natural resources, which essentially belong to the provinces.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, in a document dated February 10, 1999, the
					 Department of Foreign Affairs and International Trade clearly indicated what a
					 watershed is, and I quote: </p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td><small>A land area draining into a common
						  watercourse. Often called a catchment area, drainage basin or river basin.
						  Examples of watersheds in Canada include Atlantic (including the Great Lakes
						  and St. Lawrence River), Hudson Bay, Pacific and Arctic. A single watershed can
						  cover a relatively large section of the Canadian landscape. For example, the
						  waters of the Great Lakes include not only the lakes themselves but also the
						  many rivers, and their tributaries, that ultimately flow into the lakes.
						  </small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why not make this clear in the act? Chances are the
					 definition that will be proposed through regulations will be the one found in
					 the February 1999 document and will therefore directly infringe, by law, on
					 relevant provincial jurisdictions.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point concerns the powers given to the
					 Minister of Foreign Affairs. These powers are considerable. From issuing
					 licences to selecting the types of projects that may be eligible, not to
					 mention the practices that may be exempted from the application of the act, the
					 minister's responsibilities under the constitution are being greatly expanded.
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is true that, under the 1909 treaty, projects
					 directly affecting boundary waters already require a review and the approval by
					 the parties concerned. In case of a dispute, it is up to the IJC to settle the
					 issue. Under the treaty, Canada cannot take any unilateral action that would
					 change the level and flow of waters on the American side of the
					 border.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In that sense, the bill only formalizes the already
					 common practice of requiring a licence to build a dam, for example, or to
					 install works that obstruct waters.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, article VIII of the 1909 treaty sets out the
					 three possible uses of water in order of precedence and, as long as there is no
					 conflict among these uses, the contracting parties have equal and similar
					 rights in the use of the waters. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The various uses of water provided for are as follows:
					 uses for domestic and sanitary purposes; uses for navigation; uses for power;
					 and for irrigation purposes.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Bill C-6, only the ordinary use of waters for
					 domestic purposes, the concept can be stretched, for uses are not necessarily
					 that clearly defined, and for sanitary purposes is expressly excluded. There is
					 no reference to the use of water by the provinces for power purposes.
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The provinces' energy choices could be ignored,
					 especially since, with a broad definition of water basin, the extent of
					 waterways affected by Bill C-6 could be greater.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendments to the International Boundary Waters Treaty
					 Act could allow the Minister of Foreign Affairs to interfere in the management
					 of Quebec's natural resources. Yet these provisions clearly violate established
					 law and the division of powers between the provinces and the federal
					 government.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 109 gives indisputable property rights to the
					 provinces. It is this section, taken together with sections 92.5, 92.13 and
					 92A, which prompted Senator Gérald Beaudoin to say, in his book on the
					 Constitution of Canada, that the provinces have:</p>


	<p>

</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What we have here therefore are flagrant, I would even
					 say reprehensible, encroachments on provincial jurisdictions.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, we must also question the relevance of the
					 bill.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To protect water resources from the perils of unlimited
					 trade, Canada, Mexico and the United States declared in 1993 that “NAFTA
					 creates no rights to the natural water resources of any Party to the
					 Agreement”. The federal government is thus saying that, given the existence of
					 this joint statement, as long as water is not considered a good or a product,
					 and is in its natural state, it does not come under the provisions of trade
					 agreements, including NAFTA and WTO. However nothing could be less certain.
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such a statement, common or not, would have no value
					 whatsoever before an arbitrator because, as the Vienna convention on the law of
					 treaties stipulates, the contexts, the elements external to a treaty or
					 international convention, cannot be taken into consideration in its
					 interpretation if the text itself remains obscure and if the parties agree on
					 the pertinence of these external elements.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the United States has clearly stated, the very
					 day of the joint statement, that nothing in it changes the NAFTA treaty in any
					 way, it is therefore legitimate to state that water is subject to consideration
					 as a good within the meaning of the various international trade
					 agreements.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, from the moment that Canada exports this
					 resource, it becomes a good under NAFTA and GATT. Even if not legally
					 considered a product, it could be the object of proceedings under NAFTA chapter
					 11 on investments and services, and under national treatment. In addition, it
					 is clear that, if the federal government issues export permits, water will
					 henceforth be considered a commercial good within the meaning of these trade
					 agreements.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, should a province decide to issue a licence,
					 this appears to be applicable only within its own jurisdiction, within one
					 territory, according to the department, and I quote: </p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td width="30" align="right">
</td>
<td><small>--the
						  fact that certain projects have been approved does not in any way indicate that
						  future bulk water removal projects must also be approved. Canada's federal and
						  provincial governments retain full sovereignty over Canada's water.</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Officials have indicated that:</p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td><small>Any precedent due to the approval of
						  a water export project would be limited to the province concerned and linked to
						  the legislation that allowed the water to be exported, not to trade agreements.
						  </small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Despite these statements by the government, a reading
					 of the trade agreements, NAFTA in particular, does not leave one convinced of
					 this. We cannot know what the outcome might be of court proceedings entered
					 into by private investors against Canada or a province if an export permit were
					 issued to a foreign company. In addition, the IJC states that certain observers
					 make reference to Canada's tariff listing to conclude that all waters must be
					 considered a good and that this stance is incorrect.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It goes on to say that this list “merely indicates
					 that, when water is classified as a good, it enters into a specific tariff
					 category”. According to a number of observers, we do not know with any
					 certainty whether water could be considered a good, and the BAPE itself could
					 not settle this.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It would be safer to be sure of the situation before
					 passing such a bill. For now, it appears completely inadequate and clearly
					 threatens the jurisdiction of the provinces over their natural resources, in
					 this case, water.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The federal government is clearly using opposition to
					 water exports to justify, in the eyes of the public, its interference in the
					 form of Bill C-6. However, this legislation appears inadequate, and the effect
					 it would have on international trade is uncertain. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, the important issue of groundwater,
					 despite the fact that it was clearly raised in the IJC's preliminary and final
					 reports, is not even mentioned. Yet this issue is directly linked to flow
					 maintenance and to both the level and quality of the Great Lakes waters. The
					 federal government is silent on this issue.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Speaker has indicated that my time is running out
					 as swiftly as the spring runoff. I will therefore wrap up quickly.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government, through Bill C-6, contrary to what it
					 says, is overstepping its constitutional jurisdiction with respect to boundary
					 waters, is interfering in Quebec's jurisdiction with regards to potable water,
					 and is, in reality, offering no satisfactory guarantees as to the impact of
					 this bill on international trade agreements.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a fairly quick solution to the problem, since
					 we know quite well that a sovereign country has complete control in negotiating
					 its own treaties. If procedure will allow me, I would like to make a proposal.
					 In order to sign its own treaties, Quebec must become sovereign if it wants to
					 continue to have water that is good in terms of both quality and
					 quantity.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, as I have made clear in the past, the bill
					 would not meet the commitment made by the government and the entire House in
					 February 1999 when it declared to Canadians that it would introduce legislation
					 to prohibit, and I emphasize prohibit, bulk freshwater exports and interbasin
					 transfers. Bill C-6 would not do that. It is a failure with regard to that
					 commitment. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time that commitment was made the NDP put
					 forth a motion in the House that was unanimously adopted and supported by all
					 parties. The motion stated that Canada: </p>


	<p>

<td><small>--should not be a party to any international agreement that

						  sovereign right to protect, preserve and conserve our freshwater resources for
						  future generations.</small></td>

</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill C-6, which is before the House today for debate,
					 fails to address the vital concern that we would be compelled by international
					 agreements to export our water.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is appropriate to set in context the pressure Canada
					 is under with regard to conserving and preserving its fresh water. I draw to
					 the attention of the House two issues that are very current. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, the whole issue of climate change and
					 specifically climate warming could have a potential impact on our fresh water
					 and our freshwater reserves and supplies. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, flowing in part from that and in part from a
					 number of droughts around the continent has been pressure to export water to
					 other parts of North America and the world to deal with drought conditions
					 elsewhere. Statistics show the pressure the international community is under
					 with regard to supplying fresh water to its citizens. We must play a leading
					 role in dealing with the problem. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However the export of bulk water from Canada is not the
					 answer. As I pointed out during second reading, I found it somewhat odd that
					 the Minister of Foreign Affairs and the Minister of the Environment led the
					 debate on the bill instead of the Minister for International Trade. I was
					 surprised because the bill is to a great extent about trade and, more specific,
					 the failure of the government to protect our fresh water from trade
					 challenges.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I noted previously in debate, the bill is about
					 trade. The Minister of Foreign Affairs said Bill C-6 is “consistent with
					 Canada's international trade obligations”. That is the problem. Bill C-6
					 represents the government's continued failure to keep our freshwater resources
					 off the international bargaining table and safe from the unfair trade deals it
					 has negotiated. During debate on Bill C-6 earlier this week the hon. member for
					 Vancouver Quadra stated in the House:</p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td><small>Canadian governments have full
						  sovereignty over the management of water in its natural state, and in
						  exercising this sovereignty are not constrained by trade agreements, including
						  the NAFTA.</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reality, contrary to what the member and those in
					 his government claim, is that the strategy of the Liberal government is not
					 necessarily NAFTA proof. Bill C-6 is part of a water strategy designed more to
					 protect NAFTA than to protect Canada's water.</p>


	<A NAME="T1035"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1035"><!-- Hour: 10--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1040"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1030"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1035)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 1993 joint statement on which the government's
					 argument is primarily based is not legally binding. That statement was made by
					 the three NAFTA partners and their governments, namely Canada, the United
					 States and Mexico. However, the way NAFTA works, under the investor state
					 procedure investors have the power to challenge Canadian water protection laws.
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact we have seen that. We have the outstanding
					 challenge by Sun Belt Water Inc. against the province of British Columbia that
					 is still pending. We have seen the ability of a private company to come forward
					 and make that challenge, specifically on fresh water.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That joint statement was not agreed to by the investor
					 sectors. There would be no way of doing that. Therefore it offers no protection
					 whatsoever against claims made directly by investors.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We could say to the governments of the United States
					 and Mexico that they agreed to this, but we cannot say it to Sun Belt Water
					 Inc. because it was not at the table and is not bound by the letter exchanged
					 among those three levels of government.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is important to look at the history under NAFTA
					 because international trade tribunals, and I should not just say under NAFTA
					 but under a number of other international agreements that we have entered into,
					 have been very willing to strike down environmental protection laws if they are
					 simply disguised as trade barriers. That is open to very wide interpretation,
					 as we have seen.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, a GATT tribunal rejected Canada's ban on
					 the export of unprocessed fish even after it was redrafted. We went through it
					 and we lost. We redrafted it and focused it exclusively on environmental
					 conservation, and we still lost.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Simply stating that a bill is motivated by
					 environmental rather than trade concerns will not likely be enough to withstand
					 a trade challenge. The fish case is a clear precedent in that
					 regard.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bill is fairly limited in the geographical area
					 that it covers. The strategy of the government has been to say this is what it
					 would do and this is how it would do it. As I have indicated, that is nowhere
					 near sufficient. It does not do anything to prohibit a province from exporting
					 bulk fresh water. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would assume any province that wishes to seek a
					 financial opportunity in that regard is in no way prevented from doing
					 so.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bill, if it becomes law, would not be binding on
					 the provinces. We could change that. Enough jurisdiction has been recognized by
					 the Supreme Court of Canada in this area indicating that we could do that as a
					 legislature at the national level. That is what we need to do. We need to
					 provide a legislated ban that would be binding on all provinces that would
					 prohibit the export of bulk water. This is not a fancy. It is not something out
					 there in the ozone. Newfoundland is currently looking at the export of bulk
					 water.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My next point concerns NAFTA. It was raised when the
					 bill was before the foreign affairs committee. One of the witnesses suggested
					 much more forcefully than I did how questionable the interpretation was and how
					 out of touch the government was with the reality of how we saw NAFTA
					 functioning.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are very strong legal opinions that the bill
					 would not protect us from a NAFTA challenge. The government, therefore, should
					 not be so confident that its approach would withstand those challenges. What it
					 should be doing is looking at how to fix NAFTA, how to incorporate into NAFTA
					 the real protections we need, because that is where we need them and not in
					 this type of legislation.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have heard explanations from the government on how
					 the bill would work if it became law. The government is saying that the bill
					 contains a ban, but there is also a licensing provision to allow for the
					 diversion and export of water. We are hearing that there are regulations, which
					 we have not seen, that would define more extensively when that licensing would
					 be allowed.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I say to the government and to the House that we should
					 take the government and the minister at face value in that they would not allow
					 for this type of licensing for the diversion or export of water. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What about the next minister? What about the next
					 government, whether it be this party or some other? Rather than putting into
					 place an absolute ban, what it has done is left the door open to what could
					 very easily be major diversions of our water and abuse of our environment in
					 that regard.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will make one point with regard to the amendment, and
					 I want to give the foreign affairs committee an acknowledgement in this regard.
					 As originally drafted, the bill did not contain a provision that recognized
					 there would be no derogation to treaty rights of the first nations. As a result
					 of a motion made on behalf of my party at committee stage the committee
					 recognized the necessity of including that, and it has been incorporated into
					 the bill. I acknowledge the work done by the committee and its willingness to
					 respond to that type of amendment.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The NDP is not willing to support Bill C-6. We would
					 not be protected from the NAFTA provisions with this bill. It would not apply
					 to the whole of the country and would not be an absolute bill. For those
					 reasons we will be voting against the bill.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, I compliment the NDP critic for the
					 environment on the sentiment he expressed and on his willingness to ensure that
					 we do not have exports of bulk water, whether they be in bulk form or
					 interbasin transfers. That is the intent of the particular piece of
					 legislation. I state publicly that the Progressive Conservative Party clearly
					 supports the position that our natural heritage water is not for
					 sale.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However I want to correct a particular point with
					 respect to the Sun Belt application that was made under chapter 11 of NAFTA. It
					 had nothing to do with the capacity of actually selling bulk water. The lawsuit
					 was initiated because the province of British Columbia had granted permission
					 for bulk water to be considered to be sold. It then got its head on straight
					 and said it was not something it was interested in doing and chose to
					 compensate the British Columbia company.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once that was done, under NAFTA companies need to be
					 treated equally on both sides of the border. The provincial government in B.C.
					 compensated the B.C. company but did not want to compensate the American
					 company. It made sense from the perspective of the approach and that is why the
					 company was able to launch the challenge. It is not a bulk water perspective.
					 It is a matter of treating companies on both sides of the border
					 properly.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We suspect that the absurd amount the company is asking
					 for will not be awarded in any way, shape or form. The most it should ever
					 expect to get is what the province of British Columbia had initiated in the
					 first place, and that actually protects investors.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is quite clear that we could not stop the
					 application in the Sun Belt case. We cannot say that there is a ban, even
					 though that is what the province British Columbia did. It did not protect the

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am also struggling with another case that I remember
					 where a Mexican community was challenged on having to accept a toxic dump by a

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a provision for licensing the export of water.
					 In effect we have set up a framework, which I realize has been an historical
					 past practice. We have now incorporated that into the legislation. The
					 framework was there for Sun Belt to bring forth the application.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I said earlier in my address to the House, most of
					 the trade experts to whom I have spoken are very uncomfortable about the
					 outcome of this case. They are very concerned that Sun Belt is likely to

	Mr. Speaker, I was interested in my colleague's speech

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As critic for culture and heritage for the New
					 Democratic Party I constantly hear parallel assurances that culture, which is

					 However, when the rubber hits the road, I do not see that language in NAFTA or
					 in GATS. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore we have to be very vigilant about language
					 and about what is to take place at the table when some kind of claim is made
					 against our valuable commodities. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I guess we have to talk about water as a commodity, but

	In that case it was very vocal. The Liberals were
					 adamant that we must ban all bulk water exports from Canada. They were
					 adamantly against us and raised a huge furor in the House about it during the
					 free trade debate in 1988-89. Now all of a sudden they have come in with this
					 half-baked half measure of a bill to protect some of our water, the water
					 closest to the United States border but not the water in the inland provinces,
					 such as Nova Scotia and Newfoundland, only those waters that straddle the
					 borders.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a complete reversal of their position in
					 1988-89 when they were most eloquent and forceful in their arguments about
					 banning all bulk water transports. They were fearmongering about all the things
					 that were going to happen, that all the bulkwater was going to be transferred
					 and sold. Now what do they do? They come up with a half-baked, half measure
					 program to ban some waters, put in some rules and put on some restrictions but
					 it in no way addresses the needs and feelings of Canadians and the actual issue
					 at hand.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is absolutely amazing to hear the Liberals now stand
					 and defend their position when just a few years ago they were on this side
					 demanding far more measures. In fact, we have had events in Canada that
					 increase, not decrease, the sensitivity and the demands for protection. The
					 Liberals are slipping and going the other way instead.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some of the things we have talked about in the House
					 recently really focus on the need for the protection of our water. One
					 obviously was the Walkerton issue involving safety. The other more recent one
					 was the terrorist acts in the United States which involves security. However,
					 both involve potential demands and potential threats to our water.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the Walkerton case, there have been many more
					 examples of contaminated water as we become more sensitive to the issue, which
					 means our water is even more important than ever. The future and safety of our
					 water is far more important than it was even 10 years ago. We have had changes
					 in reporting and in identifying the contamination and the sources of
					 contamination of water. We have had complete changes in the responsibility and
					 accountability for the safety of water right across the country. Probably every
					 single member of parliament in the House has had reports of contaminated water
					 since Walkerton because the standards are so much higher and our sensitivities
					 are so much more focused on our water.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The recent terrorist acts in the United States present
					 tremendous security issues for huge amounts of water. There is now speculation
					 that some terrorists have planned to contaminate water using spray planes. Some
					 of these discussions and plans appear to have occurred in Canada and could
					 involve Canadian waters. However, whether it is in the United States or in
					 Canada, if any water is contaminated through natural sources or through
					 man-made initiatives, it would mean an increased demand for water in North
					 America, which would also mean an increased demand for our water and increased
					 pressure on us. If we do not have the legislation to prevent bulk water
					 transfers we will be under a lot of pressure. As the last speaker said, the
					 effects of global warming and droughts will put increased pressure on our water
					 supplies.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not a time for half measures and half-baked
					 actions like Bill C-6. Any of the three issues I have talked about could create
					 a large shortfall in the water supply in Canada and in the United States, which
					 will put increased demands on our Canadian water and demands for access to
					 Canadian water.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those of us involved in foreign trade recently have had
					 just a sample of the strength and the power of the Americans and the tools they
					 use to access our resources. In the case of softwood lumber, they have used
					 laws, legislation, political influence, the administration, the media and every
					 possible angle to prevent access to our softwood lumber by the U.S. and to gain
					 access to our raw materials in the softwood lumber industry. They leave no
					 stone unturned. They apply extreme pressure. If there is a shortage of water in
					 the U.S., their efforts to access our water will be even more focused and more
					 intense. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We require legislation to ban all exports, not just
					 some exports, not just the export of water in the 300 lakes and rivers that
					 straddle the border between the United States and Canada.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have thousands of lakes and natural reservoirs. They
					 must all be protected from bulk exports, not just those that straddle the
					 border. Now is the time for strong legislation on this, not after the horse is
					 out of the gate, not after the fact.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many people predicted that it was just a matter of time
					 before terrorist acts took place in the United States but no one reacted or
					 prepared for it. I predict that it is just a matter of time before North
					 America has a strong demand on our water. I do not know where it will come from
					 or what the reason will be, but I predict that we will have increased demands
					 on our water, even above the projected increased demands by demographics, which
					 predicts a 40% increase in demand on water in Canada and a large explosion of
					 growth in the world's human population. Many millions of people already have no
					 access to water. As the population grows the demands will be more and
					 more.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill C-6 does not meet current realities. It does not
					 meet potential threats. It does not impose conditions on provinces. Even if
					 Bill C-6 passes, bulk sales of water are still possible. If the bill is not
					 amended we will be subject to demands on our water, and when the pressure does
					 come, it will be enormous. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope that somewhere in the bowels of government there
					 is a group of people drafting further legislation or amendments to the bill
					 that would ban all water exports. As I have said, it is just a matter of time
					 before the demand for our water will be unbearable. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So often a government tries to react on issues but this
					 government, in particular, reacts after events have happened even though they
					 were clearly predicted in advance. One that comes to mind is the one in my area
					 close to Burnt Church where everybody predicted there would be a problem with
					 the fishery when the judgment came down. The government was not prepared for it
					 and is having a huge problem now trying to react to it. It is trying to
					 manipulate the rules. It is trying to work with the natives and the non-natives
					 and the lobster fishery. It has been a disaster and is continuing to be a
					 disaster.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government had lots of warning but it did not act.
					 It has lots of warning now on the water issue and it is not acting. It has
					 brought in this half-baked bill to protect some of the water but none of the
					 water on Prince Edward Island especially. It is imperative that the government
					 move quickly to bring in a full ban on all bulk water exports.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will reluctantly support the bill even though it is
					 a half-baked measure. However, we will continue to press the government for the
					 proper legislation that bans all exports of bulk freshwater from
					 Canada.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, I would like to inform my hon. friend that

					 Canada that does so. Therefore, according to that treaty, where I live would be
					 part of the U.S.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two places in Canada, and I refer to Newfoundland and
					 British Columbia, have large tarns. These are lakes way up on the mountains.
					 The only drainage is right into the ocean. One inch is billions of gallons of
					 water. There is lots of rain and they could very easily use that as an income
					 to fill a bulk boat below and ship the water. It would not interfere with
					 anyone, which is the argument B.C. and Newfoundland would put
					 forward.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What would the hon. member have to say about the
					 argument that it is provincial jurisdiction, that it is income for the people

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In answer to the member's question, the Liberal
					 government in Newfoundland proposed the bulk sale of water but it has since

					 to continue that export. If we do not export there is no obligation to export
					 it. Once we start there is an interpretation under our trade agreements that
					 would convert water to a commodity, which means we cannot stop.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If sometime in the future British Columbia or

					 Lib.): </b>

	Mr. Speaker, let me congratulate the federal
					 environment minister for taking a watershed approach with the bill. Such an
					 approach would ban the removal of water from its natural basin. Hopefully, this
					 will be a more comprehensive approach than a simple export ban, and we will
					 agree that it makes good ecological sense to stop the bulk water removal at the
					 source, not only at the border. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the Minister of the Environment relies on a
					 federal-provincial voluntary agreement to ban water removal from major drainage
					 basins. This approach, I suggest, ought to be broadened and expanded to include
					 all Canadian water bodies and not limited only to boundary waters.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I say this for three reasons. First, the proposed
					 voluntary accord would be just that; it would be voluntary. It would not
					 legally bind any province to protect our water resources. We recently had some
					 ideas ventilated in Newfoundland, which have to be taken very seriously.
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, the proposed accord would not prohibit export
					 initiatives undertaken by municipalities, crown agencies, corporations or even
					 private parties. Even if the provinces wanted to ban water removals and
					 exports, the federal government has the constitutional authority to regulate
					 trade. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Understandably, the federal government hopes that a
					 province by province voluntary ban would keep water protection strictly as an
					 environment issue and that trade lawyers perhaps would not notice this
					 disguise. However, water removals and exports seem already to be a trade issue
					 since there is a challenge under NAFTA brought by a water export company
					 against the Government of Canada for compensation because of British Columbia's
					 decision to ban water exports.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through the proposed accord, the federal government is
					 thus asking the provinces to take their own action on banning water exports,
					 and we may hear more from that.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before I go into the third reason, Mr. Speaker, I will
					 be sharing my time with my esteemed and distinguished colleague, the member for
					 Toronto--Danforth.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, the current proposal would only prohibit
					 removals of water from major basins but would allow the export of water as long
					 as it stayed in the same basin. The government's definition of basins as
					 Canadian leaves a lot to be desired because basin describes a geographical
					 feature without regard to political boundaries. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The concept of basin is problematic and we understand
					 it. However, for an accord or legislation intended to secure resources
					 management for political institutions, it is a very key central issue. It is
					 also an essential concept for any legislation that intends to withstand trade
					 challenges that are exactly intended to transcend political
					 boundaries.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The proposed accord will lead to some kind of a
					 patchwork of provincial initiatives, thus possibly making Canada more
					 vulnerable to trade challenges. I regretfully conclude that the legislation
					 tabled today is too limited in scope to provide protection to most of our water
					 bodies.</p>


	<A NAME="T1110"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1110"><!-- Hour: 11--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1115"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1105"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1110)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems quite clear that any meaningful protection of
					 our water resources requires the federal government to face the reality of
					 international trade agreements. This is the point that I would like to make as
					 clearly as I can.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In search of the most effective strategy to protect our
					 water resources from exports, I would recommend first, that we enact federal
					 legislation designed specifically for the purpose of banning bulk transboundary
					 water removals from Canada.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, I would recommend that we renegotiate
					 international trade agreements to seek an exclusion or waiver of water from
					 such agreements, which would perhaps be the easier route at the present
					 time.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This debate is an extremely important one and has long
					 term significance. The Great Lakes are a tremendously important water body as
					 we all know. We are passing this legislation hoping that it will work, but we
					 have no assurances at the present time that a mirror legislative initiative is
					 not being launched and completed by our neighbours to the south. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, I will conclude by urging the government to
					 see to it that in Washington an initiative that would mirror the Canadian
					 initiative, as contained in the bill as a minimum, would be launched so that we
					 would have reciprocity in this very delicate field, which is of great
					 significance for many generations to come.</p>

					 However, we would be remiss in this debate if we did not refer to and mention
					 those rivers which have their origin in Canada and flow into the U.S. Through
					 real co-operation, the damming of those rivers or streams in Canada has helped

					 the benefit of both nations. We have to say this because we have so many
					 wonderful examples.</p>

					 the help and approval of North Dakota. It controls the flooding down there.
					 That river then flows back into Canada, which is rare, and comes out in Souris,
					 Manitoba.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I understand it from having read the sections in the
					 NAFTA agreement dealing with water, the agreement only contemplates the trade
					 of water in bottled form. Therefore, my interpretation would be that water is
					 not in the agreement.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are people, however, who like to raise this issue
					 and interpret it in a different way, but I would like to think that we would
					 stick to the written agreement and make sure that water never becomes a traded
					 commodity.</p>

					 Lib.): </b>

	Mr. Speaker, I am happy to have the opportunity to
					 follow my colleague from Davenport. He has been a constant source of
					 inspiration and guidance for all of us who have been working on the issue for
					 the last number of years.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bill is a good first step. It is not complete but
					 it is a start. The challenge we will have in dealing with the whole issue of
					 water security over the next 10 to 15 years is inextricably intertwined with
					 the same challenges our neighbours to the south will face.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the member for Davenport said near the end of his
					 speech, if Bill C-6 is to be effective there must be a mirror of the bill in
					 Washington. As legislators that is where our biggest challenge will
					 be.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My riding is on Lake Ontario. I have a Great Lakes
					 riding. It is no secret to everyone in the House that the Great Lakes governors
					 of the United States signed a deal this summer with the Great Lakes premiers.
					 If 10 years from now the midwest governors or legislators found themselves in
					 desperate shape in terms of water, the geopolitical reality is that those
					 legislators would outnumber our Great Lakes legislators and we would have a
					 challenge. The leaders to the south would not sit there unable to function in
					 terms of water requirements while we sat here pretending we were an independent
					 operation. It would not work.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The words of my colleague from Davenport, who has been
					 my environmental mentor for the 14 years I have been here, are important. He
					 said we must have a mirror of the legislation in Washington.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is another problem. At the foreign affairs
					 committee in May we heard from witnesses who talked about the Great Lakes. Some
					 of them said we must preserve the ecological integrity of the Great Lakes.
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who would argue with that? We all know that levels are
					 down and that with climate change the ecological integrity of the Great Lakes
					 is at risk. We share them with the United States, so what will we do? Will we
					 look the other way? In my humble opinion we must examine every option within
					 our water inventory to preserve the ecological integrity of the Great
					 Lakes.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As much as I respect the bill and say it is a good
					 first step, it is only the tip of the iceberg. It is for this reason that I
					 have been trying for a long time to interest leaders of all parties in a
					 committee that would look into the comprehensive nature of dealing with water
					 security.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My first speech to the House of Commons in 1988 was
					 about water and the free trade agreement. I gave the speech because I went to
					 school in Houston, Texas, at the University of St. Thomas. Houston is the home
					 of Clayton Yeutter, chief negotiator for the United States during the free
					 trade agreement talks. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clayton Yeutter did a doctoral thesis on North American
					 water management at the University of Nebraska. His entire life has been
					 devoted to water. He worked for Congressman Jim Wright as a young assistant.
					 Congressman Wright, as we all know, wrote the book <i>The Coming Water
					 Famine</i>. When a man who has spent his entire life dealing with water becomes
					 the chief free trade negotiator I cannot believe his interest in water and the
					 free trade agreement are separate. I have always held that view. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I appealed to then Prime Minister Brian Mulroney to
					 attach a one page protocol letter to the free trade agreement saying that water
					 would be excluded. I never got the letter but <i>Hansard</i> will show that I
					 asked for it.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think most people would agree that I am not a person
					 who scares easily. However I am deeply concerned because the issue of water
					 security is complex and involves economic realities with our neighbours. The
					 U.S. has incredible leverage over us in terms of our economy. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bill before the House today should be used as a
					 first step to lever our complex discussions, hearings, investigations and
					 relationships with legislators in the United States in such a way that North
					 American water policy will ensure sound water management and the ecological
					 integrity of the Great Lakes. These issues will affect not only our citizens
					 but ultimately all citizens of the United States.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Could the hon. member comment on those two issues? What

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the hon. member's second question, I
					 stood in the House as a government member and supported Nelson Riis, the NDP
					 environment critic, who had a private member's bill on banning bulk water
					 exports. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have sent flyers in my riding regarding bulk water
					 exports and the Grand Canal. I have had townhall meetings. I have found that
					 one of the most difficult challenges of being a member of the House of Commons
					 is trying to get not only my own government but all MPs to grab the issue and
					 deal with it in a comprehensive way.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is why the issue should not be looked at by a
					 subcommittee. That is why I have appealed to my House leader and other leaders
					 that it be a special committee of the House, the same status as the committee
					 that looked into the Meech Lake accord. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is that serious. Anything less would not give the
					 issue its proper due. I would apply the same pressure here. I am saying in the
					 House what I have said privately and publicly, that we as a government must
					 deal with the issue. </p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government of Canada has constitutional

	Mr. Speaker, it is good rise to add some comments to
					 the debate because water is and will be a topic of serious discussion for a
					 long time. I will be sharing my time with the hon. member for Esquimalt--Juan
					 de Fuca.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I spoke to the bill at second reading and I would like
					 to add some comments to that, particularly with respect to the comments of the
					 member on the government side who wanted a special committee with full
					 committee status to look at this issue because it is so important. That is a
					 good idea and certainly I would like to participate in such a
					 committee.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As some other members have alluded to, the bill does
					 not really address the entire issue of bulk water exports. All it does is deal
					 with the International Boundary Waters Treaty Act, and that is between
					 ourselves and the U.S.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My riding is unique in that the Oldman River, which
					 flows through my riding, ends up in Hudson Bay and the Milk River ends up in
					 the Gulf of Mexico. Talking about interbasin transfer and water that leaves our
					 country and goes to another is pretty important to the area I live in, and has
					 been even more so in the last couple of years because we are in a drought. We
					 have seen very little precipitation during the spring and summer. The winter
					 runoff coming out of the mountains is almost non-existent. If it does not snow
					 this winter we are going to be faced with some very serious problems. Whether
					 it is for agriculture or civic use in our communities the safety of water is of
					 concern to Canadians. Canadians have become very concerned with what has
					 happened in the last two years with the quality of water. This emphasizes the
					 need to focus a discussion on water. The government should look at all aspects
					 of it.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The act was created in 1909 so I guess it is about time
					 it was dusted off and tuned up a little bit. It prohibits the removal of waters
					 out of the water basin in which they are located. That stops interbasin
					 transfer. It requires a licence from the Minister of Foreign Affairs for any
					 activity in boundary or transboundary waters. If Canada were to do something on
					 a river that flowed into the United States and back, it would need the blessing
					 of the Minister of Foreign Affairs. It gives sanctions for
					 penalties.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Addressing bulk water exports in the way the government
					 has clearly lacks in scope. The government has used a three-pronged approach,
					 one of which is the amendment of the International Boundary Waters Treaty Act.
					 The second is a proposal to develop, in co-operation with the provinces, and
					 the hon. member for Davenport alluded to this as voluntary, a Canada-wide
					 accord to prohibit bulk water removal. The third aspect is that Canada and U.S.
					 agree to a joint reference, the international joint commission, that would deal
					 with the Great Lakes. That is a problem because the water in the Great Lakes is
					 at an all-time low. It is a precious commodity to so many people in that area
					 of Canada and the United States and it has to be handled properly.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those are the three areas that have been put forward to
					 address the issue of bulk water, and to me they do not. It gets back to NAFTA.
					 The only thing that was put into NAFTA to deal with water was in 1993. Actually
					 raw logs and unprocessed fish were exempted but water was not. All it says is
					 that NAFTA creates no rights to the natural water resource of any party to the
					 agreement. There has been a debate since that was created whether or not that
					 protects our water. I have a tendency to say that it does not. If we sell bulk
					 water to each other, i.e., B.C. could sell water to Alberta or vice versa, that
					 makes bulk water a commodity and it allows the other signatories to the free
					 trade agreement to have access to it and we would not be able to stop
					 that.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The whole idea of the provinces being involved is that
					 it is a natural resource and the provinces have control over natural resources.
					 Thus, the provincial issue has been brought into it. We feel as a party that
					 this resource falls under provincial rights and that it is shared, but the
					 provinces have ultimate control. It is important that this aspect was brought
					 forward.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canadians have brought to our attention some of the
					 issues they are concerned with. Canada has 9% of the world's renewable water,
					 which is a huge amount. Protecting that and keeping sovereignty over it is
					 paramount to Canadians. We have to have absolute control over our water. We
					 cannot even consider any marketing or selling of it until we have that
					 control.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Challenges have already been put forward by our
					 neighbours to the south and deals have been made with some companies. There are
					 Internet sites advertising Canadian water for sale. This cannot be allowed to
					 proceed until we have clarified that as a country we can control the use of
					 water because NAFTA does not put a complete and outright ban on bulk water
					 exports.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What brings this to a head I suppose is the fact that
					 we need stronger legislation. We need to reaffirm the power that the provinces
					 have over this resource. We cannot use the three-pronged approach which the
					 federal government has put forward as the means to put the minds of Canadians
					 at ease. This is the means to keep our bulk water exports completely under the
					 control of Canada. It does not do that. In order for this to be done we have to
					 study the issue. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Water safety has been a topic of debate in Canada since
					 the Walkerton and North Battleford incidents and there have been a few others.
					 Every community is concerned. It has to be addressed along with the issue of
					 exports.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Right now the lack of water in many parts of Canada has
					 had a devastating effect on our agricultural community. Thanks to the member
					 for Selkirk--Interlake we will have an opportunity this evening to debate the
					 effects that the drought has had on the agricultural community and the income
					 crisis it has created.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We see what is happening in the United States right
					 now, the predicament that it is in and the support we are offering. If this
					 were to happen in a different way and some major water supply were to be
					 affected, what would we be able to do?</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have to be very careful because when our neighbours
					 run out of water, and they will, how are we as a nation going to deal with that
					 issue? There are places in the world right now where fresh water could be
					 shipped by tanker. Here in North America it could be shipped by pipeline. It
					 could be done in many ways. Until we have the absolute power to control that
					 resource, we have to proceed with utmost caution, and rightfully so. Whether we
					 sell it or not will be the ultimate debate, but we have to get the control
					 first. When we do that, then we can proceed with the next step.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This bill is a small step. It is not the right thing to
					 do at the moment. It needs to be broadly expanded, but because it is a small
					 step in the right direction we will be supporting the bill.</p>

					 the north shore of Lake Huron and the eastern shore of Lake
					 Superior.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Great Lakes issues are very important to my

					 if he really made it clear enough what he would do if the government was not
					 doing enough. I appreciate that he and his party will support the bill. If I
					 heard him correctly he mentioned that the provinces should have ultimate
					 jurisdiction. If that is the case, where does the federal government fit
					 in?</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think the federal government, in co-operation with
					 provincial and local governments, should have ultimate authority over
					 international boundary waters. We should not necessarily leave it to the
					 provinces to decide among themselves the resolution of international issues
					 when it comes to such things. </p>

				  </b>

	Mr. Speaker, the federal government must be involved in
					 any issue regarding a natural resource or whatever that deals with
					 international law or commitments. Whether it be natural resources such as oil,
					 gas, coal or forestry, the provinces presently have control over how those
					 resources are managed and produced. In my mind, water has to be treated the
					 same way. The provinces have to be full partners in this issue and will have
					 the ultimate say on their internal water resources. We have water that flows
					 into the ocean, into Hudson Bay and into the United States. They are all
					 different and must be treated differently. The International Boundary Waters
					 Treaty which this bill deals with is just part of that solution.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the issue of the Great Lakes and the joint
					 commission, one of the people who appeared before the foreign affairs committee
					 said that states one or two tiers south of the Great Lakes are eyeing that
					 water with much interest. The states and provinces in that area are very keen
					 on keeping that water under control so that it is not completely drained off.
					 Those lakes are not replenished at the same rate that the water is being
					 extracted, especially in the dry times we have seen over the last number of
					 years.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the whole issue of bulk water, we can ship water and
					 sell water in bottles and other containers, but even on the Great Lakes, things
					 such as ballast water ships are looked at and considered. It has to be
					 broadened. I am not saying that the provinces in the international boundary
					 waters should have control because the federal government needs to be there.
					 However, because water is a natural resource they have to be full partners in
					 any discussion on the waters within their boundaries.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not know if that completely answers the member's
					 question, but we do need co-operation with the provinces. We need to look at
					 all environmental issues and accords. We have to bring everybody into this
					 thing together because if we do not, just as we have seen in Newfoundland and
					 B.C., there will be bulk water exports. We have to make sure that the provinces
					 buy into whatever agreement the federal government comes up with, particularly
					 having to do with international waters.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague from Lethbridge for
					 kindly allowing me to share his time.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill C-6 is extraordinary in that it deals with a
					 substance that we cannot live without. Millions of people live without love. We
					 can live without food for a month, but we will die within a week if we do not
					 have water. As an ancient poet said: “Water, water, everywhere, nor any drop to
					 drink”. It is not quite that bad but we have some significant
					 problems.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As my colleague and others have mentioned, the bill is
					 very important in terms of securing our water resources. Canada has 9% of the
					 world's freshwater. This is a significant issue from an international
					 perspective and is one which I will address later in my speech.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bill does a good job of guarding our water but much
					 more needs to be done. Ninety-seven per cent of the water in the world is salt
					 water, which is made up of 3% solids and 97% freshwater. Therefore, only 3% of
					 all the water in the world right now, if we exclude salt water, is freshwater
					 in various pockets and pools. Extraordinarily enough, the amount of water we
					 have today is the same as we had at the beginning of time. It just changes and
					 flows through the hydrological cycle throughout the world, which is quite
					 fascinating. However, we are abusing it. With our burgeoning population,
					 increasing demands and urbanization, we are putting extraordinary stresses on
					 the world's water systems.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My colleagues mentioned the stresses on the Great Lakes
					 system, such as acid rain, acidification of waters, the damming of waters, the
					 changing of the hydrological cycle, the modifying of it, pollution, mercury and
					 cadmium, the latter of which has caused significant health problems in a number
					 of populations around the world, including Canada. In the St. Lawrence system,
					 the content of carcinogenic and teratogenic substances in the meat of beluga
					 whales is so high that a dead beluga whale would be considered toxic waste.
					 That is the result of the elements and pollutants in the water.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Internationally, more than one billion people do not
					 have access to safe drinking water. In North America we are prolific users of
					 water. We use a lot of it, waste a lot of it and pollute a lot of it.
					 Internationally the impact upon water has been significant. In the Dead Sea the
					 water level has dropped by about 10 metres. In China more than 80% of the
					 rivers do not support fish anymore. That is extraordinary and is a growing
					 problem all over the world.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pollution, desertification, the damming and wasting of
					 our waters is having a significant effect. I had hoped that the bill would have
					 had something to say about these important issues.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I mentioned before, we are prolific users because we
					 do not value water. The cost of water in North America is far less than its
					 value. Some places in the United States have about $500 worth of subsidies per
					 acre on some lands, which greatly exceeds the value of those lands. Some
					 farmers pay about 3% of the value of the water they receive. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What can we do to preserve it? Domestically, we have to
					 ensure that the cost reflects the value. Australia has done some very exciting
					 work in terms of having a market oriented approach to water. This has greatly
					 improved its ability to conserve water, reducing consumption by about 40% with
					 no effect on the GDP. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We also have to conserve more. In Asia they are using
					 pour toilets instead of flush toilets, saving between six and sixteen litres of
					 water per flush. Australia and the Middle East specialize in new and better
					 irrigation systems where they can use salt water for certain crops or use
					 desalinization processes which are becoming more efficient.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Internationally, more than 300 river systems are
					 transboundary. They will have a massive effect on the future as our population
					 grows. We fear that countries will fight that over water. None of us can
					 survive without water. Thomas Homer-Dixon, Robert Kaplan and many other authors
					 have repeatedly and quite eloquently warned that in the future, water is what
					 we will fight over.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When one looks at the Middle East as an example, people
					 are fighting over land, land which is by and large desert. It is land where the
					 aquifers are so low that in the future there will not be any water there at
					 all. The wars which are taking place right now will wars over pieces of land
					 which will be largely uninhabitable in the future, yet nobody really talks
					 about that.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Internationally, we have to look at other countries
					 such as India, Bangladesh, Sudan and Egypt and many other areas where water
					 will be a potential area of conflict. Part of Canada's role in the future will
					 be looking at ways to conserve and improve water not only at home, but also
					 internationally by researching and developing new methods of water
					 conservation, finding new ways to use salt water, such as desalinization
					 procedures which would be more efficient, and finding ways to stop polluting
					 our waters.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This has been a significant problem. We saw the tragedy
					 in Walkerton. We have seen the effect of acid rain. We know that many of our
					 lakes and rivers have been completely destroyed. The fish are toxic. As a
					 country it behooves us to take responsibility for our water systems. What we do
					 to our water systems not only affects us but affects people in other countries
					 too. The House of Commons and the government has a responsibility to all
					 Canadians to ensure that the very essence of life, which is water, will be
					 preserved in some way.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ways of doing that would be by decreasing demand,
					 looking at new conservation tools and spreading them widely across the country,
					 having new pricing mechanisms so that the value of water is truly reflected in
					 its cost and making sure that existing conservation mechanisms are more
					 efficient.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A lot of exciting work is being done all over the world
					 demonstrating the ways we can preserve and conserve water. I hope the
					 government works with its provincial counterparts to do that.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking now on the international scene, there are a
					 lot of water borne diseases. Malaria can be considered a water borne disease.
					 Bilharzia, which is spread by snails and affects almost 200 million people, is
					 expanding dramatically and is having a profound impact on people. This disease
					 can kill. I remember treating a 20 year old woman in Africa who bled to death
					 as a direct result of being infected by this parasite. Her veins in her
					 esophagus burst and we could not stop the bleeding. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not an academic exercise at all. This issue
					 affects people all over the world. In Canada we have seen the effect of the
					 Walkerton tragedy and our inability to secure our water system. Canadians have
					 a deep seated concern. There are boiled water warnings. I do not have the exact
					 figures but they are quite significant. From Newfoundland to British Columbia,
					 boiled water advisories are out because we have been unable to secure our water
					 resources and ensure that safe, potable water is the right of all
					 Canadians.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the present time none of us see adequate leadership
					 on this level. I hope the federal government will work with its provincial
					 counterparts to develop a national strategy to secure our water resources. The
					 bill is good in terms of ensuring that we will not damage our water resources
					 or impede or damage the water resources that go to other countries. It is very
					 important that we ensure that the water within our borders is secure. It is
					 important that we ensure that Canadians have access to potable water so we do
					 not have further tragedies such as Walkerton. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are two basic elements in what we should do
					 beyond this. There are domestic issues in terms of conservation, dealing with
					 the pollution of our water systems and new irrigation methodologies which can
					 be very efficient. Internationally, it is important that our Minster of Foreign
					 Affairs work with other countries and point out that water is a potential flash
					 point for conflicts in the future and things have to be done to ensure that
					 this is dealt with.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, I enjoyed the member's comments because I
					 have a very deep interest in the issue of water. I recognize that he has a
					 great deal of knowledge and his background as a medical doctor would give him

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would ask the member about the connection in his view

					 water tables and have a lot of heat, dryness and lack of rain, we also have had
					 high levels of problems, of boil orders, parasites and of various kinds of
					 bacteria found in water throughout the continent. I think there is a very
					 strong connection between the two that is obvious.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am interested in hearing from the member what he
					 feels are the things that can be done to combat global warming, thereby
					 increasing our ability to have good water supplies. Scientists are telling us
					 that when temperatures increase through global warming, there is as much water
					 in the atmosphere but more of it evaporates. It is in the form of clouds or

	Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for his very
					 impressive comments on global warming. If anybody in the House or in the world
					 had a pat answer on how to deal with global warming, he or she would have a
					 Nobel prize.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am an expert in nothing so I cannot add anything
					 beyond what is already out there on global warming, other than to say we have
					 to deal with the facts on the issues of Kyoto and global warming.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are a lot of misnomers about what is taking
					 place. Regardless, there are things that we can do. There are some very good
					 technologies on energy utilization, such as decreased use of fossil fuels and
					 new non-fossil fuel alternatives, but they do not get the exposure they ought
					 to.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we put a fraction of the resources we put into
					 subsidizing other elements of the energy section into developing new techniques
					 and energy tools, we would have a much greater chance of dealing with the
					 phenomenon of global warming.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the end, one of my friends, who is an expert in
					 this, said that it will probably require a multifactorial approach by the
					 energy sector, diminished use of fossil fuels, probably greater use of nuclear
					 energy in the end and other alternative sources of fuel. Some people think that
					 solar power and wind power will be the panacea that will address all the
					 problems, but they have a cost inherent in them too. They are not a magic
					 bullet but need to be worked into the whole energy system and used more
					 efficiently where appropriate. Then we will have a better system.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, the member is absolutely right. I believe

					 desalinization procedures but also on how to use salt water. It is interesting
					 to note that we can use salt water to irrigate crops such as melons, corn and
					 many others. We need to look at that.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One thing we cannot do is pump, at a great energy cost,
					 water from a central region to a coast where there is salt water, which can be
					 used for other things such as irrigation purposes. We could also use the
					 irrigation we have in more efficient ways. There are micro methods of
					 irrigation. There are more efficient uses of irrigation in California. Those
					 technologies need to be spread to many other parts of the world.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is an energy cost in desalinization of which we
					 have to be cognizant. That cost has to be weighed against the benefits of

					 BQ): </b>

	Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to address Bill C-6, an act
					 to amend the International Boundary Waters Treaty Act.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As we all know, water represents an inestimable
					 resource for humans. We all agree that it is vital to life on Earth. However,
					 contrary to what was long believed, it is not an inexhaustible
					 resource.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is why it is important to recognize that even if
					 the Great Lakes and St. Lawrence River system accounts for one fifth of the
					 world's fresh water resources, it is not unlimited. Moreover, in recent years,
					 discoveries and research on greenhouse gases and on the potential risks of a
					 rise in temperatures have increased our awareness of the fragility of our
					 resources and of the threats to these resources. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of climatic risks, increased desertification
					 worldwide, limited supplies of drinking water around the world and energy
					 development based on this resource, the idea of exporting large quantities of
					 water on tanker ships or of diverting rivers has emerged as a serious option in
					 the past ten years or so in Quebec and Canada. To environmental threats to
					 water supplies is added a new and significant threat of bulk water exports and
					 large scale diversion of our lakes and rivers.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no doubt that bulk water exports offer
					 significant economic possibilities. It is because of this potential that some
					 provinces have examined the possibility of issuing permits to companies to
					 allow them to consider bulk water exports.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the early eighties, following a drought in
					 California, British Columbia delivered such permits to five Canadian companies
					 and one American one. However, over the years, the province changed its
					 position and, concerned about the possible impact of such business on B.C.'s
					 natural resources, it passed legislation to prohibit bulk water
					 exports.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We know that the possibility of issuing similar permits
					 was examined by other provinces. The case of Newfoundland recently made
					 headlines. The province quickly gave up the idea, but the possibility remains.
					 This, combined with the recent lawsuit by the California-based company Sun Belt
					 Water against the Government of British Columbia, raises concerns and brings
					 back the issue of trade risks associated with exporting this resource. In this
					 context, the federal government has been promising to legislate for the past
					 year</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is in this context that the Minister of the
					 Environment introduced Bill C-15 in the last parliament. Bill C-6 is therefore
					 an exact replica of it.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Permit me to provide a little background. On February
					 10, 1999, Canada and the United States gave the International Joint Commission,
					 or IJC, the mandate to study the matter. After noting a growing number of
					 proposals to export water from the Great Lakes and other areas of the United
					 States and Canada, the two countries agreed to ask the commission to study the
					 issue and make recommendations within the following year. A preliminary report
					 was tabled on August 18, 2000, and the final report of the IJC was tabled on
					 February 22, 2001.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In its preliminary report, the International Joint
					 Commission recommended that, during the next six months it would need to
					 complete its study, the federal, provincial and state governments prohibit bulk
					 removal or sale of water. It emphasized a number of points worth mentioning
					 here.</p>

						  adequate information about withdrawals of groundwater</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a problem here, because groundwater can have a
					 major impact on the integrity and quality of ecosystems. The report also points
					 out that it is impossible to forecast the demand for water. Moreover, the
					 possibility of climate change and all sorts of natural factors make it
					 impossible to evaluate with any degree of certainty the level and rate of flow
					 of the Great Lakes over the next few years.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In early February, the federal Minister of the
					 Environment proposed to his provincial and territorial counterparts a
					 Canada-wide accord to prevent bulk water removal from watersheds.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The response of the provinces was rather lukewarm.
					 Alberta, British Columbia, Manitoba and Saskatchewan said they would indicate
					 their positions later, while the government of Quebec dissociated itself,
					 saying that it found the accord premature and felt that its Bill 73, an act to
					 protect water resources, was sufficient. It said it would await the public
					 hearings of the BAPE before defining its comprehensive water
					 strategy.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We should note, however, that Quebec established a
					 moratorium on the issue of new licenses to pump underground water.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three major problems may be raised in connection with
					 the bill before us today, namely, the definition of watershed, the extensive
					 powers accorded the federal minister in connection with exceptions and with
					 licensed activities and the usefulness of the bill we are looking
					 at.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of these three, Bill C-6 goes beyond federal
					 areas of jurisdiction and encroaches on provincial jurisdictions.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fact that the concept of watershed is not defined
					 in the bill is of obvious concern, but the fact that it is the governor in
					 council who defines it by regulation and on the recommendation of the Minister
					 of Foreign Affairs will not be readily supported. This concept is, clearly,
					 very risky for the division of jurisdictions and for the ownership of natural
					 resources, which is essentially provincial.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a document dated February 10, 1999, the Department
					 of Foreign Affairs and International Trade indicated clearly what constituted a
					 watershed, and I quote:</p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td width="30" align="right">
</td>
<td><small>—a
						  land area draining into a common watercourse. Often called a catchment area,
						  drainage basin or river basin.</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td><small>Examples of watersheds in Canada
						  include Atlantic (including the Great Lakes and St. Lawrence River), Hudson
						  Bay, Pacific and Arctic. A single watershed can cover a relatively large
						  section of the Canadian landscape. For example, the Great Lakes waters are not
						  restricted to the lakes themselves but include the many rivers and their
						  tributaries that ultimately flow into the Great Lakes.</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why not specify this in the bill? Why not specify what
					 a watershed, or catchment basin, is? The definition given in the regulations
					 has a strong likelihood of being the same as the one set out in February 1999,
					 and thus will directly encroach, and with force of law, on provincial
					 jurisdictions in this area. </p>


	<A NAME="T1210"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1210"><!-- Hour: 12--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1215"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1205"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1210)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is very serious. The powers given to the Minister
					 of Foreign Affairs are considerable. From granting permits to selecting the
					 types of projects that may be eligible, and including practices that may be
					 exempt from application of the law, the minister is, in our opinion, padding
					 the responsibilities conferred upon him by the Constitution.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The amendments made to the International Boundary
					 Waters Treaty Act might enable the Minister of Foreign Affairs to interfere in
					 the management of Quebec's natural resources. Yet these provisions are clearly
					 contrary to established law and the division of powers between the provincial
					 and federal levels. Section 109 of the constitution awards incontestable
					 property rights to the provinces. This, in conjunction with sections 92.5,
					 92.13 and 92A, elicited from Senator Gérald Beaudoin, in his work on the
					 Canadian Constitution, the following comment in respect of the provinces, that
					 they have: </p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td width="30" align="right">
</td>
<td><small>broad
						  powers relating to land development, acquisition and management, natural
						  resource development and sales; what we are thinking of here specifically is
						  the development of Quebec's hydro-electric resources... As well, according to
						  the jurisprudence, the expression “lands” in section 92.5 also extends to
						  waters and to mines.</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus, these are flagrant encroachments into areas of
					 provincial jurisdiction. As well, the pertinence of this bill bears
					 questioning. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To protect water resources from the disastrous effects
					 of unlimited trade, Canada, Mexico and the United States declared in 1993 that
					 “the NAFTA creates no rights to the natural water resources of any party”. The
					 federal government is therefore saying that, given the existence of this joint
					 statement, as long as water is not considered a good or a product or is in its
					 natural state, it does not come under the provisions of trade agreements,
					 including NAFTA and WTO. But nothing could be less certain.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such a statement, even if it is jointly issued, would
					 not stand up under arbitration because, as provided for in the 1969 Vienna
					 convention on the law of treaties, the context, factors outside the scope of an
					 international treaty or convention, cannot be used to interpret it unless the
					 text itself remains obscure and the parties agree on the relevance of the
					 outside factors.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the United States made it very clear on the very
					 day this joint statement was issued that nothing in it in any way changed
					 NAFTA, it is therefore legitimate to say that water might become a good within
					 the meaning of the various international trade agreements. In fact, from the
					 moment that Canada exports this resource, it becomes a good within the meaning
					 of NAFTA and GATT. Even if it were not legally considered a product, it could
					 be the object of proceedings under chapter 11 of NAFTA on investments,
					 services, and under the national treaty.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, it is clear that if the federal government
					 issues export licences, water will henceforth be considered a marketable
					 commodity within the meaning of these trade agreements.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In short, the federal government boasts that its bill
					 is consistent with its constitutional responsibilities and with Canada's
					 international trade obligations. We do not agree. Contrary to what it says, the
					 government, through Bill C-6, is overstepping its constitutional jurisdiction
					 with respect to boundary waters, is interfering in Quebec's jurisdiction with
					 regard to drinking water, and is, in reality, offering no satisfactory
					 guarantees as to the impact of this bill on international trade agreements.
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the protection of water resources is vitally
					 important, as it stands, Bill C-6 strikes us as risky and contrary to the way
					 jurisdictions are divided between the federal and provincial governments. In
					 fact, it has considerable potential of encroachment on provincial areas of
					 jurisdiction, while not providing any additional protection against bulk water
					 exports. The Bloc Quebecois is opposed to the principle underlying
					 Bill-6.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Far from us the idea of questioning the need to protect
					 Canada's water resources and to support bulk water exports. The IJC's
					 preliminary report sounds, and rightly so, the alarm and it reminds those who
					 are in favour of an aggressive marketing approach of the need to deal with
					 these issues with greater insight, while also giving more importance to the
					 protection of our ecosystems. </p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, natural resource management is the provinces'

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It goes without saying that indepth studies on the

					 NDP): </b>

	Mr. Speaker, the NDP is quite pleased to see
					 legislation come forward on this issue, not this legislation in particular but
					 at least some legislation. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If there is any area of the environment that speaks to
					 the necessity of having the precautionary principle applied before an industry
					 such as the nuclear industry is allowed to develop, this is it. It is necessary
					 when one is considering the legislation to look at a bit of the history. As we
					 all know the nuclear industry was an offshoot of the development of nuclear
					 weapons flowing from research and work done during the second world war. It
					 began to be used for non-war purposes subsequent to the second world war. We
					 got our first small nuclear reactors in the 1950s and 1960s and in the process
					 of doing that began to identify even back then the very serious problem of the
					 byproduct, nuclear waste.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However identifying the level of seriousness seems to
					 have come to the attention of governments only after the huge expansion that
					 occurred in the 1970s, particularly in Canada with the Candu reactors. At that
					 point there was a recognition that we would have to do something about nuclear
					 waste.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because we allowed the continuous development of this
					 industry, what did not happen at that point was an economic assessment of the
					 real cost of nuclear power. In fact, we have not even done that up to this
					 point. That is one of the problems with the bill. However, we did allow the
					 expansion and there was very substantial expansion through the 1970s.
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the end of the 1970s the atomic energy commission of
					 Canada was prompted to begin to seriously look at what it would do with all the
					 nuclear waste from the nuclear plants. Over a period of extensive research and
					 time, it came up with a proposal which was, in simple, man on the street terms,
					 to dump it. It put some fancy words around it and talked about deep rock
					 burial. That is the phraseology. In essence, they wanted to dump it in the
					 Canadian Shield.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As this proposal came forward, as I think any sensible
					 person could imagine it got a less than overwhelming response from local
					 communities that might have been the site of this dump. Because the reaction
					 was so strong from the Canadian citizenry, a commission was appointed, chaired
					 by Blair Seaborn, and it became generally known as the Seaborn commission. The
					 commission studied this over an extensive period of time, almost 10 years, and
					 reported in 1997 with a very damning summary of the AECL proposal. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government, in response to that, to a great extent
					 rejected the commission but pretends now in the legislation to allow for the
					 implementation, or at least the potential implementation, of the
					 recommendations from that commission.</p>


	<A NAME="T1220"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1220"><!-- Hour: 12--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1225"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1215"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1220)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To some significant degree the bill is a fraud if its
					 intent is in fact to implement the Seaborn commission recommendations because
					 it does not do that. What it does do is allow the industry to make all of the
					 decisions, to do that in a relatively short period of time given the level of
					 intense research required and probably using a methodology that will be
					 relatively inexpensive for the industry but totally unsatisfying for the
					 Canadian public.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I said when I began my remarks we welcome the
					 legislation coming forward because this issue has to be addressed by the House.
					 We will be supporting the bill on second reading to have it passed on for
					 committee review. The work in that committee hopefully will get us to a result
					 by way of significant amendments that in fact would make the treatment of
					 nuclear waste something in which Canada can be a leader in the world, as
					 opposed to what we see in the bill now.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to deal with a few of the specifics in the bill
					 that we will be looking at and attempting to alter at committee stage. The
					 first, which I have already made reference to, is the composition of the
					 decision making body. The bill provides for the establishment of a waste
					 management organization. We welcome that. It was part of the Seaborn
					 recommendations that a body of that nature be established. What we are opposed
					 to and will attempt to get changed is the composition of the panel that will
					 form that commission, because as it stands now the only people who would be on
					 it are from the industry. Those people who need regulation would be doing the
					 regulating.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Seaborn commission recommended that there be
					 experts on that panel, that it involve extensive public consultation, that it
					 be at arm's length and independent from the utilities that provide the services
					 and the product, from the other vested interests or offshoots of those
					 utilities, and from government itself, in other words, that it be completely
					 independent. We will be looking for those recommendations to be incorporated in
					 the bill.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a second group that is established under the
					 bill, advisory panels and committees. Again, that was recommended by the
					 Seaborn commission. These would be more broadly based and somewhat localized to
					 the areas where there are current nuclear facilities. The bill would restrict
					 participants to being from just that area. In effect the local community would
					 be given a chance to sit on these committees but would not be given any
					 resources either in the form of personnel to act as secretaries or money for
					 things like travel or hiring experts. The bill does not provide for any of
					 this. Again, the Seaborn commission recommended all of that. In addition, any
					 people from the outside who may be able on a volunteer basis to provide
					 expertise would not be allowed to sit on the committees. We will be looking for
					 some significant changes in that structure.</p>


	<A NAME="T1225"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1225"><!-- Hour: 12--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1230"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1220"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1225)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is important to note that after all its research,
					 study and consultation, one of the Seaborn commission's major conclusions was
					 that even though deep rock burial may be technically feasible, not one
					 community in Canada would risk accepting the nuclear waste. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The credibility of both the waste management
					 organization and the advisory councils is extremely important. Ultimately, the
					 only way nuclear waste will be adequately dealt with and dealt with to the
					 satisfaction of the Canadian public, both generally and specifically in some of
					 these communities, is for it to have absolute credibility. Bill C-27 goes in
					 the opposite direction.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to spend a few moments on the funding for
					 nuclear waste disposal. I had the opportunity to spend some time at the nuclear
					 site in Darlington, Ontario, which has currently four reactors operating and
					 four more that are idle. I spent the better part of a day looking at the
					 system. The current system is simply that it is stored, first in water and then
					 it is moved into containers, very high tech in both cases, but obviously short
					 term in that it does not deal with the waste itself. It is strictly storage.
					 That is the only methodology we have at this point. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The financing that is being recommended in the bill, I
					 believe, and it is where there is some shortfall, is based on the original AECL
					 proposal of deep rock burial. I am not entirely convinced that the proposed
					 funding will even be sufficient to do that because of what I expect will be
					 very strong opposition from whatever community in which the site may end up, if
					 that ever proceeds.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I am convinced that it is clearly not enough
					 money if we continue short term storage. The reason for that is that this waste
					 has no end in terms of its lifespan. The best scientific minds in this field
					 cannot tell us what the life expectancy is of this material.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We may be storing nuclear waste above ground or in
					 limited, below ground facilities for centuries and millenniums, and that has
					 not been costed into the bill at all. This is very clear from the dollars. We
					 are not talking about peanuts. We are talking about billions and billions of
					 dollars that are being proposed but the amount will be nowhere near adequate
					 for long term storage. That is a matter that has to be looked at very
					 closely.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the government were serious about paying attention
					 to the work done by the Seaborn commission, it would do a number of things in
					 this legislation as opposed to the smokescreen it is creating here. If it set
					 out the legislation along the lines of what the commission recommended, we
					 could have a real independent agency, one that would be arm's length from the
					 nuclear industry and from the government.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That independent agency would be entitled and
					 authorized to look at the various options. This is another real flaw in the
					 legislation. It really only provides for two options: the storage that is going
					 on now, short term, or the deep rock burial.</p>


	<A NAME="T1230"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1230"><!-- Hour: 12--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1235"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1225"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1230)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are other potential options. Extensive research
					 has been going on over what is called a transmutation of the waste. It is
					 believed there are ways of reprocessing it. This has not been done yet, I would
					 hasten to add, but it is believed that we may be able to run the waste back
					 through the system. At this point it would be very dangerous to do that but if
					 it can be developed, it may reduce the volume of waste quite significantly and,
					 subsequently, storage capacity requirements would be dramatically
					 reduced.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other research that has been going on has to do
					 with using the waste as fuel repeatedly and eventually completely eliminating
					 the issues of storage and disposal. The forecast of us ever being able to do
					 that, either in this country or any place in the world, is long term. The point
					 is that there are some other potential options to look at rather than just the
					 two that the waste management organization, which will be authorized by this
					 bill, are supposed to look at.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other problem with the bill is that it only allows
					 the waste management organization three years to come up with its proposal.
					 Again, what we will be faced with is an organization that is completely
					 dominated by the industry, which has already taken the industry's position of
					 what it wants to do with it, and it will be given three years to come up with a
					 recommendation. We already know what the result will. We will be going back to
					 the original AECL proposal of deep rock burial.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I have said, if the bill remains the way it is and
					 is passed into law, this will be, to a great extent, a charade that the
					 government has put us through. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to talk a bit more about the options. We
					 have heard some hair-brained ones. I thought that one of the most interesting
					 ones, which was quite star trekkie, was to load the nuclear waste onto a
					 spaceship and shoot it into the sun. With this option we would not only have
					 <i>Star Wars</i>, we would also have all this nuclear waste that potentially
					 could end up in our outer atmosphere. This is not an option that I think any
					 reasonable commission would follow, but there are others.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A fair amount of research is going on in this area and
					 it should be pursued. We are not the only ones doing it. A number of other
					 countries are very active in this regard. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the timeframe, whatever the waste
					 management organization eventually ends up looking like, there is no way it
					 should be mandated to come back with a report within that timeframe. We have
					 been working on this issue since the late seventies, although it probably
					 should have been longer, and to mandate the organization now when we have this
					 type of controversy, is grossly unfair however it is composed.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, I just want to make one additional point
					 concerning the whole issue of the phase out of the nuclear industry.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although I think most of us are already aware of this,
					 I want to bring to the House's attention that Germany has now moved on this
					 issue. The German government has formerly reached an agreement with the
					 industry that it will phase it out. A number of other countries in Europe are
					 following suit. This waste issue with which we are dealing cries out for Canada
					 to do the same. We have a major problem on our hands that may go on for
					 centuries or even millenniums. We do not need to compound that by increasing
					 the volume of this waste.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I said earlier, we will support the bill at second
					 reading to get it to committee and for us to make those significant changes. It
					 is obvious from my comments that if those significant changes do not come
					 forward we will be vigorously opposing the legislation at third
					 reading.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, I listened attentively to the comments

					 regarding Germany. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think what we have seen on a world scale is that this
					 problem will not go away. A significant point should be made about Germany. The
					 fact remains that although Germany has decided not to support nuclear power
					 plants on German land, it has absolutely no qualms about buying electricity
					 made by nuclear power plants in France. As a matter of fact, it buys a
					 considerable amount of it. I believe this shows that there is a very
					 significant issue at stake here. This problem is not going to go away and we
					 cannot ignore it.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do agree with having a timeline of three years--and
					 perhaps it should be five but it certainly should not be ten--to actually take
					 action and deal with nuclear waste in some way because the problem is not going
					 to go away.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like the hon. member's comments on
					 that.</p>

				  </b>

	Mr. Speaker, my colleague from the Progressive
					 Conservative Party caught me on this once before during a take note debate. I
					 went back to take a look at this because I did not have an answer for him then,
					 but I have one now.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The answer is that in fact Germany does buy from some
					 of the other countries, France in particular. In France, by the way, active
					 consideration is being given to phasing out its nuclear industry. Germany has
					 seen the purchase of that, and the continued use that it is making of its own
					 plants, as temporary. Germany has set a quota for alternative energy sources,
					 which I have asked our Minister of Natural Resources to do, and I am still
					 waiting to hear back from him on, and in fact has a specific quota for wind
					 power.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If Germany achieves that, which it fully expects to do
					 over the next 10 to 15 years, it will be able to phase out its own industry and
					 cease purchasing electricity in the form of nuclear energy from France and
					 other countries.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the time limit, my friend is wrong. It
					 is grossly unfair to impose that type of time limit on anybody when we know
					 there are other options that may be coming.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to talk about the storage bins that I saw at
					 Pickering. They are designed to last for up to 50 years and are monitored on a
					 24 hour basis. If there are any problems with them, any cracks or deterioration
					 in the material, they are identified immediately and can then be placed in
					 another storage bin. There is no reason whatsoever for us to impose that type
					 of time limit other than to dump this stuff on some community in the Canadian
					 Shield and let the industry off the hook for the cost of it.</p>

				  </b>

	Mr. Speaker, it is interesting that whenever I get into
					 this specific topic I always think of the chair of the environment committee
					 and the work he has done, not only with regard to the nuclear industry and the
					 major advantages that we have created for them both by subsidizing and by
					 favourable tax treatment, but also the work he has done with the fossil fuel
					 industry. He is a national expert on this. I believe a couple of private
					 members' bills and some reports have come out of that committee over the years.
					 I acknowledge the work he has done on that committee.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What that work clearly shows is that we have subsidized
					 the nuclear industry and the fossil fuel industry quite extensively. That does
					 not show up in the cost. We have done that with tax dollars as a bottom line.
					 We have subsidized those industries.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately I do not have the documents to share with
					 my friend and I will try to get them to him, but what is interesting is that
					 the Canadian Wind Energy Association, which is an association of a number of
					 companies and associations around the country, is trying to develop wind as an
					 alternative form of energy. It was lobbying us in the spring. It was at that
					 time I asked the Minister of Natural Resources for some commitment on
					 alternative energy use.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What that association brought forth was some very
					 interesting research that set out the specific types of subsidies we have had
					 in those two other industries going back to the 1950s. We have not accorded
					 those to solar or wind power companies that are trying to develop those as
					 alternative forms of energy.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We always hear the argument from the nuclear industry
					 that it would only cost so many cents--and it is always gets the amount down to
					 pennies--for a unit of energy if we were to go to nuclear energy. It completely
					 ignores the costs that we are talking about, which I think are minimal in this
					 bill, but it does not show up in that accounting form. It is quite significant,
					 arguably, tripling and quadrupling, if not more, the cost of nuclear energy if
					 we were to seriously analyze what it would cost to deal with nuclear
					 waste.</p>

					 PC/DR): </b>

	Mr. Speaker, I will preface my comments with a few
					 remarks relating to the speech of the hon. member for Windsor--St. Clair. A few
					 other issues need to be recognized. Many alternative forms of energy including
					 solar and wind are being continually developed. If we had put the kinds of
					 dollar into those industries that we put into other industries in the energy
					 sector, perhaps we would have a reasonable alternative now. However I think we
					 must admit the fact that it is not here today or is it likely to be here
					 tomorrow.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another absolute issue we have to look at is the fact
					 that the world, not just the western world as we know it, is more dependent on
					 nuclear energy and will become even more dependent on nuclear energy not only
					 in 2001 but in the next decade. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The energy requirements of the Indian subcontinent of
					 Pakistan, China and Southeast Asia will have to be met for a growing and
					 burgeoning population. Those countries intend to build 70 to probably somewhere
					 around 180 nuclear reactors in the next 10 to 20 years just to meet the demand
					 for electricity.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not think we can pretend that we do not have a
					 issue, not just for Canada but for the entire world, in terms of finding a way
					 to store nuclear waste safely or to change it into a safe form.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a pleasure to speak to Bill C-27, the nuclear
					 fuel waste act. Nuclear fuel waste is an issue for all Canadians, even though
					 only three provinces have nuclear power stations. Nevertheless the implications
					 of nuclear fuel waste have long term and widespread impacts. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is the fear factor associated with nuclear power and
					 nuclear waste which continues to thwart attempts to deal with the issue solely
					 from a technological and a technical standpoint. Unless Canadians can be
					 assured of the relative safety of nuclear power it will be difficult to reach
					 any kind of consensus on how and where to store or to dispose of radioactive
					 waste. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have seen the fear associated with radioactivity and
					 radioactive materials close up. Nova Scotia contains significant amounts of
					 uranium. In the late 1970s some exploration was undertaken to determine the
					 feasibility of mining uranium near my hometown of New Ross. The thought of
					 uranium mining being undertaken in the area caused a public outcry. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the tests determined that the site was not
					 economically feasible, even at the inflated rates of the time of $40 per pound
					 compared with today's value of $8 per pound it demonstrated the fear associated
					 with radioactive materials.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the early 1980s there has been a moratorium on
					 uranium mining in Nova Scotia. We are not even talking about radioactive waste;
					 we are just talking about uranium mining. While uranium is unlikely to be mined
					 in Nova Scotia, Atlantic Canadians are well aware of the issue of nuclear fuel
					 waste because of the presence of the Point Lepreau nuclear power station in New
					 Brunswick, located in the riding of my colleague from Saint John. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Combined with the nuclear power station in Quebec and a
					 further 20 nuclear power stations in Ontario, this brings Canada's total to 22.
					 With the fuel waste produced by each of these power plants as they use nuclear
					 fuel bundles to produce electricity, the issue of how to deal with the waste
					 produced is long overdue. In fact the government has been studying the issue
					 for decades, with the most recent report being in 1998.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is long overdue for the federal government to
					 introduce legislation addressing the matter. The 1998 report of the nuclear
					 fuel waste management and disposal concept environmental assessment panel laid
					 the groundwork for appropriate storage and disposal concepts. It was limited,
					 however, in its examination of the waste management proposals, tasked only with
					 the examination of Atomic Energy of Canada's limited proposal of deep
					 geological disposal and not asked to propose other methods for long term
					 management of nuclear fuel.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The panel, often referred to as the Seaborn panel after
					 its chair Dr. Blair Seaborn, laid out a number of recommendations respecting
					 the long term management of nuclear fuel waste. One of the comments in the
					 report that has been picked up on extensively is the statement that while deep
					 geological disposal is technically sound, it is not acceptable from a social
					 standpoint to many people.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Senator Lois Wilson, a member of the panel at the time,
					 stated that this observation had been misconstrued or misread. Instead of
					 saying that such a disposal method is technically sound, the panel was trying
					 to state that the definition of safety had both a technical and a social
					 aspect. In this regard the method does not meet the criteria on safety. That is
					 the way I understood Senator Wilson's comments on the matter.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We can all appreciate the fear and the questions that
					 Canadians have regarding the issue. We all know about the nuclear bomb from
					 World War II and remember the meltdown at Three Mile Island in the United
					 States. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On March 28, 1979, a series of malfunctions, mistakes
					 and misinterpretations led to the worst nuclear accident in the United States
					 when the nuclear reactor at Three Mile Island experienced a meltdown. Although
					 the accident did not release significant amounts of radiation into the nearby
					 area, the consequences could have been disastrous.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The disaster at Chernobyl augmented these fears. In
					 1986 the reactor in Kiev, Ukraine, part of the Soviet Union at that time,
					 ruptured the containment structure and sent radiation through the northern
					 hemisphere. As many as 75 million people were exposed to high levels of
					 radiation.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I mention these points not to confuse the issue of
					 dealing with radioactive waste but to further submit the fear of general public
					 about radioactivity and the nuclear sector. It is difficult to say whether this
					 fear is valid and whether there are technological ways we can deal
					 with.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whether for war or peaceful purposes like power
					 generation anything involving nuclear capability represents the unknown to many
					 Canadians. However it also represents two of the reasons legislation dealing
					 with nuclear fuel waste is important, first, to address the long term need to
					 deal with waste so that nuclear power continues to represent a viable and
					 productive energy source and, second, to establish a fund to ensure that if
					 problems occur money is available.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whether for compensation, repair or other extraneous
					 matters, without an independent third party body to deal with waste management
					 responsibility falls to the federal government. Already accused of conflict of
					 interest because of the desire to augment sales of Candu reactors, the
					 government needs to be open and transparent in its examination of nuclear fuel
					 waste disposal proposals.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Seaborn panel carried out public consultations
					 throughout its study. Since then there have been discussions with aboriginal
					 groups about possible deep geological storage within the Canadian Shield in
					 northern Ontario. These discussions must be open and encourage debate and a
					 thorough examination of all issues involved.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The legislation would establish a waste management
					 organization that would report to the minister. It would collect and oversee
					 financial contributions by the 22 nuclear power stations and Atomic Energy of
					 Canada Ltd. It would be an independent third party organization, but already I
					 question some of the parameters or lack thereof respecting this organization.
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is important for all Canadians to be privy to
					 information that affects their safety. This means information must be publicly
					 reported on a timely basis. I will be expecting more detailed answers as the
					 legislation is studied at committee stage. I hope the minister plans to live up
					 to his commitment that no concessions would be made respecting safety or
					 transparency.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some experts suggest that long term storage and above
					 ground storage containers could continue for extended periods of time, while
					 others argue that the issue must be dealt with in the near future. Reports
					 indicate that there are 1.3 million spent fuel bundles from nuclear power
					 stations in temporary storage in Canada.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The waste management organization would be tasked with
					 determining what storage method is safest. The legislation would be one step
					 toward a long term storage initiative for nuclear fuel waste. As the world's
					 leading supplier of uranium Canada needs to look at the overall impacts of
					 nuclear power which includes nuclear fuel waste and its management.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I look forward to informed debate on the issue in
					 committee. Like other members of the natural resources committee, I hope the
					 process will be entirely clear and transparent, that we will be able to call
					 informed and expert witnesses before the committee, and that we will take the
					 time to study all areas and all clauses of the particular piece of
					 legislation.</p>

					 NDP): </b>

	Mr. Speaker, the hon. member mentioned a number of
					 times during his speech how it is quite likely we will see 100 or 125 new
					 nuclear reactors in the immediate future to meet the increasing demand for
					 electricity.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One thing I noticed was that the hon. member did not
					 dwell on or mention some interesting news out of the United States. The
					 Bonneville power authority, which I believe is the largest power authority
					 anywhere in North America, covers a lot of the western seaboard, California and
					 the coast. It has actually precluded the need for eight nuclear power plants
					 through a comprehensive demand side management program. In other words, by
					 reducing the amount of electricity that it uses, it precluded the need for
					 eight nuclear power plants in that geographic region alone. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Tennessee Valley hydro authority, which covers a
					 lot of the eastern-southern states, has also had similar effects with an
					 aggressive demand side conservation program.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rather than take a fait accompli attitude that we will
					 have these nuclear power plants and therefore we better find a way to deal with
					 the waste, would the hon. member care to dwell on perhaps a more positive
					 approach? The fact is that as citizens of the planet we can find a way to
					 produce the energy we need or to deal with our precious energy resources in a
					 lot more responsible way.</p>

				  </b>

	Mr. Speaker, I entirely agree with the hon. member's
					 comments. However we must continue to try to find alternatives. Where I
					 disagree is that we cannot ignore reality. The reality is that there are no
					 available alternatives at the present time for all energy needs of the
					 planet.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we stop producing nuclear energy tomorrow we still
					 have a responsibility as stewards of the planet to look after the radioactive
					 waste that is produced and lying in wait to be disposed of in some form right
					 now. We have to face that serious burden.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bonneville power station is a power complex and is
					 able to shut down eight reactors. I applaud that but I am very suspicious. I do
					 not have all the details, but one of my colleagues thought it was because it
					 had switched those reactors and was burning Canadian natural gas, which I
					 suspect is true.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We need to seek alternatives. We need to look at all of
					 them, including hydro, tidal, deep ocean currents, solar, and essentially all
					 aspects and prospects available to us.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We cannot ignore that we have a problem with nuclear

					 Lib.): </b>

	Mr. Speaker, 22 years ago in a former incarnation as a
					 member of the Ontario legislature and as a member of the select committee on
					 Ontario hydro affairs the subject of the storage of high level nuclear waste
					 was on the front burner. The committee was taken to Whiteshell, Manitoba, and
					 exposed to the technology to be used for the long term burial of that waste. It
					 is the same technology being proposed in the bill. It was highly developed 22
					 years ago. I believe that is rather ironic.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Politics entered into the debate because storage
					 required the location and development of a natural formation of impervious rock
					 known as a pluton. There are some hundreds of plutons in the northern parts of
					 Ontario, Manitoba, and elsewhere. When it got down to actually developing it,
					 public resistance did not allow for it.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bill before us might have been more useful 22 years
					 ago. However the minister must be commended for bringing the legislation before
					 the House at this time. It shows that he understands the problem is still with
					 us and growing.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bill would provide a three year study period which
					 is felt to be quite adequate despite my friend from Windsor--St. Clair claiming
					 that it is not enough time. Enough is known and understood now about the
					 technology. This is a great step forward. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I remember some 22 years ago raising the question of
					 long term storage of nuclear waste at power sites being vulnerable to terrorist
					 attack. The plants were not designed to be secure. The waste being stored in
					 what we called swimming pools at that time was vulnerable because they could
					 have been drained and have released radioactive material. That is still the
					 case. Over the years the amount of radioactive material has compounded. Whether
					 or not nuclear power has a long term future in Canada, the waste is still there
					 and must be dealt with.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In spite of my overwhelming support for the bill I have
					 a concern about its content. My concern is provincial in nature and has to do
					 with financing. We may have difficulty amending the legislation in an effective
					 manner. The bill clearly states that funding would come from the utility
					 involved or a third party. When I see the expression third party I begin to get
					 concerned about the fact that I could read it as subsidy. </p>


	<A NAME="T1305"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1305"><!-- Hour: 1--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1310"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1300"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1305)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If there is third party funding that results in a
					 subsidy for electric power generation, it once more gives us a false sense of
					 what it really costs to produce electricity from nuclear power. There is no
					 energy in Canada that is not subject to some form of subsidy, whether it is
					 financing on the tar sands or the $16.2 billion that has already gone into
					 nuclear subsidy over the last 40 years or so. The time has come, especially
					 looking into the future and the energy options as my friend across the way
					 mentioned, to deal with the real costs of producing energy and the real
					 environmental costs as well.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In an article in the <i>Globe and Mail</i> a couple of
					 weeks ago, two professors in California did a comparison of generating
					 electricity with wind power versus coal. At first coal was half the price of
					 wind generated power but when the true environmental costs were injected into
					 the equation, wind power won. Such is the case with many other forms of energy
					 and energy comparisons.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As long as we keep the blinders on and fail to look at
					 the true costs and keep convincing ourselves that what we are paying at the
					 moment is the real cost, we will not be able to proceed into a new and
					 necessary era of renewable and environmentally sustainable energy. Those
					 technologies are there, they are mature and developed but they are not
					 attracting sufficient investment to make them work. That is why I have a
					 concern for the third party addition in the bill. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the bill is studied at committee, I will attempt
					 to introduce an amendment that may be satisfactory, if we can satisfy ourselves
					 that it is also constitutional because electric power generation is the purview
					 of the provinces and we are not the provinces. At least we will make that
					 attempt. Hopefully through the discussion and debate that will ensue we will
					 expose the fact that we are not looking at true costs for energy and that we
					 need to do what my friend across the way described as whole costing. Whole
					 costing must be the way of the future. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We can no longer hide our heads in the sand as we have
					 done for so many years, particularly in Ontario. The premier told us a few
					 months ago that the stranded asset, and I use that term advisedly because it
					 should be stranded debt, has now reached $38 billion. That is unrecoverable
					 money that was never passed through the electric power system and the power
					 corporation act clearly stated that the mandate was to produce power at cost.
					 We have deluded ourselves over the years. I am not familiar enough with other
					 provinces to know whether similar activities have gone on but this has resulted
					 in a serious concern inside the province. Ultimately the taxpayers of Ontario
					 will be the ones who will have to cough up the $38 billion one way or another.

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, I support the bill and what it is
					 intended to do. Finally we are getting a grip on one of the key components of
					 nuclear power generation. If nuclear power has any chance of a future, this has
					 got to be dealt with. I think the bill does it but I will be supporting an

	Mr. Speaker, perhaps I could just pick up on something
					 the member said just before he sat down. He said that it was necessary to deal
					 with the question of waste in order that there be a secure future for nuclear
					 power. That is just the point that we are trying to make. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question of how we deal with the waste should be
					 separate from any interest, either at the level of the hon. member or vested,
					 that is to say at the level of AECL, in the future of nuclear power. We should
					 be dealing with the question of waste independently of whether or not we agree
					 about the role of nuclear power. Otherwise, particularly as this bill is
					 drafted, the people who are put in charge of determining waste solutions,
					 determining what is acceptable and determining if in fact there is an
					 acceptable way of dealing with nuclear waste are the same people who have a
					 vested interest in saying that there is a solution, even if there is not. If
					 they cannot arrive at a solution it is more difficult for them to promote
					 nuclear power and it is more difficult for them to market Candu reactors around
					 the world.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a conflict of interest regardless of whether
					 one is in favour of nuclear power or against it. Does the hon. member not see
					 that? The argument that people are making about the conflict of interest is a
					 bit like the old analogy of putting the fox in charge of the henhouse. We would
					 not tolerate this kind of conflict of interest in any other industry. Why do we
					 tolerate it? Why does the government tolerate it in this industry when the

					 recommended against that very kind of conflict of interest?</p>

					 and doing well. When we were in Edmonton a few weeks ago, the people who run
					 the LRT in Calgary announced that they would be buying green power to run that
					 train. The slogan they have adopted is wonderful; “ride the wind”. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elements were put in place by the federal
					 government in 1996, but only a few provinces have ratified. We are most anxious
					 that all the provinces get on board. The result in Alberta has been that
					 private industry is now saying that it wants to hang up the green sign
					 too.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, I would like to ask a question with regard
					 to a problem we have right now with nuclear waste. The member for Provencher is
					 not here to talk about AECL and Whiteshell, which is a research facility that
					 has been decommissioned, so to speak. The solution to the winding down of the
					 Whiteshell research plant was in essence to mothball it, leaving the nuclear
					 materials still in place. My riding is right beside it and many people from my
					 riding worked there. We were sorry to see it close down. We would really like
					 to see that place cleaned up and put back so that we can use the whole thing
					 for tourism and so on. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What will happen to that waste material? Are we just
					 going to have to leave that plant and store it forever?</p>

				  </b>

	Mr. Speaker, the reason for its existence is that
					 Whiteshell is located on impervious rock known as a pluton. All the early work
					 for long term storage was done there. If the pluton concept is acceptable,
					 which we were told it was 22 years ago, the pluton at Whiteshell is probably
					 the safest place for the long term storage of that material. What would be
					 gained by removing it and putting it above ground somewhere? That technology is
					 now probably considered the front runner in terms of the choices that will be
					 made in the future for ultra long term storage.</p>

					 Canadian Alliance): </b>

	Mr. Speaker, on behalf of the people of Surrey Central,
					 I am pleased to participate in the debate on Bill C-27, an act respecting the
					 long term management of nuclear fuel waste.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bill, if passed, would require the creation of a
					 long term management strategy for the disposal of nuclear fuel waste in an
					 integrated, comprehensive and cost effective manner. To do this, major owners
					 of nuclear waste would have to create a waste management organization to
					 implement the long term strategies for handling, treatment, conditioning or
					 transporting for the purpose of storage or disposal of nuclear fuel
					 waste.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nuclear fuel waste means irradiated fuel bundles
					 removed from a nuclear fission reactor. This nuclear waste management
					 organization has the responsibility to determine fiscally responsible and
					 realistic options for the long term management of nuclear fuel waste. It would
					 also direct the organization to establish trust funds to finance the above
					 activities.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The act applies to Atomic Energy of Canada Limited or
					 its assignees and nuclear energy corporations, which would deposit the
					 following respective amounts to its trust fund within 10 days after the act
					 comes into force: Ontario Power Generation, $500 million; Hydro-Quebec, $20
					 million; New Brunswick Power Corporation,$20 million; and Atomic Energy of
					 Canada Limited, $10 million. Then additional amounts of $100 million, $4
					 million, $4 million and $2 million per year respectively from all these four
					 organizations will be deposited until the minister approves the amount of the
					 deposit.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have some concerns regarding the bill. The fee or
					 cost of managing seems to be vague, unclear and perhaps unjustified. I am
					 concerned as to how they have calculated the amounts and for how long the
					 deposits have to be made. I have no idea and the bill does not explain anything
					 about that.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to Bill C-27, the governor in council would
					 decide as to the best approach to be implemented by the organization. I am
					 concerned that the decision should be based on management and scientific facts
					 with no political interference.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other concern I have, which has raised eyebrows, is
					 that the nuclear industry has stood alone for many years and no such levies
					 were in place within the industry for disposal of their hazardous wastes.
					 Whereas, other industries that have to deal with the cleanup of hazardous and
					 potentially dangerous or damaging materials have to have similar funds as a
					 condition of their licensing, </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why has this weak Liberal government been neglecting
					 this important safety issue since 1993? It seems to be in line with the
					 character, culture and attitude within the Liberal government to neglect, as it
					 has with many other important issues, such as the budget, health care, defence,
					 organized crime, terrorism, national security, the safety and welfare of
					 Canadians and many other issues.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The nuclear industry cannot operate without the proper
					 checks and balances in place.</p>


	<A NAME="T1320"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1320"><!-- Hour: 1--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1325"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1315"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1320)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This legislation would bring the nuclear industry,
					 which deals with this most serious and dangerous stuff, at par with other
					 industries in providing overall safety for Canadians, which has not been a
					 priority for the government for so many years. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other concern I have is that the government and the
					 waste management organization must be focused on results, not just on the
					 process. The organization would create an advisory council to examine the
					 study, the triennial reports that have to be submitted to the minister and
					 comment on that study.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am also concerned that the advisory council would be
					 appointed by the governing body of the organization and nominated by government
					 to include representatives of local regional governments and aboriginal
					 organizations. Based on the track record of the Liberal government, I am afraid
					 it will be used again as a patronage opportunity for failed Liberal candidates
					 or their friends.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another concern I have is highlighted in the Ottawa
					 <i>Sun</i> of today. We have about 22 reactors in Canada. They were placed on
					 enhanced security within hours after the September 11 terrorist attacks in the
					 U.S.A. Could any of them withstand an attack similar to the World Trade Center
					 attack? The fear is that an airborne attack could rupture the containment
					 buildings designed to isolate radioactive materials. The president of the
					 Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission has assured, according to the article, that
					 the measures in place are adequate but are under evaluation. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Atomic Energy of Canada has imposed a secure airspace
					 of 3,000 feet, or 3.5 nautical miles, around the research campus at Chalk
					 River. However, the industry is in denial about the threat of airborne attacks,
					 which the reactors were never designed to withstand.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission said that there
					 was no identified terrorist attempt against Canada. However, the crown
					 corporation is in contact with the RCMP and CSIS on a daily basis. The
					 interesting point is the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission has conceded that
					 its reactors are vulnerable to airline crashes, but Canadian officials are not
					 making such admissions. Canadian officials are declining comment.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am concerned that in such an unfortunate event how
					 well equipped are we to handle such circumstances?</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope and expect that the above concerns will be
					 addressed. The bill does not yet address those concerns. The government has
					 finally realized that a trust fund at the expense of the nuclear industry
					 merely asks those who make the mess to clean up the mess and to pay for
					 it.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The riding of Surrey Central, which I proudly
					 represent, could have used something like a nuclear safety commission 25 years
					 ago when it first became the temporary home of some 4,000 tonnes of radioactive
					 material. For over two and a half decades, my constituents have been exposed to
					 radioactive and toxic material in the heart of the community of Newton in
					 Surrey.</p>


	<A NAME="T1325"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1325"><!-- Hour: 1--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1330"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1320"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1325)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In June 1972 a firm in Surrey was licensed by the
					 federal government to import niobium ore containing radioactive thorium. The
					 imported ore was used in smelting operations. Tonnes of hazardous waste was
					 ignored and left unattended in the open until 1976. It was 1984 before the
					 federal government accepted responsibility for it.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I heard from people in that area that children played
					 on it. Some unconfirmed reports said that some cows from a nearby dairy farm
					 died. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The feds forgot about the radioactive waste again until
					 October 1989 when a special task force was appointed, on a volunteer basis, to
					 deal with the storage, handling and disposal of the hazardous, unprotected
					 piles of smelter slag and contaminated soil in a corner at 7800 Anvil Way in
					 Newton. As well, there were barrels of concentrated radioactive material
					 rusting in Thornton yard of the CN rail. I went there and took pictures. The
					 barrels were rusted and contained concentrated radioactive material.
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The slag, which was left in the open, remained there
					 for a number of years. This material was also used as a filling when a building
					 was constructed on that site. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Surrey citing task force consulted with local,
					 provincial and federal government. The federal government appointed, on a
					 voluntary basis, an organization comprised of two people to look after this
					 radioactive material. It stored the material in a concrete bunker for 25 years,
					 calling it temporary storage. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The federal voluntary task force could not find a
					 permanent solution to the problem. Communities it contacted, including remote
					 and abandoned uranium mines, refused to accept that material. It is a crime to
					 have kept that hazardous material in the heart of the country's fastest growing
					 city, Surrey. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a member of the foreign affairs committee then
					 dealing with nuclear proliferation, I found out about this neglected storage
					 site. After some research and consultation, I lobbied for three years and
					 personally followed up with the Minister of Natural Resources until that 4,000
					 tonnes of dangerous material was finally removed from Surrey.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some of it has gone to Chalk River, Ontario while more
					 was finally dumped in Arlington, in Washington state. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The land slag was also excavated under the building.
					 The building was supported and the material was excavated from under the
					 building. The whole operation was very expensive to taxpayers and has been kept
					 kind of secret by the federal government.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am happy that finally my pressure had results and the
					 Minister of Natural Resources was helpful in dealing with the issue. I thank
					 him for that. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The longer the delay, the higher the cost and the more
					 potential for harm and danger in the community. I knocked on doors in that area
					 to find out how people felt, but many did not even know about it. The federal
					 government did not educate the community members about that
					 material.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is a shameful story highlighting carelessness and
					 neglect by the federal government in dealing with hazardous and radioactive
					 waste in Surrey.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, on behalf of the people of Surrey
					 Central, I will be paying very close attention to the work of the proposed
					 waste management organization to see that the travesty that occurred in my
					 riding does not happen anywhere else. </p>

				  </b>

	With due respect to my colleague opposite, the remarks
					 I will be making will I think engage the attention of all members because I
					 would like to think they are of some importance.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Speaker, this is a very important bill. The problem
					 of nuclear waste cleanup in the United States is a $100 billion problem.
					 Throughout the cold war period the Americans and their production of weapons
					 grade nuclear fuel caused enormous damage to the environment, particularly in
					 the western states. It has become a very serious problem in the United States.
					 I think the bill correctly addresses the issue that if we are going to have
					 nuclear power we have to put money up front to control nuclear
					 waste.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I do believe this bill is seriously flawed. It
					 has a flaw in it that I think must be attended to in committee. I will
					 certainly support the bill in principle but it has to be attended
					 to.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Speaker, as you know I have a certain passing
					 interest in access to information. You will know that crown corporations like
					 Atomic Energy of Canada Limited are outside the Access to Information Act. None
					 of us can see any of the documentation or any of the information that
					 internally travels within this crown corporation. The reason why that is
					 important is that in my view there are not enough provisions in the legislation
					 for the kind of transparency we must have in order to ensure that Atomic Energy
					 of Canada Limited and the other corporations affected by this act will indeed
					 proceed with nuclear waste disposal and treatment in a manner that is
					 consistent with environmental protection and using the best scientific
					 instruments possible and the best scientific knowledge possible.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Something as important as the deep burial of nuclear
					 waste is something that needs to be tracked effectively by the public at large,
					 by parliament, not just by, shall we say, relatively incomplete reports to the
					 minister. Let me explain in detail.</p>

				  </b>

	Mr. Speaker, the opposition is fond of claiming that
					 backbench government MPs are afraid to criticize government bills that are
					 before the House. We have just had an example of an opposition member making it
					 very difficult for a backbench MP on the government side to express his
					 criticism of legislation. What I have to say is important. It is important to
					 this piece of legislation and it is important to the entire House. I hope that
					 I can continue without these continual interruptions because I do not use
					 printed text and I do not use notes and it is very difficult with interruptions
					 to maintain one's line of thought.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That line of thought deals with the fact that what we
					 are talking about here is legislation that basically requires nuclear
					 production authorities to set up regimes whereby nuclear waste will be properly
					 disposed of, and moreover, that financial instruments will be in place to
					 ensure that this is done in a responsible fashion. What is missing is that
					 there is not the level of transparency on the part of AECL and the other
					 corporations that are affected by this document that we as parliamentarians and
					 all Canadians must have. I will give the House an example.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What this legislation proposes is that these
					 authorities, AECL or whomever, are required, after this legislation passes, to
					 submit proposals, studies first and foremost that deal with the disposal of
					 nuclear waste or that may involve collection on site or the deposit of the
					 nuclear waste in deep geologic formations. Once those studies are prepared and
					 they are required to consider the risks and primarily the socioeconomic
					 impacts, this legislation, just for starters, does not specify the kinds of
					 risks that these authorities are supposed to be assessing. We do not know
					 whether it is long term environmental risk they have to report on. There is no
					 parameter explaining what AECL or any of these authorities have to describe.
					 The study is produced and then submitted to the minister. The minister decides
					 whether or not the study is adequate.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no legislative requirement for the minister to
					 release that study. Because AECL is outside the Access to Information Act there
					 is no requirement for AECL to release the study. So we have a situation where
					 the minister will make a crucial decision and we have no right in legislation
					 to see the basis on which he makes that decision. Once the minister has given
					 approval to whatever process is proposed to him, not until three years later
					 does the organization that is depositing the nuclear waste in a geologic
					 formation or wherever, not until three years later does the corporation, be it
					 AECL or whomever, have to do a report to the minister on the progress with
					 respect to the deposition of nuclear waste under whatever plan is going
					 forward. Even that report is inadequate because the report says that the
					 corporation is required to give the minister a summary of its activities
					 respecting nuclear waste and its social, cultural and economic impacts on the
					 nearby communities where the waste is deposited.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Speaker, the requirement says nothing about an
					 environmental assessment, nothing about scientific impact. There is no
					 requirement in that report after three years to the minister to tell the
					 minister what the environmental or scientific consequences are of whatever
					 choice of nuclear waste disposal we are talking about.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The public has access to that report but it is not
					 going to be an adequate document to tell us whether or not in the decision to
					 bury nuclear waste underneath Sudbury or wherever else in the world that
					 nuclear waste is leaching into the environment. It does not make a requirement
					 that tests have to be taken. </p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my view it is totally inadequate to give this kind
					 of authority to Atomic Energy of Canada Limited, any crown corporation or any
					 corporation whatsoever that is engaged in an activity that has a profound
					 effect on public safety and on the environment, without a reasonable level of
					 legislated scrutiny.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the very least I think that whenever this government
					 does come around to reviewing the Access to Information Act, there is no more
					 eloquent an example of why crown corporations like AECL ought to be under the
					 Access to Information Act. However, that does not deal with the other
					 corporations affected by this act, so I really think that the committee, when
					 it comes to review this legislation, needs to put in proper instruments of

					 BQ): </b>

	Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to address Bill C-27, an act
					 respecting the long-term management of nuclear fuel waste.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As members know, I am very interested in the whole
					 nuclear energy issue. Last year, Quebecers, and particularly people in the
					 Saguenay region, realized that when the federal government had the
					 ill-conceived idea of importing, by air, a radioactive product, namely MOX
					 plutonium, over their heads. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today's debate deals with an extremely important issue.
					 Since Canadian nuclear power plants first came into operation, the federal
					 government has never bothered to develop a long term management plan for its
					 nuclear waste. To this day, hundreds of thousands of tons of uranium and
					 plutonium are stored close to nuclear power plants, thus posing an explosive
					 risk to the environment and to public health.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In light of this situation, in 1989, the Minister of
					 the Environment asked an independent panel, chaired by Blair Seaborn, to
					 examine the long term management of our nuclear waste.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The panel released its report nine years later, in
					 February 1998. In a speech delivered on May 15, the Minister of Natural
					 Resources mentioned that he would follow up on the recommendations of the
					 commission to the effect that, to be considered acceptable, a concept for
					 managing nuclear fuel wastes must have broad public support. It must, among
					 other things, enjoy broad public support and it must be advanced by a stable
					 and trustworthy proponent and overseen by a trustworthy regulator. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I must make a short digression here. Again, any
					 management concept must enjoy broad public support. Hon. members will remember
					 that, less than a year ago, I fought along with other groups against the import
					 of MOX fuel. In spite of the short time frame given to the public to express
					 its views and in spite of the fact that this was really a bogus consultation,
					 hundreds of people took time to make comments and suggestions to the
					 government, and particularly to the Minister of Natural Resources, and to say
					 that they did not want other countries' radioactive waste.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have in hand Transport Canada's report following
					 these so-called public consultations. It is a 700 or so page document where
					 virtually all of the stakeholders said no to this plan to import. The report
					 also contains resolutions from close to 200 municipalities, including the
					 Montreal urban community, the Quebec urban community and other regional
					 municipalities that are also against importing plutonium into
					 Canada.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, a unanimous report from the Standing
					 Committee on Foreign Affairs and International Trade mentions, and I
					 quote:</p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td><small>The Committee recommends that the
						  Government reject the idea of burning MOX fuel in Canada because this option is
						  totally unfeasible.</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Did the government take this comments into
					 consideration? No. It proceeded against the whole world to import 680 grams of
					 Russian military plutonium.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is happening with Bill C-27? Is the minister going
					 to take public opinion into consideration? The Minister of Natural Resources
					 waxed eloquently during his speech about how Bill C-27 had not been created in
					 a vacuum, but took into account comments make by the public. I find that
					 strange, because I do not recall reading in the papers any announcements
					 regarding any “Consultation regarding establishing a long-term nuclear fuel
					 waste management plan” with the lovely Canada logo above it.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the minister thinks that asking the advice of a
					 handful of specialists working in the field of nuclear energy constitutes a
					 transparent process, he should think again.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Seaborn panel's second recommendation asks that all
					 nuclear fuel waste management proposals be advanced by a stable and trustworthy
					 proponent and overseen by a trustworthy regulator.</p>


	<A NAME="T1350"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1350"><!-- Hour: 1--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1355"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1345"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1350)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet in his speech the Minister of Natural Resources
					 said that, under this bill, the major decisions will be made by the governor in
					 council.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As far as the methods of management are concerned, the
					 bill as it reads states only that the minister “may” consult the general
					 public. Everyone will agree with me that there is nothing transparent about
					 this bill, since all decisions will be taken by the Minister of Natural
					 Resources. Once again, all comments by the public will be shunted aside and
					 public opinion will be ignored. But the question of nuclear energy is too
					 important to be ignored.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will also point out that the way our nuclear waste is
					 to be disposed of is not yet defined. Here is a quick quiz question: who will
					 define the selected method? The public? Of course not. What the bill indicates
					 instead is that the final choice of method will be made by the Canadian
					 government.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no nuclear tradition in Quebec. Of course, we
					 have the Gentilly 2 generating station, but its output is insignificant
					 compared to the hydroelectric output of LG-2 and Manic 5. Unlike Ontarians, the
					 people of Quebec are not receptive to nuclear industry. The concept of
					 long-term nuclear waste management, therefore, must not be implemented at the
					 expense of Quebec. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Seaborn panel recommended that nuclear fuel waste
					 be stored permanently in a geological formation similar to the Canadian shield.
					 From a geographic standpoint, this geological area represents about 90% of the
					 area of Quebec.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are we to conclude that all Canadian radioactive waste
					 will be stored in Quebec in the Canadian shield? With C-27, it appears that
					 that could be the case, since the final decision rests with cabinet and the
					 Minister of Natural Resources. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How could such an approach be acceptable to Quebecers?
					 After the fight waged by the people of Abitibi and Témiscamingue against the
					 disposal of waste in an abandoned mine in northern Ontario, does the government
					 think it will be able to bury radioactive waste in old mines in Val-d'Or or
					 Amos without anyone having any say? I doubt it very much. Rest assured, because
					 Quebecers are not the only ones who do not want this matter buried on their
					 land.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clearly, we cannot oppose the long term management of
					 nuclear waste, but does this issue have to run afoul of Canadians and
					 Quebecers? The minister has to realize that fear of things nuclear is strongly
					 entrenched in people, and we cannot blame them, especially when we consider
					 Canada's nuclear infrastructures.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In his speech, the minister refers to the “unequalled
					 security record of Canadian nuclear facilities”. I beg to differ.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On August 17, the French network of the CBC reported
					 that the Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission had concerns about the quality of
					 maintenance of the main reactor at the Chalk River nuclear facility near
					 Ottawa. It feared that the numerous departures of experts and engineers in
					 recent years might jeopardize the safety of its activities.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to Paul Lafrenière, director of the Chalk
					 River nuclear facilities, since 1957 its technicians have been trained on the
					 job, believe it or not! I find this most disconcerting. As well, this is where
					 building 220 is located, and military plutonium was stored there between 1950
					 and 1957.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to revisit the question of importing the
					 plutonium from dismantled ballistic missiles.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the bill stands, there is no indication that the
					 disposal of nuclear waste will involve just Canadian waste. The door is
					 therefore opened to imports of MOX from the U.S. or Russia.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us recall the Prime Minister's promise made in
					 April 1996 at the Moscow summit, that Canada would import close to 100 tonnes
					 of this over the next 20 to 25 years. In January 2000, 120 grams of MOX arrived
					 by helicopter from the United States, and another 680 grams from
					 Russia.</p>


	<A NAME="T1355"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1355"><!-- Hour: 1--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1400"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1350"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1355)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the time, the Minister of Natural Resources said
					 that Canada would not import additional MOX until it had developed a concept
					 for the long term management of nuclear waste.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, the last building block is in place. With this
					 bill, the legislative framework will be complete. Once this concept is
					 accepted, all by recommendation of the governor in council, 100 tonnes of
					 plutonium will be transported by airplane, helicopter, boat or truck across our
					 country to be burned in the CANDU reactors.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Setting aside the events of September 11, why is the
					 Canadian government offering up on a silver platter to the Americans an easy
					 way to dispose of their plutonium? All members know that the Americans are
					 large producers of nuclear energy. Recently, we learned that the United States
					 had extended the authorized operating life of their nuclear generating stations
					 by 60 years.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More than ever, it is clear that the federal government
					 is trying to prolong the life of its nuclear reactors. With this concept of
					 waste management, it will be able to continue along this road. But what benefit
					 does it hope to achieve? </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Historically, the federal government has invested over
					 $5 billion dollars in nuclear energy and has been putting about $150 million
					 annually into this form of energy since 1994. Everywhere in the world, even
					 among the nations which are the greatest users of nuclear energy, questions are
					 being asked about this kind of energy and there are plans to gradually
					 dismantle the stations. In this regard, we need only mention the case of France
					 and of Germany.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In November 1999, during the meeting of parties to the
					 convention on climate change in Bonn, Germany, Canada put forward a plan which
					 would give emission credits to countries exporting nuclear reactors, thus
					 allowing Canada to meet its objectives indirectly, without reducing its own
					 emissions.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Despite growing opposition from the public, Canada is
					 continuing down the nuclear path instead of promoting renewable energy and
					 adopting strong policies for the reduction of greenhouse gas
					 emissions.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We know that Canada is way behind when it comes to the
					 reduction of greenhouse gas emissions.To remedy this, Canada is pushing nuclear
					 energy, which does not give off greenhouse gases. This is a position which can
					 even be found on the home page of Atomic Energy of Canada Limited's website. In
					 fact—</p>

					 However there are other serious matters that must be addressed by parliament.
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is appropriate that the impact of the drought is one
					 of the first of these issues brought to the floor of the House by the Canadian

					 Canadian Alliance in forcing the government to consider the needs of producers
					 in rural communities. The Canadian Alliance promised that agriculture would be
					 one of the first issues we pushed on to the agenda of the House of Commons. We
					 are keeping our promise. We are effectively challenging the cabinet's

					 Phil English, chair of the congressional steel caucus, for his support on the
					 issue. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canada also found support with the United Steelworkers
					 of America and the American Iron and Steel Institute. The FTA and NAFTA have
					 accomplished their goal of creating an integrated steel market. Canada-U.S.
					 steel trade reflects the dynamic and overall balance of this integrated market.
					 It is in our mutual interest and to our mutual benefit that it not be
					 impaired.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canada lags behind Belgium, the Netherlands and even

					 months.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Half our CF-18 planes cannot get off the ground because
					 their electronics are obsolete. They cannot integrate with American pilots. We
					 do not have enough soldiers to meet our domestic needs let alone our
					 international obligations. </p>

	Mr. Speaker, today, Canadian and American steel

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The U.S. International Trade Commission is currently

					 steel travelled to Washington as part of this investigation. He was able to
					 enlist the support of the Hon. Phil English, chair of the U.S. caucus on steel,
					 who also pleaded against implementing any countervailing measure on Canada. Mr.
					 English indicated that, on a priority basis, the unfair trade activities of
					 certain countries should be targeted and the integrated character of the North
					 American steel market protected by excluding Canada from the scope of the
					 ongoing investigation. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to further extend the integration of this
					 market and to promote a better mutual understanding of our respective and
					 common problems, Mr. English is in Ottawa today. We are pleased about this and

					 BQ): </b>

	Mr. Speaker, it is very hard to resume a speech after
					 an interruption. I will pick up a bit of my first part and carry on from
					 there.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In November 1999, during the meeting of parties to the
					 convention on climate change in Bonn, Germany, Canada put forward a plan which
					 would give emission credits to countries exporting nuclear reactors, thus
					 allowing Canada to meet its objectives indirectly, without reducing its own
					 emissions.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Despite growing opposition from the public, Canada is
					 continuing down the nuclear path instead of promoting renewable energy and
					 adopting strong policies for the reduction of greenhouse gas
					 emissions.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We know that Canada is way behind when it comes to the
					 reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. In order to remedy this, Canada is
					 pushing nuclear energy, which does not give off greenhouse gases. This is a
					 position which can even be found on the home page of Atomic Energy of Canada
					 Limited's website.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, it reads as follows:</p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td><small>AECL develops, constructs and markets
						  one of the best sources of clean electricity in the world, the CANDU nuclear
						  reactor. Nuclear energy is the only source of electricity that does not produce
						  greenhouse gases and provides a solution for countries making an effort to
						  fulfill the promises of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate
						  Change made in Kyoto in 1997.</small></td>

</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recently, there has even been an announcement of two
					 new uranium mines to be opened in Saskatchewan.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canada is a world promoter of nuclear technology. It
					 provides 30% of the world's uranium production. In addition, on June 7, 2001,
					 at a conference in Moscow attended by scientists from all over the world, it
					 officially proposed to house the largest nuclear fusion research reactor.
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Construction of the reactor, which should cost at least
					 $6 billion, should take eight years, with work scheduled to begin in
					 2003.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nuclear energy creates highly radioactive waste that is
					 very dangerous to people's health, witness Chernobyl. We have now accumulated,
					 on the sites of Canada's nuclear facilities, over 24,000 tonnes of radioactive
					 nuclear waste.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How do you expect Quebecers to believe the double talk
					 of the Minister of Natural Resources? Clearly, the Canadian government intends
					 more than ever to head blindly into the production of nuclear energy. It is
					 moving against the current of the anti-nuclear movement worldwide.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As an MP and a citizen concerned about the future of
					 our environment, Canada should manage the waste we currently have here, stop
					 all funding to the nuclear fusion industry and have the $150 million currently
					 spent each year redirected to research and development for green
					 energy.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Total elimination of nuclear energy would not be a
					 first for the world. Just last year, Germany announced that it would abandon
					 this type of energy production by 2021. Sweden wants to drop nuclear energy by
					 2010, and it looks like France will choose the same option in the coming
					 months.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Naturally, Canadian taxpayers will have to foot the
					 bill for our long years of dependence on nuclear energy. In its report, the
					 Seaborn panel stated clearly in 1998 that the cost of long term management of
					 nuclear waste would be between $8.7 billion and $13.3 billion. This is a
					 considerable sum, but, at the outset of the Canadian nuclear program, people
					 thought it would be a low cost and inexhaustible source of energy. However,
					 today, we are awaking to a nightmare, because the radioactive waste we produced
					 will cost some $13 billion to manage and store securely.</p>


	<A NAME="T1510"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1510"><!-- Hour: 3--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1515"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1505"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1510)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe this figure is astronomical enough and we
					 should not invest another penny in anything related to nuclear energy. We
					 should most certainly not continue producing energy with uranium or plutonium.
					 Why not go the route of biomass energy or wind energy? Contrary to nuclear
					 energy, they do not create radioactive waste that lasts for 25,000 years. Let
					 us stop making future generations pay the price for the mistakes we are making
					 today.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to repeat that nobody can be against the
					 idea of nuclear waste disposal management. It is high time we act on this.
					 However, the process developed by the Minister of Natural Resources in Bill
					 C-27 is inadequate, seriously flawed, severely lacking in transparency, and,
					 contrary to what the minister says, is not at all in line with the conclusions
					 of the Seaborn Report. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Take the issue of public participation in the
					 decision-making process, as an example. On the one hand, the minister says that
					 he will hear input from the public, yet on the other, the bill stipulates that
					 decisions will be made by cabinet. Furthermore, the bill provides that the
					 minister “may” consult the general public if he so wishes.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I hope the government will make amends and
					 admit once and for all that storing waste accumulated over 40 years has already
					 cost us enough, and that it will not contemplate producing even more. Nuclear
					 energy is an obsolete source of energy with more liabilities than advantages.
					 The considerable sums of money that the government sinks into it every year
					 should be put toward research and development in green energy.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In closing, I would like to tell the residents of
					 Saguenay--Lac-Saint-Jean that I have not given up my fight against importing
					 nuclear fuel. I made a commitment to defend the interests of future
					 generations. If we use this long term plan to manage nuclear waste as an
					 opportunity to launch ourselves headfirst into nuclear energy production, it
					 will be our children and our grandchildren who pay the price. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The time has come to switch to greener energy sources,
					 and the minister should announce that the $13 billion to be invested in this
					 project will be the last public money to be spent on nuclear energy.

					 NDP): </b>

	Madam Speaker, I am happy to have an opportunity to say
					 a few words about Bill C-27, an act respecting the long term management of
					 nuclear fuel waste. This is a matter which has interested me for many years. If
					 I recall correctly, one of the first questions I ever asked in the House of
					 Commons had to do with this issue.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Marc Lalonde was the minister of energy and his
					 parliamentary secretary, Roy MacLaren, had a reputation for giving some of the
					 most boring late shows one could ever imagine. He later went on to great
					 heights as the high commissioner in London.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What I was concerned about then, and I raise this in a
					 way to counterpoise my view of what has happened since then with what was said
					 by the hon. member for Halton, was the fact that AECL was initiating a process
					 that we are now near the end of, that is to say a process by which it set out
					 to prove that deep geologic disposal of high level nuclear waste was the way to
					 go.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have chosen my words carefully because it did not set
					 out to find out whether or not it was the best way to dispose of high level
					 nuclear waste but to prove a conclusion it had already arrived at. The hon.
					 member for Halton reinforced this earlier today when he said that 22 years ago
					 he went to the Whiteshell nuclear research establishment where he was exposed
					 to the technology, whatever that means.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The technology, the method of deep geologic storage or
					 disposal of high level nuclear waste, had not been developed yet. In fact the
					 lab is separate geographically, although in the same area, from the Whiteshell
					 nuclear research establishment. It had yet to be built in 1979. If we listen to
					 the hon. member for Halton we might have the impression that all this was fully
					 developed in 1979. At that point they had yet to dig into the ground and create
					 the underground space that they would use to test their theories about the
					 safety of deep geologic disposal of high level nuclear waste.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That underground lab did not open until the
					 mid-eighties. I first visited it very soon after it was opened in February
					 1986. For the hon. member to suggest that somehow this was already entrained in
					 1979 is not so. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What happened was that there was a process. The problem
					 with the process all along was that the impression was never dispelled to my
					 satisfaction or to the satisfaction of a great many others. There were certain
					 people who knew what the outcome would be from the day the process began. The
					 process was not open ended and did not allow for the possibility of coming to a
					 different conclusion.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we do not have the possibility of coming to a
					 different conclusion it is not science. If we already know what the result of
					 an experiment will be, and we are not open to the possibility that it might not
					 work out the way we think it will, it is not science. It is politics.
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was a predetermined outcome based on a political
					 decision that Canada as a maker, producer and seller of Candu reactors was
					 determined to be able to tell its potential clients that it had a way of
					 disposing of high levels of nuclear waste that would be produced by those
					 reactors.</p>


	<A NAME="T1520"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1520"><!-- Hour: 3--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1525"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1515"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1520)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is ultimately the conflict of interest at the
					 heart of the entire process which has never been rooted out. We see it in the
					 bill. Even now, at the end of the process, it is the industries themselves that
					 will be put in charge of dealing with nuclear fuel waste without any
					 participation by people who do not have a vested interest in the
					 issue.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As long as the country continues to want to sell Candu
					 reactors through a crown corporation, not only the crown corporation but the
					 government itself will be in a conflict of interest. They and others involved
					 in the industry who also have a vested interest are charged with the
					 responsibility of determining whether there is a safe way to dispose of these
					 high levels of nuclear waste. If they cannot say that, they will have a hard
					 time selling the reactors.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a prima facie conflict of interest, yet we have
					 not been able to successfully make the argument over the last two decades that
					 the debate has been ongoing. That is my primary objection to the bill. It
					 continues the conflict of interest of the government, AECL, and for that matter
					 even AECB, although from time to time it does tell AECL what to do.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The nuclear club is a very small club. It is almost
					 like a religion subscribing to a particular world view. Anyone who does not
					 share the basic presuppositions about the wonders and benefits of nuclear
					 energy can never become a member of the club.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The member for Halton said that it was best to leave it
					 up to the people who know how to do it. He asked why they would want to leave
					 such a question up to us. That is a fair question. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not claim to be a nuclear scientist or physicist,
					 but there are experts in the field who are not tied to the industry. There are
					 people in academia and NGOs that know a lot about the subject. They are trained
					 in the same way the people in the industry are trained. They would be capable
					 of rendering an independent decision while participating in a collective
					 judgment made at a table at which they and members of the industry were
					 present. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That sort of thing was recommended by the Seaborn panel
					 but it is not in Bill C-27. Instead there is the same closed little circle of
					 so-called expertise tainted by vested interest.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point made by the member for Halton was the
					 concern he had that there was a provision in the bill for third party funding
					 in the financing of waste management costs. He was worried that the loophole
					 might be an opportunity for a subsidy. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I actually started to listen with some sympathy to what
					 he was saying at that point in his speech. I felt he had the narrative sort of
					 wrong up until then, but when he talked about subsidy and the need for us to
					 know the full costs of particular energy options he made a lot of
					 sense.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the things that is wrong with our economy and
					 that has all kinds of environmental and social consequences is that we
					 externalize the costs of various ways of doing things instead of internalizing
					 them and having them built into the price of things. That sounds to me like a
					 market argument, yet when it comes to something like energy we do not have a
					 market. We have all kinds of hidden subsidies. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the greatest acts of subsidy, that is the
					 subsidy to the nuclear industry that has taken place over the years in Canadian
					 society, has not always been that hidden. In some cases it has been right out
					 front.</p>


	<A NAME="T1525"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1525"><!-- Hour: 3--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1530"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1520"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1525)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The member for Halton used the figure of $16.2 billion.
					 He was worried about there being the opportunity for further subsidy, and I
					 think that is a legitimate worry. I commend him for that worry because we need
					 to be aware of and take into account the full costs of the way we do things,
					 particularly the full environmental costs, not only with respect to the nuclear
					 energy option but also with respect to other energy options.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, the damage that is done to highways, the
					 atmosphere, the safety of the travelling public and the tremendous overreliance
					 on trucks instead of trains is a cost borne by society and government through
					 road construction and repair. It will be borne by everyone in terms of health
					 care and other environmentally related costs in the future, thanks to the
					 greenhouse gas effect, et cetera. These are not costs that are figured into the
					 cost that we pretend is associated with a particular energy option.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The member from the Alliance talked about the fact that
					 our nuclear establishments were potential targets of terrorism. Unfortunately
					 this is true. However, even more unfortunate, this is something that people who
					 have been against nuclear energy have been saying since the beginning of this
					 industry. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having nuclear reactors and nuclear waste is much more
					 dangerous in terms of potential terrorism attacks or political and social
					 instability and everything that goes with it than having hydro dams, coal
					 plants, natural gas plants, solar power, wind power or whatever the case may
					 be. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is something qualitatively different here. There
					 is an infinite qualitative difference between the danger of nuclear waste and
					 nuclear reactors if they were to be damaged and the damage that can be done by
					 other energy sources, other energy factories or whatever, should they be the
					 object of attack.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I say to the hon. member from the Alliance that it is a
					 real concern, but it is a concern that has been raised for decades by opponents
					 of nuclear energy. They have said it is a mistake to assume that the world
					 would be exactly like it is today. We should plan our energy options,
					 particularly when we are taking account of various risks, not on the basis of
					 some sanguine view of the universe but with some account being taken of various
					 worst case scenarios. That has not been done and that is why we are in the
					 position we find ourselves in today. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Someone said that even if we stopped producing nuclear
					 power today and shut down all the reactors we would still have to deal with the
					 problem of nuclear waste. I agree. We still have all kinds of nuclear waste and
					 we have to decide what to do with it. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am not trying to argue for the status quo. There is
					 an opportunity for Canada, and this is the sense in which I regret the
					 dismantling of the Whiteshell research nuclear establishment at Pinawa.
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is all kinds of work to be done on the question
					 of how to deal with high level and low level nuclear waste. It should be done
					 in a way that does not contain within it all this conflict of interest. There
					 is work to be done in determining how best to decommission nuclear reactors
					 because there will be reactors that will need to be decommissioned. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whether or not we choose to build new ones, we have a
					 lot of old ones around that will not last forever. In terms of the people who
					 are interested or who have already had their training in nuclear related
					 technologies, it is not as if there is nothing to do.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not as if there is not some worthwhile task out
					 there. It is not as if their raison d'être should depend on the making and
					 marketing of more Candu reactors. There is a generation of work to be done by
					 people who know something about this field in figuring out what to do with the
					 waste, how to decommission reactors, and for that matter, improving and
					 enhancing some of the useful ways in which nuclear science can be used for
					 various medically related purposes and other purposes.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is only second reading, and we hope against hope,
					 we hope for things unseen, we hope for things never seen in this place, we hope
					 that finally this conflict of interest will be seen for what it is and that the
					 government will adopt the recommendations of its own panel and try to set up a
					 more independent, arm's length agency to deal with the question of nuclear
					 waste. Or is it, as I suspected back in 1979, a fait accompli from the
					 beginning, all this process, 22 years of process to arrive at exactly where the
					 Liberal minister of energy at the time thought the thing would end up in the
					 first place.</p>

			<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House resumed from September 26 consideration of the
			 motion that Bill C-33, an act respecting the
			 water resources of Nunavut and the Nunavut Surface Rights Tribunal and to make
			 consequential amendments to other acts, be read the second time and
			 referred to a committee.</p>


	<A NAME="Int-52823"></A><a HREF="#Int-52915"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-52819"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Ms. Nancy Karetak-Lindell (Nunavut,
					 Lib.): </b>

	Madam Speaker, yesterday I talked a bit about the
					 certainty that Bill C-33 would provide for Nunavut so I will carry on from
					 there.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This proposed legislation would also provide certainty
					 for industry. For example, it would set out clear ground rules for the issuing
					 of water licences and for the enforcement of licence conditions. The
					 legislation would also ensure that resource developers have access to lands for
					 the purpose of exercising their subsurface rights.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anyone who is familiar with the resource industry will
					 understand that clear and consistent rules of the game are essential for
					 projects to go forward. No company will invest in a multimillion dollar project
					 if there is genuine concern about the validity or conditions of a needed water
					 licence. No company will consider a development opportunity if it is not
					 guaranteed reasonable and affordable access to the site. Bill C-33 addresses
					 these and other issues of stability and certainty that are important to
					 industry.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Nunavut land claims agreement has clarified the
					 Inuit position about who owns the land and resources in the eastern Arctic.
					 What we need now is a certain and consistent resource management regime of
					 which water management and surface rights are a key element. This certainty is
					 critical if the new territory is to take advantage of its resource development
					 potential.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a region where unemployment is a longstanding
					 challenge and where an ever growing number of young people are looking for
					 work, we must do everything possible to support sustainable development and job
					 creation. It is worth noting that the three existing mines in Nunavut are
					 nearing the end of their economic life. Further exploration and development
					 would be welcome in Nunavut and it would be encouraged and facilitated by this
					 legislation.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However Bill C-33 would do more than provide a secure
					 base for economic activity. For example, Bill C-33 would give the surface
					 rights tribunal the power to award compensation for loss of income resulting
					 from damages to wildlife or to wildlife harvesting equipment caused by
					 development activities. As well, the Nunavut water board would not be allowed
					 to issue, renew or amend a water use or waste deposit licence that may
					 substantially affect waters that flow through Inuit owned land unless a
					 compensation package is in place.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill C-33 also addresses a land claims commitment to
					 name an individual or fund that would be held liable for damages to wildlife
					 from marine activities. This issue must be addressed in order to protect the
					 interests of government and taxpayers as well as to provide guarantees to Inuit
					 harvesters.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill C-33 will provide another important element of
					 certainty, the certainty that the residents of Nunavut will be heard on issues
					 related to water, the environment and their communities.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The proposed legislation would stipulate that a minimum
					 number of members of the surface rights tribunal must live in Nunavut. As well,
					 four of the eight members of the Nunavut water board are to be nominated by
					 Nunavut Tunngavik Incorporated, which represents the Inuit under their land
					 claims agreement.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to remind my hon. colleagues that we are
					 not being asked to invent new institutions of government in Nunavut.
					 Preliminary versions of the water board and the surface rights tribunal were
					 established through the Nunavut land claims agreement and are performing the
					 functions set out in the Nunavut land claims agreement. Both institutions are
					 modelled on existing regimes that are working well in other parts of
					 Canada.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What we are being asked to do is ensure that these
					 institutions have the full backing of federal legislation, and in the case of
					 the water board, the backing of federal regulations. This is absolutely
					 essential if they are to do their jobs as envisioned in the land claims
					 agreement.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We already went through a summer of uncertainty where
					 the licence issued to the town of Iqualuit was questioned, the validity
					 disputed and the authority of the board undermined by the lack of
					 clarity.</p>


	<A NAME="T1540"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1540"><!-- Hour: 3--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1545"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1535"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1540)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are also being asked to ensure that the country
					 lives up to commitments that have been made to the Inuit. Meeting Canada's
					 obligation to aboriginal people is an underlying principle of Gathering
					 Strength--Canada's Aboriginal Action Plan, an objective that must be supported
					 by all hon. members. In this regard Bill C-33 is the fair and right thing to do
					 and it is long overdue.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In closing I would urge hon. members to give careful
					 consideration to Bill C-33. This is clearly an important piece of legislation
					 for the people of Nunavut. It should be sent to committee for review as soon as
					 possible.</p>

					 PC/DR): </b>

	Mr. Speaker, I rise on a question of privilege about
					 something that has happened over the last several days which I believe has
					 truly infringed on my responsibilities as a member of parliament, and also
					 affects the constituents of Edmonton North who have corresponded with me over
					 the years.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a pretty serious issue. When this saga began on
					 Monday, I really did not think there was a serious problem. My assistant logged
					 on to her computer, as would be a normal thing to do on a Monday, but
					 discovered that she could not access our computer which is of course what she
					 does every day. When she phoned the House information services people to find
					 out what the problem was with the computer, she was informed that my computer S
					 and U drives had been shut down, frozen by the Canadian Alliance. I could
					 hardly believe it, but I continued to check it.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is now Thursday afternoon and we have lost an entire
					 business week. My entire computer system has been frozen and shut down with a
					 number of files on it with my contacts, correspondence and files with my
					 constituents.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we located where the files actually were and dug
					 deeper into it, we discovered that when I was serving as the Leader of the
					 Official Opposition on an interim basis from March until September 2000, the
					 server was allocated to the Leader of the Opposition office by the House of
					 Commons. While I was serving as the leader on an interim basis, that was the
					 server through the House of Commons information services.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course the question is why was I not taken off that
					 server over a year ago? Obviously it was not done by whoever was supposed to do
					 it and my office has just continued on in my capacity as the member of
					 parliament for Edmonton North. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My correspondence and files on the computer disappeared
					 on Monday. The S and U drives were completely frozen. Evidently we understood
					 in the ensuing days this week that the Alliance whip's office wanted to go
					 through all the files. We checked that out further. A representative from the
					 House of Commons planning and communications department, with whom we checked
					 about this, said to my staff, “The two sides will work it out. We won't release
					 any information until both sides agree on a decision and then issue a joint
					 directive”, which sounds very sensible to me. “You folks work it out and then
					 come and see me, and I can release this information”.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yesterday afternoon the Alliance whip staff member said
					 to my assistant at a retirement pizza party, and let us make sure that it was a
					 fairly informal gathering, “Let's get together and go over these files and then
					 I will decide what can be released and what cannot”. My assistant said, “This
					 is our computer, our constituents files and correspondence”. There were years
					 worth of stuff in there, and my assistant said, “No, I do not think it is any
					 of your business. This is our computer and we will just carry on so no, I am
					 not interested in doing that”. She brought that to my attention.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have spent almost the entire day on this. As far as
					 I understand from various people, the staffer then checked with information
					 services and legal counsel and said that I, as the member of parliament, had
					 declined the invitation to review the files with him and that he was coming to
					 look at them, that in effect he had been given the okay, that it was all right
					 for him and I had just been assumed to have said, “Sure. Go ahead”, when in
					 fact nothing of the sort had been offered. He then was given permission and
					 access to my files to go through them with no negotiation and no representation
					 from my office, either me or one of my staff members.</p>


	<A NAME="T1550"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1550"><!-- Hour: 3--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1555"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1545"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1550)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just as an aside, let me say that when I finished my
					 role as the caucus chairman in April, in the spring of 2001, I turned over a
					 physical filing cabinet full of stuff to the new caucus chairman of the
					 Alliance, the member for Langley--Abbotsford, as well as all of the disks with
					 all of the caucus minutes since 1993. I certainly have nothing to hide. Any
					 correspondence that the staff member may have looked through today certainly is
					 not very exciting, I can assure him. Of course if that is my privacy, there is
					 an incredible invasion there. I think all members need to be aware of
					 that.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I just said, I have nothing to hide. The information
					 has been gone over now. He was given full access to it earlier today without
					 any negotiation or any okay or representation from my staff. This is about the
					 privacy of my files, the privacy of my correspondence with constituents and the
					 sanctity of those files wherein constituents have asked me to represent them in
					 terms of tax issues, immigration issues, and national defence issues. I have an
					 incredible amount of information on those issues which I and every member in
					 the House would assume would be safe and the sanctity of which would be
					 paramount.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nobody from anywhere contacted me about proceeding with
					 a review of all the files on my computer. I was not contacted. I made some
					 inquiries late this afternoon. I have been working on this. I arrived here at
					 6.35 this morning and received a phone call some time after that from someone
					 who was concerned about it. It has not only consumed the entire day but the
					 entire week, effectively a week where my assistant has been completely frozen
					 from her computer system. It is unbelievable.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The main concern is that House officials never
					 contacted me about proceeding. They took it on a staffer's word that I declined
					 so it was okay. “She declined the invitation so let us go through the files”.
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must also guard against this happening to any other
					 member in the House ever again. I am sure all of my colleagues would agree with
					 me. Tories have crossed the floor to the Liberals and Liberals have gone to the
					 Bloc over the years, and their files go with them. I am astounded that this has
					 happened.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Legal Counsel, Rob Walsh, said to me before
					 question period at about 1.50 that he thought it had been cleared up by 7.30
					 this morning. I told him we still did not have a computer. I will read a memo
					 that I received at 2.37 from the whip staffer:</p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td><small>I have just contacted Information
						  Services and instructed them to release all your files on the S &amp; U drives
						  with the exception of documents that relate solely to the Canadian Alliance
						  Caucus. </small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fair enough. In fact they had all of them in a filing
					 cabinet that I had turned over in April.</p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td><small>These files are old caucus agendas,
						  Alliance staff and MP lists and organizational charts for the OLO.</small></td>

</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course those very things would be in a physical
					 filing cabinet.</p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td><small>These files have been temporarily
						  stored in a folder where only I have access and are stored as “read only” so
						  that they cannot be altered. If you are satisfied with my above explanation as
						  to the files that remain in our possession, then I will instruct Information
						  Services to delete these files. If there is some doubt, I will hold onto them
						  until that doubt is removed. I trust this is satisfactory.</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact it raises an unbelievable number of questions,
					 Mr. Speaker, questions which I think you as the chief of the precinct here need
					 to answer. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first question is who initiated this and when and
					 why? I served as the Leader of the Opposition on an interim basis until over
					 one year ago. Who initiated this and when? </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, why was I not informed, either verbally or in
					 writing, of this decision for someone to paw through my files when it was made?
					 There was no contact with my office whatsoever.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, who let them into those files without any
					 negotiation or any knowledge on my part?</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourth, how do I know which files were removed? It is
					 one thing to say that everything is cool and here we are. I cannot even get
					 into those files and the S and U drives to find out what might be missing or
					 what might have been stored elsewhere.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fifth, how do I know that they will not exercise the
					 same privilege in my office? I think of all of us, no matter which party we
					 serve in, does someone somewhere have a master key and they can help themselves
					 to information? </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Speaker, you and I both know about the sanctity of
					 our files, the sanctity of our responsibilities and the sanctity of our own
					 private office space. I believe that has been breached.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, if they were just reading directory names, as
					 the assistant led us to believe, and they were just having a little look at the
					 directory names, how would they determine if it was in fact these caucus
					 documents as he referred to, lists, organizational charts, staff and MP lists?
					 It would almost seem that someone would have to enter that file. I am not sure
					 any of us could be guaranteed that all the files were not entered.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Speaker, as upset as I could be over this, I can
					 assure you that I have constituents who have asked me to look into some very
					 serious matters on their behalf. They do not know where these things are now. I
					 am not sure they would be impressed that somebody somewhere, on somebody's
					 direction, with somebody not knowing about it was looking through their files.
					 I just do not think that is cool.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Speaker, I am asking you to look into this and to
					 answer the questions I have raised. Then of course there is the overarching
					 question of why it was that the House officials never even contacted me about
					 proceeding with reviewing my private files. We must also guard against this
					 happening again and ensure that it will never, ever happen again to anybody of
					 any party or any political stripe in this Chamber.</p>

					 George—Bulkley Valley, Canadian Alliance): </b>

	Mr. Speaker, I would like to respond to the question of
					 privilege brought forward by the member for Edmonton North.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Late Tuesday afternoon my office was contacted by the
					 office of the member for Edmonton North in regard to this situation.
					 Immediately after being informed, my staff contacted the House liaison officer
					 in the information services department to clarify both our rights and our
					 responsibilities.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As you can appreciate, Mr. Speaker, given the relative
					 newness of the information age, there was some confusion on the part of
					 information services as to how to proceed. My staff did, however, contact the
					 staff of the member for Edmonton North later that afternoon to say that we were
					 working on the matter with information services in an effort to satisfy the
					 security needs of the Canadian Alliance caucus as well as the needs of the
					 member for Edmonton North as it relates to her performance of her parliamentary
					 duties.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On Wednesday my staff also contacted the office of
					 legal counsel to further clarify our rights and responsibilities. It is the
					 opinion of legal counsel that we were well within our rights to ensure that all
					 information under the member's name which resides on the server under the sole
					 authority of the Canadian Alliance caucus and under the jurisdiction of the
					 whip, is in fact information to which she is entitled. My staff then discussed
					 with the member's staff a solution to ensure that both the needs of the member
					 and the needs of our caucus could be met in a timely fashion. That offer
					 unfortunately was not taken up by the staff member from the office of the
					 member for Edmonton North.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have no desire to deprive the member for Edmonton
					 North of information to which she is rightfully entitled. However, we must as
					 well be confident that our rights are not compromised in that process. We have
					 assured the member that we are more than willing to transfer all of the
					 information that is rightfully hers once we are sure the files do not contain
					 information to which she is no longer entitled by virtue of her expulsion from
					 the Canadian Alliance caucus.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To that end we have since received clarification from
					 the chief information officer and are now in the process of facilitating the
					 return of the appropriate files.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I trust, Mr. Speaker, you will find that my office has
					 acted not only in a responsible manner, but that we have done so with great
					 dispatch. Therefore, I respectfully submit that no question of privilege
					 exists.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, the issue is now the information is in the

					 made on the part of the Canadian Alliance to return the information.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The real issue that concerns all of us, and in
					 particular the hon. member for Edmonton North, is the fact that she or a member
					 of her staff were not present when this selection of information, this
					 intellectual property that may have belonged to the Canadian Alliance and not
					 the hon. member for Edmonton North, took place.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I submit that very much infringed upon the hon.
					 member's privileges, to have that process take place without a representative
					 of hers present. This very much jeopardizes the security and the sanctity, as
					 she said, of this intellectual property. That is no different than if it was in
					 a tangible hard form, as if it was a piece of paper. The information on the
					 hard drive of the computer system was hers and hers alone. It should not have
					 been selectively pawed through by anyone without her presence and her okay.
					 That is where this issue becomes most serious.</p>

<tr valign="top">
<td><small>That the committee take note of the
						  crisis facing the agricultural industry.</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said: Madam Chairman, the issue we are dealing with
					 in agriculture is essentially comprised of two issues: first, the massive
					 drought that has occurred across the country this year; and second, the ongoing
					 low commodity prices, particularly in the grains and oilseeds area. There has
					 been some increase in those prices, but the problem continues. With the
					 drought, the farmers do not have the grains and oilseeds to sell to take
					 advantage of some price increases, which we may hear about later on in the
					 debate.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canadian farmers from coast to coast are suffering from
					 these drought conditions. I believe that the government, the cabinet and the
					 agriculture minister are continuing to ignore the needs of farm families and
					 rural Canada. This is not in the national interest. Agriculture is far too
					 important in these troubled times to have our food supply in jeopardy.
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Liberal agriculture minister refused to acknowledge
					 the depths of the ongoing farm income crisis and the exasperating impact of the
					 drought. In regard to safety nets, CP Wire spoke to the agriculture minister.
					 He was of the opinion that he still needed to know how the existing disaster
					 assistance programs were working before committing more funds.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know the agriculture minister is interested in the
					 debate and I hope he will participate in it. I know he does have a concern for
					 farmers and this issue. As a matter of fact I see that he is here. However I am
					 concerned that he may not be getting enough feedback from members of parliament
					 and the different constituencies to bring home to him and his cabinet
					 colleagues the seriousness of the issue with which we are dealing.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Initiating the debate is part of the Canadian Alliance
					 promise to farmers over the summer that agriculture would be before parliament.
					 When the drought came along that promise was even more important. I am pleased
					 that this has come before the committee of the whole. This is in addition to
					 the serious issue of terrorism with which we are dealing.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Canadian Alliance member for
					 Saskatoon--Rosetown--Biggar is unable to be here. She is in the maritimes
					 talking to farmers and others with regard to agriculture and family issues. The
					 member certainly wants her farmers to know that their message is getting across
					 in parliament.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last year was eighth driest for southern Alberta since
					 weather records began in 1886. Between April and August there was only 50
					 millimetres of rain. In Saskatchewan it was similar. In Ontario there were
					 reports from the Waterloo airport that it had been the driest year since
					 records were kept some 30 years ago. The drought is having a massive
					 compounding effect across the country.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As all member know, Prince Edward Island has a big
					 potato industry. It is the source of the majority of potatoes for the Cavendish
					 Farms and McCain Foods processing factories. These companies have had to import
					 potatoes because there is an insufficient supply of potatoes in Prince Edward
					 Island. This is the seriousness of this problem.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Grains and oilseeds are a special case. The safety net
					 programs, the Canadian farm income program, the crop insurance program and the
					 NISA program are not working for the grains and oilseeds sector. That is why
					 this is still a crisis as opposed to an issue that can be dealt with through
					 routine government action. I will go into the history of that in a few
					 minutes</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Grain growers, who comprise corn, soybean, durum, grain
					 and canola, estimate that the grains and oilseed impact is at least $2 billion
					 this year. The Saskatchewan party has been out front on these issues. It has
					 indicated that there will be as much as $770 million worth of hurt in
					 Saskatchewan alone. I note that the provincial agriculture minister has talked
					 about needing $200 million in additional federal funding just for the crop
					 insurance program.</p>


	<A NAME="T1610"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1610"><!-- Hour: 4--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1615"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1605"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1610)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I referred to how the government dealt with safety net
					 programs over the years. I recall that back in 1998, during September, October,
					 November and part of December, the government and agricultural minister said
					 that the safety net programs were sufficient. At that time, there was the crop
					 insurance program, the NISA program, along with the companion programs. All the
					 agriculture industry, including myself, the opposition members and the farmers
					 were saying that those safety net programs would not be sufficient to deal with
					 the crisis. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the hog market fell out in those years, the
					 government began to move and brought in the Agriculture Income Disaster
					 Assistance, AIDA. That program worked pretty well for the hog producers, but it
					 left out the massive problem with the grain and oilseed sector. To this day
					 that has still not been addressed. The alfalfa dehydrators were also left out
					 of that program. Again, this impacted not only farm families, it also impacted
					 on the towns and communities in which they were located. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Standing Committee on Agriculture and Agri-food
					 produced a report in December 1999, after hearing from farmers about the income
					 crisis and the effectiveness of the safety net programs. The reason that it had
					 to be studied again by the standing committee, even though the AIDA program was
					 already in place and operating, was the farmers found that the program was a
					 disaster and did not address the needs. We had a deficient program in
					 place.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In February 2000 the Standing Committee on Agriculture
					 and Agri-food presented a report to the House and the government. There were
					 seven recommendations from the chair of that committee and the Liberal members,
					 including eight recommendations from the official opposition. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which of the recommendations has the government
					 actually implemented? Has it made the AIDA program efficient and effective so
					 that it will work for this massive drought? That will be addressed under the
					 Canadian farm income program, which is the replacement for AIDA. I look forward
					 to the minister substantiating that it is an effective program and that it will
					 work well. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bob Friesen of the Canadian Federation of Agriculture,
					 Kevin Maxlow of the Grain Growers of Canada and many other farm organizations
					 have said that the CFIP program does not address the needs of the grain and
					 oilseeds sectors. As a result we have massive problems. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cattle industry's has had to sell its livestock
					 twice in one year because farmers do not have the feed to carry those calves
					 over the winter, which they normally would do. The minister has to look at
					 extending the one year tax deferral to a two or three year deferral as
					 required.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We need to address this issue now because
					 climatologists have indicated that the drought, which has been in place in
					 southern Alberta and Saskatchewan for at least two years, could well continue
					 on for another two or three years. We have to have effective safety net
					 programs and other government programs in place to take care of
					 this.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other members will speak extensively about solutions to
					 this. Many of the solutions are not direct subsidies by the government. Rather,
					 our members will deal with grain transportation which should be modernized. It
					 is still highly regulated with most of the control within the Canadian Wheat
					 Board.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We also have the issue of the Canadian Wheat Board and
					 farmers not being allowed to market their own grain. In Ontario farmers market
					 their grain. In Manitoba, Saskatchewan and Alberta we are treated like little
					 children. We are not allowed to market our grain. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, in addition to the farmers' request for an
					 actual cash subsidy, I am advancing from the Canadian Alliance Party that many
					 other things could be done by the government to help these farmers through this
					 crisis and to help all of Canada, including those in small towns.</p>

	Madam Chairman, I thank the House for the opportunity
					 to make some comments. Unfortunately I will not be able to remain for all of
					 the debate, but I can tell members that I have staff and other members who will
					 be monitoring the debate. I look forward to the comments that will be made by
					 all hon. members today.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The drought situation is almost over in Canada. However
					 the hon. member pointed out there are some predictions that some areas may
					 continue in a drought situation. This has been one of the most severe drought
					 situations on a coast to coast basis that Canada has had for many decades. It
					 has seriously affected the income of many producers, but its severity has been
					 markedly different in other parts of the country.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Southern Alberta, Saskatchewan, Ontario, Nova Scotia,
					 New Brunswick and Prince Edward Island have all been hit by the drought. The
					 drought was not as prevalent the further we go east in Saskatchewan as it was
					 in the western part of the province. I am not making light of the severity when
					 I mention this, but I spoke to one producer this week from eastern Saskatchewan
					 who said that he had better than average crops this year. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As members are aware, I am from Prince Edward County
					 which is halfway between Ottawa and Toronto. If members look in the drought
					 package I sent out last week they will see one orange spot in the province of
					 Ontario. This orange spot represents the area that has received the least
					 moisture, and that happens to be my riding. The same riding that was the
					 coldest and wettest in Ontario last year is the driest and the hottest this
					 year.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There were also drought areas in British Columbia,
					 Quebec and Newfoundland. The main concern in the province of Manitoba was that
					 there was too much water. In some areas of the country there were above normal
					 crops. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since agriculture is without question the single most
					 important industry in Canada it deserves and demands as many protective
					 measures as we can collectively put in place as individual producers, as
					 industry sectors, as provincial governments and as the federal government to do
					 all we can when Mother Nature takes the upper hand.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are a number of safety net measures and programs
					 in place to help alleviate losses. I repeat again there is nothing as good as a
					 good crop and a good price. However we need to work as hard as we possibly can
					 to get to that point.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government will continue to monitor the situation.
					 All of the harvest is not lost. I know if I say that some people will say they
					 know a producer who did not have anything to harvest. That unfortunately is the
					 situation with the individual, and we recognize that. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the last few years we have worked in conjunction
					 with the industry and the provinces to make our programs as flexible as they
					 possibly can be to help farmers manage these situations. The system is more
					 flexible compared to what it was a few years ago. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not need to go into the reasons for putting our
					 fiscal house in order. Where would we be today if we were still running a $42
					 billion a year deficit? Any action that we have been able to take in the past
					 and even consider for the future would simply not be in the cards. As a result
					 of unfortunate incidents in the last couple of weeks we may have expenditures
					 in that area as well.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a result of an agreement with my provincial
					 colleagues a couple of summers ago, $5.5 billion is available in safety nets
					 over three years. That includes the period that I call crop year 2002 for such
					 programs as crop insurance, the net income stabilization account, the Canadian
					 farm income program and fall cash advances, to name a few.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will continue to monitor what we have done. Over the
					 last year or so we have made the availability of NISA accounts much more
					 flexible for producers. Producers asked for this and we were able to react to
					 that. If producers were to ask for an interim withdrawal right now, we can
					 assure them that they would have money in their hands in 30 days. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know the hon. member made some valid points regarding
					 the Canadian farm income program. It is more effective and has proven to be
					 more effective for livestock or a situation where the returns in the market
					 have been fairly high and then dropped off the table. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In reference to Saskatchewan, I must remind the hon.
					 member that the AIDA and CFIP have put hundreds of millions of dollars into
					 that province. Would we like to put more money in all of the provinces? Yes.
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The province of Saskatchewan received considerable more
					 money than any other province. Did all provinces get sufficient money from that
					 to make them as economically sustainable as they would like to be? I understand
					 that may not have been the case.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tens of thousands of farmers received support.
					 Applications are now being accepted for the CFIP 2001 crop business year. These
					 are interim applications. I have seen the form which is very simple and can be
					 filled out very quickly. We can turn those around in 30 days. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am pleased that more farmers who have crops on more
					 acreage are covered with crop insurance this year than ever before. I am
					 however disappointed that more farmers do not buy crop insurance. I understand
					 that some farmers have made the business decision to take the risk on their
					 own. For whatever reason, they were not totally happy with the insurance
					 program for their commodity, or whatever it was, and chose to take that risk on
					 their own. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our estimates of a couple of months ago, before the
					 severity of the drought continued, were that crop insurance payments to farmers
					 this year would probably be between at least $1.1 billion and $1.4 billion. The
					 average over the last five years has been less than a third of that.
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The farmers, the provincial governments and the federal
					 government make contributions to the premiums. When one deducts the total
					 contributions to the premiums of about $200 million from the $1.1 billion to
					 $1.4 billion, it still indicates our estimate of the crop insurance payments we
					 will be providing to farmers this year which will probably exceed $1
					 billion.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the province of Saskatchewan alone it is estimated
					 that farm income will be down to about $700 plus million. It is estimated that
					 crop insurance in Saskatchewan this year will likely provide to farmers
					 somewhere between $500 million to $800 million in crop insurance
					 payments.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The programs are there. Could crop insurance be better?
					 We had discussions with ministers and members of the industry in the west as I
					 toured western Canada this summer. We will work with them to strengthen those
					 programs to make them more enticing to producers so that their best business
					 decision is to buy rather than not to buy. I think that is
					 important.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we put all of this together our estimate of the
					 federal and provincial government program payments to farmers this year for
					 crop insurance will be at least $4 billion. We anticipate farmers will draw
					 from NISA, which is not the only eligible program; the Canadian farm income
					 program; and other programs. These are moneys they will not have to pay
					 back.</p>

				  </b>

	Madam Chairman, if I could have a couple of minutes I
					 believe that along with the continuing and expeditious review of the safety net
					 programs, crop insurance, NISA, et cetera, we need to look at the long range
					 approach that we take to the industry.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We know, for example, that there are concerns in our
					 industry and in society that were not there a few years ago. I am not saying
					 producers are not doing a good job. It is like a lot of other things. We have
					 to reassure and strengthen it in terms of farm food safety and the environment.
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can we help our industry brand our food products in
					 Canada so that when people around the world think of Canada they think of what
					 we are already building from? We have a leg up on many other countries in the
					 world as far as our reputation is concerned. We need to continue to work on it.
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I assure the House that in doing so we cannot diminish
					 or take away from that. We need to build a stronger basic safety net program
					 with the provinces. I am encouraged by the comments and the efforts of the
					 provincial and territorial ministers in Whitehorse at the federal-provincial
					 conference this summer when there was unanimous consent to go in that
					 direction.</p>


	<A NAME="Int-52866"></A><a HREF="#Int-52872"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-52862"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Rick Borotsik (Brandon—Souris,
					 PC/DR): </b>

	Madam Chairman, I certainly thank the minister of
					 agriculture for being here this evening and putting forward his points on
					 agriculture. I also thank the member for Selkirk--Interlake for allowing us to
					 debate what I consider and what I have always considered to be a very important
					 issue not only in my constituency in western Canada but throughout this great
					 country. Certainly the agriculture industry is extremely important to each and
					 every one of us.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not want the minister to take this the wrong way,
					 as I do not believe it is his fault, but it seems that ever since he has held
					 the position of agriculture minister everything with agriculture that could go
					 wrong seems to have gone wrong. As I said, I am not suggesting there be a
					 change but that is perhaps one way of trying to get agriculture back on the
					 rails.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However there have been severe problems within
					 agriculture. First there was the ice storm and then there was a commodity
					 crisis. We have had crisis in the tank for the last six or seven years. In 1999
					 in my area we had a situation of excessive rain. We had the Red River Valley
					 flood in 1997. This year we have a drought across the entire nation. I
					 obviously cannot blame the minister for the weather, but it seems we have never
					 had a circumstance where we could get back to where agriculture should have
					 been which is back in 1995 when we had excellent commodity prices and
					 agriculture was actually in fairly good financial condition.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have been fighting this battle for only four years
					 and there are two areas in which I have been fighting. The first is for a long
					 term safety net program, something that farmers can depend on that has been put
					 into place that would allow them to see some light at the end of the tunnel,
					 perhaps a program similar to GRIP which was taken away from producers in 1995
					 and has not been replaced. It was replaced with an ad hoc program called AIDA
					 which has similarly been replaced with an ad hoc program called
					 CFIP.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second thing for which we have always fought and
					 have suggested should be in place in agriculture is a disaster program. We are
					 talking about a disaster program that could deal with droughts, with
					 extraordinary circumstances like ice storms and excessive moisture.
					 Unfortunately we have not had the opportunity to bring that back into place. We
					 have not had any direction from the government and certainly the minister
					 himself to try to put into place the necessary programs that would assist
					 agriculture.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are aware of the problems that now face agriculture.
					 We know right now that in the grains and oilseeds industry in particular it
					 stands to lose somewhere around $2 billion of its gross sales this year. That
					 is a huge amount of money considering that commodity prices right now are as
					 low as they have ever been. They are going up slightly right now but that is
					 probably because there is going to be less crop harvested.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The minister said that we should not to jump to
					 conclusions because not all of it has been harvested. The majority of my area
					 has been harvested and I can say that my area, probably better than any, has
					 good average crops. I will probably get a lot of phone calls and letters on
					 that one but we do have a good average.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However I am a little oasis in a sea of total drought.
					 Right now in western Canada we are looking at the possibility of a 14%
					 reduction in barley production, a 20% reduction in meat and a 28% reduction in
					 canola, which again would translate to about a $2 billion loss.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The minister talks about the programs that are in place
					 and always seems to say that they are sufficient, that we should look at the
					 problem and make sure the programs in place now take effect. The crop insurance
					 program that he spoke about will in fact probably put $1.1 billion to $1.4
					 billion back into the farm economy, but that is an insurance program that in
					 most cases does not cover the cost of production.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It does not cover the cost of the inputs that have to
					 go in to make that crop in the first place, sometimes 70% or 75% depending on
					 the area that the producer is in, but perhaps only 70% or 75% of their costs
					 will be recovered. That still leaves a loss. People cannot go through years and
					 years of losses without ultimately having some serious financial
					 implications.</p>


	<A NAME="T1630"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1630"><!-- Hour: 4--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1635"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1625"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1630)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The minister talked about NISA. Absolutely, what a
					 wonderful program, put in place I might add by a previous government that
					 understood agriculture, but a program nonetheless that is there to serve the
					 farmers. The problem is that the producers have been taking out of the NISA
					 program for so many years that there is not a lot left in the program. Some
					 producers who had some took it out over the last two years and now do not have
					 any more access to funds. The minister is right, it is a wonderful program, but
					 it has been used in a lot of cases to its maximum.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The minister talks about AIDA but not often, nor should
					 he because there are lot of problems with AIDA and we are still suffering a lot
					 of problems with that program.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The program that is in place now, CFIP, is not
					 sufficient to take us to the next step. The drought we are suffering this year
					 will take all of the funds that are in CFIP and more. Last year we had more
					 dollars for support to agriculture than we have this year but the problems this
					 year are much more serious than they were last year. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The minister must recognize that there has to be other
					 financial resources put into the budget for this crop year to enable the
					 producers to put in a crop next year.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to talk briefly about how Canadians see
					 agriculture. The minister has in his possession a report by Ekos polling that
					 was done for the department that says quite specifically that Canadians want to
					 assist agriculture. As a matter of fact the numbers I have are that 69% of
					 Canadians polled said that they would support more money going into
					 agriculture. Sixty per cent said that they would provide short term financing
					 to farmers in difficulty with no conditions placed on it. Seventy-two per cent
					 said that government should certainly try to do something to save the family
					 farm. Canadians themselves want the government to put into place a program that
					 will assist Canadians staying on the farm.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have before us a lot of serious issues. I agree with
					 the minister that there are priorities. My belief is that agriculture is the
					 top priority. We have a battle that we have to fight to make sure that message
					 is given to the cabinet. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have an issue right now with Air Canada, which we
					 will be debating next week, where in fact dollars will be going into the
					 airline industry. That is fair ball, but dollars must go into the agriculture
					 industry as well. As a matter of fact, 5,000 people have lost their jobs at Air
					 Canada. I feel for those people because there will not be a lot of opportunity
					 for them now or perhaps in the foreseeable future.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, just last year in the agricultural industry,
					 not just farming but those people who are actually dependent on agriculture,
					 somewhere in the neighbourhood of 34,600 people were displaced. That is a huge
					 number of people but we do not hear about them because they go quietly away.
					 Whether they be farmers who sell their farms and walk away or individuals who
					 were involved in the direct or indirect servicing to agriculture, they go away
					 without making much noise. We have not had a huge hue and cry about the fact
					 that we have lost 34,600 jobs in agriculture. This is huge.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We also have about $14 billion of our economy that goes
					 into agriculture from Canada to the United States. That is in jeopardy right
					 now because of what happened on September 11. We must make sure that the border
					 crossings are kept open, that the agricultural product that we produce in
					 Canada has an opportunity to access the market in the United States. That too
					 is the minister's responsibility. Not only is it his responsibility to keep the
					 farmers on the farm and to put into place the proper support systems that will
					 allow agriculture to survive, but he also has to make sure that farmers can
					 market their produce at a fair price.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I appreciate the fact that the minister is here. I know
					 that when he goes to the cabinet table he will fight for the same, if not a
					 better package for agriculture as others will to go to the cabinet table to
					 fight for Air Canada. That is all I an hope.</p>

				  </b>

	Madam Chairman, I am pleased to have the opportunity to
					 take part in the discussion on the situation with agriculture producers in
					 Canada. Those most deeply affected over the last number of months have been the
					 farmers in western Canada. All of us have been affected in some way, shape or
					 form, but certainly in Alberta, Saskatchewan and into Manitoba it has been an
					 extremely tough time over the last number of years. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Knowing that, I picked up notes from my colleague, the
					 agricultural critic, the member for Palliser, and noted the number of times we
					 have had discussions on agriculture in the last short while. We had an
					 emergency debate in February or March and we had discussions in March and April
					 but we do not seem to be able to come up with a proper program or plan to
					 assist farmers. I do not think anyone can.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have a serious problem in agriculture. All one has
					 to do is go out west and drive around the farms in some of those areas to see
					 what they are going through.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some farms, depending on where they are, are doing okay
					 but the majority are really feeling the pinch for a variety of reasons, a
					 number of which have been mentioned. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My colleague previous to me indicated that he hopes the
					 agriculture minister will go in and fight and do what he has to do. I hate to
					 say this but, quite frankly, we can only send the same fighter in so many
					 times. When he does not do the job, we have to give him the hook. If he is not
					 doing the job, we get him out of the way. He is not doing the job he is
					 supposed to be doing for farmers. He is not promoting the agriculture industry
					 in Canada.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. member: </b>He is on the ropes.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs. Bev Desjarlais</b>: If he was on the ropes we
					 would at least have a fighting chance. He is out of the ring. The problem has
					 come up time and again in the House over the last number of years and it is
					 still there but there seems to be no real plan to address it.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My colleague from Brandon--Souris mentioned the NISA
					 program. The NISA program did provide the support that was needed but that is
					 no longer the case. As the member indicated, it no longer works because it was
					 used too often. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We all have heard at some point about the AIDA program
					 which was there to help out during hard times. I heard much discussion going
					 back and forth, but when we are not critics in that particular area, we do not
					 always pay attention to every single thing that happens. We have so much to do
					 each day in our own critic areas and in the different committees we attend that
					 we can only to do the best we can in other areas. We do not always take
					 everything in. However, the one thing everyone in the House knows is that the
					 AIDA program was not working.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I never lived on a farm but I was around farming
					 communities all my life. I have family members who are farmers, and they have a
					 saying, as useless as tits on a bull. When something does not do the job it was
					 supposed to do, that is the saying a farmer uses. That is exactly what the AIDA
					 program was.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What we need see from the government is a dramatic
					 change in its efforts if it wants to address the problem with agriculture in
					 Canada, no ifs, ands or buts about it.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not okay to say that we are going to support
					 numerous other industries but to heck with agriculture. As a Canadian I am not
					 willing to have that happen and neither are the people in western Canada. We
					 want agriculture. We want the family farm. We want those things to be part of
					 Canadian culture but the government has been pulling the rug out from under
					 agriculture and not giving a helping hand when farmers need it.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to refer to some statements made by my
					 colleague, our agricultural critic. He said that following the 1993 election
					 the Liberals adopted the Reform Party's policy of slashing agriculture support
					 and shifting to an industry shaped entirely by market forces.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The European community was not willing to do that. It
					 said it wanted to protect its agricultural industry. It knew that to maintain
					 its farmers and their way of life it would need to give them support. The
					 European community would not cut subsidies as has happened here. The federal
					 Liberals did not need to cut as deeply as they did.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is room for Canada to give more support to
					 farmers without provoking WTO or NAFTA challenges. It can happen. Money can go
					 into farming without it becoming a cross-border issue. It is a red herring to
					 suggest it is not possible.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is not a huge amount of farming in my riding.
					 However because of the size of my riding, which is most of Manitoba's land
					 mass, there are some farms as well as pretty much every industry one can
					 imagine. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This summer was disappointing for farming areas in my
					 riding. Farmers tried to diversify as the government told them to do. They
					 invested more in cattle production and different types of farming. They
					 expected support from the government for infrastructure programs if, for
					 example, they had to fix their water supply. There were huge problems with the
					 water supply to farming areas. A good number of farming areas in the west do
					 not have water piped in to ensure a safe supply. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Projects had been started and an impression was given
					 that PFRA would be there to support farmers and give more funding. In the past
					 week one of my colleagues from the Alliance mentioned during question period
					 that the money was gone in a couple of days. That is the reality. There was
					 such a small amount of money in PFRA that it was not there to support farmers
					 who needed the assistance.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The municipality and the province had put money toward
					 a project to put in water lines and get them out to all the farms. Some were
					 done and the rest were supposed to follow but there was no money. We were not
					 talking about billions of dollars for the farmers. We were talking about a
					 couple of million dollars but they could not get it.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every time I see things come across my desk regarding
					 industries in eastern Canada getting dollars I get ticked off. Industries in
					 eastern Canada may not like hearing that, but quite frankly it is true.
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A good number of people in the west no longer feel they
					 are part of Canada. However there are those of us who will not say to heck with
					 Canada, pack it in and become another country. We are fighting to stay part of
					 Canada and make Canada recognize that it needs to treat all regions fairly. It
					 must give support to all of them and not just certain areas. That is the way it
					 must be.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I get darn annoyed when I see that happening. If the
					 government is to get people back onside it must recognize that we must be the
					 true nation we are and support each other from region to region in times of
					 need. Otherwise there will always be hard feelings.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my first campaign I was travelling around my riding
					 and someone in one of the smaller communities referred to Ontario as the middle
					 east. That was a classic. I have used it ever since. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I appreciate the work and the efforts of people in
					 Ontario and throughout the country. I was raised to appreciate every aspect of
					 the country. That is what we were taught in our schools. Quite frankly, the
					 government needs to go back to the classroom. It must learn that to build a
					 nation and keep it strong it must treat every region fairly. That needs to
					 happen with agricultural producers in western Canada and throughout the
					 country, or it will not work.</p>

					 Secretary to the Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food, Lib.):
				  </b>

	Madam Chairman, it is great to see members from all
					 areas of Canada take part in this most important debate. The latest speaker
					 spoke with passion.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will clarify what our programs at Agriculture and
					 Agri-Food Canada do and what they are invested in across the country. The AIDA
					 program that my colleagues have mentioned had room for improvement so we
					 improved it with a new program. Under the AIDA program more than $1.6 billion
					 was paid out. By far most of it went to the province of Saskatchewan which
					 certainly deserved it.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no denying the severity of the drought that
					 affected many parts of Canada this summer. Yet parts of Manitoba and B.C., in
					 an odd twist of irony, had too much rain. That is the business of farming.
					 Whether drought, disease or too much rain, there will invariably be
					 circumstances where farmers are unexpectedly faced with income declines beyond
					 their control.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no question that farming is a risky business.
					 That is why the government along with the provinces put in place the safety net
					 programs the hon. Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food outlined for us
					 today.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the three years leading up to the year 2002, crop
					 insurance programs such as the net income stabilization account and the Canada
					 farm income program will provide $5.5 billion in federal and provincial funding
					 to agriculture safety net programs and producers. These programs alone will pay
					 out $5.5 billion. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ensuring our producers remain viable is not just an
					 important component of any program or agricultural policy. It should be the
					 foundation, and it is. However we would be remiss if safety nets alone were the
					 extent of our agricultural policy. To better meet the challenges facing our
					 agricultural sector the government is developing a strategy to move the sector
					 beyond crisis management, as was said in the Speech from the Throne.
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The agricultural policy framework of which the hon.
					 minister spoke is an action plan for a comprehensive national agricultural
					 policy. It would take in the whole scope of agriculture and make Canada the
					 world leader in food safety, innovation and environmentally responsible
					 agriculture production. The new policy framework would not diminish the need
					 for effective safety net programs but build on the programs over the long
					 term.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the big factors driving agriculture today is the
					 consumer. Consumers around the globe are more sophisticated, knowledgeable and
					 discerning than ever before. Consumers are concerned about the food they eat
					 and how it is grown. They have concerns about the environment in which it is
					 produced. They are more particular about the kinds of food they eat.
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Competitors are building on this concern by using
					 technical issues such as barriers to trade. To be successful under these
					 circumstances we must brand Canada in terms of food safety, quality and the
					 environmentally responsible manner in which our products are grown and
					 produced.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The agricultural policy framework would involve
					 facilitating environmental management at the farm level. Being environmentally
					 responsible in our production would mean sustainable resources and more
					 investment in Canada. From a marketing perspective environmental planning is
					 important because consumers are demanding it.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The plan would build on Canada's reputation as a
					 producer of high quality, safe food by strengthening on farm food safety
					 systems. Our producers have asked for it and are investing in it, and we are
					 working with them. Safety and quality run through the entire food chain but it
					 must start at the root. It must start on the farm.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government will use science to help the sector
					 create economic opportunities with innovative new products. We will renew the
					 sector through programming for farmers that addresses their unique needs and
					 helps them adapt to change.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will look at management skills and practices, access
					 to capital and addressing the productivity of the land. Essentially that means
					 we will ensure we are providing the right tools, policies and programs to
					 support farmers. That is why the new policy would include a review of farm
					 safety nets. </p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This important work on the long term direction of the
					 sector will be undertaken in close consultation with the industry. By investing
					 in our producers and their ability to manage risks such as drought and consumer
					 demand we will help them thrive as leaders in innovation and growth.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canada is known around the world as a leader in food
					 safety and environmental performance. By being number one in these areas we
					 will use our position to influence international standards. Through the
					 branding of Canadian agricultural products we will capture new and premium
					 markets while maintaining existing ones. This is a long term comprehensive
					 policy that will put our producers front and centre in the global
					 marketplace.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As we have mentioned, the provinces and the federal
					 government are working together on this important front. The debate we are
					 having is part of this. We are glad the debate is happening and I look forward
					 to hearing more comments from my colleagues.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The week after next when the House is not sitting I
					 will attend a meeting in Toronto with the minister. The meeting is in Toronto
					 this time. It was in Quebec earlier in the year, then it was in Whitehorse, and
					 this time it will be in Ontario. Our minister and the ministers from each
					 province will be in attendance to work together and resolve some of these
					 challenges. I ask for and know I will get the support of members of the
					 House.</p>


	<A NAME="Int-52879"></A><a HREF="#Int-52883"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-52875"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Rick Casson (Lethbridge, Canadian
					 Alliance): </b>

	Madam Chairman, it is a pleasure to speak to this
					 issue. I thank the House for recognizing the importance of the crisis in
					 agriculture and allowing this debate to take place. The member for
					 Selkirk--Interlake, the critic for the Canadian Alliance, wanted to bring the
					 issue forward the day the House resumed but of course we were consumed with
					 other issues and wisely he chose to postpone it. As important as the issue is,
					 we realized that other issues had priority.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now that we are here I would like to quote some numbers
					 from a survey which the Canadian Alliance undertook through Praxicus. One
					 thousand people were randomly selected across Canada. Only six per cent, when
					 asked if they believed there was a crisis facing farmers, said that there was
					 not a crisis. The rest knew and believed that there is a crisis in agriculture.
					 That is important for the government to recognize.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When they were asked why they thought the farms were in
					 a crisis, 84% said it was poor weather conditions that hurt crop production and
					 high subsidies by EU and the U.S. Canadians have an idea of what the problems
					 are and 78% of Canadians think we should support our producers until we can
					 bring down those EU and U.S. subsidies.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am quickly going to run through some things we see as
					 problems that exist because of the drought. The historically low grain prices
					 and the EU subsidies have always been there. This is something we need to
					 address but I want to get into some of the things we feel have highlighted the
					 situation this year. Then, as an opposition party should, I will offer some
					 solutions and avenues the government can take to solve problem.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last year was the eighth driest year in southern
					 Alberta. My riding in southern Alberta has gone through the second consecutive
					 year of the most severe drought we have ever seen. The runoff from the
					 mountains is low. There were record low rainfalls. The water holes have dried
					 up. The prairie grass is gone. Cattle breeders and ranchers have faced the
					 worst situation they have ever had and are selling off their herds. This year
					 was the fifth driest on record in Saskatchewan. The water level is at a 30 year
					 low. In the Great Lakes region it was 26% less than normal. New Brunswick
					 usually gets 102 millimetres and it got 17.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us look at the impact on the livestock industry.
					 Producers are searching for water. The PFRA ran out of money early in the year
					 and could not help as many people as it had wished. It is hurting the cattle
					 ranchers in B.C., the prairies, Quebec, Ontario and the maritimes. Shallow
					 wells 30 metres deep are showing stress and need to be deepened. The PFRA says
					 that 95% of the surface water in southern Alberta has been depleted. Some
					 pastures may not bounce back for three years. Some say it will take as much as
					 10 years to bring back full productivity to prairie grasses. In New Brunswick,
					 ranchers and dairy farmers estimate forage crops will be down 30%. It goes on
					 and on. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The impact on the grain and oilseeds sector is
					 particularly hard because of the historic low returns they are experiencing. It
					 is compounded by the drought. I am sure my colleague from Grasslands in
					 Saskatchewan will highlight some of the problems they have had. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to put forward some solutions for the
					 government. We have heard from the minister that the money which has been paid
					 out is all there is going to be. The farmers and producers are saying it is not
					 enough. We would like to offer some other solutions. We feel that due to the
					 neglect of the government, our farmers need an immediate emergency cash
					 infusion. Because of the drought we have to put it into their hands
					 immediately.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second idea I have came from the grain growers
					 across Canada. The Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food should strike a
					 special measures committee as provided for under section 12 of the Farm Income
					 Protection Act to analyze the exceptional circumstances facing the grain and
					 oilseeds sector.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have talked about this idea with the minister and he
					 has indicated a willingness to work with us on it. Ranchers who must liquidate
					 their herds because of the drought can defer tax on the sale of some of their
					 breeding stock for one year. We would like to see that changed so that the
					 income deferral can take place until the grass is able to hold the cattle
					 again, which as we said may take up to 10 years.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must improve our existing safety net programs. We
					 hear a lot about that. We must ensure they meet the needs of
					 farmers.</p>


	<A NAME="T1655"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1655"><!-- Hour: 4--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1700"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1650"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1655)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The crop insurance program needs to be improved to
					 ensure that it covers all costs that producers incur in seeding their crops.
					 Regulations surrounding natural disasters must be amended to ensure that
					 farmers can receive compensation for their inputs lost due to natural
					 disasters. If this had been in place, farmers in southeastern Saskatchewan and
					 western Manitoba would have received some assistance back in 1998 for their
					 flood losses.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The NISA program must be made more accessible to
					 farmers in need. The calculation of NISA eligible costs should also be adjusted
					 to include grain transportation costs. That is an important issue. The grain
					 transportation system in western Canada is not working. When a farmer gets his
					 cheque for selling his grain, a quarter to a third of it comes off the top to
					 get that grain to market. Even if it does not move very far, it is a huge cost
					 to farmers and we need to do something about that.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We can reduce costs imposed on farmers by the federal
					 government. In the last election the Liberals campaigned on removing the excise
					 tax on farm fuel. That could be done tomorrow but there has been no will so far
					 to do it. User fees and taxes on inputs are issues that can be dealt with
					 immediately. We realize fighting the European and U.S. subsidies is a long term
					 goal, but some things can be done immediately to help the bottom line on the
					 farm.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We can encourage farmer driven value added processing.
					 The Canadian Wheat Board in western Canada has a marketing monopoly and is a
					 hindrance to value added industries coming into our area. One in particular is
					 the prairie pasta producers. They have tried to build pasta plants. They would
					 like to get the wheat board out of the system so they can get the grain at a
					 more reasonable price. That has not yet happened but could happen tomorrow with
					 the will of the government. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Give grain farmers a marketing choice. This is
					 something we have been raising here forever and ever. It is unbelievable. Some
					 people do not believe us when we tell them that we do not have our own
					 marketing options. We need that. A farmer should be able to sell his product
					 where and when he wants.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We can reduce farmers' costs by modernizing the grain
					 handling system which I have already touched on. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Canadian Alliance agriculture policy has been built
					 through continual consultation with farmers. We did a tour a year and a half or
					 two years ago. We went to 70 different meetings. We talked to 3,500 producers
					 face to face. We prepared the ASAP report which we tabled in the House. We gave
					 copies to the agriculture minister. We said that this was what the producers
					 were telling us, and those were the things that needed to be done. So far we
					 have had no action along those lines.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The big one I suppose is the continued erosion of the
					 income our producers face by the unfair European Union and U.S. subsidies. We
					 have to be very aggressive at the negotiating table to beat the
					 production-distorting subsidies down, so that there is not the flood on the
					 market, and so that a farmer can get a good return on his investment in his
					 crops. We have to keep that in mind with the WTO round coming up this fall. We
					 have to pursue that vigorously. We feel that is something that has not been
					 done in proper way.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those are my comments. Once again I thank the House for
					 this opportunity. As we said, there are other things gripping the nation and
					 the world right now, but if we are going to send our soldiers into war, we had
					 better be able to feed them.</p>

					 (Rural Development) (Federal Economic Development Initiative for Northern
					 Ontario), Lib.): </b>

	Madam Chairman, I appreciate having another opportunity
					 to talk about the issues of rural Canada. Today we are dealing with the
					 agricultural sector. We have been here on debate before and we talked about the
					 natural resource sector. We have had other opportunities for discussion. I am
					 pleased to see that opposition members and government members are trying to
					 seek solutions to deal with the issues that impact rural Canada.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the Secretary of State for Rural Development I have
					 the opportunity to deal with some of the key issues that those of us who
					 represent rural Canada deal with on an ongoing basis with our constituents. A
					 big part of what we are talking about as rural members of parliament, and many
					 of us in the Chamber right now are rural members of parliament, is to make sure
					 there is an understanding that a successful Canada and a strong Canada is a
					 Canada that has both of its component parts strong, that we have both a strong
					 urban and a strong rural Canada.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not an issue of one being strong at the expense
					 of the other, or taking an asset from one and giving it to the other. The
					 nation is strong when we have a strong urban and rural Canada. That is
					 something we need to work toward. The reality is that we want to make sure as a
					 government, and I am sure as all 301 members of parliament, whether they come
					 from urban or rural Canada, that our rural citizens have an opportunity to
					 access the wealth that is Canada, that we have an opportunity to share in
					 everything the country has to offer.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One reality we need to recognize is that when it comes
					 to rural Canada and rural Canadians, there are some structural differences from
					 those that exist in urban Canada. There are challenges that are faced by rural
					 Canada which are different from those that are faced by urban Canada. As we
					 have these discussions here in the House and as we develop legislation and
					 respond to the issues of the day, it is important for us to recognize those
					 different challenges and to develop public policy that takes them into
					 account.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What are those challenges? Some of them are fairly
					 straightforward and obvious. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Take the issue of geography in rural Canada. There is a
					 lot of geography in rural Canada. Many of us choose to live in rural Canada
					 because of that geography. What it means is that when it comes to delivering
					 programming, when it comes to delivering government services or private sector
					 services, there are thousands and thousands of square kilometres in which to
					 provide service and it is far more challenging than it may be in a tight
					 urbanized centre.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Take the issue of population density. One of those
					 structural realities is there is a low population density in rural Canada,
					 particularly compared to some of our large cities. That has very significant
					 ramifications. When we are trying to attract investment and trying to ensure
					 that we have the right kind of investment in infrastructure or trying to get
					 the investment into businesses, when there is low population densities, the
					 return somebody can obtain from those investments will oftentimes not be as
					 great and may be much more slow in coming than it would be in an urban centre.
					 It makes it a challenge to attract that kind of investment to a rural
					 area.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sometimes the public policy response for attracting
					 that investment has to be different. We need public-private partnerships.
					 Sometimes the private sector may make an investment on its own in a high
					 density urban area, but it may not be willing to make the same investment in a
					 rural area unless there is a public-private partnership. That is what I mean by
					 having a different public policy response in a rural area from what may be
					 suitable in an urban area.</p>


	<A NAME="T1705"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1705"><!-- Hour: 5--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1710"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1700"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1705)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To speak more directly to the issue of agriculture and
					 agriculture in rural Canada, one of the structural differences that exists in
					 rural areas is the fact that the economy is cyclical in nature. For the most
					 part rural Canada is a natural resource based economy whether it be forestry,
					 mining, fisheries or agriculture. It is a cyclical type of economy based on
					 fluctuating commodity prices.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An economy based that way is very different from many
					 of our urban economies which tend to be diversified. They tend to be
					 manufacturing or technology based. When there is a problem or a challenge in
					 one component part of that economy there are many other component parts that
					 can deal with it and ensure that on a macro basis the economy will continue to
					 move forward and be strong.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rural Canada has resource based economies which are
					 often single industry economies and cyclical in nature. We understand that
					 there is a need for a different public policy approach. As rural members from
					 all sides of the House we are saying that we need a different type of public
					 policy approach when dealing with rural Canada and its natural resource based
					 economies. That is very clear.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What kind of public policy tools do we as a government
					 respond with to deal with the cyclical nature of these economies? They will be
					 very different from the tools that could be found in an urban economy or a very
					 diversified economy. Those tools exist in the agricultural sector whether we
					 are talking about crop insurance, NISA, CFIP or spring advances. There is a
					 whole series of tools.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members of the opposition are suggesting that there can
					 be additional tools. We on the government side agree that the tools contained
					 in the agricultural sector ought to be enriched or enhanced. That is the kind
					 of discussion we are having here today. It is not an issue of those tools not
					 existing. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government has made a very strong response to the
					 public policy issues I talked about by ensuring that the tools are available.
					 However that does not mean the discussion should be over. We are having this
					 debate so we can talk about how we should strengthen those tools or how we
					 should add to them.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The previous speaker talked about consultations that
					 had taken place with rural residents. That is important. Many of my colleagues
					 are travelling across Canada this week as part of a task force developed for
					 members of the Liberal Party. They are talking to rural citizens about those
					 issues. I have established something I call rural dialogue. I do not mean rural
					 consultation but rural dialogue. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have taken the opportunity over the last two years to
					 talk to rural citizens, be they ones who operate in the agricultural sector,
					 the resource based sector or are simply part of the communities that support
					 those industries. They have told me about some of the issues we need to deal
					 with. In respect of that input we have been developing the tools I have talked
					 about and changing them as appropriate and creating new ones as
					 needed.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is important to recognize in terms of agriculture
					 the need to get away from simply having short term tools, as important and
					 necessary as they are, to having a long term vision for agriculture. That is
					 why I was so pleased this past June when I was in Yukon where all the
					 provincial ministers came together and agreed on a framework for long term
					 stability in the agricultural sector and the communities that depend on
					 it.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am pleased to have participated in this debate and
					 the discussion with all members of the House on the types of things we need to
					 do to ensure the long term sustainability of rural Canada.</p>

					 Hills—Grasslands, Canadian Alliance): </b>

	Madam Chairman, I begin by thanking you for allowing
					 this emergency debate to take place. Throughout the entire summer farmers
					 across the country have been dealing with one of the most severe droughts in
					 recent history. In other areas of Canada farmers have had too much rain. All in
					 all farmers have not been given the most ideal conditions within which to work.
					 However that is part of being a farmer. Some years are good; other years are
					 devastating.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My riding of Cypress Hills--Grasslands and the ridings
					 that border it, particularly those of Battlefords--Lloydminster,
					 Saskatoon--Rosetown--Biggar in Saskatchewan, and Medicine Hat and Lethbridge in
					 Alberta, have been hard hit by the drought this summer. My constituents in
					 southwestern Saskatchewan are mostly grain farmers and cattle ranchers, people
					 who live off the land and need to produce to make a living.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In southern Alberta producers are faced with a similar
					 situation. Ranchers do not have water for their cattle: farmers do not have
					 water for their crops.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This spring, as I looked out the window from a little
					 commuter plane between Medicine Hat and Calgary, it was interesting to see that
					 the grass never did green up in that area. It stayed dry and grey the entire
					 summer.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tough times are nothing new to farmers. Grain farmers
					 have been struggling with unstable commodity prices for many years. The present
					 low commodity prices in the grain and oilseed sector are due to the excessive
					 subsidies our competitors receive in the United States and overseas in Europe.
					 These subsidies cause overproduction and distortion in certain agricultural
					 commodities which drive down world prices.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Canada farmers are not fortunate enough to have the
					 strong backing of the federal Liberal government. For some reason the
					 government believes that if it weans producers off subsidies and leaves them on
					 their own they will become lean, mean, farming machines. However, in order to
					 run a viable farming operation and stay in business, producers must make or at
					 least have the opportunity to make money.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Farmers today are faced with an uphill battle and the
					 government should be there to support them. The agri-food industry in Canada is
					 the fifth largest industry in the country. It accounts for almost 8.5% of
					 Canada's gross domestic product. This $95 billion sector of the economy is not
					 insignificant and it is worth fighting for. One in seven jobs in Canada are
					 tied directly or indirectly to agriculture. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;United States wheat farmers receive 49% of their income
					 from subsidies, while their European counterparts receive 52% of their income
					 from the government. Our wheat farmers receive less than 13% support. At the
					 same time it is delivered to farmers in convoluted income support programs like
					 AIDA and CFIP. It take months and even years to process applications under
					 these programs and in the end they deny support to many farmers.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tonight we heard that Saskatchewan received a big
					 portion of that money but in fact 46% of the applications were denied and
					 rejected. That is not an indicator of a successful program.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a rather strange situation because farmers do not
					 want to be dependent on subsidies and the government does not want to give them
					 money. The ideal solution to our agriculture problems would be to reduce all
					 trade distorting subsidies internationally. The only way to remove foreign
					 subsidies is by negotiations through the World Trade Organization and NAFTA.
					 This is a long and arduous task and can take years to complete, especially when
					 players like the U.S. are now spending $20 billion a year in subsidies.
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must get moving in this regard. The agriculture
					 discussions have been delayed long enough. We need to have some results in that
					 area. The government does not have a choice on this issue. If it wants an
					 agriculture sector in the country it must be willing to support it. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Alliance has done some polling and released the
					 results early last week. Canadians across the country want to support farmers.
					 In that survey we saw that 78% of Canadians felt farmers should receive
					 subsidies to help them compete until farm subsidies in other nations are
					 lowered, even if it means subsidizing farmers for several years. Our poll of
					 both urban and rural areas does not leave anything to question, yet the
					 government still does not seem to get the point. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Livestock producers on the other hand have been fairly
					 fortunate over the last few years, but the drought this summer changed that
					 radically for them. As I mentioned, flying from Medicine Hat to Calgary the
					 land never did green up, but one of the more concerning things was that we
					 could watch the dugouts go dry. We could actually see from week to week as the
					 water level went down. A lot of them are now dry. </p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ranchers are resorting to hauling water and feed so
					 that they can hold on to their cattle. If they are unable to do that, often
					 they are forced to sell off part of their herd. Usually at times like this
					 ranchers would be able to work with the PFRA to find a new water source or to
					 install pipelines. However this year the budget for the PFRA was exhausted just
					 four days into the fiscal year and currently up to 500 projects in Saskatchewan
					 alone are on hold.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It appears that the priorities of the agriculture
					 department are out of step. Would not reallocating more financial resources to
					 the PFRA so that ranchers could find water be the logical thing to do during a
					 drought? Producers are being faced with so many challenges right now they do
					 not need the government to be another one as well.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few weeks ago I received a letter from a constituent
					 who operates a ranch in Maple Creek, Saskatchewan. He wrote:</p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td><small>My family has raised cattle in this
						  area since the 1880s. I've been associated with our operation over 30 years of
						  my adult life. Never before have I had no livestock feed to harvest. We have
						  had no irrigation or stock water releases in the 2001 season. Also, there has
						  been no production on our native pastures for the past two years.</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This livestock producer is not alone. There are many
					 people like him in my part of the world. When feed crops fail to yield
					 anything, ranchers have no recourse since they cannot effectively use crop
					 insurance. Instead they must compete with U.S. producers in buying feed at very
					 high prices.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One program ranchers can normally depend upon during
					 especially dry seasons is the income tax deferral program. This summer the
					 minister announced which regions of Canada would be eligible to use the
					 program. He announced that relatively early in the season. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However restrictions placed on the program prevent
					 producers from using it effectively. The tax deferral applies only to breeding
					 livestock that are a year or older. This summer many people were forced to sell
					 off their calves and feedlot owners were left in the dark
					 altogether.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tax deferral program is a relatively simple
					 program, however the restrictions that are placed on it do not help producers.
					 The government should open up the program to either more types of livestock or
					 it should extend the tax repayment period over three years, or extend the tax
					 repayment period until the land recovers.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government realizes that it cannot remain silent on
					 this issue. This drought could be the financial wall that will force many
					 producers into bankruptcy. For years farmers have struggled with an income
					 crisis and now they have a drought that has eliminated all production for many
					 of them.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government needs to discover a new commitment to
					 agriculture. I admit that we have some members on the government side who have
					 an interest in agriculture but the government in general has no heart for that
					 sector. Agriculture is important and we need to support it. We also need to
					 take a look at our spending and examine how it is taking place.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last spring our party called on the government to
					 allocate an additional $500 million in emergency aid to farmers. Rather than do
					 that the government's response was to appoint a task force. The task force went
					 around the country to meet and to discuss the same issues that were discussed
					 by the government for the last nine years. It will not have a report until a
					 year from now. That is not good enough. The government has been in power long
					 enough. It needs to figure out where to spend efficiently and effectively in
					 the agriculture sector.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I found it interesting that over the last few weeks we
					 heard about aircraft manufacturers, airplane businesses and auto manufacturers
					 coming to the government requesting money. There seems to be a clear and
					 immediate interest in providing them with financial help. The agriculture
					 sector has come to the government for years and the requests have fallen on
					 deaf ears.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why do they get such a quick response and the
					 agriculture sector does not seem to? I would suggest, and I would hope it is
					 not the case, that some of this may be geographic or may be the result of
					 location.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government needs to give farmers a chance to
					 succeed. One of the ways it can do that is by providing voluntary marketing in
					 western Canada. It needs to open up opportunities for people to thrive in their
					 communities and to diversify. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government needs to aggressively get after the
					 United States and the European Union. It needs to go after their subsidies and
					 get them reduced so that we can survive. I find it hard to remain calm on this
					 issue.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My staff assured me that I did not need to come in here

					 Lib.): </b>

	Madam Chairman, there is no question the drought this
					 past year was one of the worst this country has seen in the past four decades.
					 There is no question that members of the House have their own stories from
					 people back home in their ridings about how the drought has affected
					 them.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no question either that the federal government
					 has the mechanisms in place to help those in need, to assist those the drought
					 has affected and to support our farmers. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Farming is one of those businesses where we depend on
					 so many variables: the market, the technology, last year's crop, this year's
					 crop and of course the weather. We can put marketing boards in place, we can
					 invest in innovative new products and technologies and we can expand our
					 markets at home and abroad, but there is one thing no government can control
					 and that is the weather. We wish we could control it but we cannot. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to plan for the uncertainties in farming, like
					 disease, too much rain or, in some areas this year including my county,
					 drought, the federal government has worked hard with the provinces and
					 producers to design safety net programs that respond to the various needs of
					 farmers across the country to help them get through difficult and unforeseen
					 situations. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In July of last year, as we have already heard, the
					 federal and provincial ministers of agriculture signed a more flexible safety
					 net agreement designed to stabilize farm income as much as possible. This
					 safety net package provides $5.5 billion over three years, through to 2002, in
					 support of farm income stabilization. It supports the net income stabilization
					 account, NISA. It supports fall cash advances, crop insurance and companion
					 programs. There is also an element for income disaster assistance and spring
					 cash advances.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NISA, crop insurance and the Canadian farm income
					 program, or CFIP, are all ongoing programs specifically designed to provide
					 financial assistance to producers when they are faced with low incomes due to
					 circumstances beyond their control.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is currently about $3.2 billion in NISA accounts
					 with approximately $1.3 billion of that available for immediate withdrawal.
					 Farmers deposit money to their NISA accounts and that deposit is matched by the
					 government. This program is designed to help producers achieve long term farm
					 income stability on an individual basis. As the NISA accounts grow, farmers can
					 make withdrawals in lower income years from the funds they have set aside.
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new Canadian farm income program provides up to
					 $600 million to farmers across Canada for the year 2000. In provinces where the
					 federal government delivers a program and in the province of Alberta, producers
					 who have been affected by drought can apply now to CFIP for an interim payment
					 for 2001. In areas across the country where the federal government delivers the
					 CFIP interim payments, we can respond to a completed application in 30
					 days.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Crop insurance premiums hit a record low this year,
					 both in terms of the premium cost and the producer paid portion of the
					 premiums. Federal and provincial governments pay about 66% of total premium
					 costs, while the producer pays the remaining 33%, which is on average about
					 $2,000 per year. The number of crops, the total acreage, the number of farmers
					 with crop insurance and the value of product covered by insurance this year are
					 all at record high levels, which indicates pretty clearly that farmers are
					 taking advantage of everything they can in order to maintain their
					 position.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These three programs address different aspects of farm
					 income. They allow the government to contribute to farmers' incomes in areas
					 where they need it the most, whether that is crop insurance or a crop failure,
					 an account to boost farmers' incomes in lean years with NISA or targeted
					 assistance to producers who have experienced a sudden and severe drop in
					 farming income for reasons beyond their control.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Drought is a natural phenomenon. It cannot be
					 prevented. We can however increase our ability to withstand the impact of
					 drought by implementing sound water and land management practices. The Prairie
					 Farm Rehabilitation Administration, funded by Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada,
					 has a rural water development program that provides technical assistance and
					 $5.5 million a year for secure water supply development in agricultural and
					 rural areas in Manitoba, Saskatchewan, Alberta and northern British Columbia.

					 Canadian Alliance): </b>

	Madam Chairman, I would like to convey my thanks to the
					 Speaker for allowing us to have an emergency debate this evening.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The agriculture crisis, the drought that is facing our
					 farmers, is something we have not seen in a lifetime. Since the House adjourned
					 for the summer recess, events have changed the way we look at the world.
					 September 11 will be on our minds forever. My sympathies go out to all the
					 victims and their families, to the American people and to people around the
					 world who have been affected. Everyone will be affected by this in
					 time.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before those events occurred there was another crisis
					 which the Liberal government was ignoring. That crisis developed over several
					 years but has been compounded by the events of the last three months. With
					 respect to all the other important issues before parliament at this time, and
					 the crisis of September 11 is what I am referring to, we need to continue to
					 address the concerns of agriculture.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A devastating drought has occurred in the prairies. In
					 fact rainfall across the country has been very low. In Saskatchewan we have the
					 fifth driest year ever on record. As I mentioned, and I will not go into the
					 details, rainfall has been down across the country. My colleagues have
					 adequately explained that.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Drought is not a local or regional issue, it is a
					 national issue. The impact of the drought will be tenfold because it has come
					 on the heels of consistently low commodity prices. A bad situation has been
					 made even worse. Farmers who were wondering if it was worth planting a crop
					 this spring are wondering now in the fall whether it is worth harvesting.
					 Livestock producers, cattle producers, have had to sell off their stock because
					 they do not have sufficient feedstocks to last the winter. Some dugouts that
					 they use for water storage have dried up or are so low that there may not be
					 enough water to last the month.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government has sat idly by, and this is a sad fact,
					 and allowed the situation to fester, hurting all Canadian producers. The
					 financial impact of this drought will be horrendous. The Grain Growers of
					 Canada estimate that the national cost of this drought on the grains and
					 oilseeds sectors will be $2 billion. In the province of Saskatchewan alone it
					 will be $770 million. The government of Saskatchewan has asked the federal
					 government for $200 million to cover a shortfall in crop insurance payments.
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government has slammed the door in their faces: the
					 agriculture minister said to prairie farmers this summer that they should look
					 to crop insurance for help. In fact I heard him reiterate that when he was
					 addressing us here a little while ago. What has he done? He has not sent out
					 the money to the province to cover the shortfall. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government is willing to give billions of dollars
					 to the airlines and large corporations, but when it comes to hardworking,
					 ordinary Canadians the government ignores them. Something has to
					 change.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like at this point to read an excerpt from a
					 statement put out by the Canadian Chamber of Commerce. The impression may be
					 that we stand here and lament the problem of farmers, but the Canadian Chamber
					 of Commerce, which believes very much like we do that businesses should not be
					 subsidized, has made a statement on this that I think is key. I want to read
					 excerpts of this into the record. I cannot read the whole thing because of time
					 limitations, but it is very important that we listen to what the chamber has to
					 say. It states:</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to read the whole thing, but time does not

</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is as much I will quote from the Canadian Chamber
					 of Commerce statement, but it expresses better than I ever could my feelings on
					 this topic.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also wish to point out a very disturbing thing that I
					 found out recently. The deputy minister of agriculture told the agriculture
					 minister in a briefing note that a minority of grains and oilseeds producers
					 are facing problems, arrears are almost non-existent, farm bankruptcies are low
					 compared to other businesses, the farm debt mediator service is little used
					 outside of Saskatchewan, land prices are up and safety net programs, including
					 AIDA, have been effective. Someone in the minister's office is not telling the
					 agriculture minister the truth. Someone is misleading him. Someone in the
					 minister's office has missed the boat. It makes me angry when I hear stuff like
					 this because it is so far removed from reality.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My office in Yorkton receives calls on almost a daily
					 basis from farmers who were given an AIDA payout and suddenly get a letter from
					 the department saying they have to pay the money back. They come to me weeping
					 and asking where they are going to get the money. They say they are broke and
					 cannot pay back the money, yet the government is demanding it. How on earth can
					 anyone say that program is effective? AIDA has become the most despised
					 agriculture program in recent memory. CFIP, the son of AIDA, there to replace
					 it, is simply AIDA with another name. There is a lack of intelligence. Maybe I
					 should choose my words more carefully, but the government should realize if it
					 examines the situation that this is appalling.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Something must be done. We in the Canadian Alliance are
					 asking for an immediate cash injection to help Canadian farmers, not only to
					 deal with the drought but with three years of disastrously low commodity
					 prices. We are asking the government to reduce costs imposed by it on the backs
					 of farmers, such as the excise tax on fuel and all taxes on inputs. The
					 Canadian Alliance encourages farmer driven, value added processing. We have all
					 heard about how the wheat board is standing in the way of that. We would give
					 farmers a choice in how they market their grain and we would reduce grain
					 handling transportation costs by modernizing the whole system.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The agricultural policies of the Canadian Alliance have
					 been developed by continually speaking with farmers and farm groups. We are
					 speaking out for them. The Alliance is on the front lines. That is why we have
					 asked for this debate today.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We in the Alliance have spent so much of our time and
					 effort trying to get the government to listen. I appeal to the government this
					 evening to please consider what we are saying. The Liberal government has
					 failed to address the root causes of the farm crisis. There does not appear to
					 be any long term vision on the part of the government. We appeal to them to
					 immediately address this crisis.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish to say one other thing before my time is up.
					 There are many other policies of the government that affect farmers. By the
					 government not properly addressing the terrorism and security issue, the
					 security of our borders and the immigration concerns we have been raising,
					 agricultural exports to the U.S. are put at risk.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government really needs to take a look at all the

					 that the member across the way talked about are exactly what we have
					 heard.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What I would like to talk about right now is the fact
					 that we have a number of programs. We have CFIP, which is a Canadian income
					 program, NISA, crop insurance. Quebec has ASRA. There is MRI or GRIP. These
					 programs were brought in years back.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us deal with crop insurance, for instance. It was
					 brought in in the mid-sixties. I am not driving a mid-sixties car yet
					 agriculture is dealing with a mid-sixties program.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I happen to be in supply management. It is one sector
					 of agriculture that currently does not cost the Government of
					 Canada.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I see the member from Selkirk--Interlake kind of
					 smiling over there. He was wondering when I would talk about chicken farming.
					 It is fairly early in my speech.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The point that I am making is that there are some
					 programs within Canadian agriculture right now that are in fact working. There
					 are other programs that are in place that were designed years back and quite
					 frankly they have to be updated, such as crop insurance. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I insure my poultry barns, I insure each of them
					 for fire insurance. If one barn burns, down I do not take the average of all
					 the barns and that is what I am paid. That specific barn is insured. That is
					 one thing that needs to be updated within crop insurance.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another aspect is I believe that the input costs that
					 go into it have to be insured. In essence, there could be a cost of production
					 formula incorporated within crop insurance. This is what we have heard as we
					 have moved across the country.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A cost of production formula is something that we deal
					 with in the poultry industry. It works this way. We take the average of the
					 input costs from the best and the poorest growers so that it is in the centre.
					 It is great for the best grower because his input costs are a lot lower than
					 what the average is so he is doing very well. However, the costs for the
					 poorest grower are obviously a lot higher than what the average is and he is
					 not doing as well. That is what we have done in the poultry industry to breed
					 efficiency within the system and to get rid of inefficiency.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is one of the things we have to still take a look
					 at within the crop insurance program, if in fact we head toward the issue of a
					 cost of production formula.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The member for Yorkton--Melville also talked about
					 CFIP, the son of AIDA. I agree with him. However, it was brought in under an
					 agreement between the federal and provincial governments and different farming
					 organizations in 1998 to deal with the pork industry. Quite frankly, this is a
					 program that needs a lot of rejigging if it is going to be a broad based
					 paintbrush covering all commodities.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What I am saying is that we have programs in place that
					 we have to analyze to see whether these they are good enough to be updated and
					 kept in place to carry on to the next generation or whether they should be
					 thrown out and a new program brought in to deal with the new issues that are
					 facing agriculture. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know my colleagues across the way will agree with
					 this. Of the population of Canada, currently 2% is involved in agriculture. Of
					 that, half of 1% produces 80% of the food and the other 1.5% produces 20%.
					 Those are the statistics.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next generation right now, if looks at the family
					 farm, whatever that is, and will to go into that in a second, and the fact that
					 their parents are not making, then why the heck would they want to go into it.
					 Now we are into a philosophical debate. I am always convinced that somebody
					 will be growing the food on the land. However, who will it be? Will it be
					 somebody running the family farm or will it be a corporate entity?</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Some hon. member: </b>Bombardier.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Murray Calder:</b> It could be Bombardier. One
					 never knows. Actually, those are loan guarantees not subsidies. Let me clarify
					 that right off the bat.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us take a look at the family farm. These are some
					 of the things that are facing agriculture right now. Back in the 1940s and the
					 1950s, when the family farm was transferred to the next generation, it was
					 basically given to that generation and that generation took care of the
					 generation that had retired. We do not see that today. One generation sells it
					 to the next generation.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we want to get down to this, I would start to
					 question the definition of the family farm. The older generation needs so much
					 money to retire. They look at their farming operations for that retirement
					 money. However, if they attach a $500,000 mortgage to it, they have taken the
					 farm and basically stopped it dead in its tracks because it has to pay for a
					 $500,000 mortgage without any benefit to the efficiency within the farm. That
					 farm now is paying off a $500,000 mortgage. It is stopped dead in its tracks.
					 It cannot update its equipment or anything else like that until it pays off
					 that mortgage. Anything within agriculture today that stands still is falling
					 behind.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe we not only have to look at programs of
					 support for the farming industry but we also have to look at how we will put
					 programs in place so we can transfer the capital assets from one generation to
					 the next. That is very incumbent upon agriculture today.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have been working on my own family operation with
					 just exactly that. I started this type of planning 20 years ago. My son is
					 getting ready to go into the OAC at Guelph next year. He will take
					 agri-economics. He also talking about veterinary science too. I am the third
					 generation on the farm. With the planning that we put in place, there will be a
					 fourth generation.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Someone mentioned the wheat board. I was on the
					 standing committee of agriculture when we looked into this. It was a crown
					 corporation with five commissioners. The reason why there was a government
					 entity was because of the guarantee on the initial payments, which came under
					 the finances act. Everyone of us in the House, and I know the member across the
					 way is constantly talking about finances, has a responsibility to the taxpayers
					 of Canada. So when we came up with the new wheat board, it had 15 members on
					 it. It still had the five commissioners of the crown corporation but we now had
					 10 elected farmers on that board. Now we have the feedback of the grassroots
					 into the CWB.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The more they get involved within the CWB, and I have
					 had a chance to talk to some of these directors, the more supportive they are
					 of the way the Canada Wheat Board is run. However, they are elected and have
					 connections to the grassroots. Everyone in the House knows that if we do not do
					 what our constituents think is the right, come election time we will not be
					 back. That is the reality. So now there is a commitment of the grassroots to
					 the Canada Wheat Board. Therefore, members can see just how complicated this
					 issue is.</p>

					 Canadian Alliance): </b>

	Madam Chairman, I want to thank the House for
					 permitting this debate today. Agriculture is a very important industry in my
					 riding and around the country. As others have pointed out, it accounts for a
					 big chunk of Canada's production every year. It annual GDP is about $14
					 billion. We need to take it more seriously than we do. We take it for granted
					 because it has been around for so long. So many people live in urban areas
					 today and they sometimes take for granted the food that arrives in their
					 grocery stores.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The truth is that there is a crisis in agriculture
					 today. I want to compliment the hon. member for Selkirk--Interlake for raising
					 this issue on behalf of the Canadian Alliance. I would also like to point out
					 some of the other agriculture critics who have made an issue of this. I am
					 speaking of people like the hon. member for Cypress Hills--Grasslands, the hon.
					 member for Peace River, the hon. member for Yorkton--Melville and people from
					 all over Saskatchewan, Alberta and Manitoba who are really pushing this issue
					 and are standing up for farmers. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to take a moment to talk about the impact that
					 the drought has had on my riding of Medicine Hat. Medicine Hat is a large area
					 in southern Alberta and has been hard hit by the drought of the last couple of
					 years. I thought the best way to explain what is going on is to touch a bit on
					 some of the crop reports that were written by Alberta agriculture through the
					 summer. These will give members an idea of what the agronomists have said about
					 what is going on in southern Alberta. I will mention some of the specific areas
					 that make up my riding.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me go back to mid-July because that is when we were
					 really starting to understand that there would be another serious situation for
					 the second year in a row. Let me quote from the crop report of July 17. Here is
					 what it had to say about Foremost:</p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td><small>Things are very dry down here (like
						  that's a big news flash!). Crop insurance has been very busy with calls from
						  farmers wondering about turning cattle out into cereal fields and spraying out
						  cereal crops completely. I have been working on a sawfly survey and have found
						  moderate levels of infestations. Pea canola/mustard pods are starting to fill
						  but the number of seeds in each pod is disappointing.</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is what it said about Medicine Hat:</p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td><small>Dryland yields across the district
						  are expected to average in the single digits. The hot dry weather will now

</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;About Taber, it said:</p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td><small>The relentless hot and dry conditions
						  are taking a toll on dryland crops. Poor soil moisture conditions and the

						  allows.</small></td>

</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If I skip ahead a couple of weeks, this is what it had

	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">

</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is one to three bushels just for perspective. On
					 dry land in an area, a typical crop would be 20 to 25 bushels an acre. Members
					 can see it is pretty desperate.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The report went on to say:</p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td><small>Hail passed through a scattered area

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It goes on and on. I will skip ahead to September

</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is the same for Taber and Foremost. It is a complete
					 and utter disaster in my riding. I do not know of any other way to say it. When
					 we fly over that area, as my colleague was pointing out a few minutes ago, or
					 drive through it, the pastures are not brown. They are grey. The hon. member
					 for Lethbridge was pointing to meteorological reports that were suggesting that
					 pastures might take as long as three years to ten years to recover. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prairie fires are burning. When they come through they
					 burn down to the roots. There is no moisture in the soil. A tremendous wind
					 came up the other day and blew the prairie grass off the top of the ground.
					 Usually that wool is so tough it holds the soil in almost any condition, but
					 after so much drought even the prairie grasses are blowing off the top of the
					 ground. It is absolutely desperate.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is bad at any time. It is especially bad coming at
					 a time when prices are low and when the government has completely and utterly
					 failed to listen to the opposition when it comes to fixing some of these
					 programs. I do not know how many times we have raised the fact that AIDA is a
					 disaster. It was supposed to be a disaster program. It is a disaster
					 itself.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have pointed out that the government sends out 20
					 page forms that farmers cannot figure out. Farmers spend a thousand dollars
					 getting accountants to figure out the forms for them, only to find out that
					 they do not qualify. It is a thousand dollars that they do not have. The
					 situation is desperate.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This spring the Canadian Alliance proposed about a half
					 a billion dollar injection into agriculture because the situation was so
					 desperate. I am sad to say that Liberal members voted against it and that it
					 was defeated. That is a shame. When one considers what the government spends
					 its money on today it speaks volumes about what its priorities.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every time we come into the House we on this side raise
					 issues of government waste and mismanagement. We went through the billion
					 dollar boondoggle last year, where the human resources minister was under so
					 much fire because about a billion dollars had not been accounted for and was
					 ill spent by the Department of Human Resources Development. Money just
					 disappeared and a lot of the money was used, frankly, for patronage reasons.
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have farmers who are in a desperate situation
					 through no fault of their own. It is time for the government to step up to the
					 plate. In 1996 when the United States government passed the freedom to farm
					 legislation it was spending about $7 billion a year on agriculture. Today it is
					 up to $31 billion in subsidies.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canada has not matched that. As a result we have seen
					 commodity prices continue to be soft because the Americans and the Europeans
					 are dumping so much grain on to the world market and depressing prices that
					 Canada cannot keep up. Our farmers are being pounded as a result.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is time for the government to recognize the
					 desperate situation faced by farmers. I urge the government to set aside some
					 of the partisan behaviour we have seen with respect to this issue, reallocate
					 resources from some of the low priority programs and put them into agriculture
					 to help these people out.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;People on farms produce a lot of things but what they
					 really produce is good people who need help right now. This party does not very
					 often ask for much from the government. We do not demand money for many things.
					 This is one time when we are united on this side in asking the government to
					 stand up for farmers, open up that wallet a bit and ensure that farmers today
					 can look forward to the future with a bit of hope.</p>

				  </b>

	Madam Chairman, I have listened with interest to the
					 hon. member's position. I want to participate briefly in this debate. It is
					 certainly good tonight to be able to look at the problems in agriculture and in
					 particular the problems in certain sectors of industry.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My seatmate from Ontario referred to the so-called
					 marketing systems in Canada. We find that those sectors where producers have
					 made arrangements in terms of the amount of product and the price they might
					 get for it seem to operate quite effectively. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This past year in the livestock industry the reports in
					 terms of prices have been good. Most people in the beef sector and the dairy
					 sector have had reasonably good years.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am glad to see the hon. member for St. John's West
					 here tonight. In my own province of New Brunswick potatoes are a big factor.
					 Maybe he and I could get together to get a good fish and chip business going
					 that would encourage both the fishery and agriculture sectors.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Potato producers and more important the people involved
					 in growing vegetables have had a very difficult year in New Brunswick due to
					 the dry conditions. We also found that people involved in the production apples
					 had a very small product and one which was not so good for market.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my own area of Kent county to the south and into
					 Westmorland a number of producers have been involved with such products as
					 Brussels sprouts, cauliflower and various vegetables. They have not been able
					 to reach the success they had in previous years. Some of them are appealing to
					 our governments, both in New Brunswick and federally, for some assistance so
					 that they can continue with that industry. It has been a significant employer
					 in terms of a growing industry. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know those involved with cauliflower, Brussels
					 sprouts, cabbage and so forth certainly want to continue their businesses.
					 However some of them tell me that unless they get some assistance they will
					 have difficulty making it to another year. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We see people in the galleries and members in the
					 House, especially those from the west who are here to hear the concerns. During
					 the past winter I was on the agricultural committee with a number of my friends
					 in the House. That committee undertook to look at some of the farm issues
					 across the country, especially in the area of our grains, oilseeds and corn
					 crops in Ontario and in Quebec.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The history of the past few years has not been good.
					 Prices have been low. This year the crops in many areas were not good. In terms
					 of dry conditions, only last week I visited the area between Montreal and the
					 far side of the river and Hull. We found too that certain farmers had
					 tremendous problems. In fact the floor here has probably more grass than some
					 of those farms along the river. Further down we found areas where the corn
					 crops were quite good.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tonight we have heard the issue. I am glad it has been
					 brought to the attention of the House. As Canadians it is to be hoped that we
					 can look at agriculture as being a very important part of our economy. Our
					 nation, if we remember, was first opened up by the fur trade. Then came
					 agriculture, lumber and all the other primary industries. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past number of years we have seen great changes
					 in our country. People have moved away from the rural areas toward the cities.
					 We find that the cities are growing larger and a very small number of people
					 today can provide the food we need.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Part of the overall philosophy in North America has
					 been to maintain a very inexpensive food supply for people. People in the
					 cities have benefited greatly from the efficiency of our agricultural
					 communities. However, as one member mentioned briefly, we have to look at the
					 future of this industry. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have to show our children that there are
					 opportunities, that there is a way of life, and that there is a livelihood that
					 will sustain them and their families. If we cannot bring the young people into
					 the industry, we have to ask what we can do as a nation to improve this
					 industry.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am concerned, in terms of what I have seen across
					 Canada, that some provinces pay more attention to agriculture than others. I
					 commend the province of Quebec because it has taken a very vital interest in
					 agriculture. It has good programs for its farmers. It maintains agriculture as
					 a very important part of the industry of that province. Other provinces seem to
					 put agriculture at a much lower priority. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The federal government must assess the situation and
					 attempt to encourage provinces to do more for their agricultural
					 communities.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am sure we will hear in committee that inputs for
					 farmers have been increasing. The price of arm machinery is at an all time
					 high. Farmers who have breakdowns have found that the cost of repairs and spare
					 parts has been at international prices. The inputs directly affect what kind of
					 profit the farmer may make at the end of a given year. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hopefully the agriculture standing committee can work
					 with agricultural communities, that it can hear from farmers, and eventually
					 toward the end of the year can bring before the House definite recommendations
					 on how we might address the problems of our farmers.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have been listening with interest to this good
					 debate. I see our friends from the west are greatly concerned because of
					 commodity prices and the difficulties they have. I could not believe the hon.
					 member for Medicine Hat buys water by the truckload in his home community. The
					 different situations in Canada vary from province to province. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We hope that somehow in terms of the debate we are
					 having tonight and in terms of the programs that might come from the
					 agriculture committee chaired by the hon. member for
					 Dufferin--Peel--Wellington--Grey that we can offer farmers some hope that their
					 industry is a viable industry. The agriculture industry needs the support of
					 our federal government, the support of the provinces, and hopefully will offer
					 a future for our young people.</p>

					 PC/DR): </b>

	Madam Chairman, members may be wondering what a
					 fisherman from St. John's, Newfoundland is doing speaking on an agricultural
					 debate. The first reason is that I support the resolution. As a Canadian I am
					 well aware of the situation western farmers are going through and I am
					 extremely supportive of helping them at this time of crisis.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second reason is that we in Newfoundland always
					 say, when we are ignored, which is quite often, that it is because it is only
					 Newfoundland and because it is only fish. It seems to me that the people who
					 count in this country, the primary producers, are the ones who are overlooked
					 the most, and that is extremely unfortunate.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we did not have the bread makers, the fish producers
					 and the vegetable growers, where would we be? Let us just imagine the price we
					 would have to pay for the basic necessities of life if we had to import them.
					 We do not know how fortunate we are to live in a country where we can produce
					 our own vegetables, fish, wheat and other grains that create staple foods that
					 not only ourselves but that the world eats. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To think that in time of dire need we ignore
					 agriculture and yet within hours of a perceived airline crisis, the government
					 runs around trying to find money to bail out airlines that perhaps are their
					 own worst enemy.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I mentioned coming from a province that deals with
					 fish, if we are talking about food supply, we also have farmers in our province
					 who have had a major problem this year. It was not because of a lack of
					 moisture, it was because of too much.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last winter in Newfoundland we had a record snowfall,
					 the most snow ever. Newfoundland is a place where in the past we have had
					 pretty hard winters. Growing up in Newfoundland we had enjoyable winters. From
					 the end of November until the middle of April we could ski, skidoo, skate,
					 whatever we wanted to do to enjoy the winter scene.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the past 10 years or so, we thought we had moved
					 south of Florida. A year ago we did not have to shovel the driveway or a step
					 once during the winter. This past winter, it turned around again and we had
					 record snowfalls, which meant that a lot of the snow did not melt until well
					 into May. With that kind of accumulation, especially in open areas on the
					 fields, one can imagine how wet the fields were. The farmers were extremely
					 late getting their crops into the ground, to the extent that it affected their
					 year's production, a reverse of what occurred in the west.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think the total rainfall in the hon. member's area
					 was 60-odd millimetres for the year? </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. member:</b> Twelve inches in two years.
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Loyola Hearn:</b> A hurricane hit Newfoundland
					 about a week ago and in a few hours 120 millimetres of rain was dumped on the
					 Avalon. That in itself caused a tremendous amount of damage, which we will be
					 talking about tomorrow or the next day. It washed out roads and flooded
					 basements. Some basements had as much as six feet of water. Some of the main
					 roads were washed away and shoulders were taken off a lot of our highways. The
					 cost has been phenomenal. The mayor of the city of St. John's called a state of
					 emergency, which is not done lightly. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I read a story in the paper that summarized what
					 happened. A lady said that she was awakened at three o'clock in the morning
					 when her little dog jumped up on the bed. She said that when she pushed the dog
					 off the bed she heard a splash. </p>


	<A NAME="T1810"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1810"><!-- Hour: 6--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1815"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1805"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1810)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That was pretty common in a lot of St. John's. It was
					 an extremely dry summer and the ground was extremely hard. When there is a lot
					 of rain like that everything runs off and takes whatever is there with it. That
					 is what happened. It was a complete reversal of what the west has had to
					 face.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of the heavy moisture, the late season and the
					 excessive rains, the farmers in our area have had the reverse. They also have
					 been negatively affected and have been asking for assistance but have been
					 getting the cold shoulder.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps, collectively, we should all start zeroing in
					 on the basics and look at the people who really are the hard workers, the
					 people who built the country and stayed with the farms, those who did not sell
					 their lands to housing projects when they had a chance to make a fortune and
					 leave town. Those are the people who stayed through hard times and passed on
					 their farms to generation and generation. They still exist today and still work
					 the farms. It is the same for the fishermen in the boats who year after year
					 worked the nets and then passed the boat and gear over to the son who then
					 passed it on to his son, et cetera.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They provided good livelihoods. They were tremendous
					 people who contributed greatly to the economy of their community, province and
					 country. They asked for very little other than the freedom to work at what they
					 wanted to do and, if times got tough, that we do for them what we would do for
					 others who perhaps were less deserving. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We solidly support the request from the farmers in the
					 west. We ask the government to stop fooling around. We must forget about what
					 this agreement or that agreement says. The agreement should say that if there
					 is a problem the government will be there to help if there is a legitimate
					 need. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the time that is spent, the bureaucracy that is
					 involved, the costs that are involved and the costs incurred in waiting would
					 certainly pay a lot of the debts that have been built up.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us cut out the fooling, get down to the basics and
					 help the farmers who need help. Let us get on with the job so that hopefully
					 next year will be a different year for everybody.</p>

					 Centre, Canadian Alliance): </b>

	Mr.Chairman, I want to attack this from a human
					 suffering point of view. I have in my hand a letter I received today from a
					 constituent in Regina. Members may wonder why I would start off with this but
					 here are the first two lines of the letter: </p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td><small>I want to let you know that I do not
						  want to see any taxpayer money going to bail out Air Canada. The service they
						  provide to us in Regina is not worthy of any support.</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have heard that the government may be bailing out
					 such a major company as Air Canada. It has been explained to us often that it
					 is because there are so many jobs involved, that it is our transportation and
					 that it is our national airline. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tonight we are talking about our national industry
					 called agriculture, an industry that has a national impact on jobs. It is said
					 that probably one in seven jobs in Saskatchewan is farm or agriculture related.
					 We are very definitely talking about jobs when it comes to agriculture in
					 Saskatchewan.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Canadian Alliance has put out a little bulletin for
					 us. The first point on it says “Canadian farmers from coast to coast are
					 suffering from drought conditions”. I want to pull one word out of that because
					 I believe there are more than drought conditions causing our farmers to suffer.
					 Drought conditions have just heightened and increased it. They are suffering
					 from a number of things. We all know that they have been suffering for a long
					 time from the depressed prices of commodities. They do not get what they should
					 for their crops. I remember hearing those same prices when I was a boy growing
					 up and that was back in the days when they were greenback dollars. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The farmers are not only suffering from poor crop
					 prices but they are also suffering from high input costs, which the government
					 has failed to do anything about. The tax on fuel could have been removed. It
					 would not have been a handout but at least it would have been of some help. I
					 am told that there is another hidden cost, although I am sure some farmers
					 would argue this. On one hand perhaps the low dollar helps, but a farmer told
					 me the other day that the U.S. exchange on a new combine is in the
					 neighbourhood of $80,000 being added to the cost of the new machine.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The drought of course is causing them to suffer as well
					 as the prices. We can see that as the other members and I fly back and forth to
					 our ridings. As we get closer to the ground we can see the blotchy fields and
					 the arid spots where there is no straw, no stubble, no crop. We understand the
					 drought is causing a great amount of suffering for people who were already near
					 the edge and the unusually dry weather just pushes them over.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are some other things that cause farmer to
					 suffer. I have never heard anyone mention this but what I call forced
					 diversification causes our farmers to suffer. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of my constituents told me that in the spring, when
					 they are considering what to plant, they like to keep it down to a maximum of
					 six different crop varieties in order to control their machinery costs and
					 harmonize their activities a little more. However, he said that he had to still
					 diversify into seven different crops this year. He is very diversified. We
					 cannot suggest that to farmers any longer because they are as diversified as
					 they can get. They may diversify into an area that is supposed to be good and
					 then the price drops out of it and they are hurting again. It is not a long
					 range answer.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They are suffering because they are penalized for
					 working off the farm. The young farmers who are really trying hard to make it
					 work, work not only on the farm but put in many hours, perhaps even full time
					 hours, at other jobs. Then when they apply for some of the assistance programs
					 out there they are disqualified simply because they are making money in an off
					 farm way.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some of the farmers are suffering because they are
					 working on the farm. We have some farmers in Saskatchewan manufacturing
					 playground equipment or farm equipment. I was on one farm where the farmer was
					 making his own crop sprayer. It was a beautiful sprayer. It would pass
					 inspection at any farm implement factory. It was just a beautiful job. He had
					 to make his own equipment. Farmers are suffering through the extra work they
					 have to put in to design, build, make do, repair and work on their own
					 equipment because of a lack of funds.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They are suffering because of the declining demand for
					 used farm equipment and the prices for it. It is one thing to be able to have a
					 fire sale and walk away from a business having sold the inventory, but try
					 selling the used farm equipment or try selling the farm. There is just a dead
					 end there for many of these farmers and they are suffering because they cannot
					 even liquidate in a manner that would let them get out from under the debt load
					 they are already carrying.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For years in Saskatchewan there has been a lot of farm
					 counselling going on. For a number of years the Saskatchewan government has
					 even had to sponsor and take care of counselling for farmers. They are
					 counselled for depression. I would be depressed too if I had so little hope of
					 making a living with such a debt load over me. It goes so far as to end up in
					 marital counselling. Many farmers have experienced family breakdown because of
					 this extreme pressure upon them. It goes right to the point of suicide
					 counselling for farmers who feel they have no other choice but to consider
					 taking their own lives. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are talking about suffering. We are talking about
					 the lives of people. We are talking about jobs being lost because of the
					 crisis. We are talking about the kinds of things the government should be
					 concerned about and want to help out with when it can.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In our constituency we have farmers losing the very
					 land that their farm fathers fought for in World War II. Talk about a guilt
					 trip. Talk about suffering. These poor fellows are crushed because they feel
					 like they have failed their families and their fathers who fought so
					 desperately to pass on the farm to them.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where do they look for a job? Where do they go? Someone
					 who lives in a city and loses a job has a little better opportunity to move to
					 another source of income than what our farmers are faced with in the rural
					 parts of our country. They suffer because of that. They have little choice in
					 what they can do and where they can go.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe this is a crisis that should invoke
					 compassion but also an understanding that we are dealing not only with a
					 drought crisis: we are dealing with the loss of an industry that affects many
					 jobs and many lives. I would hope that our government would take a second look
					 at it and give a second thought to supporting this industry.</p>

					 Alliance): </b>

	Mr. Chairman, I am very happy to stand to persuade all
					 the Liberals in this hon. House that they ought to have compassion and take a
					 serious look at the needs of farmers across the country.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I grew up on a farm, many years ago obviously. As a
					 matter of fact my dad says that I am a child of the depression, the thirties.
					 When we were young and growing up on the farm we were very poor. It is amazing
					 to me that with all our technological advancements and our prosperity in the
					 country now we have not invented a way of solving the problem for farmers when
					 they have these downturns from time to time.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Way back then, like today, farmers faced many problems,
					 anything from drought to too much moisture. I remember that as a youngster
					 there was a time when we had rust in the fields. We also had plagues of
					 grasshoppers. We had various diseases go through the crops. We had ups and
					 downs in prices. Throughout all of that the farmers survived.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to emphasize the importance of this,
					 especially in the context of what is seizing us as Canadians these days in
					 terms of national security, I would like to point out that a solid, independent
					 and self-sufficient food supply is absolutely critical to our national
					 security.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are many Ukrainians in my riding who point out to
					 me frequently that there was a time in their history when the deprivation of
					 food was used to destroy them as a people. It is really atrocious that we do
					 not take it very seriously and make every effort possible to look at a secure
					 food supply as a national security issue.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I imagine that everyone here today, especially on the
					 other side of the House, has had a full meal or two today. We are not
					 accustomed in Canada to thinking about real hunger. I do not know, Mr.
					 Chairman, whether you have ever gone without food. I probably should have more
					 than I have, but from time to time I have fasted, which is a good exercise for
					 many reasons. To go without food for a day or two while drinking only water or
					 perhaps juice has a number of very good effects on a person. One of the most
					 important ones is that it really emphasizes the importance of food in our
					 lives.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has been said that a person can live about a minute
					 or so without air, a day or two without water and a week or two without food.
					 Mr. Chairman, I would probably outlast you, but it certainly is true that in a
					 very short length of time we become dependent on food input in order to stay
					 alive.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think it would be a great exercise, as was suggested
					 to me by my son-in-law, a farmer, if every member of parliament were to be
					 asked to do a one day fast. If by the end of the first week the agriculture
					 problem is not solved, the following week the members should do a two day fast.
					 Then if by the end of that week the agriculture problem is not solved, they
					 should do a three day fast, and they should keep going until the problem is
					 solved. He said he was sure that MPs would soon discover a way of solving, in
					 the long term, the agriculture problem that faces our country.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think we ought to address the issue. Right now of
					 course it is a disaster. My colleagues have spoken of areas where there is no
					 income, where expenses and bills are piling up, where bankers and indeed the
					 government's own Farm Credit Corporation are asking for the money and farmers
					 do not have the ability to pay it back. It is in fact a desperate
					 situation.</p>


	<A NAME="T1825"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1825"><!-- Hour: 6--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1830"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1820"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1825)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I suppose there is another way we can look at it. What
					 would we as members of parliament do if at the end of the month we did not get
					 a paycheque, then did not get one the next month or the month after? Then the
					 banks would want to take our houses for not paying the mortgages, or the gas or
					 electricity would be shut off because we were not paying the bills. We can see
					 how quickly we would become desperate. That is where many farmers are today.
					 They are without an income or a hope of an income and are literally facing
					 personal disaster.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to mention a few things the government should
					 do. One is with respect to user fees, which have really shot up for farmers.
					 There is some justification for charging users the fees for these services that
					 are supplied by government, but the fact of the matter is that these services
					 for which fees are charged in the case of agriculture are good not only for the
					 farmers. They are in fact for every Canadian. We should question whether or not
					 we should charge excessive user fees to farmers when every citizen in the
					 country is the beneficiary of the services such as food inspections and things
					 like that supplied by the government.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am thinking of another one that the government should
					 do immediately. It could be done tomorrow if we had the political will to do
					 it, and that is to have a motion that says effective tonight, or if we want to
					 be generous take it to the weekend or the end of the month, as of October 1 we
					 could have no more fuel tax on farm fuel. Why can we not take away that excise
					 tax? No, the Liberal government seems to be quite content not only to charge
					 excise tax on fuel used by farmers but then to charge GST on the excise tax
					 itself, besides charging GST on the cost of the fuel. It is actually charging
					 farmers, like all Canadians, a tax on a tax and it does not feel badly about
					 it. I sometimes wonder whether government members have any conscience at
					 all.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think very seriously about the whole issue of trade.
					 We presumably have an open border between the United States and Canada with the
					 free trade agreement, except for food products. We can imagine how frustrating
					 that is to farmers who, having a product in the bin which has value and which
					 they can sell, are forced by the law in the country to sell only to the wheat
					 board, but the wheat board is not buying it. They are prevented from pulling a
					 truck up to the bin, loading their own product into the truck and taking it to
					 a market where they could sell it. I have spoken to more than one farmer who
					 has been in that situation. It is atrocious that in this country farmers do not
					 have the freedom to sell their products to whomever will give them the price
					 they are ready to sell it for. That is how the marketplace works. It works that
					 way in every other area.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my little town I have a number of different grocery
					 stores to which I can go. I can choose to buy my food at Safeway or IGA. I
					 should not have started the list. The others will be upset if I do not complete
					 it. There is Save-on-Foods. We have all these different marketers of food. I
					 cannot believe that farmers cannot also choose who to sell to. They should be
					 able to make a deal. If somebody is willing to pay the price and they are
					 willing to sell the product, let them go and do it. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am thinking of organic farming, another area where
					 farmers would like to break free. Can they do that? No. At every turn they have
					 impediments from the government in regard to growing and marketing their
					 products. In fact the wheat board will not handle organic food as a separate
					 commodity and yet farmers are required to sell their grain to the wheat board.
					 That is ridiculous.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can see nothing wrong with continuing to have the
					 wheat board, but we should make participation in it free. If a farmer gets the
					 best price from the wheat board let him sell his product to the wheat board,
					 but if he can get a better price elsewhere who are we in this country to pass a
					 law to prevent him from doing that?</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We should be thinking of some other things. When we go
					 to the grocery store and buy a loaf of bread for around $1.20, depending upon
					 where we are, the farmer gets about six or 10 cents. We could add just a little
					 to the cost of food and give the farmer a fair market price.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are many things that can be done. I am very sad
					 that my time is up because I am only half done, but it will hold for another
					 time.</p>

					 Alliance): </b>

	Mr. Chairman, I am going to talk about Saskatchewan.
					 Only nine per cent of the earth's surface is suitable for the production of
					 food. Saskatchewan has more than 65 million acres of agricultural land which
					 consists of cultivated land and grazing land. This represents 39% of Canada's
					 total. We produce 38% of the primary agricultural exports. It is important for
					 people to realize that Saskatchewan is a major producer.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The member across the way talked about the wheat board
					 and how he was among those who helped form the Canadian Wheat Board. He is from
					 Ontario and I am very surprised. He made reference to being an elected official
					 responsible to constituents. I see the wheat board more like a committee where
					 there are eight Liberals and seven opposition members with all the powerful
					 positions being in that area. The Canadian Wheat Board has 10 elected and five
					 appointed members. It is dominated and it is more like a committee than like
					 being responsible to constituents.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I did have a speech but I prefer to raise this issue
					 and if I had the cheque here, I would table it. A farmer wanted to buy school
					 clothes and supplies this fall. He took his 2,100 bushels of wheat to the
					 elevator and the cheque he got had three zeros, it was for $0.00. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am not going to get into numbers, but these are some
					 of the costs that came off. He had to pay for weighing and inspection, CWB/FAF
					 deductions, elevation, terminal cleaning, and rail freight which was $1,430.74.
					 In Saskatchewan we pay a lot more for freight than most other provinces. Then
					 there was an advance refund. It was really nice to see that our minister of
					 agriculture gave him an advance in the spring, but it was taken off his first
					 truckload of wheat to the elevator this fall. Was that done with the Bombardier
					 loan guarantees? Is it taken off the first plane that goes out? The farmer also
					 had to pay for coordinated trucking, accounts receivable, which the farmer owed
					 for chemicals he used in the spring and charged to his account, and there was a
					 deferred amount that is an accommodation for the farmer. He had 2,100 bushels
					 of wheat and got a cheque for zero dollars.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the member for Elk Island mentioned, one bushel of
					 wheat is worth $3.18 and produces 42 pounds of flour, enough to make 68 or 72
					 loaves of bread. Imagine how many loaves of bread have been made with that
					 2,100 bushels of wheat. In Saskatchewan we have grown up to five billion,
					 accounting for 47% of Saskatchewan's total exports. That is our contribution to
					 agriculture. We are stuck with approximately $15,000 per year per farm
					 operation for transportation. Revenue user fees have gone up as much as 300%
					 over the past years.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those things are real. It is not just about saving the
					 family farm anymore. It is about saving an industry. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have a friend who was widowed at 40 years of age with
					 four children, from nine to 15 years of age. When her husband died they were in
					 bad shape on their farm. They had just gone through the Trudeau years, during
					 which farming really suffered. She almost lost the farm but she learned to
					 drive the tractor, she took a course, her kids took up farming and they decided
					 to save the farm.</p>


	<A NAME="T1835"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1835"><!-- Hour: 6--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1840"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1830"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1835)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However she was hit with kidney disease and needed a
					 kidney transplant. Her boys have helped her by taking over the farm. They now
					 have to work up north in the oil fields to help save the family farm. She saved
					 it by going back and learning how to drive a tractor. These kids will save it
					 by going up north. It is not just up north, it is where nobody wants to
					 go.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to make the point that it is about more than
					 saving the family farm. We are talking about an industry. Saskatchewan should
					 be more respected. When I hear how Saskatchewan gets all of these numbers of
					 dollars, I challenge the minister of agriculture to show me the money. We have
					 not seen it yet.</p>

					 Alliance): </b>

	Mr. Chairman, I want to express my gratitude for having
					 a chance to once again speak to the issue of the farm crisis and the
					 agriculture industry crisis. It is such an important thing.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope that the one Liberal who is here listening to
					 the speeches, and the one who just came in, the two in this big majority
					 government, will try to take some messages back to their colleagues. They are
					 the ones who are in a position to do something about it. We feel like we are
					 not talking to anybody. They certainly do not respond to anything.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Chairman, I want to say to you that it is a
					 pleasure that you asked how the elk, the deer and the bear are doing in my
					 riding. One of the places that attracts a lot of people to my riding is the
					 Lake Louise and Banff region. I can understand why they go there because if it
					 is not the most beautiful spot in Canada, then it is one of the most beautiful.
					 It is certainly worth venturing there. There are 25,000 square kilometres in my
					 riding and those kinds of areas represent only about 20%. The other 80%, a big
					 chunk of it, belongs to the agriculture industry.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Driving through Lake Louise and Banff and continuing
					 eastward for approximately 450 miles we get to the eastern side of my riding.
					 We come to a couple of small towns. Cluny is one and Gleichen and Hussar are
					 others. What we see in this area today is absolutely devastating.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My wife and I drove to Gleichen. We drove out to the
					 rural areas and stopped our car. I got out and took a walk into a field of
					 grain which was stubble about six inches high with droopy heads that were not
					 filling out. The cracks in the ground were anywhere from an inch to three
					 inches wide and went all the way through the fields. Literally thousands, if
					 not millions, of grasshoppers were flying in front of my face. It is a terrible
					 thing to see. These people are absolutely devastated and do not know what to
					 do. It is a drastic situation.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have read comments by the members of the Liberal
					 government who go out there. The minister responsible for the wheat board said
					 “You have got to diversify”. We hear this comment a lot. I do not know what
					 crop it is that they could grow that does not need moisture, that does not need
					 water.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have heard it said that they need to get into
					 livestock. That whole area out there is surrounded with dugouts that are
					 usually full of water where animals and livestock can drink, but the dugouts
					 are dry. The ducks and geese that used to reside and nest on the dugouts are no
					 longer there because there is no water. It is bad.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The day before yesterday I got a call from the riding
					 and the temperature was 30 degrees Celsius. That is very unusual. It is nearly
					 October. Yesterday it was up to about 28 degrees, the wind was blowing and the
					 dust storms are unbelievable. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I drove through there this summer, there were a
					 couple of very windy days. It was like the panhandle of Oklahoma where the dust
					 blows out of Oklahoma on its way to Texas and then when the wind changes
					 direction it blows back from Texas to Oklahoma. The clouds were totally grey
					 and black and we could not see the sun because of the dust that was flying
					 around.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I went to a family reunion this summer. When we drove
					 across the Salt Lake desert we saw more green there than we did in that portion
					 of my riding. That shows how serious it is.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think people understand the seriousness of it. We
					 have to get off this kick that we have the programs in place that are working
					 because what those people do not understand is that it is not getting into the
					 hands of the people who are suffering, the people who are trying to make a go
					 of things. It is not getting there. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They brought in the application forms required to be
					 filled out for AIDA. They would need the help of 17 Philadelphia lawyers to
					 fill out the forms. They had to hire accountants and try to find some
					 professionals to help them fill out the documents, and when they apply they
					 never get anything. They never get anywhere. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not know where all the money is going. I have not
					 found anybody in my riding in that predicament who has received a
					 cent.</p>


	<A NAME="T1840"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1840"><!-- Hour: 6--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1845"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1835"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1840)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are solutions to all kind of situations that come
					 up in agriculture but first we have to recognize that it is the most important
					 industry in the country. I do not know if any of my colleagues agree with me,
					 but it does not come across to me that the government puts the emphasis and
					 priority on agriculture, not just in my riding in Alberta but all across the
					 country. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not only that, when we look at what is going on today,
					 Mr. Chairman, those very mountains that you were talking about, where the elk
					 and the deer roam, at this time of the year the mountains are usually solid
					 white but they are not. They are grey and brown. There is no snow coming. That
					 is going to hurt other industries, but I am not here to talk about them
					 tonight. I am here to talk about the agriculture industry.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We need a cash injection. That is something we could do
					 with. The question is, where are we going to get the money?</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me help. I am no expert in the budgeting but the
					 ministers who sit in the front row have departments they are responsible for.
					 They know what their budgets are. I think they need to draw back a little and
					 ask where their portfolios are in the list of priorities. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We know that with the tragic events on September 11
					 security is certainly one of them. Our defence is certainly another one. We
					 have to take a good look at agriculture because food is pretty essential. We
					 talk about air and water. We know what the essentials are, but food is very
					 essential. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There has to be a cash injection. Maybe they need to
					 wear down the erasers on their pencils when they start passing out
					 money.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The public accounts are coming out and I find it
					 amazing that the ministers are still keeping up to their commitments. Billions
					 of dollars are going into different programs, most of which are nice things to
					 do. When things are going well, I would support keeping those kind of things
					 flowing in those areas that are nice things to do, but we are in a situation
					 where the higher priority areas are suffering. Perhaps we could shuffle some of
					 that money around in a different direction. Put it to an essential
					 cause.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we go further into the public accounts and see
					 where they are spending the money, it gets to the point of ridiculousness. The
					 absolute stupidity of spending millions of dollars in areas that we cannot
					 understand what the devil they are even thinking about.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I suppose $165,000 sounds like peanuts but it is only a
					 small example of the many projects the government spends money on. My pet one
					 now that I am 65 years old is this wonderful committee on seniors and
					 sexuality. Boy does that make me feel good that I now qualify as a senior and
					 somebody is out there looking after my sex life with tax dollars. A good
					 Liberal program. That is only one example. We could find hundreds of them in
					 the public accounts.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why do we not direct some of this money at places that
					 deal with essential things? We cannot find anything more essential than
					 food.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Along with that is another essential item. In order to
					 produce food, we need moisture. We need to see what we can do about that. There
					 are excellent irrigation programs. We can start working toward getting
					 something into place in areas that are capable of handling that. I think we
					 could improve on that. At the same time there is the cost of energy. We cannot
					 produce food without energy. They are the two most important items; they go
					 hand in hand.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I farmed way back in the 1960s, I got as much for
					 a bushel of barley then as they get today. I can guarantee the input cost for
					 energy was not anywhere near what it is now.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us address the energy problem. Let us do what we
					 can to relieve our farmers and producers of the headaches of where they are
					 going to get the money to buy fertilizer, where they are going to get the money
					 to pay for the power and how they are going to afford their fuel. What can we
					 do?</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I appreciate the two Liberals being here. However I am
					 disappointed that in a crisis of this nature, faced with the essential task of
					 feeding 31 million Canadians and keeping our commitment to the hungry in rest
					 of the world, members are not all here demanding that we stay seated until we
					 come up with resolutions that will solve the problem or at least head in that
					 direction. I am afraid I will wake up tomorrow morning and ask myself what it
					 was all worth because nothing will have changed.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will make one last comment before I shut it down.
					 Many do not want to diversify. They want value added goods and the wheat board
					 is a hindrance to that possibility. Let us think about that and look at what we
					 can do in those areas.</p>

					 to the Minister of Public Works and Government Services, Lib.):
				  </b>

	Mr. Chairman, as members well know, I am from an urban
					 riding next to Toronto and am one of the two Liberals who happen to be in House
					 right now. However members have been taking care of their work and making
					 calls. I was working in my office watching the debate and I wanted to come here
					 for a good reason: to show my support.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. member: </b>We appreciate that.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Paul Szabo:</b> Thanks. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Early in my career I had the pleasure of being
					 corporate treasurer of United Cooperatives of Ontario, an agricultural
					 co-operative which provided farm inputs. I learned an awful lot about the
					 agricultural community and it sensitized me to the reality of the family
					 farm.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The northeast of Ontario is mostly dairy and cattle and
					 the southwest is seed and grain. Their requirements are a little different in
					 terms of their inputs. I will share with the House a few things an urban person
					 learned about the farm, which I think Canadians would be interested to
					 know.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When there is an economic downturn in Canada farmers
					 are the first to suffer and the last to recover. That is the reality I saw in
					 the agricultural community in Ontario.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I learned about the technology of farming. It has been
					 changing dramatically, so much so that we can produce more food with many fewer
					 farms than we ever did before. That is a tremendous pressure on the family
					 farm. How can a family farm compete? Large corporations are buying up farms and
					 consolidating properties. They are able to negotiate with suppliers to get
					 significant savings on agricultural inputs that are not available to the small
					 family farm. Economies of scale are a big issue.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no question that the family farm is declining.
					 This is unfortunate but widespread. I listened to the speech of the hon. member
					 for Dufferin--Peel--Wellington--Grey. It was an excellent speech. He has a
					 plan. However the family farm needs help so I am here to lend my support. I am
					 here to say I support the agricultural industry and the family farm.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not have the current figures on food and our
					 economy. However Canadians should know that we are not just talking about the
					 livelihood of farmers. Only about 2% of the population are farmers. We are
					 talking about a major industry in Canada which employs an enormous number of
					 people outside the farm gate. I am talking about all the people involved in the
					 supply of inputs, fertilizers and chemicals. I am talking about the
					 Ciba-Geigys, the Monsantos and CF Industries in the U.S. which is a major
					 fertilizer supplier.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will give an example of the problems and cost issues
					 that used to come up. CF Industries used to make me strike a purchase price for
					 fertilizer months in advance of delivery. Because it came from the United
					 States, I had to make a decision on purchasing timing because there was a risk
					 on the foreign exchange side. We also had to pay in advance. Time is money and
					 this adds to the costs. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In considering this example of incremental costs to the
					 inputs of a farm operation, we can imagine how many other aspects of farming
					 are not typical. There are risks inherent in the agricultural industry. We know
					 about the tragic drought across Canada and other serious problems. We know
					 about the risks we face with regard to foot and mouth disease and the
					 safeguards being taken.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government of Canada is concerned about the
					 agricultural industry. Has it been able to do enough? I do not believe
					 so.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the pre-budgeting process we will get an
					 opportunity to show our support by talking with colleagues like the hon. member
					 for Miramichi who has been such a sound spokesman on behalf of the Canadian
					 farm. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government of Canada will make sure it is there in
					 situations of economic downturn where farmers are the first to suffer and the
					 last to recover. It will be there on behalf of all Canadians because it values
					 our food supply. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I cannot overstate the fact that the Government of
					 Canada spends an enormous amount to protect the quality and safety of our food
					 supply. It is another cost to taxpayers but an important one. If the safety of
					 our food supply is in jeopardy Canadians as a whole will suffer. Seventy-five
					 per cent of our exports go to the United States. A large percentage of that,
					 around 80%, is agricultural production. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am here tonight as an urban member of parliament with
					 a bit of knowledge of the agriculture industry. I know enough about it to know
					 it is important. I favour continued support for the agricultural community.
					 Seeds and grains were the hardest hit by the drought in the last round. However
					 it is not the only tragedy we have had in the agricultural industry. Canada
					 must be vigilant about how to protect the things that are most important to us.
					 I cannot think of anything more important to Canada right now than the security
					 of our food supply.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I thank members for participating in the debate. It is
					 important that Canadians know we care about agriculture.</p>


	<A NAME="Int-52917"></A><a HREF="#Int-52919"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-52914"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Charlie Penson (Peace River,
					 Canadian Alliance): </b>

	Mr. Chairman, when my hon. colleague from
					 Selkirk--Interlake asked for this emergency debate, I was of two minds as to
					 whether or not to participate. I have been involved in several emergency
					 debates on agriculture in the almost nine years that I have been in the House
					 and I honestly have to say that I am very discouraged. In fact I despair for
					 the way agriculture has been treated and what the future is for agriculture in
					 Canada.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even though my colleague who just spoke said that he
					 realizes the importance of the industry, in general terms I do not think the
					 government recognizes its importance. I fail to understand how any government
					 could ignore a basic industry which produces food for our country and think
					 that it could build a modern economy if there is no security in our food
					 supply. Is it going to let our farmers disappear and die? We can import corn
					 into eastern Canada from the United States and we can import canola cheaper
					 from the European Union because of all the subsidies, but some day that may
					 change. If it changes, I suggest we will be in big trouble and it may not be as
					 far off as we think.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In terms of security, we have seen what happened to the
					 United States. We always think that things like that happen far away from us.
					 My colleague from Elk Island talked about Ukraine. The Soviet Union had a
					 deliberate policy to starve out the people of Ukraine in the 1920s and 1930s.
					 Twenty million people perished because of that kind of policy. Any nation that
					 does not have the ability or the foresight to look after its food supply is in
					 jeopardy.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why has the government chosen not to look after our
					 farmers? We know that other countries have looked after their farmers. There
					 are many ways of doing it. There is the subsidy route which the European Union
					 chose. There are other methods. Canada continues to charge high taxes on fuel
					 and fertilizer. We have heard this before. It is not as if the government does
					 not choose to do the same thing with other sectors. Agriculture is obviously
					 not a priority area for the government.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Grants and subsidies are going to businesses all the
					 time. We are about to have another one hit us here next week regarding Air
					 Canada. It wants $3 billion to $4 billion. I suggest the track record of the
					 Liberal government will mean that it gets it. Yes, the airline industry is an
					 important industry. What about Bombardier? Since January 1 it has come to the
					 government twice. It was given a $1.7 billion loan guarantee to sell jets to
					 Air Wisconsin and there was another one shortly after for $1.3 billion. Why?
					 Because the competition is unfairly subsidizing its product and we have to keep
					 pace. Does that sound vaguely familiar?</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The European Union subsidizes its farmers to the extent
					 of about ten times as much as Canadian farmers get. Not only is it supplying
					 its own needs which we can accept, but it is using those export subsidies to
					 steal our other markets in third world countries. Our farmers are withering and
					 dying. I have been at functions and meetings with farmers. I have seen 30 farm
					 wives in tears wondering how their farms are going to survive. Many of them did
					 not survive. In the last few years there has been great devastation. We can
					 choose to go down that road.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the members opposite said there has always been
					 change and fewer family farms. That is true and it will continue to happen.
					 Some farmers will survive. What about the fairness aspect of this? We can find
					 money for Bombardier. We can find money to give to Pratt &amp; Whitney and
					 General Electric. HRDC grants of over $1 billion seem to go missing. McGill
					 University asked for a grant of $60,000 out of that program and it was sent
					 $160,000. That is the kind of nonsense that goes on. When farmers come knocking
					 at the door, they are told there is not enough money and that they will just
					 have to survive.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What about cultural grants? Yes, culture is a very
					 important thing. We all need culture, but if we do not have a base economy,
					 what kind of culture are we going to have in the future?</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What about Shawinigan? We have money to give to hotel
					 builders in Shawinigan to build hotels, conference centres and so
					 on.</p>


	<A NAME="T1900"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1900"><!-- Hour: 7--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1905"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1855"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1900)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us assume that they had chosen not to give money to
					 agriculture because it is not a priority area. How else could we help farmers?
					 We could help farmers by getting out of the intervention that takes place. When
					 farmers realized they could not look to the federal government for any more
					 money, they would want to operate on a market basis and would find the markets
					 to sell their product. However, if they did that the federal government would
					 tell them that they had to sell their product to the Canadian Wheat Board,
					 which will not let the farmer export. He might live five miles from the
					 Canada-U.S, but he cannot take it across the border. He has to get a licence
					 from the Canadian Wheat Board. It is more intervention and more control.
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What about the Canadian Grain Commission? If some
					 Canadian companies want to sell products that have 5% dockage and 95% product,
					 wheat for example, to customers who want them, they cannot do that. The
					 Canadian Grain Commission will not allow them to do it. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What about the transportation side? Farmers want to
					 have a transportation, market driven system. They cannot have that because we
					 have the Canada Transportation Act which limits what they can do. They also
					 have to involve the Canadian Wheat Board which says they cannot have rail cars
					 to ship their product unless it tells them to do so.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a lack of concern by the government in terms
					 of trying to give some financial help to farmers. There is a lack of concern
					 about letting them go their own way, like New Zealand. When New Zealand thought
					 it was too heavy going and it had to get out of the subsidy business, it at
					 least took the reins off the industry and let it go to a market industry so
					 that railways could reduce their cost of doing business and people were not
					 constricted in what they had to do in terms of monopoly situations. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the government cannot help farmers it should get out
					 of the way. That is what I say to the Liberals across the way. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have heard some good speeches from the other side. I
					 asked the chairman of the agriculture committee to take the committee to Grande
					 Prairie a couple of years ago, in the Peace River country, an area that
					 produces as much grain as the entire province of Manitoba. It would have been
					 the first time the committee had ever been in my riding. I asked it to come to
					 hear the concerns of the people. Yes, it came and I was grateful for
					 it.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the chairman, Mr. Harvard, started, I was a little
					 tough on him. Some of the members of my riding asked me why I was being so
					 tough on the Liberals because they seemed like good people. I told them that
					 was fine, but to wait to see what they would deliver. They delivered great
					 promises. There were speeches afterward at the chamber of commerce, and they
					 got good press. They said they were listening, that they were our best friends
					 and that they would do something. It never happened. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why are we dubious? I have been here nine years and it
					 is the same old story. We have these debates and yes, things will happen. We
					 asked the Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food for $500 million. The
					 government could not do it. It rolled over money from one year to the next to
					 make it look like it was doing something. I think it is just too little. If the
					 government cannot help, it should get out of the way and let farmers choose
					 their own course. That is what we need.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This year we have a devastating drought in many parts
					 of the prairies. Also, in Ontario some of the other speakers have identified
					 problem areas. That is the latest, but it has happened many times before in
					 different forms. What have farmers come to expect of government? They have come
					 to expect some help in these times. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We had major rains in one sector of the Peace River
					 country. I applied to the Disaster Services Board. It said no. If a farmer took
					 crop insurance he did not qualify. What happened in Ontario after the ice
					 storm? The government could not wait to get cheques into the hands of those
					 people. In fact, there were advances before the claims were even made. It was
					 the same with the flood in the Saguenay. Let us try treating people equally and
					 fairly in this country for a change.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We see where the Liberals are coming from. They are
					 looking after certain sectors. They do not look after others. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think I know why the Prime Minister did not come to
					 Saskatchewan when it was looking for major help a couple of years ago. The
					 Liberal candidate in Saskatoon summed it up quite nicely in the last election.
					 She said “If you don't elect me, you're getting nothing”.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I see my colleagues from Saskatoon here. On this side
					 of the House people will not take that kind of silliness in politics. We want
					 fairness in this country. If the government will not give us fairness, it
					 should get out of our way and let farmers choose their own course of action.

					 Alliance): </b>

	Mr. Chairman, I appreciate your patience here tonight
					 and your presence is certainly appreciated.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the recent crisis in the United States has
					 overshadowed the more common domestic problems in Canada, we must not forget
					 about the stresses and setbacks of our citizens. The people I would like to
					 talk about today are our Canadian farmers.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the past several years it has been clear that the
					 federal government is unwilling or indeed unable to come to grips with a
					 serious farm income problem in Canada. While the federal and provincial
					 ministers recently announced a long term vision for the future of agriculture,
					 this proposal ignored the immediate income crisis facing grain and oilseeds
					 farmers.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While continuing to develop a long term goal for
					 Canadian agriculture is important, more immediate steps need to be taken to
					 ensure that farm families can afford to stay on the farm. Canada needs to
					 develop a plan to put more money into the pockets of farmers immediately.
					 However, instead of implementing practical solutions, the federal government
					 has shown nothing but inaction. Its failure to recognize the grave income
					 problem our farmers face will mean that many families will lose their farms,
					 indeed many corporations who run farms will lose their business. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not just a problem in western Canada. This year
					 in particular we have heard how Canadian farmers from coast to coast are
					 suffering severe drought conditions as well as extremely low commodity
					 prices.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If Canadians want to know where the water went, it went
					 to southeastern Manitoba where we have been suffering nothing but flood. Fields
					 are under water and we have serious problems with getting our crops in. We have
					 serious problems with our forage crops and with cattle. In my riding we have
					 had an abundance of water. If there was a way to distribute this water across
					 the prairies or into Ontario, I would love to see that solution. However that
					 is the reality of dealing with weather in Canada.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking specifically of the drought situation, the
					 federal agency that was set up to help farmers and ranchers with their problem
					 with the lack of water, the PFRA ran out of money just four days after the
					 beginning of this fiscal year.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Crops of all kinds have been seriously affected this
					 season. A Statistics Canada survey of 5,900 Saskatchewan farmers suggested that
					 spring wheat production will fall 18% from last year. Canola production will
					 fall 38%. Durum wheat will fall 49% from last year to the lowest level in
					 recent history. Corn production is down 20% and soybean production is down 25%.
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Problems like drought cannot always be anticipated or
					 prevented and for that reason it is extremely crucial that government improve
					 upon the existing safety net programs to ensure that they meet the needs of
					 farmers. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sadly, the federal Liberal government continues to fail
					 Canadian farmers with its lack of an effective agriculture policy. The Canadian
					 wheat farmer receives only 11% of his income from government. Compare that to
					 58% for European grain farmers and 46% for American farmers. Yet instead of
					 providing direct support for Canadian farmers until we can persuade the
					 Europeans and the Americans to reduce their subsidy levels our minister of
					 agriculture simply shrugs and says, “If you don't like it get out of the
					 business”.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was very pleased to hear my colleague from Peace
					 River mention the national security aspect of food production because one need
					 only look at history to realize that when we lose control of food production we
					 lose our country. It is an inevitable connection. If we ignore food production
					 here and allow others to produce it, we will lose our country. This is a
					 national security issue that the government simply does not
					 recognize.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Farmers have been ignored and sidelined by the federal
					 Liberal government for years, but our nation rests on the backs of these
					 farmers. Now Canadian farmers are having to face not just what have become the
					 more common problems of debt, drought and flood. They are being hit from all
					 sides by ill-advised government policies. For example, the legislation dealing
					 with cruelty to animals, Bill C-15 currently before the House, has the
					 potential to adversely affect normal farming practices. In the bill we see
					 significant alterations in the underlying principles related to animal
					 offences. It is something that needs to be very carefully
					 considered.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The justice minister has attempted to assure members of
					 the House and the Canadian public that the bill is not intended to target
					 farmers or others who use animals legitimately. She has promised that these
					 changes do not in any way negatively affect the many legitimate activities that
					 involve animals such as hunting, farming, medical or scientific research. I can
					 only ask this question. If it is not intended to change legitimately the way we
					 deal with animals, then why do we need these substantive changes? It is
					 creating anxiety and concerns among farmers.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the minister were to stand and say that we needed
					 tougher penalties against those who were cruel to animals, I and I think every
					 member of the House would agree with that, but there is something much more
					 behind this legislation. It has nothing to do with more severe penalties. There
					 is an animal rights agenda here that is designed to drive farmers out of
					 business and the Liberal government is buying into the policy. No member across
					 the way will stand up and tell farmers that they will not allow a narrow
					 political agenda to jeopardize the farmers' livelihoods.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other issue again is ill-advised government policy
					 driven not by members of the House, not the two good Liberal members I see
					 across the way, but by the secret bureaucrats who drive these agendas. Who are
					 they? Who would have advised the minister to introduce this type of
					 legislation? Probably the same bureaucrats or policy advisers who brought in
					 Bill C-68.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What does that have to do with agriculture? It has
					 everything to do with agriculture. It criminalizes activities of hunters and
					 farmers. It is just another government program to worry about; half a billion
					 dollars that it has been dumped down the drain. That half billion dollars could
					 go to our farmers in direct supports. It could go to national security.
					 However, to set up programs to aggravate hunters and farmers and to allow
					 criminals to escape simply is not acceptable.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have had the opportunity to put a few thoughts on the
					 record. I thank the House for its patience and indulgence.</p>

					 (Saskatoon—Wanuskewin, Canadian Alliance): </b>

	Mr. Chairman, it is an honour and, in some sense, sad
					 that I am here participating in this debate. I am sure other members would
					 prefer not to be here and that things were going well in the farming
					 communities across the country.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I speak particularly on behalf of the farmers of the
					 Saskatoon--Wanuskewin constituency, but we know there is a major problem for
					 Canadian farmers and agriculture producers from coast to coast who are
					 suffering from drought conditions. They are facing some real burdens these
					 days. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has been fairly obvious over a number of years and
					 even of late that the Liberal government does not have, as any kind of
					 priority, the needs of farm families in rural Canada. It may say that it is not
					 in its interest nor in the national interest, but it is very wrong on that. At
					 a time like this, it is in the national interest to sustain and assist those
					 who put food on our tables day by day. It is in the interest of each of us,
					 three times a day at least.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Liberal agriculture minister refuses to acknowledge
					 that there is a crisis. We see him responding in the House in a rather
					 lacklustre fashion refusing to acknowledge the depth of the ongoing farm crisis
					 and the exacerbating impact of the drought across our country. At times, when
					 he is pressed on it, he comes up with a briefing package that nicely itemizes
					 or details all the help available to farmers, but it proves to be rather
					 pitiful. It may look great on paper but there is not a lot of cash or dollars
					 on the table when it comes right down to it.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Overall yields are down very significantly across the
					 country, anywhere from 20% or better in the prairies. Surely in this session
					 the time has come for farmers to get some help and receive deliverance. The
					 government ought to finally follow through in terms of the many years of
					 promises of a solid, long term farm safety net program. We need it and we have
					 been insisting on it, and there is no better time than these days ahead to put
					 that into practice.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During this session of parliament we hope the Liberals
					 will view those who till the soil as at least equal to some of the companies
					 across other parts of the country, such as Bombardier, that make up the
					 so-called new economy. Air Canada has asked Ottawa for some $3 billion to $4
					 billion or it may have to file for bankruptcy. Well the fact is that many
					 farmers have already had to file for bankruptcy and it has created enormous
					 distress. Help lines have been set up across the west and elsewhere in the
					 country. Forgive us if we fail to see the justice in a possible $3 billion to
					 $4 billion bailout if the government goes down that road.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Liberals have failed to clearly address the root
					 causes of the farm income crisis which has been further hampered by the drought
					 arriving on the heels of disastrously low commodity prices. Farmers need
					 immediate emergency financial help and they need it now.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Canadian Alliance has a plan which we have laid out
					 very clearly over a period of time after consultations with farmers and by
					 holding town hall meetings. It is a plan to deal with the immediate crisis and
					 includes a long term vision so that our agriculture industry becomes as vibrant
					 as it once was in the country.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is obvious, if one looks at the record in
					 <i>Hansard</i>, in committee and so on, that the Alliance considers agriculture
					 as one of its top parliamentary priorities. Everyone can be assured that the
					 Alliance's efforts on behalf of farmers will not abate.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This was the fifth driest year on record for my
					 province of Saskatchewan, but I do not want to seem to be concerned only about
					 my backyard. I had the opportunity to spend some time in the maritimes this
					 past summer travelling with our leader, the member for Okanagan--Coquihalla.
					 When we were in the province of New Brunswick we saw some of the effects of the
					 drought. New Brunswick received only 17.3 millimetres of rain in July compared
					 with normal precipitation in the range of about 102 millimetres.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Livestock producers are searching for water and are
					 being forced to sell off their land in parts of the country. The impact of the
					 drought is hurting cattle ranchers in B.C., on the prairies, in Quebec, in
					 Ontario and in the maritimes.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Medicine Hat office of the PFRA has estimated that
					 95% of surface water in southern Alberta is depleted. Some of those pastures
					 may bounce back, but they will not regain full productivity until maybe a
					 decade down the road.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we visited New Brunswick we saw that ranchers and
					 farmers are hurting because of the drought or the lack of rain. They estimate
					 that their forage crops will be down by 25% to 40% in that province.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will describe some of the impacts in Saskatchewan and
					 the riding of Saskatoon--Wanuskewin which I have the privilege to represent.
					 Oilseed production is down. Canola production is down by 38% from last year.
					 Durum wheat has fallen by 49%, almost by half from last year, to the lowest
					 level in recent history.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The drought is not only affecting the west or my
					 backyard but also Ontario. Corn production is down by 20%. Soybean production
					 is down by 25%.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We met with the head of the potato board of the Prince
					 Edward Island Federation of Agriculture. He indicated to us that the lack of
					 rain was expected to cut the 2001 yield crop of vegetables by at least half, if
					 not more. That reduces the gross farm revenue by at least $62.5 million. This
					 is pretty significant. It is not an isolated or remote spot in Saskatchewan. It
					 is in different parts of the country.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I draw to everyone's attention some of the things that
					 must be done, as has already been suggested by members. We have had years of
					 neglect by the Liberal government. We are now faced with the drought and the
					 impact of disastrously low commodity prices. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The minister of agriculture needs to get a special
					 committee together to carefully analyze the grains and oilseed sector crisis we
					 face.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ranchers are asking for something that is very
					 reasonable. They are liquidating their herds because of the drought. They want
					 to be able to defer the tax on that sale for at least one year to allow them to
					 repurchase breeding stock. Asking for that one year extension is not
					 unreasonable.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members of the official opposition on this side of the
					 House have often talked of how existing safety net programs need to be
					 dramatically improved to ensure they meet the needs of our farmers. Some of the
					 suggestions for change have come from our agriculture critic, the hon. member
					 for Selkirk--Interlake. I commend him for the consistent job he has been doing
					 over a considerable time keeping us rallied, focused and hammering on this
					 issue. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With respect to existing safety net programs, the crop
					 insurance program needs to be significantly improved to ensure that it covers
					 all the costs that producers incur in seeding their crop.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The regulations surrounding natural disasters need to
					 be amended to ensure that farmers receive compensation for inputs lost due to
					 natural disasters, as we are facing now. If that had been in place in
					 southeastern Saskatchewan and southwestern Manitoba, they would have received
					 disaster assistance on the other side of the equation when they had flooded
					 farmland back in 1998.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The net income stabilization account must be made more
					 accessible. I have talked to countless farmers on numerous occasions who have
					 told me how they need to be able to get better access to NISA. The calculation
					 of NISA eligible costs should be adjusted to include grain transportation costs
					 as well. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have suggested other practical things such as
					 reducing the costs imposed on farmers by the federal government. We have some
					 pretty excessive taxes on things like farm fuel, user fees, taxes on taxes, and
					 taxes on inputs.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We need to encourage farmer driven value added
					 processing. The Canadian Wheat Board market monopoly is a hindrance that gets
					 in the way. It should get out of the way so that farmers can get on with the
					 job. That is what farmers want. They want marketing choice. Farmers' costs
					 should be reduced by modernizing the grain handling and transportation
					 system.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Canadian Alliance policies have been built through
					 continued consultations with farmers and farm groups. We put together the
					 action for struggling agriculture producers, ASAP for short. It heard from more
					 than 3,500 farmers at 70 different meetings in five provinces.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The member for Battlefords--Lloydminster was very
					 instrumental in that and a key player. It was pushed forward by our lead
					 critic, the hon. member for Selkirk--Interlake. Our consultations will not
					 stop. They will continue.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have put in considerable effort and we need to build
					 on that. Our leader, the member for Okanagan--Coquihalla, has been in the
					 forefront of this in Parliament. After the last election there was a letter to
					 the Prime Minister and we have gone after this in question period time and
					 again. We have made almost a hundred statements on the issue. A variety of farm
					 issues have come up that we have pressed on and that we will continue to press
					 on.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We had a vote in the House asking for an additional
					 $400 million in emergency help and the Liberals voted it down. The Canadian
					 Alliance will continue the fight. We will fight for farmers. We have been
					 leading the fight for farmers in recent years and we will continue. For more
					 details on these efforts I would ask all those interested to visit our
					 agriculture website at www.canadianalliance.ca\agriculture.</p>

					 Canadian Alliance): </b>

	Mr. Chairman, on behalf of the people from Surrey
					 Central I am very pleased to participate in this debate on the agricultural
					 industry. I would also like to extend my thanks to our agriculture critics, the
					 hon. member for Selkirk--Interlake and the hon. member for Cypress
					 Hills--Grasslands, who have done an excellent job in being proactive and
					 listening to the farmers about their concerns time after time.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can tell viewers as well as members that before doing
					 my M.B.A. I did my first degree in agriculture honours at the number one
					 university in Asia, Punjab Agricultural University. I mention this because the
					 university worked together with the government of Punjab state and brought
					 about a green revolution in the state. The Punjab has an area of about 2% of
					 the country but it produces over 70% of the food for the whole country. This
					 shows how effective a government role, as well as that of an institution, can
					 be in bringing about a green revolution.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the agricultural perspective here in Canada, when
					 I compare it with my experience of agriculture in India, I believe that the
					 government approach in Canada is one of neglect, not only in the budget, health
					 care or various other areas such as defence, organized crime, terrorism and so
					 on, but specifically in agriculture. Farmers have not been listened to by
					 government in regard to their problems and neither does the government appear
					 to be looking forward to addressing the problems. I do not see any political
					 will from the government to address those issues.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. member:</b> I don't see any
					 politicians.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Gurmant Grewal:</b> Exactly. Attendance in the
					 House shows that only one Liberal member is listening to the debate. I thank
					 him for being here.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canada is geographically the second largest country in
					 the world. We can be number one in agriculture or at least make our
					 agricultural accomplishments known at the international level. Remember that
					 when we visit other countries people talk about Canadian wheat, but given the
					 circumstances the farmers are surrounded by here I think it is a pity for the
					 farming industry in general.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few weeks ago I toured some farms in my constituency
					 of Surrey Central. I was amazed by the particular initiatives of the farmers
					 and how well some can do by diversification because they cannot survive with
					 traditional farming practices. One farmer ventured into herb production and
					 that farm is the largest herb and special plant producer in North America.
					 Another farmer went into blueberries, Purewal Farms, and it is also the largest
					 blueberry farm in North America.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some smart farmers are shifting from traditional
					 farming, and the government has to address that issue.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have noticed so many particular issues like the wheat
					 board, for example. Why would government interfere with the marketing of a
					 specific commodity? Similarly, there is the labour code. Farm workers cannot
					 apply for employment insurance. I compare that with the fishery industry. Why
					 is there a double standard? The farmers do face crises in labour.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some farmers told me that their vehicles were stopped
					 on the road for safety inspections and their labourers, who worked hard all day
					 from early in the morning until late in the evening, were left sitting on the
					 side of the road for four and half hours. Why would the inspectors not go to
					 the farms and examine the vehicles there?</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are so many things to consider, like pesticides.
					 In Canada we of course want to be environmentally friendly and protect our
					 environment, but certain pesticides are banned in Canada and not in the U.S. I
					 understand where the government is coming from but look at the impact. Farm
					 produce from the U.S., where those pesticides are used and help make farming
					 more economical, is allowed into Canada and consumed in the Canadian market.
					 Why not have standardization and look at it from the perspective of making our
					 industry competitive? I believe that the farm industry in general is a
					 business. Why is the business not profitable? It should be
					 profitable.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We see the dumping of produce into the Canadian market,
					 for example, tomatoes. I visited some B.C. hothouses, which are greenhouses
					 where tomatoes are produced. They are having a crisis because the government

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similarly with crop insurance, I notice that for the
					 fruit producers in the Okanagan Valley when there is a climatic catastrophe the
					 crops are not being properly insured, because crop insurance is a major issue
					 for those farmers.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are so many other issues I can mention but my
					 time is up. I believe that the government should listen to the farmers, be
					 proactive and make the farming industry profitable in Canada rather than having
					 farmers selling farms and facing this crisis. Now that we have the recent
					 situation of drought in the agricultural community, farmers are facing
					 unprecedented difficulties. The Liberal government is completely ignoring the
					 needs of the family farms and it is ruining rural Canada. The costs of the
					 ongoing farming crisis and the impact of the drought are significant and the
					 government needs to address that. The low commodity prices are affecting the
					 farmers and the government is completely ignoring that too. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe the government should pay attention, look
					 into the root causes of these problems and develop a strategic plan whereby the
					 farmers are assured that they should have confidence in this industry and make
					 their industry useful for the country, not only for the farmers but for the 31
					 million of us living in Canada.</p>
