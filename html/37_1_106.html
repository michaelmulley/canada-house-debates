	Mr. Speaker, I would like to take a moment to commend a
					 unique money management seminar for senior high school students that is
					 organized by the Canadian Bankers Association. This seminar entitled “There's
					 something about money” focuses on introducing good financial basics to
					 students. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I had the opportunity to participate in one of these
					 seminars in my riding at David and Mary Thompson Collegiate. As a result of
					 these seminars 94% of students felt better equipped to prepare for their
					 financial future. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prior to these seminars 46% of the students said they
					 were not preparing for their financial future. The comments of students
					 indicated a strong interest in all facets of the program, with particular
					 emphasis in areas involving compound interest, credit rating and post-secondary
					 assistance. </p>

	Mr. Speaker, Canadians trust their government to use
					 CIDA funds for the poor countries of the world, not for pre-election
					 communication work in the riding of the Minister for International
					 Cooperation.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is obvious that the minister tiptoed around treasury
					 board guidelines to avoid public scrutiny. However the issue is an ethical one
					 about who was involved, the timing, if work was actually done and what kind. It
					 is morally wrong for political campaigners to replace public service PR staff
					 in a minister's riding, particularly just before an election. These actions
					 would surely benefit the minister's election campaign, not the poor
					 countries.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is an hypocritical abuse of public funds by a
					 minister whose role is to promote good governance in poor countries, which is
					 why I am calling for an immediate investigation by the ethics counsellor and
					 for her immediate resignation.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, this week is National 4-H Week. The
					 historical roots of the Canadian 4-H program are solidly grounded in rural
					 Canada.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The program originated for the purposes of improving
					 agriculture, increasing and bettering production, and enriching rural life. Its
					 beginnings were inspired by energetic and idealistic agricultural officials,
					 dedicated school teachers, and others committed to ensuring that young rural
					 Canadians learned important skills to succeed on and off the farm.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today's programs continue to serve primarily rural
					 communities but they do not have to live on a farm to join. Open to all youths,
					 male and female between the ages of 8 and 21, 4-H focuses on developing well
					 rounded responsible and independent citizens. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members participate in technical skills development
					 projects as well as other fun activities. There are 2,600 4-H clubs across
					 Canada with over 35,000 members completing 53,000 projects yearly. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I congratulate 4-H members and their leaders throughout
					 Canada for all the hard work they do and recognize the importance of their
					 organization.</p>

					 70% of the out of court settlements reached with former Indian residential

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The federal government forced aboriginal children to go
					 to residential schools for over a century. It delayed the settlement of the
					 Indian residential school claims for many years forcing these people to go to
					 court. Then the government further delayed the court cases by dragging the
					 churches into the lawsuits.</p>

					 forced into bankruptcy. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why will it not do the right thing as Grand Chief

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, the oil refinery at Come by Chance,

	Mr. Speaker, for weeks we have asked the solicitor
					 general for information related to people arrested and possible terrorist
					 activity in Canada and in the United States. We have asked this to protect
					 Canadian citizens. For weeks the solicitor general has scorned us and has said
					 that he cannot talk publicly about this because it could put people at
					 risk.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yesterday, in front of the entire world, he announced
					 that CSIS has given important information to the United States. There is no
					 problem with it giving the U.S. information, but he announced an ongoing
					 operation publicly.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Does the Prime Minister think it is appropriate for the
					 solicitor general to be standing out in public giving public information about
					 ongoing CSIS operations? </p>

					 the last three years have had very substantial pay increases, as have those in
					 the regular force. There is a proposal that will involve some readjustment,
					 some realignment. Some will get a reduction. Even more than that will get an
					 increase.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Overall the entire reserve force of some 21,000 is
					 receiving increases. Reservists will also receive better training and better
					 equipment and they will play a very meaningful role in terms of the Canadian
					 forces of the country.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, the Minister of Transport has decided to

					 service between Montreal and Alma, once again showing his prejudice against
					 regional carriers.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Does the minister realize that by helping only the

					 unfair competitive advantage over small regional carriers such as Air
					 Alma?</p>

	Mr. Speaker, today in the House I had occasion to ask a
					 number of questions and to receive some answers. My concern is not with the
					 direct answers that I received although the answers themselves were less than
					 satisfactory. I am also concerned about some extraneous comments that were
					 placed on the record afterward. I am very concerned and I think I am in order
					 to stand to ensure that those remarks are withdrawn from the record.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In further response to the question that I had posed of
					 the minister, asking her why the House should agree to jeopardize the civil
					 liberties of religious and political groups in Canada when she could not
					 explain why those provisions were in the legislation, she provided an answer
					 and then later she stated words to the effect: since when did you guys care
					 about civil liberties. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These words will appear in <i>Hansard</i> and they are
					 unparliamentary. The record will demonstrate that I care very much about civil
					 liberties and I know that the Canadian Alliance cares very much about civil
					 liberties. It is not inconsistent to be concerned about security while
					 all--</p>

	I am sorry but it does not sound like a good point of

					 seems to me I may have heard them before from both sides of the House and did
					 not rule them unparliamentary. </p>

	Mr. Speaker, I am proud to rise to present two quite
					 different petitions which relate to the same topic. The petitions relate to end
					 stage kidney disease. They have been developed in the Peterborough area by Ken
					 Sharp, a person who has been on kidney dialysis his entire adult
					 life.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first petition deals with support for research
					 regarding the bioartificial kidney. As we know, the bioartificial kidney is an
					 experimental implant device which would greatly improve the situation of those
					 who have end stage kidney disease. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The petitioners call on parliament to support the
					 bioartificial kidney which would eventually eliminate the need for both
					 dialysis and transplantation for those suffering from kidney
					 disease.</p>

	My second petition, as I said, is related but is quite
					 different. It concerns the Canadian Institutes of Health Research and its
					 Institute of Nutrition, Metabolism and Diabetes which does wonderful work for
					 kidney research. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many of my constituents believe that work would be more
					 effective if the name of the institute included the word kidney. They call on
					 parliament to encourage the Canadian Institutes of Health Research to
					 explicitly include kidney research as one of the institutes in its system. They
					 ask that it be named the Institute of Kidney and Urinary Tract
					 Diseases.</p>

					 Transport, Lib.) </b>

	moved that Bill C-38, an act to amend the Air
					 Canada Public Participation Act, be read the second time and
					 referred to a committee.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said: Mr. Speaker, it is a pleasure to rise to speak
					 to Bill C-38 this afternoon to try to get the sense of the House on furthering
					 the improvement of airlines in Canada. This is a very short bill and it has one
					 purpose: to amend the Air Canada Public Participation Act to eliminate the 15%
					 limit on ownership of voting shares in Air Canada by any one person. I hope
					 there will be speedy passage of the bill.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As most people know because we have been engaged in the
					 airline file for a number of years Air Canada took on Canadian Airlines a
					 couple of years ago. Over the last couple of years it has done a remarkably
					 good job of merging the two airlines together. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There have been problems, not all of them of Air
					 Canada's making. Some had to do with bad weather in the summer of 2000. Others
					 had to do with the increase in air traffic when the economy was doing well.
					 There was also an inability to merge the workforces on time. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All these things came together to create a situation
					 that combined with high fuel prices and a declining economy in the last year
					 caused problems for Air Canada before the events of September 11. Air Canada
					 had publicly stated its need to get its house in order to attain more equity
					 before September 11. The events of September 11 have compounded the problem and
					 there is no question that Air Canada, as other airlines, requires a new
					 infusion of equity.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of the constraints parliament imposed when Air
					 Canada was privatized, it was impossible for the normal kinds of investment to
					 occur in Air Canada that occur in other public corporations in the country.
					 Investors who wanted a say in the direction of the company were stymied because
					 of the legislation and the restriction on voting shares. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we are asking the House to eliminate the limit on
					 individual ownership it would be useful to give a bit of the history as to why
					 the limit was imposed in the first place. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Air Canada was privatized in 1988 and 1989 under the
					 enabling legislation which is before us and which would be amended by this
					 bill. At the time the act contained a section that limited individual ownership
					 of voting shares to 10%. The justification for the 10% limit was to ensure that
					 voting shares would be as widely held as possible by Canadians.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most people do not realize that the 10% limit was
					 accompanied by a prohibition on association between persons who hold voting
					 shares. This was designed to ensure these persons could not act together and
					 take control thereby nullifying the concept of a widely held company. At the
					 time no one thought much about that and the bill was passed. The 10%
					 restriction remained in place until the year 2000 when we raised it to 15% by
					 way of Bill C-26.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members may remember that leading up to that bill there
					 was an initiative by the government in the fall of 1999 to find a private
					 sector solution to the woes that were bedeviling Canadian airlines. As a result
					 of actions we took we precipitated a private sector solution. Two offers were
					 before Air Canada at the time. One was from Onex Corporation. The other was a
					 proposal that originated with the management of Air Canada. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will not go into all the details, but people know
					 that Onex withdrew and subsequently Air Canada's management made good on its
					 promise to take over Canadian Airlines subject to certain restrictions. At the
					 time in December 1999 there were intense negotiations between the government
					 and Air Canada because with the demise of Canadian Airlines there would be one
					 large carrier with 82% of the capacity in the country. </p>


	<A NAME="T1520"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1520"><!-- Hour: 3--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1525"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1515"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1520)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a result of those negotiations, Air Canada decided
					 on certain guarantees with respect to no involuntary layoffs and service to
					 small communities. It has made good on its promises. I emphasize that during
					 those discussions at any time the Air Canada board of directors was free to
					 walk away from that initiative. It made a conscientious business decision which
					 it had to live with in good times and in bad.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course the times right now are not as good. That is
					 why the original objection by Air Canada management to changing the 10% and
					 having single shareholders potentially own the company has changed. It has
					 publicly stated its willingness to agree to this kind of a change. It is in
					 agreement with it. Therefore I cannot see any great controversy.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The decision to move to the 15% limit was one we felt
					 was at least in keeping with other crown corporations such as Canadian National
					 Railways. We cannot take that particular comparison too far because the
					 ownership limits on former crown corporations have been tailored to the
					 specific industry sector. CN and Petro-Canada for example have a 15% limit but
					 no limits on non-residents. Nordion for example has no individual share
					 ownership limits except for the 25% for non-residents. Major Canadian banks
					 will allow 20% but there is a fitness test. What we are proposing for Air
					 Canada is appropriate to the Canadian air services sector at this time in our
					 history.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I said there has been some degree of support for
					 this from Air Canada. In coming to the decision to remove the limit, I have
					 been told by a number of people that any limit in the past has been a
					 disincentive to an investor with serious intentions when investing to have a
					 say in the company. That is why we have decided to re-examine the entire
					 operation and to ensure that there is an equity infusion into Air
					 Canada.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have been fully engaged with all of the airlines
					 since September 11 to look at their finances and ascertain their financial
					 health. Obviously they have been adversely affected, as have airlines around
					 the world. What we see in Canada is not unique to us; it is something that is
					 being played out elsewhere.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We know what the United States government has done in
					 the aftermath of the terrorist attacks. It came forward with a $15 billion
					 package for the airlines, $5 billion for immediate compensation, $10 billion
					 for loan guarantees. There was another $3 billion included in the $40 billion
					 appropriations bill for reconstruction specifically for security measures. As I
					 have said publicly, we are examining the efficacy of the Government of Canada
					 taking on more of those security costs.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have watched with some concern as airlines have
					 faced difficulty. They have all reduced capacity and made many adjustments.
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just last week I announced a loan guarantee package for
					 Canada 3000. That airline met certain objectives such as equity infusion by
					 investors, reduction in capacity, the paring of workforces and most important,
					 a business plan that would restore Canada 3000 to profitability.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What I said publicly last Thursday night is that kind
					 of program will be available for the five principal airlines in the country
					 that cover 95% of the market. I realize from questions in question period there
					 are other smaller carriers that would like to avail themselves of a similar
					 loan guarantee program, but they were covered in the initial compensation
					 program. They were covered, as were all the airlines and airports, by our
					 agreement to pick up the war risk liability for 90 days, the third party
					 liability that was terminated by insurance companies which affected not only
					 Canada's air industry but air industries around the world. We did this for the
					 air carriers, the airports and Nav Canada. Everyone has benefited. </p>


	<A NAME="T1525"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1525"><!-- Hour: 3--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1530"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1520"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1525)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One has to draw the line somewhere in how far one goes
					 in terms of loan guarantees. That is why we have said the five largest carriers
					 that cover 95% of the market that are national in scope, they being Air Canada,
					 Air Transat, Canada 3000, WestJet and Sky Service, would be eligible for the
					 loan guarantee initiative. I am not sure that all of them will require
					 it.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no question that air traffic has come back to
					 some degree in the last number of weeks. It is gradually coming back to
					 approximate pre-September 11 levels. However, that is not the case certainly on
					 transborder traffic where there is still a significant reduction as compared to
					 the period prior to September 11.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In looking at Air Canada in particular, we have said
					 that perhaps by eliminating the single ownership limit the company would become
					 more attractive to investors. It would allow more of an infusion of equity. It
					 certainly would facilitate with the overall restructuring of the
					 company.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We come with the message that we are preoccupied with
					 the health of the transportation sector in general, but in particular the
					 airline industry. We have made a number of changes to security regulations and
					 safety regulations on board aircraft with the locking of cockpit doors and the
					 strengthening of cockpit doors. In fact last Friday after I boarded the plane
					 and before it left the gate, I was asked by an Air Canada pilot to see the new
					 measures that had been put in place. I was quite impressed with how quickly
					 that had been done and it had been done with the co-operation of Transport
					 Canada. This is being done not only here but in the U.S. and elsewhere around
					 the world. We are facilitating extra security on planes with the new
					 regulations.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hear my friend from the Alliance who is preoccupied
					 with Americana and wants the provision of armed security personnel to be
					 blanketed on Canadian aircraft. We have said yes for those flights to Reagan
					 national airport, specifically because the American government has said that is
					 a condition for Air Canada to go back to that airport. I think everyone in the
					 House understands that. Anyone who has flown into that airport knows its
					 proximity to the downtown core. It is not just any downtown core; it has the
					 seat of government of one of the largest nations, arguably the most powerful
					 nation in the world. Obviously there have to be some extra security provisions.
					 We have agreed to that because Air Canada is unique on the open skies treaty in
					 being able to use that airport. We did not want to inhibit Air Canada in any
					 way, so we have agreed that the RCMP, Canada's national police, will be on
					 those flights. I have said that we would consider it elsewhere. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, our preoccupation has been to ensure that
					 airport security be made more stringent and that those rules be put in place
					 quickly and be enforced. Yes, there is some inconsistency across the country,
					 but we are getting to that. We are dealing with that through
					 inspections.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was on the CBC town hall meeting last night. The
					 Leader of the Opposition was on the panel. I was very happy when he agreed that
					 the security regime has improved and that lineups at airports are diminishing
					 as people get through the new rules. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course the one disagreement, in terms of substance,
					 was the question of whether the government should go along with armed security
					 personnel. As I have said publicly, we have that under advisement.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have done much to help the airline industry and the
					 airports. There are new regulations, new security regulations. I have no doubt
					 that the security regime at Canadian airports, in the skies generally, and in
					 other parts of the world is much better than it was before. I thought it was
					 good before September 11 but it is much more stringent now. Canadians should
					 feel very comfortable in flying. Indeed gradually people are going back. Even
					 business class passengers who stayed away in droves following September 11 are
					 starting to travel again, even some of them to the United States.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our decision to amend the Air Canada Public
					 Participation Act at this time is to provide another kind of assistance to
					 Canada's largest carrier in its attempts to return to financial
					 stability.</p>


	<A NAME="T1530"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1530"><!-- Hour: 3--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1535"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1525"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1530)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Air Canada is the world's 11th largest airline. It is
					 an airline of which we can be proud. It has not been easy for Air Canada in the
					 last couple of years with some of the problems that it has undergone. However,
					 the quality of the professionals that work at Air Canada both in the air and on
					 the ground is unparalleled. The quality of service we get on Air Canada is
					 among the best in the world. It has been adjudged as such by international
					 bodies. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have an airline of which we can be proud. It is an
					 airline that is having some problems, but it is an airline which I think has
					 the ability to get over those problems. It is incumbent upon us as politicians
					 and upon the House in general to facilitate solutions, certainly private sector
					 solutions, on the part of our airlines, particularly Air Canada.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am confident that if we enact the bill it will
					 provide the private sector greater opportunities for investing in Air Canada
					 which will contribute to a successful restructuring of the company. With the
					 enactment of the bill, Air Canada will find itself on the same footing as all
					 of the other airlines. No one else has a single ownership limit. We are not at
					 this time proposing to raise the 25% foreign ownership limit. We do not think
					 that is necessary. We are being consistent with many other countries around the
					 world, including the United States, which keep that 25% limit. They believe
					 inherently that an industry so fundamental to the economy, the fibre and the
					 being of the country should indeed not only be operated by Canadians but
					 controlled in effect by Canadians. If we need to change that we would not need
					 legislation because current legislation allows that change to occur, at least
					 the raising of the limit from 25% to 49%, by order in council. However we do
					 not think that would be necessary. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We believe that the passage of the bill would be
					 timely. It would give Air Canada the investment. As I said before, it is a very
					 simple bill. It has three sections. The first removes the 15% limit and the
					 prohibition on association. The second renders as null and void any other
					 corporate documents that address the 15% limit. The third deals with when the
					 changes will come into force. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would hope that my colleagues would agree that this
					 is just another step in the government's response and parliament's response to
					 the tragic events of September 11. But in particular, it is also a response to
					 the ongoing restructuring and realignment of the Canadian air industry which
					 predated September 11. I hope that my colleagues would ensure speedy passage of
					 the bill. Certainly at committee if there are any detailed questions members
					 would like to ask, I am fully prepared to be there with my officials.
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a bill that is in the national interests. It is
					 certainly in the interests of airline passengers and all of those who believe
					 that our national air carrier, Air Canada, should continue to be the great
					 carrier that it is.</p>

					 Moody—Coquitlam—Port Coquitlam, Canadian Alliance):
				  </b>

	Madam Speaker, it is my pleasure to stand in favour of
					 Bill C-38, an act to amend the Air Canada Public Participation Act. This change
					 is long overdue. It finally puts Air Canada on a level playing field with other
					 Canadian air carriers with respect to the sale of its shares.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the first time in Canadian history Canadians can
					 buy, sell and trade as many Air Canada shares as they want, just as if they
					 were shares of any other Canadian company. Bill C-38 represents a marked
					 departure from the traditional thinking of Liberal governments. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Air Canada was created by an act of parliament in 1937
					 as Trans-Canada Airlines. It has been the subject of much discussion in the
					 House since that time. For the first 40 years of the company's existence it was
					 seen as an agent of the crown and as the federal government's principal policy
					 instrument in the field of aviation. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That changed with the passage of the original Air
					 Canada Act in 1977. For the first time Air Canada was required to borrow in its
					 own name and was declared to be no longer an agent of the crown. It remained a
					 crown corporation and cabinet retained the power to appoint its
					 directors.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1987 the Progressive Conservative government passed
					 the National Transportation Act. It fundamentally changed the rules of the game
					 and attempted to introduce competition rather than regulation as the primary
					 arbiter within Canada's domestic airline industry. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Within a year the Progressive Conservatives had
					 correctly realized that in a competitive situation the government had no
					 business owning one of the competitors, so the parliament of the day quickly
					 passed the Air Canada Public Participation Act essentially privatizing Air
					 Canada and turning it from a crown corporation into a regular company whose
					 operations were subject to the Canada Business Corporations Act.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Paragraph 6(1)(a) of the Air Canada Public
					 Participation Act limited the number of shares that could be owned by a single
					 shareholder to 10%. This was done to ensure that Air Canada stocks would be
					 broadly held by as many Canadians as possible. The section also put Air Canada
					 on a level playing field with its principal domestic competitor, Canadian
					 Airlines International. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members must not forget that the Air Canada Public
					 Participation Act was first read in the House on May 19, 1988. This was nearly
					 five months after the January 1, 1988, birth of Canadian Airlines International
					 from the fusion of all Air Canada's pre-1980 domestic competitors, Pacific
					 Western Airlines, Transair, Nordair, Quebec Air, Eastern Provincial Airways and
					 Canadian Pacific Airlines, into a single entity.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1988 Canadian Airlines parent company was governed
					 by Alberta's Pacific western airlines act which set a 4% limit on the number
					 shares any one group could control. In fact the 10% share limit set in the
					 original Air Canada Public Participation Act was actually more liberal than the
					 4% limit set in the act governing Canadian Airlines. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill C-26 raised to 15% the number of shares that could
					 be held in Air Canada following the takeover by Air Canada of Canadian Airlines
					 in 2000. We are finally discussing whether to give Air Canada some of the same
					 rights as other companies some 64 years after parliament first created a
					 national airline.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we were to believe government members, Bill C-38
					 would put Air Canada on a level playing field by striking down paragraph
					 6(1)(a) of the Air Canada Public Participation Act. Bill C-38 ostensibly puts
					 Air Canada on that level playing field with all other airlines with respect to
					 the way its shares can be bought, sold and traded by Canadian citizens. On that
					 basis alone it should be supported, and the official opposition supports this
					 legislation.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill C-38 does little to address the short term
					 financial woes of Air Canada that led to thousands of layoffs at Air Canada,
					 including the laying off today of 500 to 700 pilots. I will explain.
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, Air Canada does not obtain money when its shares
					 are acquired by a new buyer unless Air Canada is the seller. Second, no single
					 shareholder is currently restricted by the present 15% limit, that is no
					 current shareholder owns 15% and has publicly expressed a desire to purchase
					 more but cannot as a result of this section. Third, if people were not inclined
					 to buy Air Canada stock before the legislation the fact that they can buy more
					 of it is simply not an incentive. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are only two ways that Bill C-38 would
					 financially benefit Air Canada. First, some of the debt which the Caisse de
					 dépôt et placement holds would have to be converted into shares. The caisse
					 currently owns roughly 9% of Air Canada stock and converting its debt into
					 shares would give the caisse roughly 18%. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, this move, based on a $2.50 price for shares at
					 the date of the transport minister's announcement of his intention to introduce
					 this legislation, would allow the company to convert roughly $17.789 million
					 worth of caisse debt into 9% of Air Canada voting shares. Second, an individual
					 or group would have to take control of Air Canada with a clear plan to
					 restructure the company. This would not be enough unless the restructuring plan
					 were to meet the approval of the transport minister and be acceptable to Air
					 Canada unions.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bill is essentially political posturing. It lets
					 the government claim to be addressing Air Canada's concerns while ignoring the
					 company's plea for bigger and bolder policy moves such as the implementation of
					 permanent new security regimes on the ground that are not only better but
					 faster and more streamlined, placing air marshals on planes, and putting the
					 issue of airline industry restructuring before the Standing Committee on
					 Transport and Government Operations for immediate consideration and
					 redeliberation.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill C-38 requires us to examine the Air Canada Public
					 Participation Act. While I am in favour of striking down paragraph 6(1)(a) of
					 the act we should not stop there. We should ask ourselves a basic philosophical
					 question. As we enter the third millennium should the government continue to
					 regulate the internal affairs of a publicly traded corporation whose shares it
					 no longer owns?</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why should paragraphs 6(1)(d) and (e) of the Air Canada
					 Public Participation Act require Air Canada to maintain facilities and/or
					 offices in certain cities? Surely these decisions are the responsibility of the
					 company's shareholders and board of directors. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why should section 10 of the Air Canada Public
					 Participation Act make the Official Languages Act applicable to Air Canada and
					 no other Canadian airline? If the Official Languages Act applies to Canada's
					 airline industry it should do so in the Official Languages Act and not in the
					 Air Canada Public Participation Act. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It hardly seems fair to hold Air Canada to a higher
					 standard than Toronto based Canada 3000, Calgary based WestJet or Montreal
					 based Air Transat.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why should paragraphs 6(1)(b) and (c) of the Air Canada
					 Public Participation Act restrict foreign share ownership in Air Canada when a
					 more equitable regime would see similar limits placed on all Canadian carriers?
					 Paragraphs 6(1)(b) and (c) of the Air Canada Public Participation Act are
					 wholly unnecessary. The transportation minister should know that there is
					 already a prohibition against foreigners owning more than 25% of a Canadian air
					 carrier in the Canada Transportation Act. Section 55 of that act defines a
					 Canadian carrier as: </p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td><small>A corporation or other entity that is
						  incorporated or formed under the laws of Canada or a province, that is
						  controlled in fact by Canadians and of which at least 75% , or such lesser
						  percentage as the Governor in Council may by regulation specify, of the voting
						  interests are owned and controlled by Canadians.</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 56(3) of that act gives the Canadian
					 Transportation Agency the power to review all mergers and acquisitions in the
					 airline industry and determine whether such activities would affect an
					 airline's status as being Canadian. Paragraph 61(a)(i) requires a carrier to be
					 Canadian in order to have a licence to operate domestic air service.
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 69 only allows two types of carriers to operate
					 international air service: Canadian air carriers and non-Canadian air carriers
					 which have been designated by a foreign government or an agent of a foreign
					 government to operate an air service under the terms of an agreement or
					 arrangement between that government and the Government of Canada.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the Canada Transportation Act, if WestJet, Canada
					 3000 and Air Transat were to allow foreigners to acquire more than 25% of their
					 voting shares they would no longer be Canadian. They would lose both their
					 ability to serve domestic routes within Canada as well as international routes
					 between Canada and another country. In essence, they would lose the value of
					 any potential buyer. This restriction is utterly redundant.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Given the restrictions against foreign ownership
					 already present in the Canada Transportation Act, paragraphs 6(1)(b) and (c) of
					 the Air Canada Public Participation Act are wholly unnecessary. Even if there
					 were no prohibitions in the Canada Transportation Act, Air Canada's board of
					 directors would undoubtedly take actions to ensure that control of the firm
					 remained in Canadian hands because of the convention on international civil
					 aviation, more commonly referred to as the Chicago convention. It sets out the
					 basis of international commercial aviation.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Internationally scheduled commercial air traffic is
					 made possible through bilateral agreements in which governments exchange air
					 rights for the benefit of their respective carriers. Each country can designate
					 a national carrier on any international route. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Air Canada and Air France fly between Montreal and
					 Paris. Air Canada and Korean Air Lines fly between Vancouver and Seoul. Air
					 Canada and Cubana Airlines fly between Canada and Cuba. Only in the most
					 exceptional cases will we find an airline flying between two cities where
					 neither is in the airline's home country. </p>


	<A NAME="T1545"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1545"><!-- Hour: 3--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1550"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1540"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1545)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In virtually every case where a foreign airline flies
					 between two foreign destinations it is only as an extension of a flight that
					 started in the airline's home base. Air Canada flies between Sao Paulo, Brazil,
					 and Buenos Aires, Argentina, but only as part of a Toronto, Sao Paulo, Buenos
					 Aires service and only with the approval of the governments of Canada, Brazil
					 and Argentina.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If Americans or people of any other nationality were to
					 acquire a majority of Air Canada's voting stock, foreign governments might
					 refuse to recognize Air Canada as a Canadian company and thereby deny it the
					 ability to continue serving routes in those countries even without the
					 safeguards of the Canada Transportation Act. Thus, if United Airlines and
					 Lufthansa were to buy 51% of Air Canada's voting stock, the British, French and
					 Chinese governments would have the right to deny Air Canada permission to fly
					 to London, Paris and Shanghai. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Air Canada as an airline would cease to hold value for
					 the investors who just purchased it without the ability to serve international
					 routes. For this reason alone its board of directors would never allow
					 foreigners to own a majority of Air Canada's stock.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We only need to look at the arrangement that American
					 Airlines had with Canadian Airlines in 1999. Passengers were flown from the
					 U.S. to Vancouver and then from Vancouver to Asia on Canadian Airlines jets.
					 The reason for this was that American Airlines had only been granted routes to
					 Japan from the U.S. and needed access to Hong Kong, China, Taiwan, Thailand and
					 the Philippines. The Asian service provided by Canadian Airlines was based on
					 bilateral agreements between Canada and the Asian countries concerned. American
					 Airlines would have literally killed the goose that laid the golden egg had it
					 taken control of Canadian Airlines.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree with repealing paragraph 6(1)(a) of the Air
					 Canada Public Participation Act. The official opposition will support Bill
					 C-38. However, having carefully examined the Air Canada Public Participation
					 Act, we see no reason not to repeal the entire act itself. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has at least four irrelevant sections. Section 4
					 deals with the transfer of shares to the Minister of Transport. Air Canada
					 tells me these shares have since been sold. Section 5 deals with continuance.
					 Presumably this has been achieved in the past 12 years since the act has been
					 passed. Section 11 deals with the continued appointment of Air Canada directors
					 past the privatization date. Presumably the terms of these directors have long
					 since expired. Section 14 repeals the Air Canada Act. This section has also
					 been spent.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The act also discriminates against Air Canada in four
					 specific areas. Paragraph 6(1)(a) limits share ownership of an individual or
					 group to 15%. Paragraphs 6(1)(d) and (e) make Air Canada maintain facilities
					 and/or offices in defined cities. That is mandated by the government and is not
					 a decision of the company. That is mandated against Air Canada and not levied
					 against other businesses. This is a government regulation that retards the
					 economy.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Paragraphs 6(1)(b) and (c) restrict foreign share
					 ownership in Air Canada. Section 10 makes the Official Languages Act applicable
					 only to Air Canada and not other carriers.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The transport minister says that because the head
					 office is mandated to be in Montreal it somehow adds virtue to a discriminatory
					 policy which handcuffs Air Canada but does not handcuff other carriers. He says
					 that it is in the national interest. It is in the national interest if it is in
					 Montreal but not if it is in Calgary or Vancouver. That is not in the national
					 interest; Montreal is the national interest.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a rather perverted approach to public policy. Why
					 does the government not just leave companies alone to compete on an equal and
					 level playing field in the free market? It might try it once. It does wonders.
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the government is intent on putting Air Canada on a
					 level playing field with its domestic competitors it can do this not only by
					 removing the share limitation in paragraph 6(1)(a) of the act but by repealing
					 the entire act itself. This is what the official opposition believes the
					 government should do.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I intend to call witnesses before the standing
					 committee to examine the practicalities of repealing the entire act and the
					 best ways to put Air Canada on an equal footing with its domestic competitors
					 while respecting the other priorities now contained in the act.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the transport minister would like to come before the
					 committee and tell us why Montreal is more a Canadian city than Calgary,
					 Hamilton, Toronto or Edmonton, he is free to do so. I encourage him to do so.
					 It would be the death of the government if he did that.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The legitimate policy aims which are contained in the
					 act should apply equally to all Canadian carriers. Aviation law should apply to
					 all Canadian carriers equally, not just to Air Canada.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Air Canada Public Participation Act discriminates
					 against Air Canada in ways that are utterly counterproductive and which retard
					 the marketplace. Just because Air Canada is a corporation does not mean that
					 the thousands of Air Canada employees should be held to a higher standard than
					 their colleagues at other companies. Either we believe in fairness as a nation
					 or we believe in double standards. The official opposition believes in fairness
					 and competition. I hope the government's opinion of the air industry will one
					 day be the same.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bloc Quebecois will support Bill C-38.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of greatest concern are the speeches by the Minister of
					 Transport and the representative of the official opposition on the future of
					 Air Canada and airlines in Canada. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill C-38, a simple bill with only three pages, repeals
					 section 6 of the act. I will read it for the men and women of Quebec. The Air
					 Canada employees watching us surely understand it. The act contained, and I
					 quote:</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td><small>6. (1) provisions imposing
						  constraints on the issue, transfer and ownership, including joint ownership, of
						  voting shares...to prevent any one person, together with the associates of that
						  person, from holding, beneficially owning or controlling, directly or
						  indirectly...voting shares to which are attached more than 15% of the votes
						  that may ordinarily be cast to elect directors of the Corporation—</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What the Minister of Transport is proposing in Bill
					 C-38 seems thoroughly harmless. It would, however, allow a single shareholder
					 to hold more than 15% of shares. It would be this shareholder other
					 shareholders or entities who would hold the shares. They would thus have the
					 right to take over control or to take part in the control of Air Canada's board
					 of directors. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is this desirable? It is what Air Canada is asking for.
					 It is thought that investors could be interested. Citizens and companies across
					 Canada will probably want to buy Air Canada shares, ensuring with colleagues,
					 friends or related corporations that they have a certain degree of control over
					 the board of directors so as to be able to play a greater role in the company's
					 decisions, to perhaps be able to run it better and turn a profit. This would
					 surely allow them to make some sort of return on their investment.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What this means is giving Canada's business community a
					 free hand to control, to continue to control and to increasingly control this
					 national company, Air Canada.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is cause for concern, because the minister has
					 told us quite candidly what our neighbours to the south have done. He has told
					 us in all sincerity that the Americans provided massive assistance to the
					 airline industry, over $15 billion he tells us, and that was the figure. Five
					 billion dollars in direct aid and $10 billion in loan guarantees. A choice was
					 made. In the wake of the sad events of September 11, the Americans decided to
					 invest heavily. The minister was quite open about this. The Americans invested
					 heavily, he told us, and that is so. The figure mentioned was $15 billion to
					 revive the airline industry.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other countries in the world suffered, such as
					 Switzerland's Swissair, which sought bankruptcy protection. Switzerland decided
					 to invest heavily in a company called Crossair, a regional airline in
					 Switzerland. This company will soon buy up Swissair's shares and revive the
					 airline industry. Switzerland has made a choice. It decided to invest heavily
					 in Crossair, which will soon take over the defunct Swissair. This is a choice
					 as a society. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is saddening to hear today is that Canada has
					 decided to give the market free rein and not to make any massive investments to
					 kick start the airline industry. Anything it does do is on a bit by bit basis.
					 Canada's approach is a piecemeal one. At the outset, the minister announced
					 investments to meet high insurance costs.</p>


	<A NAME="T1555"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1555"><!-- Hour: 3--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1600"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1550"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1555)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a result of the sad events of September 11, the
					 airlines were faced with astronomical hikes in insurance costs. Some carriers
					 were no longer even able to insure themselves. The government therefore decided
					 to compensate them for the astronomically high premiums they were being charged
					 for insurance.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It then reimbursed expenses. Since the air space was
					 totally closed down, all companies' equipment was grounded. The Government of
					 Canada decided, still within its piecemeal approach, to announce one week later
					 that it would offer compensation and assistance, reimbursing the airlines'
					 losses that were the result of the six day closing of Canadian air space.
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This assistance was in dribs and drabs. After that a
					 loan guarantee program was announced, followed last week by another loan
					 guarantee to Canada 3000 of $74 million.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The minister refers to a business restructuring. He
					 spoke of massive staff reductions. Once again the minister helped out Canada
					 3000 once it had restructured and, in particular, made massive staff cuts.
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The minister has told us very candidly that the
					 government can help the five major carriers in Canada, including Air Canada,
					 Air Transat, WestJet and Canada 3000. He said very candidly “once they have
					 restructured”. Downsizing is an important part of the restructuring of any
					 company.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a message to the employees of all these
					 airlines in Canada and Quebec, saying “In the end, you are the ones who will
					 pay for the September 11 events. We will help—as was the case with Canada
					 3000—once your company has restructured financially”. And the minister adds
					 “once your company has reduced its staff”. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to get help from the federal government,
					 airlines must absolutely restructure. They must submit a restructuring plan
					 that includes staff reductions. This is very hard to accept for airline
					 industry workers, because what happened on September 11 was not their fault. It
					 is not their fault if their industry suffered such setbacks but they are the
					 ones who are paying for this.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, this applies to four airlines at the exclusion
					 of Air Canada. In the agreement and in the various acts, very important
					 guarantees were demanded for Air Canada. Such guarantees were demanded by the
					 Bloc Quebecois, which questioned the government in debates on the various acts
					 establishing Air Canada as we know it today, and by others. Why? To protect the
					 rights of workers. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Air Canada is the largest airline, with 80% of Canada's
					 air traffic. Therefore, it is important that it be afforded some protection.
					 When Canadian was integrated with Air Canada, we made sure that workers would
					 not lose. As the minister said, we made sure that small municipalities would be
					 served. This has always been a requirement in the original legislation that is
					 now being amended. These requirements have not changed. Protecting the rights
					 of workers and serving small municipalities are still requirements under the
					 acts that established Air Canada and French in the skies. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is sad to hear speeches such as that of the Alliance
					 member in a country where there are two founding peoples, anglophones and
					 francophones. Members will understand why, with such speeches, that sovereignty
					 is not dead in Quebec. If we were to hear speeches like that of the Alliance
					 member every day, I am sure sovereignty would take off for the pure and simple
					 reason that francophone rights must be protected.</p>


	<A NAME="T1600"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1600"><!-- Hour: 4--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1605"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1555"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1600)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the law provides for the protection of French in
					 the air.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is harder to accept is the fact that 136
					 complaints are before the commissioner of official languages. They were lodged
					 against Air Canada because French is not respected in the air. This is the
					 harsh reality.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is hard to hear the representatives of the Canadian
					 Alliance say, today, that it is time to stop protecting French in the air, a
					 practice established by one of the two founding peoples, thanks to
					 representations by the Bloc Quebecois, among others. Air Canada is Canada's
					 largest airline, carrying 82% of the volume. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Obviously we must carry on and make sure that the
					 rights of travellers are protected. As regards service to small
					 municipalities—I am using the minister's expression—it must be protected. That
					 is what the minister said earlier.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are no large or small municipalities. Canada was
					 built from communities that diversified their approaches. Communities were
					 established around natural resources. Cities—this is the term we should use and
					 not small and large municipalities—were established across Canada.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No law makes a distinction between towns and cities in
					 Quebec. They are cities. There are no large and small cities in the Quebec Loi
					 des cités et villes. There are cities. Obviously, there are cities in the
					 regions and there are cities near major urban centres, and the law must protect
					 and continue to protect service to cities in the regions.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canada owes its existence to its natural resources and
					 continues to be very much a country of natural resources. The future is very
					 important for all regions of Canada. Such is the diversity of Canada, what
					 makes it great. We are one of the largest countries in the world in which the
					 decision has been made to allow the market to operate freely.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is where the problem lies. In such a vast country,
					 a country of such diversity, the strength of which depends in large part on the
					 natural resources located in distant regions, the government has a duty to
					 intervene in order to ensure that transportation services are maintained,
					 including the most rapid means of transportation, air service, so that regional
					 cities are connected with the major urban centres.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is why it was hard to swallow today the statement
					 in the minister's speech saying that, with Bill C-36 which merged Air Canada
					 and Canadian, we obtained and included protection for service to small
					 municipalities. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope he will rethink his choice of words. Cities in
					 the regions have as much right to air service as major urban centres. That is
					 reality. Just as Canada's francophone air travellers have as much right to
					 service in their own language as anglophones. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am proud that the act which created Air Canada
					 protects the use of French in the air. I hope the rumours that Air Canada wants
					 to abandon Air Canada Regional precisely because the use of French in the air
					 is a constraint on the expansion of all the businesses that make up Air Canada
					 Regional, are not true.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apparently they want to abandon these businesses, sell
					 them or transfer a part of their routes. That is the current rumour. This is an
					 attempt to improve the bottom line and to avoid having to respond to the 136
					 complaints received by the official languages commissioner against Air Canada
					 regarding the use of French in the air.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is difficult and it is a hard fight but we must
					 continue to fight to protect the rights of workers under the statutes that
					 created Air Canada as we know it today. We must continue to protect service to
					 cities in the regions, and not small municipalities as the minister said, and
					 protect the use of French in the air. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This bill only changes the percentage of individual or
					 group participation in the share capital of Air Canada. It only amends this
					 clause.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bloc Quebecois will support Bill C-38 for the
					 simple reason that the rights of workers at Air Canada will still be protected,
					 as will service to cities in the regions, and the use of French in the
					 air.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must continue to fight so that cities in the regions
					 of Canada and Quebec are better served and that the use of French, the language
					 of one of the two founding peoples of Canada, is better protected in the
					 air.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a commitment which the Bloc Quebecois is
					 determined to defend in the House.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is sad to see the federal government deciding to put
					 its faith in the free market in something as important throughout Canada as the
					 airline industry. This is a position strongly backed by the Canadian Alliance,
					 which would like to go much further. It would be a disaster for Canada's entire
					 airline industry for the good and simple reason that this great country of
					 Canada, and of Quebec, needs flights linking cities in the regions with major
					 urban centres. They do not all have the same number of inhabitants and are so
					 diversified that we must support them. In my view, the Government of Canada
					 would do well to do as Switzerland or the United States have done and provide
					 massive aid to the airline industry. It is a vital part of our
					 economy.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Companies such as Bombardier were able to create
					 markets in aeronautics because we in Canada were heavy users of air services.
					 The entire aeronautics industry is supported by the airline industry and we
					 must encourage this industry and its workers. They should not have to pay for
					 what happened on September 11. They should not bear the brunt of industries'
					 losses through the loss of their jobs. We are condemning entire families to
					 poverty just because the government decided to give the market free rein.
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I call on the minister to rethink his position on this
					 issue. I call on the federal Liberal government to start looking at the larger
					 picture and to send out a clear message. I hope the Minister of Finance will
					 understand and that in his next budget he will announce heavy investments to
					 support Canada's airline industry. As in the United States, Switzerland and
					 other countries, this industry needs significant government support right now,
					 until business picks up. We all hope that business picks up in the airline
					 industry. Only time will tell.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Working on security is a good example. I support the
					 Minister of Finance with respect to the Government of Canada's investments in
					 security.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The problem is that we did not do enough before
					 September 11. This is why we now have to invest so massively in security. We
					 did not do it before. In 1987 the government decided to move the RCMP out of
					 all Canadian airports. The RCMP was responsible for monitoring and supervising
					 security at airports. It is not just the Liberal government that made this type
					 of decision. That decision was made by the Conservative government and was
					 supported by the current Liberal government. Why? For reasons of economy.
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government delegated to so-called non-profit
					 organizations the responsibility of managing and administering some of the
					 duties relating to security at airports. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today we are seeing some of the results of that
					 decision. There has not been much investment. Instead, cuts were made. The
					 government tried to transfer the burden of security to airline companies which,
					 over the past 20 years, have undergone major changes, including bankruptcies
					 and the merging of Canadian Airlines International and Air Canada. Meanwhile,
					 it was asking airlines to pay for security.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It did so by investing as little as possible. Since
					 1987 Transport Canada has been responsible for security at airports. This is a
					 civilian agency which over the past 15 years has been much busier dealing with
					 disputes about the costs to airline companies compared to the services provided
					 by non-profit organizations set up by the Government of Canada to transfer its
					 responsibility. They tried to make it as inexpensive as possible and now we can
					 see the results.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today we are being forced to make massive investments
					 and the Liberal government is now afraid that it will not have enough money,
					 for the simple reason that we do not know exactly how much the security bill
					 will cost. In the meantime, we are not investing in the airline industry, we
					 are saving our pennies to invest in security and protect passengers, users and
					 all Canadian.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a choice we as a society made, and today the
					 airline industry is paying the price. The federal Liberal government does not
					 want to invest like the Americans have done. Once again, I thought the
					 minister's statement was quite frank when he said that the Americans had
					 provided massive support for the airline industry, $5 billion in direct
					 assistance, $10 billion in loan guarantees; $15 billion in all.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Switzerland made a choice, following Swissair's filing
					 for protection under the bankruptcy act, when it decided to invest massively,
					 with the purchase of 38% of the shares of Crossair, which will take over from
					 Swissair in January. So, it is a societal choice.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Canada, all that is being promised, all that is
					 being offered to employees in the airline industry, which supports the aviation
					 industry, airplane manufacturers, et cetera, is Bill C-38. The world's leading
					 companies in aviation and aeronautics are here, there are manufacturers and
					 companies that produce parts, and all that we can promise them today is Bill
					 C-38.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We agree that individuals should be able to have more
					 than a 15% control of shares if they want to. If this finally allowed a major
					 investor to control Air Canada's board of directors and try to jump start the
					 company and get it on track, this is a societal choice that the government of
					 Canada has made.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must think about the workers in the airline
					 industry, in all the companies, and not just the five major ones. There are
					 regional companies as well. This afternoon, Air Alma was mentioned. There is
					 Air Inuit and all the other regional carriers, which were hit with the
					 reduction in air traffic across Canada and around the world. They are not being
					 helped by the measures the minister announced yesterday.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This afternoon in oral question period, the minister
					 told us candidly that revitalizing the major companies was likely to give the
					 smaller regional carriers a boost. This represents a choice not to support the
					 regional companies, which are often family operations, and letting them go
					 adrift. When they hit really hard times and are within inches of seeking
					 bankruptcy protection the government might agree to guarantee loans for them,
					 if things are really going bad.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No plan is in place to help the airline industry. They
					 will deal with things piecemeal, day by day. They put out fires. That is how
					 security was dealt with. When problems arise, they deal with them. Otherwise,
					 they try to save as much as possible in security. This is the way they have
					 operated since 1987.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They are making massive investments because there is a
					 security problem but the passengers on the airlines are paying the cost in
					 Canada. Today they have nothing more to sink their teeth into. They have a bill
					 that will enable private investors to participate more in Air Canada in an
					 attempt to revive it.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope and we will demand that the context in which
					 today's Air Canada was established will be maintained. In other words, Canada
					 and Quebec need a strong airline that respects travellers' rights, that serves
					 the cities and the regions and that uses French in the air, for both founding
					 peoples.</p>

					 NDP): </b>

	Madam Speaker, it is a pleasure for me to rise on
					 behalf of the New Democratic Party at second reading of Bill C-38, an act to
					 amend the Air Canada Public Participation Act. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was not that long ago, in fact just about 18 months,
					 that we last debated a bill to amend the Air Canada Public Participation Act.
					 That was the last parliament's Bill C-26 which, among other things, approved
					 Air Canada's merger with Canadian Airlines. I think it is important that as we
					 debate the bill before us today we remember this context. It has been about a
					 year and a half since the government passed Bill C-26 to approve the merger of
					 the two national airlines and I think it is now pretty safe to say it has been
					 a disaster. The government completely dropped the ball with the merger.
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the minister's stated objectives in Bill C-26
					 was to foster competition in the domestic market. He said so repeatedly in the
					 House. What has happened? Eighteen months later we have even less competition
					 than we had before. Royal Airlines and CanJet are no more. They have been
					 swallowed up by Canada 3000. Two entire airlines are gone. So much for
					 fostering competition.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The minister also said that Bill C-26 was supposed to
					 prevent Air Canada from using predatory pricing to drive its competitors out of
					 business. As we on the House of Commons transport committee have heard
					 repeatedly over these months, this part of that bill has been a failure as
					 well. The small airlines that are trying to compete with Air Canada and offer
					 Canadian travellers some choice in the market have repeatedly been saying what
					 we in the New Democratic Party were already saying while Bill C-26 was still
					 before the House: that the anti-predatory pricing measures contained in that
					 bill were toothless and completely ineffective. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This should not be surprising to the government. The
					 commissioner of the competition bureau came before the transport committee
					 while we were reviewing Bill C-26 and told us straight out that the bill did
					 not give him the powers he needed to stop predatory pricing, but the Liberals
					 ignored him. So did the Alliance and the Tories. I do not know why that
					 happened. Maybe they just had their ideological blinders on and would not even
					 think about the possibility that maybe a little regulation was necessary to
					 prevent Air Canada from abusing its monopoly. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The competition commissioner said the bill would not
					 give him the power to stop predatory pricing. My party's response was to try to
					 do something about it. At report stage I introduced amendments to strengthen
					 the competition bureau's ability to fight predatory pricing. The Liberals, the
					 Alliance and the Tories opposed it and now we see the results.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bill before us today, Bill C-38, would repeal
					 paragraph 6(1)(a) of the Air Canada Public Participation Act. This would remove
					 the 15% cap on ownership of shares by an individual or a group of individuals
					 working in concert. This is a thoroughly underwhelming response to the current
					 crisis in the airline industry. If the minister thinks that this is going to
					 solve either the short term or the long term problems facing Air Canada and the
					 overall airline industry, he is fooling himself. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government argues that removing the shareholder cap
					 will allow large investors to come in, buy the company, recapitalize it and
					 restructure it. There are two problems with this reasoning.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, industry and market analysts tell us that there
					 is virtually no interest out there from investors in making any kind of major
					 investment in failing airlines like Air Canada. This was the case before
					 September 11 and it is even more so now given the world decline in travel and
					 tourism since the terrorist attacks. Who does the government think is going to
					 come along and invest all this money in Air Canada? Unless it knows something
					 that it is not telling us, the bill would not do even a little bit of
					 good.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second problem with the government's reasoning is
					 that even if removing the cap were to solve Air Canada's short term problems,
					 which I do not believe it will, it opens up the airline to an even more long
					 term problem down the road. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why has the minister flip flopped from 18 months ago
					 when arguing against the elimination of the cap? Is it simply because he sees
					 no other way to address Air Canada's short term cash crunch? There are much
					 better ways to address the short term necessity of keeping Air Canada in the
					 air, which do not carry the long term costs that the bill carries. In the past
					 few weeks, as the New Democratic transport critic I have suggested numerous
					 alternative ways that the government could help Air Canada make it through the
					 short term cash crunch, like tax deferrals, interest free loans, lower airport
					 lease fees and initiating negotiations with Nav Canada to find a way to reduce
					 the air navigation fees. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;New Democrats do not want to see a direct government
					 handout of taxpayer dollars to Air Canada, but if it is necessary we have said
					 it should come with strings attached and should give the government a say in
					 how the airline is restructured. <sup></sup></p>


	<A NAME="T1620"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1620"><!-- Hour: 4--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1625"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1615"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1620)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bill addresses only the immediate short term
					 problem facing Air Canada and it does not even do a credible job at
					 that.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have to look at the long term issues facing the
					 industry. In the long term it is crucial that the government break the airline
					 industry out of the destructive cycle it has been in for the last decade. The
					 cycle repeats itself over and over again in every country that, like Canada,
					 has an unregulated airline industry. First, capacity rises to unsustainable
					 levels. This leads to massive financial losses. Then the weakest companies go
					 under. They collapse and are downsized or the airline reduces capacity. Then
					 the cycle repeats itself.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a ridiculous way for the government to let an
					 industry as important as the airline industry operate. The uncertainty we get
					 from going from crisis to crisis undermines the entire national economy. We can
					 ill afford this with our economy on the verge of recession.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the government ever wants to end this cycle it has
					 to drop the passive, minimalistic approach the transport minister is
					 suggesting. It has to stop responding on a crisis by crisis, patchwork and
					 piecemeal basis and look at some modern regulation to limit the growth of
					 capacity. I am not talking about the old fashioned regulation of every route
					 and every fare. I am talking about limited, targeted regulation to control the
					 growth of capacity: a modern regulatory regime. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the good of our airline industry the minister needs
					 to take off the ideological blinders telling him that all regulation is bad and
					 realize that total deregulation is just as bad as total regulation. There is a
					 middle way and that is what he should be aiming for.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although I do not believe this extinction of the
					 shareholder limit will be the saviour of Air Canada or do the job of
					 stabilizing industry, my party will not delay the bill going to committee. The
					 transport committee needs to review the situation and, quite frankly, I hope we
					 will see investors come forward. However, more must be done to stabilize our
					 entire airline industry. Had one or two shareholders owned Air Canada, where
					 would they be today? Would they have survived the huge losses of the past six
					 weeks? Will these present changes ensure service to all regions of Canada? I
					 think not.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My colleague from the Bloc has rightfully criticized
					 the government for its approach to offering loan assistance. The government has
					 said that if the airline restructures and lays off workers it will get
					 assistance. The government has abandoned smaller rural and northern communities
					 by not holding Air Canada to the merger agreement.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also want to join my colleague from the Bloc in the
					 disappointment I feel that the Alliance Party refuses to accept our bilingual
					 nation.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Much more needs to be done to stabilize the airline
					 industry. It is time to realize that the strategy of the last decade has not
					 worked. We need to look at alternative methods. I look forward to having
					 witnesses appear before transport committee and to coming up with a resolution
					 that I hope will truly, once and for all, give some stability to our airline
					 industry.</p>

					 Rock—Langley, PC/DR): </b>

	Madam Speaker, I am pleased to be debating the second
					 reading of Bill C-38. It is with a degree of astonishment that we find
					 ourselves addressing the issue 18 months after the fact. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The issue of public ownership and domestic ownership in
					 Air Canada did come up when we were reviewing the restructuring of the airline
					 industry 18 months ago. One of the dissenting opinions of the Canadian Alliance
					 Party and myself was that this limitation of 15% was not a good thing and
					 should not be in the legislation. We said at that time, and I repeat it now,
					 that the 15% limitation in ownership hindered Air Canada from dealing with the
					 issues rather than helping it. The government was urged at that time to remove
					 the controls on ownership to give Air Canada the ability to raise capital in
					 order for it to be able to afford the debt it was taking on with the
					 acquisition of Canadian Airlines.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At that time the government said, as the minister did
					 today, that it was not necessary to remove the limitations, that it was all
					 fine and well and Air Canada could move ahead without it. Today I heard the
					 minister say the same thing about foreign ownership, that it is not important
					 at this time to remove the limit or raise the limit from 25% to 49% because all
					 is well and Air Canada, with this amendment to the legislation, would be able
					 to garner the capital that is necessary.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would suggest that now it is time for the government
					 to look seriously at the issue of Air Canada, at its financial position, the
					 issues and the problems it has to deal with, and the government should realize
					 that now is not the time for government to put on restrictions. Air Canada has
					 an enormous debt load. Airlines cost big dollars, not small dollars. Air Canada
					 will require a large amount of money, not a small amount of money, in order to
					 remain afloat.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would suggest that today the government is showing
					 the lack of foresight that it showed 18 months ago when it would not remove the
					 government restrictions to ownership in a way that would have allowed Air
					 Canada to reach the maximum possibilities of getting fresh capital into its
					 company.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is interesting to see that Air Canada is now in
					 favour of these changes, that Air Canada is now willing to look at removing
					 this 15% control of domestic ownership and raising the foreign ownership limits
					 from 25% to 49%. It is interesting because 18 months to two years ago it was
					 this restriction on domestic ownership that caused the other bidder, Onex, to
					 remove itself from the merger of Canadian Airlines and Air Canada. It was this
					 limitation on domestic ownership that forced the government to deal with the
					 bid that Air Canada had put on the table. This control on domestic ownership
					 allowed Air Canada, I would suggest, to perhaps make an unwise decision to
					 fight the takeover bid that Onex had put on the table.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having said that, let me say that the problems Air
					 Canada is facing are not due to September 11. September 11 did not help, but
					 certainly the problems did not originate with the horrific events of September
					 11. The problems that Air Canada is facing have been ongoing. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was an article in <i>The Economist</i> of July 7,
					 2001, obviously before September 11, that outlined in great detail the problems
					 in the airline industry, the problems with the downturns in the economy, the
					 fact that air travel fell in the United States and Europe for the first time in
					 decades in May, and the fact that on any given day, at that time, four million
					 people around the world were taking to the air and that at any one moment in
					 time a quarter of a million people were in flight. However, bad weather,
					 congestion on the runways, hamstrung air traffic control, computer failure and
					 the late arrival of incoming flights all turn air travel into a
					 lottery.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was quite apparent before September 11 that there
					 were major problems in the airline industry. Air Canada is one of the larger
					 players. I understand it is the 11th largest airline in the world but that just
					 means that its problems are perhaps larger than some of the smaller airlines.
					 Air Canada has been having difficulties, to say the least, in merging the two
					 workforces and cultures of Canadian Airlines and Air Canada. It is because of
					 these problems that it ended up in a dire situation that preceded September
					 11.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We cannot deny that the events of September 11 had an
					 impact on the airlines but I suggest that the government's decision to remove
					 the domestic controls on ownership is a sorry response to the issue Air Canada
					 is facing. The government has shown a complete lack of vision as to where the
					 airline industry should be going. Had it had some vision of how Canada could
					 have a strong national airline with support from other airlines and that all
					 those pieces could work together, perhaps a lot of this angst would have been
					 sorted out before now. Unfortunately, the government has not shown that kind of
					 vision. It had a knee-jerk reaction to emergency situations that arose at the
					 time.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government had a knee-jerk reaction when Canadian
					 Airlines was going under. Now that Air Canada finds itself in financial
					 difficulty, again it has a knee-jerk reaction. Canada 3000 found itself in
					 financial difficulties and there was yet another knee-jerk reaction. I think
					 Canadians would like to know that their government has given some thought to
					 the future of the airline industry and how their expectations will be met. We
					 have not seen that from the government.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would argue that there is surely room for one
					 national carrier in Canada. Surely there is enough business. I know in this
					 room alone there are 301 people who end up flying somewhere. Surely there is
					 enough business to support one national carrier, but it should not be at the
					 exclusion of all regional carriers. We should not allow this one national
					 carrier to put every other carrier out of business.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Air Canada was given some support, as were other
					 airlines, the federal government gave it $160 million to supplement or
					 compensate it for its direct costs of September 11. What was Air Canada's
					 response to that? It immediately started Tango. What is Tango? Tango is another
					 lower cost airline that is in direct competition to Canada 3000. When the
					 federal government guaranteed a loan of $75 million to Canada 3000, what did
					 Canada 3000 do? It immediately lodged a complaint with the competition
					 commissioner against Air Canada.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to think and I think Canadians would like
					 to think that there is a long term plan, that the government does not just give
					 money to airlines to get into a fight with the other competing airlines. That
					 seems to be what is happening. Even though Air Canada is financially vulnerable
					 right now, it is planning to create another subsidiary airline to go into
					 direct competition with WestJet.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why is the government not encouraging through measures
					 one strong national airline that has a role to play and encouraging regional
					 airlines and low cost airlines which also have roles to play? Why would we
					 encourage or allow a dominant air carrier to take out its
					 competition?</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me get back to Air Canada and the amendment to the
					 Air Canada Public Participation Act which removes the controls on domestic
					 ownership.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Air Canada's board of managers own less than 3% of the
					 company's shares. They are very small shareholders. When we are talking about
					 running a big corporation, being a small shareholder creates a problem because
					 the decisions that are being made need to consider the shareholders' that the
					 board represents. If the board of managers own a very small share of the
					 corporate shares, perhaps the decisions being made are not being made in the
					 best interests of the shareholders, looking at the bottom line.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My colleague from the NDP would probably say that it is
					 time to stop worrying about the bottom line, that it is time for the government
					 to support Air Canada and perhaps take over ownership again, but I do not think
					 that is what Canadians want. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think Canadians are looking for an airline that has
					 the capacity to operate without government interference and one that has the
					 capacity to restructure its debt and move it into equities. I think they want a
					 company that can take advantage of opportunities and operate in the private
					 sector without looking for taxpayers to bail it out. I think that is possible.
					 If there were a larger group of shareholders with more say and who had higher
					 investments in the company, perhaps decisions would be made in such a way that
					 the company could move forward.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was a little concerned when Air Canada's largest
					 shareholder, la Caisse de dépôt et placement, made a huge profit by selling
					 short on Air Canada's stock during the downturn and post-September 11 when
					 share value was dropping like a rock. In other words, it was profiting by the
					 decline in value of Air Canada.This company then wanted Canadian taxpayers to
					 bail it out. How can anyone explain to taxpayers that the largest shareholder
					 is making a profit on the devaluation of the stock and yet turn around and
					 expect Canadian taxpayers to bail it out?</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think Canadians would like to see the federal
					 government remove the restrictions on domestic ownership and raise foreign
					 ownership restrictions from 25% to 49%. This would allow Air Canada to
					 restructure in such a way that its debt would be put into equity. Perhaps the
					 largest shareholders, maybe la Caisse de dépôt et placement, would buy more
					 shares and show their interest in making this company work. Perhaps some
					 foreign investment could be brought in to get new capital to make it work. This
					 is not a question of losing control. If ownership remains under 50% then the
					 ownership is still Canadian. This would allow Air Canada to get the necessary
					 influx of capital to function in the real world without constantly going to
					 Canadian taxpayers for subsidies. I think it is possible for Air Canada to
					 compete given a fresh approach and new capital.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We in the Canadian Alliance will be supporting the
					 legislation. It is 18 months overdue which just shows that the government is,
					 as always, slow in doing the right thing.</p>

	Madam Speaker, in my hon. colleague's presentation she
					 referred to regional carriers. Since September 11 we have seen many changes
					 with regard to regional carrier service. It has been cut dramatically. We need
					 that regional service in smaller areas if we expect municipalities to grow. How
					 can we guarantee that the municipalities will be able to keep their people and
					 the companies that employ the people if there is no regional carrier?
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will give one example. Because of the changes since
					 September 11, next week I will have to fly from Saint John, the largest city in
					 the province of New Brunswick, to Fredericton, then back from Fredericton over
					 Saint John to Halifax, then from Halifax back over Saint John and Fredericton
					 to get up to Ottawa. That is absolutely ridiculous.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I ask my colleague, what can we do to protect the
					 regional carriers and the municipalities and make sure the quality of life the
					 people have had is there for them and that it will continue to grow?</p>

				  </b>

	Madam Speaker, if regional carriers and smaller
					 carriers had the freedom to grow and expand their market then local businesses
					 could expand and service areas that may not now be serviced.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I take one example of a small local airline that
					 started up in Terrace, B.C., a very small community in northern B.C. with about
					 15,000 people. It has one or two Dash 8s and provides a two-way service twice a
					 day from Vancouver to Terrace. Because it is local, it offers good service and
					 it originates out of Terrace, it is now bringing in another plane to service
					 the surrounding communities. However, if we allow a dominant carrier to come
					 in, interrupt and interfere with that local airline's potential growth
					 perspective and the travelling public's access to that airline, then it will
					 not maintain its ability to remain in the business.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We need to free up and encourage Air Canada, as the
					 dominant carrier, to concentrate on being the national carrier and to stop
					 trying to drive out the WestJets, the CanJets and other airlines that can
					 provide regional carriage and do it well and service the communities well. If
					 we allow the dominant carrier to replace them, the time will come when they
					 will remove the service as they have done now.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What we want to do is encourage the smaller airlines to
					 fulfill that role in our society. They can do it and they can do it very
					 well.</p>

					 Canadian Alliance): </b>

	Madam Speaker, it is a privilege for me to speak on our
					 transportation industry. This is the second time I will have spoken on this
					 subject.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When my colleague who just spoke was the Alliance
					 critic, I spoke to her about this. She is now the DRC critic and many of the
					 points she mentioned today were what I was going to mention. Nevertheless, I
					 will re-emphasize many of those points.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before I go to that, I would like to set the record
					 straight. The Bloc and NDP members who spoke alluded to the fact that the
					 Canadian Alliance was opposed to bilingualism. I would like to make the record
					 very clear for them, especially the Bloc member who brought the separatism
					 issue into this.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My colleague, the transport critic, did not say that we
					 opposed bilingualism. He said that only Air Canada was forced to speak in two
					 languages while the other carriers were exempt from that. He said that the
					 rules should be equal for everybody, which would mean that the other carriers
					 should also speak in both languages. He was trying to say that this restriction
					 tied the hands of Air Canada. Let us not twist the facts.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I listened to what the Minister of Transport had to
					 say. I was extremely stunned when he said that parliament put the 15% per cent
					 restriction of ownership on Air Canada . As my colleague from the DRC said,
					 both she and I stood 18 months ago and said free up the ownership rule and let
					 Air Canada fly on its own. At that time, he stood up and said that it was not
					 possible and gave all the usual excuses. Eighteen months later he is proposing
					 a bill removing that ownership. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This indicates that the mess the Canadian airline
					 industry is in is partly the responsibility of inaction and not well thought
					 out plans by the government. We also know that this mess was also created by
					 Air Canada itself. Everybody knows Air Canada's management has been disastrous
					 at times.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some of the management decisions have made me shake
					 head and wonder if they have been made by supposedly qualified managers. Many
					 times I have asked questions about the operations of Air Canada.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me go back to mismanagement by the government.
					 Regulations have tied Air Canada's hands. However the government is untying
					 them slowly. It wants Air Canada to act as a private company. Then it does not
					 want that. Then it wants to put in restrictions. Nobody has the foggiest idea
					 where this is going. Who is aware of what is going on? I am sure even the
					 management of Air Canada is at times wondering what it has to do.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us talk about restrictions the government wants to
					 remove. We have the foreign ownership restriction but, as my friend said, that
					 is immaterial. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We want Air Canada to be a viable institution. By
					 removing the 15% restriction, it will be able to trade. It will be a private
					 company.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Government has no ownership. If the government has no
					 ownership, why is it poking its nose in Air Canada? It claims and says that the
					 smaller communities do not have services and that we have to provide them with
					 these services. My colleague from DRC articulated one point very well. WestJest
					 provides services.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the reasons WestJet came into existence was
					 simply because Air Canada was charging too much. It was ridiculous. Hence
					 WestJet came out with a sound business plan and look where it is stands today.
					 Even after the disaster of the September 11 attack, WestJet said it did not
					 need much money. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members of parliament, who have travelled over the last
					 three and a half years or four years, know that Air Canada and Canadian
					 Airlines were trying to kill each other. It was not good for the airline
					 industry. We had planes departing at the same time. What were they trying to
					 do? I do not understand. They were routed to the same place, which was absolute
					 nonsense. These planes were half full.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We now have Air Canada doing the same thing with Tango
					 airline. Their experts say Tango is a great name. I guess we will have to get
					 used to it.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My colleagues just advised me that Air Canada picks
					 them up and pushes them over to Tango. Air Canada is using its bigger monopoly
					 for this discount airline in competition with the other regional airlines.
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is the intent of Air Canada? It has more than 70%
					 of the market. It has all the international routes. If it concentrated on its
					 core business to provide good service, it could do well. However, it is more
					 interested in opening up Tango and trying to run other people out of the
					 business, which has fallen off from since they were dealing with Air Canada.
					 There is absolutely no change in the mentality of the management of Air
					 Canada.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a matter of fact, when I travel and talk to Air
					 Canada and Canadian Airline employees at the Ottawa airport, the Calgary
					 airport and in some other place, I do not see happy employees. They are, of
					 course, worried about jobs, but in general their morale is down. As a former
					 businessman, I do not know how people can run a company with unhappy employees.
					 It will eventually translate into frustration and bad service. I have had bad
					 service on many occasions. Who has not had this bad service? </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We need to make Air Canada what it is supposed to be: a
					 business that is an expert in transportation. That can only be done if we
					 remove the regulations.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The NDP members said they liked competition but they
					 wanted regulation. The Bloc wants to protect the employees. We all want to
					 protect the employees. However, in the long run, if Air Canada's hands were
					 untied and it had the ability to make sound management decisions with happier
					 employees and a happier public, that would benefit Canadians.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canadians would like to see that maple leaf flying all
					 over the world. It is a great sight to see but not at the expense of
					 Canadians.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the September 11 attack, a statement made by the
					 CEO of Air Canada stunned everybody. He said he wanted $3 billion to $4 billion
					 of Canadian taxpayer money. This airline has a monopoly. It is an airline that,
					 through its predatory practices, killed Canadian Airlines. It has all the
					 international market, yet it wants money and blames it on September 11.

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everybody knows that previous to that it was having
					 severe financial difficulties. Obviously, if we really looked at it, the
					 restrictions put on Air Canada by the government has had an impact on it. It
					 has not been able to work as an efficient business entity.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;People keep saying they want Air Canada. Then they say
					 they will let Air Canada go like they did to CN. Look what happened to CN.
					 There are two railway lines, the CN and CP. That is all right. When CN was let
					 go, CN's performance improved and now we have two viable railways. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What happened was people did not want to let Air Canada
					 go. There was this fear, especially with the Bloc, the NDP and the Liberal
					 government that services would not be delivered to small communities and to
					 others. Canadians are very entrepreneurial. Canadians will seize the
					 opportunity.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can say that, if the opportunity is there, lots of
					 regional airlines and other airlines will come in. Right now with all the
					 restrictions, Air Canada is in a dominant position and will not let anybody
					 come in. It is running these operations at a loss, but it still wants to
					 maintain its market share.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pricing structure of Air Canada right now makes me
					 shake my heard. Air Canada charges $3,000 from Calgary to Ottawa. That is
					 pretty expensive. I flew from Vancouver to Shanghai for $4,000. If a person
					 flies last minute economy it is over $2,000. Is it going to let discount air
					 carriers come and let them take the traffic?</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is obviously a stupid business decision as far as I
					 am concerned. No wonder the other airlines woke up. Now Air Canada has Tango,
					 the no frills service. The bottom line is simple, most people travelling on Air
					 Canada are travelling at half the price. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a need to allow Air Canada management to be
					 let go. There is a need for an infusion of capital, and it should get it. There
					 is a need for sound management practices by Air Canada</p>

					 PC/DR): </b>

	Madam Speaker, I will be sharing my time with the
					 member for Saanich--Gulf Islands.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This debate is an extremely important one. Perhaps it
					 is no more important to anybody else in this whole House than it is to the
					 members who represent the province of Newfoundland and Labrador. Should members
					 from any other province decide they want to walk or drive home, they can do it.
					 We cannot. We have to fly, swim or take the ferry. We are more dependent on the
					 airlines, especially our business people, our everyday travellers, people going
					 on vacations, many students who are at universities on the mainland, and I
					 could go on. Practically every family is affected by the service to our
					 province by the airline. Basically, we are talking about Air Canada.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fortunately, over the last while we have seen Canada
					 3000 coming in to the province and providing a bit of competition and some
					 extra service. This certainly is looked upon by many as being one of the
					 factors that kept the rates down somewhat. However, to a large degree Air
					 Canada still has a monopoly. That is one of the concerns we have when we talk
					 about this bill.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As we look at protecting and preserving our national
					 airline, which we favour tremendously, we also have to make sure that the
					 service that is eventually settled upon is provided at a reasonable price.
					 Regardless of whether it is completely operated by the private sector, whether
					 there is government involvement, or whether involvement by foreign companies is
					 much greater than at present, whatever the case may be, that service must be
					 provided to Canadians from British Columbia to Newfoundland at a reasonable
					 price.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are getting more letters than ever before from
					 people who have no choice but to use the airline but cannot afford to do so.
					 The prices to fly out of many of our smaller areas are extremely high.
					 Consequently this has a very negative effect on many ordinary people throughout
					 the country.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is great if someone is travelling for a wealthy
					 company that is paying the bill or travelling on behalf of the government,
					 realizing of course that if the government is paying the bill, it is coming out
					 of the taxpayers' pockets anyway. However, for the average family on medium or
					 low income who have to travel because of sickness, educational needs or work,
					 whatever the case may be, it is extremely difficult for them to get on and off
					 the island of Newfoundland at the present rates that are being charged by the
					 airline. We must keep that in mind. It is not just in Newfoundland; the service
					 provided has to be reasonable enough to be used by all the people of the
					 country. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The private sector, God love it, keeps the economy
					 going. However, the bottom line for everybody involved in business is to make
					 money. In order to make money they provide a service. In providing that
					 service, any company worth its salt will try to make as much money as it can.
					 When we are talking about providing an essential service to the people of this
					 country, then companies have to be regulated to some extent so that they cannot
					 charge people whatever they wish, or just pick lucrative routes into the larger
					 areas. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everybody wants to fly out of Toronto. Everybody wants
					 to fly out of Vancouver. Everybody wants to fly out of Montreal. However, not
					 everybody wants to fly out of Stephenville, Deer Lake, Goose Bay or even St.
					 John's and many other small towns and cities throughout this great
					 country.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;People in the lucrative areas usually earn much higher
					 incomes than those in the rural areas. If they can fly for fairly reasonable
					 rates, why should people who are in areas where the going is tough economically
					 have to pay two to six times more per mile than the people in the larger
					 centres? It is entirely unfair. The government has to do something about it.
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The problems first started a couple of years ago with
					 the closure of Canadian Airlines. That was when the government should have
					 stepped in and made the right decision. It certainly did not. The private
					 sector had the opportunity to move in and solve the problems that we face today
					 and by refusing to do what the government is now asking with the share
					 restriction, we could have solved that problem two years ago. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Instead, the government basically forced the then
					 lucrative Air Canada to take on the complete debt of Canadian Airlines.
					 Canadian Airlines, with all kinds of employees, was going down the tubes. The
					 government said to Air Canada, a company that was doing very well, that it
					 could merge with Canadian Airlines and take it over but it would have to take
					 all the debt and carry all the baggage, pardon the pun, with it. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It just cannot work that way. Rearranging the company
					 so it would be a viable option was not allowed. Instead Air Canada was saddled
					 by government regulations with a company that has now put it under. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now that we are revisiting this whole situation,
					 hopefully common sense will prevail. Whatever the resolution is, by the time we
					 pass the present legislation and deal with the Air Canada situation in total,
					 hopefully we will have a decision that will enable Air Canada, whoever the
					 owners may be, to operate viably and to provide a reasonably priced service to
					 everyone in the country. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Air Canada was viable before government asserted its
					 authority and tried to tell it how to run the company. When we look at the
					 experiences of this government in particular, when it asserts itself to try to
					 do anything, we know the result is not successful. The records are there to
					 prove it.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In all of this process the group of people we all must
					 be concerned with is the employees of Air Canada itself. From coast to coast we
					 have a tremendous number of hardworking dedicated Air Canada employees, some of
					 whom have been with Air Canada for quite some time. Some of their jobs were
					 jeopardized when Canadian Airlines was taken over by Air Canada. The type of
					 deal the government set up was entirely unfair to the employees who had been
					 with that company for quite some time. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regardless of that, an employee is an employee. We
					 certainly do not want to make choices as to who should be laid off and who
					 should not. Hopefully a properly structured regulated airline can be busy
					 enough and the profits lucrative enough for it to ensure that all the
					 employees, regardless of whether they were with Air Canada for 30 years or
					 whether they came with the Canadian Airlines merger, can find good, solid jobs
					 within the airline. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In view of September 11, we must instill some
					 confidence in people to get back in the airplanes and fly. As many of us know,
					 in many cases it is much safer to fly than it is to drive or walk. Hopefully,
					 we can get back to creating a good economy around our airlines.</p>


	<A NAME="T1710"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1710"><!-- Hour: 5--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1715"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1705"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1710)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, profits are made around numbers. I mentioned
					 this before. I know I am repeating myself to some degree, but I cannot
					 overemphasize the fact that we are pricing ourselves out of business. It is
					 great to say that we made a profit because we can charge $2,000 for a trip from
					 point A to point B. If we charge $1,000, three times as many people may take
					 the trip and then the profits would be even greater.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have to make sure that an airline, especially where
					 it is serving areas of the country which depend entirely upon that mode of
					 travel, charges prices that are within reason. We are getting away from that.
					 From Newfoundland to Ottawa the round trip costs anywhere from $1,800 to
					 $2,000. Not many people can afford that. To fly from Newfoundland to Halifax
					 quite often costs in the range of $700 to $800 and sometimes even more. Just a
					 few years ago it cost in the range of $200 to $300. How many average people can
					 afford to fly when they are paying three times more than they paid just a few
					 years ago? Why should they have to pay that?</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is interesting to compare fares, as I mentioned
					 earlier, in areas of British Columbia. I should not say British Columbia
					 because it has the same problem in certain parts of the province that we have.
					 However, quite often the fares from Vancouver, Toronto and Montreal are quite
					 reasonable.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The member for Saint John who has been flying for some
					 time will tell us that the prices paid to get from New Brunswick to here are
					 much greater today than they were even two or three years ago. It does not make
					 a difference for us; I have to come to work and the government pays my way.
					 However, the taxpayers are paying for it. It is affecting our bottom line. If
					 the person next door to me has a job in Ottawa and wants to go home, or his
					 family wants to come to visit, they usually cannot afford to do so because the
					 costs are so exorbitant.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are a few things we have to keep in mind. If
					 government is asserting itself by bringing forward and approving legislation,
					 let us make sure it is good legislation. If we are to interfere with the
					 operation of a company, let us make sure that we have some say. If government
					 money is going into a company, the government has to have some say in its
					 operation, not telling it how to run the company, let us stay out of that, but
					 making sure that the consumer is protected. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have to make sure that a private company can operate
					 viably. Quite often the best way to do that is to get out of its way, cut the
					 red tape and bureaucracy and let it do the job.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we had let Air Canada do that two years ago or the
					 private sector we would not be here today worrying about how to straighten out
					 our national airline. If we had not stuck our nose in and interfered with Air
					 Canada as it took over Canadian Airlines we would not be here today. It would
					 undoubtedly still be a profitable operation.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We all know that Air Canada, Canada 3000, West Jet and
					 all the other airlines were affected by the events of September 11. It is right
					 and proper, because of actions taken by governments around the world, that the
					 government compensate them for the direct losses they incurred during that
					 process. We have no problem with that. However we cannot let inefficient
					 companies or companies that are operating under such government restraints that
					 they become inefficient piggyback on September 11. However, if it is the
					 government's fault, as I would suggest it is with the present situation as it
					 relates to Air Canada, then the onus is on the government to correct the
					 mistakes of the past. </p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We should have learned from what happened a couple of
					 years ago. Let us not make the same mistake again. Let us not make our cuts and
					 changes on the backs of employees of the company. Nor should we make our
					 decisions and cuts on the backs of people who live in certain areas. We should
					 not sock it to them, as the saying goes, and say that if they want to travel
					 they must pay the price.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Confederation is about looking after all the people and
					 provinces that fall within this great dominion. We are supposed to be brothers
					 and sisters who share and share alike. Some of us have advantages because we
					 live in larger regions. Many have advantages because we live in small ones,
					 whether it be greater resources, the types of freedoms we have or whatever.
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When it comes to movement throughout this country, we
					 should not be penalized because we live in remote areas. We should not be
					 disadvantaged when it comes to educational or employment opportunities because
					 we live in small communities or because our accent or skin colour is different.
					 That is not what Confederation is about. That is not what Canada is
					 about.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have a chance here to do something right. Let us use
					 a bit of common sense, as I said before, and make sure we do it right this
					 time.</p>

					 Moody—Coquitlam—Port Coquitlam, Canadian Alliance):
				  </b>

	Mr. Speaker, I wanted to come back to the House after
					 my speech and clarify some things that were said about my speech within the
					 context of the debate on Bill C-38.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was said by the hon. Bloc member that I was somehow
					 anti-French and anti-Quebec because I dared say that the Air Canada Public
					 Participation Act is not the most efficient means by which to enforce official
					 bilingualism in Canada.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By mandating that only Air Canada must enforce the
					 Official Languages Act and not the other carriers, we are doing a disservice to
					 the principle of official bilingualism rather than a service to it. That is the
					 only point I was trying to make. The member dared to stand in this place and
					 say I am anti-Quebec and anti-francophone because I dared to point out that
					 principle and enforce the view that official bilingualism is an appropriate
					 principle for Canada.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would inform the hon. member that my mom taught
					 French immersion in British Columbia. My sister teaches French immersion in
					 British Columbia. I am a product of French immersion. When I was 12 years old I
					 lived in Quebec for a month in a community that was totally francophone. I did
					 so because I wanted to learn the language and understand the country better by
					 being exposed to literature in both official languages. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would say to the Bloc member that there are a lot of
					 British Columbians who want to learn both official languages to understand the
					 country better. However enrolment in French immersion classes is way down
					 because of the Bloc Quebecois and separatist movements.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My family has done more for the country by advancing
					 official bilingualism and the French fact than the Bloc Quebecois has ever
					 done. For the hon. member to dare stand in this place and say I am opposed to
					 official bilingualism is absolutely offensive. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would encourage the hon. member to withdraw the
					 remarks because the official opposition and I are in favour of official
					 bilingualism. That sort of smear is totally inappropriate and undignified for
					 the French language in Canada.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, I congratulate my hon. colleague for his

					 was leaving to fly to Ottawa this week, one of the men who had been working at
					 Air Canada for 23 years received his notice that he was being laid off. He
					 needed a little more time to get his retirement pension.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we are bringing in legislation and talking about
					 things like this we must somehow have protection for people like him. That must
					 be part and parcel of the legislation. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I then went to the ticket agent who had been there long
					 before I started flying to Ottawa. She got her notice that day. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is what is happening. Many people are being hurt
					 right now. We gave the airline $160 million and it went out and bought another
					 carrier instead of looking after those employees. How does my hon. colleague
					 feel about this?</p>

				  </b>

	Mr. Speaker, the hon. member is dead on in what she
					 says. I think all of us who have gone through airports recently have run across
					 employees in a similar situation. A while ago Air Canada tried to lay off a
					 number of employees who had come from the Canadian Airlines system. Because of
					 an agreement they have been asked to put it all on hold.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of the transition that has taken place I would
					 suggest to the government that Air Canada not be allowed to tamper with its
					 employees until the mess is straightened out. I hope we can deal with them by
					 keeping them on. If not, we should still proceed in the right and proper
					 fashion and try to get the company back on solid footing so we can continue for
					 many years to provide the type of employment we need so badly in
					 Canada.</p>

				Act, be read the second time and referred to a committee.</p>

					 PC/DR): </b>

	Mr. Speaker, I want to speak to Bill C-38 in which the
					 government is finally acknowledging that it is willing to raise the foreign
					 ownership restriction from 15% to 45%. I compliment the member for South
					 Surrey--White Rock--Langley. She has been a leader on the issue and has fought
					 for these changes ever since I was a member of parliament. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the government had taken leadership on the issue
					 years ago the airline industry may not be in the mess it is in right now. It is
					 important to emphasize that. Canada's airline industry is in a disastrous
					 state. The government is scrambling and grasping at straws to make the changes
					 that will somehow pull it out of the ground. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government must take responsibility for the mess we
					 are in today. It was directly involved with the Canadian Airlines and Air
					 Canada deal. Who knows to what level it was involved? It is important that this
					 be stated here in the House. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We in my party support the bill. I cannot overemphasize
					 the amount of work my colleague the member for South Surrey--White
					 Rock--Langley has done on the issue. She has been a leader. She saw the problem
					 when the airline industry was first in trouble. She did virtually everything in
					 her power to get them to come to their senses. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is important to emphasize that this is not a result
					 of the events on September 11. There is no question that the attacks had a
					 compounding effect, but the industry was in dire straits prior to that. Air
					 Canada was losing something like $1.5 million a day and the government refused
					 to move. I wish the government had done something sooner.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am not convinced the bill would save Air Canada. Air
					 Canada has huge problems. I have spoken to people directly involved in the
					 industry who are not convinced Air Canada can survive. Technically it should be
					 bankrupt now. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have stated before on the record that I do not
					 believe bailouts at the cost of the taxpayer are the solution. It is one thing
					 to provide Air Canada with direct compensation as a result of September 11.
					 However to start bailing it out with the billions of dollars it is asking for
					 is not the answer. There must be changes to Air Canada. There must be changes
					 to the way the airline is managed. It is a disaster.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We in the Canadian Alliance will be supporting the
					 bill. I am pleased to stand and support legislation that the member for South
					 Surrey--White Rock--Langley might well have drafted herself. She is the one who
					 brought the issue to the forefront. She is the one who has advocated it for so
					 long. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a pity the government would not listen to her. It
					 is a pity the government would not listen to the good ideas of a member of
					 parliament who knows the industry inside and out, who has many airline workers
					 in her riding and who has followed the issue. It is a pity the government would
					 not put the future of airline industry employees who face losing their jobs
					 ahead of politics. Unfortunately the government only started listening at the
					 24th hour. It is now uncertain whether this can be saved. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We in my party will be supporting the legislation. It
					 is about time the government woke up.</p>

					 well-being of their employment benefit plans, the management of those plans and
					 their ultimate retirement plan issues.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My motion is quite self-evident in the very brief
					 motion that it is. It makes the argument that whenever an employee benefit plan
					 or a pension plan shows a surplus, that surplus got there by an
					 over-contribution. It is an actuarial surplus. It should be viewed as the
					 property of the employees, not to be used for anything else. In other words,
					 the employer should not be able to view this actuarial surplus as something
					 that he could in fact dip into and use for any other reason, for any purpose
					 other than improving the benefits of the beneficiaries of the plan or, and we
					 also contemplate another acceptable usage, to give a contribution holiday to
					 the employee if in fact it is a joint contribution plan.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This raises a whole debate right across the country
					 because of the sheer size and volume of these plans today. Members in the House
					 would be interested to know that employee benefit plans constitute the largest
					 single block of capital in the world today. Over 50% of all the trading going
					 on in the stock exchange is employee benefit plans moving their money around.
					 It is huge. My own union is a very small union on an international level and
					 our union pension plan is $40 billion. It really is staggering to look at the
					 scope and size of these plans.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We can understand the temptation of the employers as
					 they view this actuarial surplus to say either that they are in a pinch and can
					 use that money or that they could use that money to expand the company or for
					 any number of reasons.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I first took note of this back when Conrad Black owned
					 Dominion Stores. There was quite a national court battle over the idea. I think
					 there was an $80 million surplus at that time. He believed that he made the
					 contribution to the plan and it was a defined benefit plan. There was an
					 actuarial surplus, ergo he should be able to use whatever surplus there was. In
					 other words, anything above and beyond the stated obligation should be his to
					 use for any other purpose. The employees balked at that and took it to court.
					 Ultimately, when all the dust settled, a split was negotiated.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There has been an absolutely overwhelming number of
					 similar cases since then, which was what made me interested in putting forward
					 a motion. We believe that the courts could use the guidance or at least that
					 this debate over these plans could use the guidance of members of parliament.
					 Some direction is needed because, frankly, the rulings of the courts or of
					 third party arbitrators, whatever the case may be, have been all over the map.
					 They have gone from ruling that yes, it is the exclusive deferred wages being
					 held in trust for the employees, to no, it was the employer that made the
					 contribution, ergo it is the employer's money, to any combination halfway down
					 the middle, 70:30, 60:40, 50:50. Judgments have been all over the
					 place.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no comfort level for Canadians. There are many
					 pensioners or people of middle age or beneficiaries of pension plans who are
					 nervous about this. It really came to a peak in my mind, and it was about the
					 time when I drafted this motion, when the government, as an employer, the
					 largest public sector employer in the country, did the exact same thing. It
					 could not help but notice a $30 billion actuarial surplus in the public service
					 employees' pension plan. As he left Canadian politics it was the last action of
					 Marcel Masse, the former president of the Treasury Board, to pass legislation
					 in the House to take every penny of that $30 billion. </p>


	<A NAME="T1735"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1735"><!-- Hour: 5--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1740"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1730"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1735)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was no negotiation. There must have been a
					 question in the government's mind as to who rightfully owned it, because if
					 there was not a question it would not have had to put forth the enabling
					 legislation to enable it to take it all. However, by its actions the government
					 weighted this otherwise legitimate debate that is going on in the
					 country.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That $30 billion should have been seen as the property
					 of the employees on whose behalf the contributions were made. When we think
					 about that particular case it is worthwhile to point out what a difference it
					 would have made had the government shared even a portion of the $30 billion
					 with the beneficiaries of the plan. We did some research. The average
					 beneficiary from the public service pension plan collects $9,000 per year. It
					 is not exactly a generous pension. Had the government shared even a portion of
					 that $30 billion, and we calculated it at one-third, I believe, it could have
					 doubled each beneficiary's yearly pension to $18,000 a year. It would have made
					 a huge difference in the lives of many senior citizens in the country and there
					 still would have been a surplus for the Government of Canada to use.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I raise this issue I think I can say without any
					 fear of contradiction that most Canadians want to know the status of any kind
					 of surplus in a pension plan to which they might belong.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I should go further to point out another thing that may
					 come up during the debate. To me it does not matter whether the contribution
					 was made by the employer or by the employee. Many pension plans are joint
					 contribution plans. The employee puts in $5 a month and the employer matches it
					 with $5 a month. It is all the employee's money. Let me state that very
					 clearly. I am sure we will hear contrary opinions today. From my point of view
					 and the point of the view of the labour movement in the country, it is all the
					 money of the employees because it is part of their negotiated wage package.
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us think about how employers end up putting in
					 contributions to pension plans. A wage increase is negotiated at the bargaining
					 table, at least in the unionized sector. Let us say that it is a 1% raise. Then
					 the employers and employees talk about how the 1% will be given to the employee
					 and usually it is some combination of wages and benefits. In other words,
					 employees take their negotiated wage increase and say they want 25 cents an
					 hour in their pockets and 25 cents an hour put into their pension plan on their
					 behalf. That is how we get the view that it is employees' deferred wages being
					 held for them in trust until they are needed.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In our view, to use the money for anything other than
					 the understood use is a breach of trust. Employers take money off employees'
					 pay packets and put it on hold for them for a specific reason. To seek to take
					 it out and use it for some completely different reason is a breach of trust, a
					 breach of faith. That is what is happening right across the country, or at
					 least employers are seeking to do that right across the country.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I brought with me an absolute stack of recent cases. I
					 will not bore the House with all the details. We can hardly open a newspaper to
					 the financial pages without finding an example, whether it is OMERS, of the
					 Ontario municipal employees' union, which is currently fighting the same fight
					 with CUPE leading the struggle on the employees' behalf, or Moore's of Canada,
					 the garment retailers. Royal Bank employees are having a similar battle. Bank
					 of Canada employees are having a similar battle.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All across the country seniors' groups, groups of
					 retirees and groups of pensioners are coming together to ask this very
					 important and pressing question, which raises the point of why the House of
					 Commons did not deem the issue votable. I really think we are doing a
					 disservice to the many retirees, pensioners and members of pension plans who
					 really do want some direction. They want a legal opinion.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They are many conflicting legal opinions, but they want
					 a legal opinion from this authority, maybe not the highest authority in the
					 land, but certainly this House of representatives should have an opinion to
					 share, to give some direction and to add to this very pressing
					 debate.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I have said, I was part of a union pension plan
					 myself, the carpenters' union. I served as a trustee to manage that fund and I
					 do know something about the issue. Another point I would make is that in our
					 unionized setting these plans were jointly trusteed. Had I had room within this
					 motion I would have also advocated that there be a mandated joint trusteeship
					 in any trust document forming an employee benefit plan. We believe it is only
					 logical that the interests of those who ultimately would benefit from the plan
					 should be represented at the trustee level. I do not think we would be having
					 the same court challenges or clogging up the legal system with these many
					 challenges were we able to deal with that at the most elementary level, whereby
					 the board of trustees would make the choice as to how it would allocate any
					 kind of surplus in one of these employee benefit plans.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have had meetings with Canadian union retirees, with
					 members of the Manitoba association of seniors and with other seniors' groups
					 and organizations and activist groups that deal with employee benefit plans.
					 They are seriously in need and desirous of somebody coming forward and ruling
					 once and for all on how these surpluses should be invested or dealt
					 with.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a school of thought in the recent Bell Canada
					 pension surplus issue, where the surplus was divided up in roughly the same
					 percentage as the contributions were made. It was a 40% employee contribution
					 matched by a 60% employer contribution. That was the way the surplus was
					 divvied up. That happened at exactly the same time we were debating Bill C-78
					 and we in the House were making the ruling that the government would take all
					 of the $30 billion and not put one penny into the pockets of either the
					 employees or the beneficiaries of the plan, the retirees.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not hard to see where the government found the
					 $100 billion that it gave in tax cuts. It took $30 billion from arguably the
					 most needy people in the country, senior citizens and pensioners living on
					 $9,000 a year from the public service pension plan. It took another $30 billion
					 from the surplus in the EI fund. That is no secret either. Therefore, of the
					 $100 billion, $60 billion came from unemployed people and pensioners. That is
					 nothing to be very proud of.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However it is not my intention to berate the federal
					 government over water under the bridge. Bill C-78 was passed and is now law. In
					 that context it does not give guidance to other private sector pension plans or
					 even to other public sector pension plans as to how they might treat their
					 surpluses. This was a special act of parliament that gave parliament a one time
					 right to take the $30 billion actuarial surplus out of an employee pension
					 plan. The same question still arises right across the country in both the
					 private and public sectors.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not just the trade union movement that believes
					 pension plans are a form of deferred compensation for employees. There are
					 legal opinions to that effect. Many people use the test that if costs are
					 bargained in the negotiation of a pension plan the amounts which are agreed on
					 to be put toward pensions are in fact deferred wages. If benefits are bargained
					 and not costs, it would follow that it is the promised pension benefit that is
					 the deferred wage rather than the contributions which pay into the benefits. I
					 believe that is the distinction. If it is the benefit that is bargained and not
					 the contribution, then in a defined benefit package there would be no question.
					 Employees would have satisfaction without going to the courts. They could just
					 look at the jurisprudence. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it is in fact the defined costs, or in other words,
					 if we are dividing up who would pay into the plan, if that is part of the
					 negotiating process, at least in some legal opinions there is no question that
					 it is the deferred wages of the employees that are being held in trust for the
					 employees and they should be considered the exclusive property of the
					 employees, to be used only in two ways: to sweeten the benefits upon retirement
					 or to give the employees a contribution holiday for a period of
					 time.</p>

					 Secretary to the Minister of Finance, Lib.): </b>

	Mr. Speaker, the hon. member raised some interesting
					 ideas, but I cannot support the motion. I will give the main reason I cannot
					 support the motion first, then give some background and come back in more
					 detail on why I cannot support it.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The basic reason is that the member's motion is a good
					 example of what might be called the law of unintended consequences. The intent
					 is to benefit workers in pension plans over employers, but the effect would be
					 otherwise because the critical point that the motion fails to recognize is that
					 pension plans are voluntary. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If this motion were to succeed and become the law of
					 the land, the primary impact would be that we would have far fewer companies
					 willing to set up or continue with pension plans and workers would be forced to
					 make their own contributions to RRSPs or defined contribution plans. That is
					 more or less what the Alliance was arguing for when we had the debate some time
					 ago dealing with Canada pension plan reform.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We would have a retreat from the stability and the
					 security arising from defined benefit plans which currently exist today. We
					 would go to the much less secure world of employee directed plans where the
					 security of the employees would be reduced. The unintended consequence of this
					 motion would be to reduce the security for employees in their older years
					 rather than to increase their wealth which is the intent of the
					 motion.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will give a bit of the background provided by the
					 department on how the current system works. One would not want all the
					 department's work to be of no avail. The Pension Benefits Standards Act, PBSA,
					 is the main federal act that regulates pension plans in federally chartered
					 enterprises. This includes banking, interprovincial transportation and
					 telecommunications. Other private pensions are regulated by the
					 province.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The PBSA is administered on behalf of the government by
					 the Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions, or OSFI, and covers
					 some 1,100 pension plans. OSFI clearly makes every effort to protect the rights
					 of pension plan members having due regard for the voluntary nature of pension
					 plan sponsorship. If we ignore the fact that pension plans are voluntary we do
					 so at our extreme peril, which is the critical deficiency of the
					 motion.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill S-3 which was introduced in 1998 is another bill
					 that is relevant to this debate. Major changes in the bill included enhancing
					 planned governance measures by placing more emphasis on the importance of the
					 responsibilities of plan administrators. It required administrators to provide
					 more information to plan members and former members on the financial condition
					 of the plan and a means to facilitate agreements between employers and plan
					 beneficiaries on the distribution of surpluses.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bill specified the manner in which employers who
					 sponsor pension plans with surpluses could withdraw a portion of the surplus.
					 That should be of particular interest in today's debate. In June the government
					 announced specific regulations which relate to the mechanisms for an employer
					 to establish claims to a surplus.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The measures in Bill S-3 and the subsequent regulations
					 provided for an explicit process for the determination of surplus ownership of
					 pension plans. These changes created an environment where employers and
					 employees have the opportunity to work together in dealing with pension plan
					 surpluses.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So much for the status quo and the system under which
					 we work today. I will now return to the law of unintended consequences. The
					 hon. member's motion would have precisely the contrary effect to what he
					 intends. To illustrate and explain that point more clearly we should make the
					 key distinction between defined benefit pension plans and defined contribution
					 pension plans.</p>


	<A NAME="T1750"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1750"><!-- Hour: 5--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1755"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1745"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1750)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under defined benefit pension plans the employer
					 guarantees to the employee a certain fixed sum of money when that employee
					 retires and therefore is required to build up the capital to fund that future
					 contribution. The risk is borne by the employer and that is the setting in
					 which surpluses arise. There may be excess surpluses and the debate is about
					 who will control them. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under defined contribution pension plans there are
					 really no surpluses because each employee makes a defined contribution every
					 month or every year. The stock market and the bond market would determine the
					 amount of money that an employee would receive in retirement.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When everybody thought that the stock market never went
					 anywhere but up, until recently that is, defined contribution plans were
					 becoming more popular. A lot of companies are shifting away from defined
					 benefit where the employee has the security of knowing what his or her future
					 pension would be and the risk is borne by the company to define contribution
					 and where the employee gets whatever the market delivers on his or her
					 investment.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is too early to tell but I suspect this enthusiasm
					 for defined contribution waned a bit in the last several months. People have
					 learned that the stock market does not go exclusively up but sometimes goes
					 down. The risk for the individual whose life savings are in the stock market is
					 now perceived to be greater than it used to be.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This comes back to the Alliance's love affair with
					 defined contribution self-directed pension plans when we were dealing with
					 Canada pension plan reform. Thankfully we did not do this and we preserved the
					 security of the pensions of Canadians through the Canada pension plan rather
					 than subjecting each individual to the whims of the market. It might have
					 looked good back then but it looks a lot less favourable and more risky today.
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If companies were sole contributors and were required
					 to say that the surplus belonged to the workers entirely, even if it were the
					 company that put in 100% of the contributions, we can bet our bottom dollar
					 that companies would not want that. Companies would not agree to it if this
					 motion were to pass. Pension plans are voluntary and they would get out of
					 it.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The trend that we have been observing from defined
					 benefit toward defined contribution would accelerate. The unintended
					 consequence of the member's motion would accelerate the shift away from defined
					 benefit pension plans and toward defined contribution. The net effect would
					 reduce the security and the income of today's employees rather than increase
					 their wealth. That is a more than adequate reason to oppose the motion.

					 Alliance): </b>

	Mr. Speaker, I am speechless. The parliamentary
					 secretary has put forth a position with which I, unfortunately, have to agree.
					 The motion put forth by my colleague is a very well intentioned motion. The
					 intent is there to protect workers and ensure that all Canadians, of whatever
					 background, have a solid nest egg, something to retire on.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When my father came over from Italy he was part of the
					 union movement. He started out as a carpenter and a painter. He was a member of
					 local 1080, the painters and allied trades in Toronto. The pension plan was a
					 very important one for him. He moved on and started his own business but he
					 does receive a pension plan. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The important thing for me in the Alliance Party in
					 Canada is that there is choice. In our constitutional parliamentary system we
					 have the judiciary and the parliamentary system. With the bringing into effect
					 of the charter of rights, the distinction or the relationship between those two
					 bodies, it is not that it is being blurred but it is in the process of being
					 figured out.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In looking at the motion, I do not believe it is
					 balanced enough. As the parliamentary secretary mentioned, it takes an approach
					 that removes a lot of the individual's freedom for decision making. When my
					 father was a drywaller and a painter, he had companies and subcontractors that
					 were willing to participate in a type of pension system. That was very
					 important. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was going to talk about the flaws in my colleague's
					 motion but I would be redundant because the six points I would have mentioned
					 have been gone through by my colleague from the government side. However we can
					 always trust a Liberal to put a partisan edge on a debate that deals with the
					 well-being of Canadians. That is the key point here. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am sure all members in the House want to make sure
					 workers are taken care of. We have a process. It may not be the final word on
					 determining surpluses but it is a process and for the House to support the
					 motion I think would tie the hands not only of the courts but of
					 parliamentarians in this sitting and in the future. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For that reason, I and the official opposition cannot
					 support the motion even though we support the intent of the motion to provide a
					 solid pension system for the hardworking men and women of Canada.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, thank you for this opportunity to

					 Centre, which reads: </p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td><small>That, in the opinion of this House,
						  any actuarial surplus in any pension plan or employee benefit plan should be

						  should only be used to improve the benefits of retirees or to provide a
						  contribution holiday for employees. </small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to take a few moments to dissect the
					 motion, starting with the first part calling for the sums paid into pension
					 plans or employee benefit plans to be considered deferred wages.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We in the Bloc Quebecois are naturally in favour of the
					 motion. We are not at all bothered by considering the employee portion of
					 pension plans or benefit plans deferred salaries.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In professional sport, that is how the multimillionaire
					 players get deferred salaries years after retirement. These people are, it must
					 be kept in mind, earning millions of dollars a year. They are not our average
					 wage earners. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another part of the motion I think it important to
					 address is the part about these pension plans remaining the exclusive property
					 of employees. If the motion had been law, I think it would have prevented
					 certain unscrupulous governments from dipping into pension plans and EI
					 funds.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am sure the member for 
					 Kamouraska--Rivière-du-Loup--Témiscouata--Les
						Basques, who is the Bloc Quebecois' EI critic, would agree that
					 employers and employees own Canada's EI fund.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the member for Winnipeg Centre explained so clearly,
					 this would resolve many decades long legal disputes. One particular case that
					 comes to mind is that of Singer, an American company which manufactured sewing
					 machines.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One fine day it decided to shut down its Saint-Jean
					 plant, cross the border and leave for the United States, taking with it the
					 employees' pension fund. It took years to resolve the problem in the courts, so
					 many years that most of those entitled to draw pensions under the plan had died
					 by the time the case was settled. The majority of them had died and those still
					 living were 80 or 85 years old and had only a few more years left to benefit
					 from the pension fund to which they themselves had contributed.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clearly, we agree completely with the motion put
					 forward by the member for Winnipeg Centre.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, however, I find it unfortunate that the
					 motion is not votable. I therefore seek the unanimous consent of the House to

					 PC/DR): </b>

	Mr. Speaker, it is with pleasure today that I rise to
					 speak to the motion by the hon. member for Winnipeg Centre. I commend him for
					 bringing it forward. It harkens back to when the government, through Bill C-78,
					 raided $30 billion out of the federal superannuates' pension and did so while
					 breaking its own guidelines set forth in Bill S-3 which was originally
					 introduced in the House in 1997.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While I do not support the member's motion completely,
					 I do believe the government ought to follow its own rules as set forth in Bill
					 S-3, which did provide at least a framework to ensure that the interests of
					 employers were balanced with the interests of employees and the third group,
					 the people who had already retired and stood to benefit. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clearly the government was in violation of the
					 principle of Bill S-3 and in fact broke its own rules by arbitrarily taking $30
					 billion out of the superannuates' pension fund without actually following some
					 type of rules based methodology which would have ensured fairness to all
					 parties involved at that time.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill S-3 actually put forth some level of guidelines.
					 It outlined that the surplus could be accessed if two-thirds of the current
					 members to the plan and two-thirds of the former members, retired employees,
					 agreed. If they could achieve 50% but not necessarily 65% then the employer
					 could go to arbitration. This again would help to ensure that all shareholders'
					 interests were looked after and met in a rules based way.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hon. member for Markham made a good point. Given
					 the current tumultuous times in the capital markets, it would be of significant
					 benefit to an employee or a retired individual receiving a pension to have that
					 level of defined benefit. There would certainly be a tremendous peace of mind
					 in that regard. I think even the Canada pension plan fund lost 15% of its value
					 this year. I wish my portfolio had done that well. A 15% loss sounds pretty
					 good at this juncture. The fact is that there is a benefit.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Going back over the last several years of bull markets,
					 people started to forget that sometimes markets actually go down as opposed to
					 going up all the time. I believe that had the hon. member for Markham still
					 been an economist he would have foreseen this and would have demonstrated his
					 impressions and foresight in the world of private sector bank
					 economists.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. John O'Reilly:</b> His portfolio went
					 up.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Scott Brison:</b> That is good because his
					 income went down when he was elected.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fact is that there is a significant exposure for
					 employers when they manage these funds. They have the downside risk of ensuring
					 the funds are there for the employees and retirees. That being the case, the
					 employees have the risk of employers taking funds from the pension and going
					 bankrupt. We need to understand that there are significant risks on both sides
					 which is why there needs to be an enforceable rules based system by which we
					 can ensure fairness to all parties.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What disappointed me most about the government's
					 arbitrary and unfair treatment of superannuates was when it chose to ignore the
					 rules based system as put forth in Bill S-3 and to pursue a policy that was
					 short-sighted, unfair and consistent with the government raiding the EI fund
					 and using funds designed for specific interests and to meet general revenue
					 needs. I have seen a few public policy initiatives by the government that have
					 disillusioned me but the treatment of superannuates' pensions at that point was
					 something that united all opposition parties.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A good many members opposite agreed privately but of
					 course they had to be whipped into shape at the appropriate times. Many of them
					 were appalled even with their own government's heavy-handed approach to
					 superannuates, people like RCMP officers and retirees, and people in the
					 military. They served their country and were treated shabbily by the government
					 in ignoring its own guidelines in the brief. I understand exactly why the hon.
					 member would move the motion. I am sure he can remember the government's unfair
					 and heavy-handed approach at that time.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is very difficult for the government to expect
					 private sector employers to follow guidelines set forth by legislation passed
					 in the House, or as introduced in the Senate in the case of Bill S-3. How can
					 we expect private sector employers to follow those guidelines the government
					 ignores those guidelines when it is convenient? I think that would be a
					 principle upon which all members in the House could agree. Certainly all
					 opposition members would agree that the government ought to follow its own
					 guidelines.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That trust was broken between the government and public
					 sector employees at the time of its arbitrary theft of the funds from the
					 superannuates pension. It was absolutely unacceptable and disillusioning. Every
					 member of the House at that time heard countless appeals from superannuates,
					 from people who had served this country. For the government to have turned its
					 back on those people speaks of the unprecedented and near toxic levels of
					 arrogance that emanate from government benches. It is only getting worse as
					 members of the natural governing party feel increasingly ensconced in their
					 feudal chairs.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those issues can be dealt with through some of the work
					 that is being achieved by the PC/DR Coalition and other opposition parties. As
					 we bring together like-minded intelligent Canadians seeking better government
					 in the interests of all Canadians, by the time the next election occurs there
					 will be a competitiveness--</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. member:</b> Take an Aspirin.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Scott Brison:</b> The hon. member opposite
					 suggested that I take an Aspirin. He should suggest that because his government
					 has created nothing but headaches for Canadians, and nowhere are those
					 headaches more pronounced than here on the opposition benches.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. member: </b> I would have suggested
					 acetylsalicylic acid instead of Bayer Aspirin.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Scott Brison:</b> There was a suggestion that I
					 not take an Aspirin. My friend from the New Democratic Party suggested I take a
					 generic brand, which brings me to our health minister who is everyone's
					 favourite generic leadership candidate, but that is a different issue for
					 another day.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is so much to criticize about the government that
					 it is difficult to maintain some level of attention. Perhaps we need generic
					 Ritalin so that opposition members can focus.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have to ensure that all governments follow rules
					 based methodologies that are already in existence. Only then can we ensure that
					 private firms follow those rules. Until the government is willing to play by
					 those rules, I think the hon. member is quite right. I disagree with the
					 specific notion that in an arbitrary sense all these surpluses should go back
					 to the employees. However, we do need to ensure that governments are held
					 accountable when they break their own rules in not ensuring fairness among the
					 players, the employers, the employees and the retirees. </p>

					 NDP): </b>

	Mr. Speaker, just in case my colleagues across the way
					 have lost sight of what we are talking about or the public has forgotten,
					 because sometimes when a debate goes on other things come into it, I want to
					 reinforce the motion by my colleague from Winnipeg Centre:</p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td><small>That, in the opinion of this House,
						  any actuarial surplus in any pension plan or employee benefit plan should be
						  considered the deferred wages and exclusive property of the employees and
						  should only be used to improve the benefits of retirees or to provide a
						  contribution holiday for employees.</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A lot of Canadians believe this already happens. We
					 have heard horror stories over the years where different employers raped the
					 pension plans or went bankrupt and used the pension plans and the employees
					 were left out in the wilderness in the snow. They were left going into their
					 senior years with nothing. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canadians think that governments addressed this issue
					 and put in strong regulations to make sure this did not happen. A lot of people
					 out there believe this has already happened. It is surprising that sometimes
					 private members have to bring forward good motions and good pieces of
					 legislation to address the downfall and the lacking of the government of the
					 day and certainly, that is the case here.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My colleague from Winnipeg Centre has been involved
					 with employees for a number of years. I am sure over time he has seen a number
					 of cases where this has happened and the employer has utilized the
					 funds.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think of the situation of the Giant mine workers in
					 Yellowknife and what they went through with their severance packages and
					 pension plans when that mine went under. The government, and I believe it was
					 under the auspices of the Department of Indian Affairs and Northern
					 Development, took over the mine and literally gave nothing back to those
					 employees. They were left out in the cold, which again is no surprise with the
					 government.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is crucial that we as private members bring these
					 motions forward and remind the government of what is important. Canadians want
					 to see values. They want to know that when they make investments in their
					 pension plans, they will reap the benefits of those pension plans.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not just those employees that reap those
					 benefits. Each and every one of us knows retirees in our communities. Often
					 employees leave their employment with a pension that gives them $10,000 a
					 month. Mostly they are minimal pensions that give a person a living to some
					 degree. Those people are interspersed in every small community, village and
					 town in the country. Those are the people who keep our local economies going.
					 The more we can put into their pockets in their retirement, the better off we
					 are as a country. That is what sustains our local economies and builds the
					 country we know and we want to be proud of. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am extremely pleased that my colleague has brought
					 forward this motion. I want to support his motion. It has certainly been good
					 listening to some of the members who have supported it. Obviously there are
					 those who had some rather lacking comments about it for what I consider invalid
					 reasons, but so be it. That happens in the House.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I reflected on some things as my colleague from the
					 PC/DR Coalition was speaking. He talked about the need for the government to
					 follow through on what it does so that the private sector will also follow
					 through. It is tough ensure that the private sector will follow through on
					 rules if the government does not do it.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pay equity was the prime example. For 14 years public
					 servants had to fight the government year after year after year. Literally
					 hundreds of thousands, actually millions of dollars went to legal fees to fight
					 the employees who were claiming rightful equity within the public service.
					 </p>


	<A NAME="T1815"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1815"><!-- Hour: 6--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1820"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1810"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1815)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally the government was forced to come through with
					 it. There were 14 years of legal fees and fighting. Through that whole process
					 that was the example it was setting for private industry in Canada. It said
					 that pay equity was not important, not worth diddly-squat. It made that fight
					 in the private sector that much tougher.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is crucially important that the government practice
					 what it preaches. Otherwise it does not get the support and does not have the
					 trust of the public.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is another situation. I almost do not want to
					 bring it up but I do so because it happened this afternoon and it bothered me
					 that the government would take this stance. We talked about the cluster bombing
					 in Afghanistan. Former foreign affairs minister Lloyd Axworthy is renowned
					 internationally for his efforts to ban landmines. Canada sings its praises
					 about banning landmines. We could not get the U.S. on side and never could, but
					 Canada went out there and sang its own praises. All the Liberal members I am
					 sure jumped up at numerous times and clapped and cheered because they were
					 opposed to landmines.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today we heard about cluster bombs. They will land and
					 not explode, but they will explode later. They act just like landmines. We
					 heard that we have to do that sometimes. No, we do not do it ever. If we do not
					 believe there should be landmines, then we follow through all the time. It is
					 absolutely inhumane to leave bombs sitting around for children to walk over.
					 The small children are the ones who suffer the most.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, I have a couple of points to make in
					 support of my colleague's private member's motion.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This brings home the point of the need for this type of
					 legislation. I recently had a conversation with one of my legal colleagues. He
					 was telling me about a current situation. I will change the facts a little so
					 it is not clear about the specific case we were talking about. I do not wish to
					 divulge any of the information he specifically gave me.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. member: </b>He is not the solicitor
					 general.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Joe Comartin: </b>That is right. I have to be
					 careful of disclosing confidential information.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The situation is going to lead to a tragedy. We can see
					 it coming. There was a financial difficulty in the corporate setting. The
					 workforce was gradually reduced, leaving at the end of the day about 15 or 16
					 workers, long term employees who, when the administration of the company was
					 about to close, entered into an agreement on the pension. In effect it was a
					 severance package that allowed those people to retire somewhat earlier. It did
					 not disclose that there was a substantial surplus.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The company over a period of several sales always
					 allowed for the surplus to be an asset, in fact the only asset that was being
					 traded. All of this was unbeknownst to the workers and the people who were
					 receiving pension benefits on a monthly basis. That matter was sitting there
					 until very recently. The company has applied to have the surplus paid out. This
					 is going to provoke a major lawsuit. Those employees are going to insist that
					 they somehow participate in this fund, which they fully expected they were
					 going to be able to do. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This situation is multiplied across the country
					 numerous times. All sorts of situations and incidents either are occurring now
					 or are going to explode at some point in the future. There is a crying need for
					 legislation to take care of this situation as soon as possible. Again I
					 congratulate my colleague on the work he has done on this private members'
					 motion. I encourage the government to take it into account.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the years I have had a number of instances in my
					 own constituency in which working people have had their pension surplus
					 stripped away from them.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purpose of this motion is to ensure that those

					 NDP): </b>

	Mr. Speaker, I thank all the hon. members who saw fit
					 to join in the debate and share their views with me. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am disappointed that the views that I hold on the
					 subject are not more widespread, but I am interested in the fact that the
					 debate at least has been held here tonight. It is information that we can use.
					 It is information that we will benefit from.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have to restate our original position: in the event
					 of an actuarial surplus where the assets of a fund exceed the liabilities of a
					 fund, those reserves should be used only to benefit the beneficiaries in the
					 monthly amount or benefits they receive.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a straightforward issue. We view contributions to
					 a pension plan as part of the employee's wage packet. Employees get their
					 hourly wage or monthly salary and their pension contribution. Whether it comes
					 out of the employee's pocket or comes directly from the employer, it is part of
					 the employee's wage. It is being held in trust for the employee for a specific
					 purpose. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To take that money and use it for anything other than
					 the understood purpose is a breach of trust. There have been too many cases.
					 Recently there has been an overwhelming number of cases. The courts are clogged
					 with these cases, which is exactly the reason why the House of Commons should
					 give some guidance to the arbitrators or the courts or at least say to
					 Canadians that we have thought about this and it is our opinion that this money
					 should be viewed as the employees'.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to thank the member from the Bloc Quebecois who
					 pointed out a very important recent ruling in that province. I sometimes envy
					 the members of the Bloc and the residents of Quebec for their attitudes on
					 these social issues. Judge Guy Arsenault recently ruled in the Singer case,
					 which is called Chateauneuf v TSCO of Canada Ltd., formerly known as Singer
					 Sewing Machine, and directed that the surplus assets of the plan must be
					 returned to the plan members. He went back retroactively from 1966 to 1984,
					 when a private company used to say that any time a plan showed a surplus it
					 used that for its own purposes.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That was wrong. The judge in Quebec ruled that it was
					 wrong and was backed up further in that province by the social solidarity
					 minister. How I wish we had a social solidarity minister. The social solidarity
					 minister of Quebec, André Boisclair, said that the government will amend bill
					 102, the law which addresses the way private pension plans are to be
					 administered, because it flirted with the idea of giving employers the right to
					 dip into private sector pension plan surpluses. Partly because of this court
					 ruling, they have now been convinced to back off and get their hands off
					 private sector pension plan surpluses.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We had a glaring example in the House of Commons. As a
					 union leader I have seen glaring examples all across the country. We had the
					 ultimate example in Bill C-78, when the federal government knew it was on shaky
					 ground. It knew this was a debatable issue. It was not black and white. It was
					 a grey area as to who really had the claim on the $30 billion surplus of the
					 public service pension plan.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It therefore introduced a bill and by act of parliament
					 said that it was the exclusive owner of all of that $30 billion, that it was
					 not negotiable, that it was not something the government was willing to share,
					 that it was the government's, 100%. The government knew it was not absolutely
					 right in that argument or it would not have had to introduce a special bill to
					 do it. It would not have had to sacrifice Marcel Masse's career to make it his
					 last act in parliament. The government could have done it legally.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We know it is a moral issue. It is a legal issue. It is
					 an ethical issue. It is an issue of basic trust. When money is deducted from a
					 person's paycheque for a specific purpose and is held in trust for them, even
					 if it does grow it is still the exclusive property of the person on whose
					 behalf it is being held. It should be used for nothing else but employee
					 benefits. In our minds, it is a simple case.</p>

					 (Kamouraska--Rivière-du-Loup--Témiscouata--Les Basques, BQ):
				  </b>

	Mr. Speaker, a few weeks ago, on October 3, I put a
					 question to the Minister of Finance. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I asked him for an action plan to allow those who were
					 affected by the events of September 11, those who lost their jobs and employees
					 of small and medium size businesses, to be exempted, for example, from having
					 to contribute for a month, in order to promote economic recovery by giving more
					 money to small and medium size businesses and to workers so they could buy
					 goods and services and get the economy going. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also asked the minister to extend EI benefits by 10
					 weeks in the case of those workers who lost their jobs following the events of
					 September 11.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That question was put on the day that U.S. President
					 Bush made the same proposal to Americans, but with 13 weeks compared to the
					 additional 10 weeks that we asked for.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister of Finance replied the following about the
					 surplus in the EI fund and I am quoting him because this is somewhat
					 impressive:</p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td width="30" align="right">
</td>
<td><small>—as
						  the hon. member is well aware, the surplus in the EI fund is being used for
						  health, for infrastructure programs, and for job creation.</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The minister thus confirmed that, since workers only
					 contribute to the employment insurance program up to an income of $39,000,
					 those who earn more than that amount did not do their fair share for health,
					 infrastructure programs and job creation. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The minister confirmed the unfair nature of the
					 employment insurance program when seen as a payroll tax instead of what it
					 should be, which is a true employment insurance program. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On October 3 we also asked the minister to bring down a
					 budget. In the end, the government agreed with us on this score.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, with regard to employment insurance, we had a
					 real cold shower. The human resources development minister had in her hands the
					 unanimous report of the human resources development committee containing 17
					 recommendations to improve the employment insurance plan and ensure it would
					 act as a real social safety net.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The recommendations would have enabled people to enjoy
					 reasonable living conditions while out of a job and have a decent income during
					 an acceptable number of weeks. It would have been easier for young people to
					 qualify and, at the end of the day, it would have ensured that older workers
					 who lost their jobs and could not re-enter the workforce had access to a fund
					 that would have allowed them a decent living while waiting for their old age
					 security cheques or Quebec pensions. However, the minister said no and stated
					 emphatically that the current plan was adequate.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe that today, as we are facing an economic
					 downturn, we have the proof that this plan will not be an adequate social
					 security net. A lot of people are all losing their jobs at the same
					 time.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The minister said that when the economy is thriving,
					 only one out of five people receives benefits during the maximum number of
					 weeks they are entitled to. I am sure that in the current context, it will not
					 be one out of five but two out of five.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While the number of unemployed workers is increasing,
					 the government is sitting on a few hundreds of millions of dollars it could
					 give the provinces for manpower training. The federal government has control
					 over this money and will not put it in the system.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Could the government not be swayed by our arguments and
					 at long last take concrete steps without delay? I hope it will do so in the
					 budget. But there are things it could do right away, tomorrow morning, in view
					 of the surplus that has been accumulating this year again in the employment
					 insurance fund, even with the economic downturn, to the tune of $6 billion,
					 which will be used for purposes other than what it was intended for.
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will conclude on that note and ask if in fact the
					 government will accept our suggestions now that the downturn in the economy has
					 unfortunately been confirmed.</p>

					 Secretary to the Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
				  </b>

	Mr. Speaker, answering the question from the member
					 opposite would take more than the four minutes allotted me because of its many
					 sub-questions. However, I will try to give a more general answer.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first important thing to remember is that the
					 Government of Canada has looked out for all Canadian workers and is still doing
					 so. It keeps a careful eye on the EI system in order to ensure that it always
					 meets their needs.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is particularly important to take a prudent approach
					 during an economic downturn such as the one we are now experiencing.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It must be recalled that during the course of its
					 existence the EI fund has varied from deficit to surplus. During the last
					 recession the surplus of $2 billion in the EI fund at the end of 1990 quickly
					 turned into a deficit of $6 billion at the end of 1993. We do not wish to
					 return to this state of affairs.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the last seven years the Canadian population has
					 benefited from premium reductions. We have gone from $3.07 in 1994 to $2.25 in
					 2001. Increasing premiums, as was done during the last recession would, in our
					 view, be the worst solution from an employment point of view.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to assess the current situation, the
					 government has announced that it will review the methods used for setting
					 premiums; changes deriving from that review will be implemented in
					 2004.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government of Canada is always worried when workers
					 lose their jobs. In order to help Canadians who are laid off, the government
					 has taken a balanced approach by providing income benefits and by encouraging
					 people to work. We will use our programs to help workers take advantage of new
					 job opportunities. As always, our goal is to help Canadian workers get back
					 into the workforce. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will also add that I am surprised that my colleague
					 opposite would ask the government to apply the same standards as the United
					 States with regard to social programs when we know that historically our social
					 programs have always been a lot better than what the Americans have done. And
					 it is still the case today. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For that reason, Human Resources Development Canada
					 offers several types of support measures to employees and employers in cases of
					 massive layoffs. That is what we have been doing since the events of September
					 11. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, we go to the premises of the employers or
					 to mutually agreed upon places to help employees fill out their applications
					 for benefits. Since we are on site, we can gather all the required information
					 and process the applications more quickly.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to point out a very important aspect of our
					 plan. Each month we correct the variable entrance requirement according to the
					 latest unemployment figures. When the unemployment rate increases, Canadians
					 need less hours to qualify for employment insurance and can receive benefits
					 for a longer period. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Employment insurance benefits give Canadians who are
					 laid off the time and resources they need to find another job that is
					 appropriate for them.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our follow up and evaluation process shows that the
					 employment insurance plan produces the desired results. </p>

				  </b>

	Mr. Speaker, it is true that the government controls
					 the plan. It controls it to such an extent that it has accumulated $34 billion
					 in surpluses since 1993.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today there is $34 billion in the government coffers
					 and there will be a further $6 billion this year. With such an increase, and
					 even being very cautious, it would take close to a decade to wipe out the
					 surpluses. I would like the government to be aware of that and stop misleading
					 us. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My question is straightforward. I understand that
					 assessments are conducted every month. How is it then that in my area where the
					 unemployment rate is on the rise, having reached 15.1% on October 8, recipients
					 have seen their benefits cut by two weeks?</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Claimants who used to be eligible for the minimum
					 number of weeks, 32, are now only eligible for 30 weeks. Those who were
					 eligible for 40 weeks are now down to 38 weeks. Is it not a blatant
					 contradiction and an obvious example of the government's bad faith in this
					 matter?</p>

	Mr. Speaker, I cannot answer with regard to the
					 particular situation that exists in my colleague's region. However, to say that
					 we are misleading Canadians seems to be a gross exaggeration.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First of all, I would like to point out the fact that
					 the required number of hours to qualify for employment insurance is adjusted
					 each month, in each of the 58 employment insurance regions, according to the
					 local unemployment rate.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will say again to my colleague opposite that during
					 the last election campaign, in November, we promised Canadians that we would
					 eliminate the intensity rule. That was the second bill that we passed, Bill
					 C-2, when we came back to the House. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also remind my colleague that, with the
					 employment insurance plan, Canadians who lose their jobs receive 55% of their
					 insurable earnings and low income families can receive up to 80% of their
					 insurable earnings. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not have enough time to answer this question in
					 the way I would like but those were a few of the points that could be
					 discussed. </p>

					 NDP): </b>

	Mr. Speaker, I rise this evening to follow up on a
					 question I asked the Prime Minister last month following the terrorist attacks
					 on the World Trade Center in New York, on the Pentagon and on the plane that
					 went down over Pennsylvania on September 11.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At that time and since, we have condemned, in the
					 strongest possible terms, these terrorist attacks as crimes against humanity
					 and have called for those who were responsible to be brought to justice within
					 the framework of international law and under the framework of the United
					 Nations. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today in following up on this question, I want to point
					 out that since October 7 we have witnessed in Afghanistan an illegal, immoral
					 and profoundly destructive war. I rise this evening to plead with our
					 government to end its support for this war and to end Canadian participation in
					 it. This is a war which is creating many new innocent victims, innocent Afghani
					 civilians. How many hundreds have already died as a result of this destructive
					 war?</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As well, we know that UN deminers have been killed. We
					 know that Red Cross and the United Nations' warehouses have been bombed and
					 destroyed. Hundreds of thousands of Afghani people are fleeing the terror of
					 the bombing and the terror of the Taliban regime. Canada's response to those
					 refugees has fallen far short.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was particularly concerned to learn that Canada is
					 involved in the military coalition with respect to the use of cluster bombs.
					 The United States is dropping cluster bombs from B-52 bombers on Afghanistan.
					 The shameful response of our Prime Minister to this is that we have to let
					 American generals fight this war. He said that Canada would let American
					 generals decide on the appropriate weapons. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As New Democrats, we are not prepared to agree with the
					 use of cluster bombs, which have been condemned by the Red Cross. In fact, the
					 Red Cross has called for cluster bombs to be banned. We are not prepared to say
					 that Canada should be part of a military coalition that allows and sanctions
					 the use of cluster bombs. In many cases they do not explode directly on impact
					 and are like hundreds of little landmines.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canada has led internationally in the campaign against
					 landmines and yet this is a blatant contradiction when we are prepared to
					 support the use of cluster bombs in Afghanistan. What is even worse is that
					 cluster bombs, which are yellow in colour, are the same colour as the food
					 packages. Now the Americans are warning Afghani civilians that they had better
					 be careful because they might be picking up a cluster bomb instead of food.
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For Heaven's sake, what has happened to Canada's
					 historic role? Why will we not speak out for the rule of law and for bringing
					 this under the umbrella of the United Nations, even at this late date, to end
					 the suffering and the creation of more innocent civilian deaths? As the parents
					 of one of those young men who died in the World Trade Center said during a
					 memorial service, “Why on earth would we bomb Afghanistan and create even more
					 innocent civilian victims? That doesn't bring back the life of my
					 son”.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I appeal for a peaceful solution; a solution of peace
					 and justice.</p>

				  </b>

	Mr. Speaker, I am sure we all join with the member in
					 sympathizing with the innocent victims of the war, however we did not start
					 this. Here I am on Halloween night doing a late show with the member for
					 Burnaby--Douglas, so that in itself is worrisome to some people.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There seems to be a misconception in the House that
					 supporting the United States and our allies in this campaign against terrorism
					 means that we are failing to support international law and the United Nations.
					 This is simply not the case.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All states have the right to individual and collective
					 self-defence under article 51 of the United Nations charter. The United Nations
					 Security Council has stated very clearly that the horrific attacks of September
					 11 constitute a threat to international peace and security. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With specific reference to the terrorist attacks on
					 September 11, 2001, the individual and collective right of self-defence was
					 expressly reaffirmed by the security council of the United Nations on September
					 12 and September 28 through security council resolutions 1368 and 1373
					 respectively.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Consequently, rather than acting outside the UN
					 framework and international law, the United States, Canada and its other allies
					 are taking action with the support of international law, the United Nations and
					 the United Nations charter.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canada has informed the security council that it is
					 acting militarily in accordance with article 51 of the UN charter. One of the
					 ways in which Canada is working together with its allies in this effort is by
					 committing 2,000 Canadian forces personnel to the campaign against
					 terrorism.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our contribution includes one Airbus, two Aurora
					 maritime patrol, three Hercules transport aircraft, a component of our Joint
					 Task Force Two special forces and a naval task force group consisting of four
					 of Her Majesty's Canadian ships, plus another ship in a U.S. formation, all
					 told over 1,000 sailors.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These deployed forces could be tasked and are capable
					 of performing a wide range of missions, including surveillance, transportation,
					 humanitarian aid, maritime operations and security and escort
					 duties.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The international military coalition, to which Canada
					 belongs, has a simple, clear and just mandate to defend ourselves against
					 terrorism. Within this mandate, we are working to identify the terrorist
					 threat, disrupt and destroy its networks and bring its organizations to
					 justice.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The minister has made it very clear that terrorists and
					 the Taliban regime are targets of the current campaign and that the Afghan
					 people most certainly are not. The government is committed to helping the
					 Afghan people and to this end has already allocated $16 million in humanitarian
					 aid.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While the military contribution is an important aspect
					 of the campaign against terrorism, it is by no means the only aspect. We are
					 also contributing diplomatic, humanitarian, economic, political and military
					 aid with the single objective of creating a safer more secure world, safe from
					 terrorist attacks like those we witnessed on September 11.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are acting with the sanctions of the UN and within
					 international law so that we can continue to be a country and a world that is a
					 safe place in which to bring up our children and our children's
					 children.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I ask the parliamentary secretary very specifically to
