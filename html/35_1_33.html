	<B>Mr. Walt Lastewka (St. Catharines):</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise in 
the House today to congratulate a great Canadian and a member 
of my St. Catharines constituency, Mr. Walter Ostanek.
<P>
	Walter Ostanek, better known as the polka king, received a 
second Grammy Award in New York last week. Walter Ostanek 
and his band won best polka album for <I>Accordionally Yours</I>.
<P>
	As the member of Parliament for St. Catharines, I am pleased 
and proud to congratulate Mr. Ostanek on his success at the 
Grammys. Those of us from St. Catharines have known of Mr. 
Ostanek's talent for many years. His dedication to the pursuit of 
excellence is exemplified by this most recent achievement in the 
international music industry.
<P>
	Congratulations to Walter Ostanek and his band.

	<B>Mr. Gilbert Fillion (Chicoutimi):</B> Mr. Speaker, a century of 
teaching will be the theme of the centenary celebrated this year 
by the Sisters of the Congregation of 
Notre-Dame-du-Bon-Conseil, the only religious community 
founded in Chicoutimi. Theirs is a history of dedication which 
deserves our attention.
<P>
	The Congregation has helped educate residents of the 
Saguenay-Lac-Saint-Jean area, since 1894, without 
interruption. The sisters also extended their ministry to 
Charlevoix and the North Shore. Finally, they have also worked 
in various countries in Africa and in Chile.
<P>
	I would therefore ask all members of this House to join the 
people of Chicoutimi in wishing the Sisters of 
Notre-Dame-du-Bon-Conseil a happy and prosperous 
centenary year.

	<B>Mr. Allan Kerpan (Moose Jaw-Lake Centre):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I rise today to congratulate my colleagues in their 
efforts to maintain a true sense of decorum in this House.
<P>
	I recently encountered many Canadians who were saddened 
and angry over remarks attributed to certain members in the 
House, one of whom alleged that some of us do not like Indians 
and then apologized. Television cameras recorded yet another 
member of the House calling other members racists.
<P>
	My constituents have told me they are disappointed when 
members of the House malign each other. They are distressed 
that their House of Commons is in danger of being brought into 
disrepute by any member hurling abusive language about so 
freely.

	<B>Mr. John Murphy (Annapolis Valley-Hants):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the budget is a key element in a much larger process, 
one that began last fall when Canadians told us they wanted a 
government that treated jobs as a priority.
<P>
	We have listened. We have made sure that the changes are 
sensitive to those with the greatest need. With the changes to the 
unemployment insurance, for example, low income Canadians 
with dependants will receive increased benefits to 60 per cent. 
Also, small businesses have been telling us that if we reduce UI 
premiums, if we just give them a chance, they will create work 
for Canadians.
<P>
	Now we have delivered. This must be seen in tandem with 
other actions we have taken to create jobs such as the 
infrastructure program, targeting of $800 million to innovative 
federal-provincial employment projects, a youth core, a youth 
internship project and our $1.9 billion support package for 
Atlantic Canada.
<P>
	It is clear that this government is keeping its promise to 
Canadians.

	I had the pleasure of meeting her just over a year go in my

<P>

<P>
	Dr. Arkinstall obtained a degree in medicine from the 
University of Toronto and set up practice with her husband, Dr. 
Bill Arkinstall, in Hearst, Ontario in 1931. They travelled by 
horse and cutter to look after people in lumber camps and remote 
homesteads.
<P>
	Dr. Arkinstall was not only a medical practitioner at a time 
when it was rare to see women in medicine, she also wrote 
books. In addition, Dr. Arkinstall volunteered her time to the 
United Church Women's Missionary Society. Since 1948, Dr. 
Arkinstall has lived in East Gwillimbury with her family and 
practised medicine in Newmarket.
<P>
	Dr. Arkinstall was awarded the first East Gwillimbury Citizen 
of the Year Award for her extraordinary contribution to the

<P>
	<I>Business Week</I> magazine says that states with low taxes 
clearly perform better than states with high taxes. Since 1985 
job growth in low tax states has been 65 per cent higher than in 
high tax states.
<P>
	There is a tradeoff however. Cutting taxes lowers the tax haul. 
The resultant faster growth still does not quite compensate for 
lost revenue and that is where the other necessary step comes in.
<P>
	Politicians must also reinvent the delivery of services. That 
means privatization and deregulation to reduce the cost of social 
services. This is not ideology. It is the hard evidence of what

	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Canadian Heritage.
<P>
	The sale of Ginn Publishing to Paramount Communications of 
New York is causing much concern in Canada's publishing 
world and cultural industry. We are about to see yet another 
instrument for the expression of cultural identity taken over by 
foreign interests. In addition, the whole operation has a 
clandestine air to it. It appears to have been conducted in secret 
on the strength of a verbal agreement of unknown origin.
<P>
	Will the minister reveal the identity of the person responsible 
for this sell out of our interests to a foreign publisher?
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Michel Dupuy (Minister of Canadian Heritage): </B>Mr. 
Speaker, I think that those responsible are the officials who 
closed the deal with my full support as well as the support of my 
colleague, the Minister of Industry who is responsible for 
Investment Canada.
<P>
<B>(1420) </B>
<P>
	I explained the situation a couple of days ago. This sale 
resulted from contractual commitments, which have been 
confirmed by the highest legal authorities in Canada. We simply 
fulfilled these commitments.
<P>
	We have been able to negotiate with the American buyers a 
series of commitments which will foster the publication and 
distribution of books in Canada.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the highest legal authorities in Canada are the courts, 
mainly the Supreme Court, yet this government did not dare 
bring the case to court.
<P>
	How can the minister attach so much importance to a promise 
which was carefully excluded from the written agreements, 
particularly in light of the fact that the government of the time 
had publicly committed itself never to sell this company to 
anything other than Canadian publishing interests?
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Michel Dupuy (Minister of Canadian Heritage):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, to answer that question, I think I would have to go 
check the history of this issue. It is almost ancient history by 
now. Under the previous government, there was a policy that the 
leader of the opposition must be familiar with, the Baie Comeau 
policy, requesting from American concerns acquiring Canadian 
book publishing companies that they make sure that these 
remain under Canadian control.
<P>
	At the time, it was understood-and deals were made under 
this policy-that if a policy change occurred, then purchases 
made by the Canadian government under this policy would be 
cancelled, and the property sold back to the American owner. 
That is the Baie Comeau policy.
<P>
	Later on, the Conservative government decided to change its 
policy and, therefore, fulfilled the commitments it had made. 
That government has now moved to the other side of this House, 
and we are delighted about that, but we have inherited 
contractual obligations that we have to fulfil.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, let us be clear. What the minister is speaking about is a 
legal obligation based on something that does not exist. There is 
no possibility for any Canadian, for any court, to look at the 
document or instrument from which arises this supposedly 
existing obligation.
<P>
	The truth is that instead of fulfilling his duties and role as 
guardian of cultural heritage the minister has yielded to pressure 
from an American lobbyist. It does not bode well for the future.
<P>
	How can the minister justify his refusal to cancel this 
agreement given the fact this government and this Prime 
Minister have already cancelled a duly completed contract 
concerning Pearson international airport? Why has his courage 
failed him in this case?
<P>
	<B>Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is 
important to add some clarification to this issue since the Leader 
of the Opposition who we all know has great interest in 
Canadian culture seems to be implying that Canadian interests 
were somehow ignored in this.
<P>
	I want to make it clear as the minister responsible for 
Investment Canada there were a number of implications to this 
complete transaction which should be well understood.
<P>
	What was reviewed by Investment Canada was an indirect 
acquisition of an already foreign owned company, Maxwell 
Macmillan Canada, which was in receivership. Part of that 
transaction when approved by Investment Canada obtained from 
Prentice-Hall certain valuable undertakings with respect to the 
Canadian publishing industry, which I think are a net gain for 
Canada.
<P>
<B>(1425) </B>
<P>
	In the context of those undertakings for example we have 
commitments to ensure a strong development program for new 
and upgraded Canadian material for educational programs. We 
have ensured that primary distributors for imported consumer 
book lines which were valued at approximately $4 million in 
1993 will be Canadian controlled publishers and agents. We 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2040"> 2040 </A></B>
<P>
have ensured support to the Canadian publishing industry 
infrastructure by maintaining an integrated warehousing  
system. There are other undertakings that were obtained in the 
context of this transaction.
<P>
	Simultaneously, as the minister has said, CDIC did dispose of 
its interest in Ginn as part of a verbal commitment made by the 
previous government. That commitment was one which we 
found in our review was not going to be met by any potential 
Canadian purchaser.
<P>
	In the context of obtaining very significant commitments as 
part of the acquisition we feel it was a net benefit to Canada.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Témiscouata):</B> My 
question is addressed to the Minister of Industry.
<P>
	On February 14 Viacom, an American corporation, took 
control of the Paramount group in the United States. This 
transaction will have a major impact on the ownership of the 
Canadian cultural industry since Paramount is a major player in 
that sector in Canada. It controls among others, Prentice-Hall, 
Ginn Publishing, Maxwell Canada and has a major stake in the 
Famous Players cinemas.
<P>
	Since the Viacom-Paramount transaction represents a major 
shift to foreign ownership of the Canadian cultural industry, will 
the minister ask Investment Canada to review this transaction as 
is his prerogative under the Investment Canada Act?
<P>
	<B>Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
again I am delighted the Bloc Quebecois is so interested in 
protecting Canadian cultural sovereignty. That is good news for 
Canada.
<P>
	I might inform the member it is unnecessary for me to give the 
direction she is asking because the transaction as an indirect 
acquisition of these Canadian companies is reviewable by 
Investment Canada as a matter of law.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Témiscouata):</B> This 
government forgets one of our promises. We said that as long as 
we are within Canada we will take care of the interests of Canada 
as well as the interests of Quebec.
<P>
	Will the minister unlike his colleague the Minister of 
Canadian Heritage, make a commitment to this Chamber to 
protect Canadian heritage by restoring Canadian control over 
Ginn Publishing when the Viacom-Paramount transaction is 
reviewed by Investment Canada?
<P>
	<B>Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry):</B> The commitment 
we make is quite clear, Mr. Speaker. We are committed to 
ensuring that any transaction reviewable by Investment Canada 
is of net benefit to Canada.

	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
my question is for the Prime Minister.
<P>
	Dr. Donald Savoie, an economist who has studied the politics 
of public spending in Canada over the past 20 years, has reached 
this conclusion: that major efforts at government cost cutting 
are almost never successful unless they are fully and vigorously 
backed by the leader of that government.
<P>
	In light of that conclusion, would the Prime Minister care to 
retract or to modify his comments made in Alberta last week to 
the effect that there will be no further spending cuts in the next 
three years other than those announced in the 1994 budget?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
said in Edmonton that we want to make some cuts. When 
travelling in Canada today, we find that a lot of people think that 
we have put forward some very deep cuts and we have to handle 
that.
<P>
	At the same time I said that we had a plan. The plan is clear, 
that over the period of three years we want to reduce the deficit 
to 3 per cent of GNP. I said that with the cuts that have been put 
forward in the budget and having 3 per cent growth the first year 
and 3.8 per cent the second year, we will achieve our goal. At the 
same time I have asked the minister of federal-provincial 
relations to look at all other aspects of government on top of that 
to see if we can do better.
<P>
	That is why, for example, yesterday we made an agreement 
with the Auditor General to review the matter of government 
planes in a reasonable way.
<P>
	I want to find as many cuts as possible but at the same time be 
responsible. If you go too deep with cuts, you create 
unemployment and more misery in Canada.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the fact remains that the deficit is in the vicinity of $40 billion to 
$45 billion. The government is carrying half a trillion dollars 
worth of debt. The weakness and the uncertainty in the Prime 
Minister's answer does not inspire confidence, particularly 
among investors and lenders.
<P>
	Will the Prime Minister acknowledge that his failure to speak 
and act vigorously on the deficit and debt problem is now 
contributing to the weakness of the dollar and to the rise in 
interest rates?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
think that we have delivered exactly what we said we would. We 
did what was promised in the red book. We are on track. If 
anybody wants to look at that they will see that we are 
determined to provide a good government. We will achieve our 
goal.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2041"> 2041 </A></B>
<P>
	We know that at the same time there are a lot of people who 
need help from the government. We will not do what has been 
done in Alberta, put people on the unemployment list. It is very 
nice for the premier to cut there, but when he puts someone on 
the unemployment list, he transfers the problem from 
Edmonton to Ottawa. It is just shifting the problem from one 
jurisdiction to another.
<P>
	We are doing what we can, but we cannot achieve our goals 
overnight. If we have 3 per cent of the deficit in relation to the 
GNP in three years, it will be what we said we want to do. It is

<P>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
remind the Prime Minister that the net difference between what 
the federal government has taken from the province of Alberta 
over the last 25 years and what it has spent is in the vicinity of 
$100 billion, so his implications are a little bit off.
<P>
	I have a further supplementary. The government's budget 
projects spending cuts of almost $4 billion by 1996-97 through 
the reform of social programs. Many Canadians do not believe 
the government will follow through on these social spending 
reductions during the same time period that it will be making a 
special effort to sell the benefits of federalism in Quebec.
<P>
	Will the Prime Minister unequivocally tell the House that the 
federal government will follow through on these proposed 
spending reductions no matter what?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister):</B> Mr. Speaker, it 
is very easy for the hon. leader of the Reform Party to realize 
what this government is up to. Look at what we have done so far.
<P>
	Every cut that we put in writing in the red book has been 
made. Everything is in this book. During the campaign I said to 
look at page 111. By the end of the term it will have been 
fulfilled. If you look at the budget presented by the Minister of 
Finance, every one of these commitments have been met, not 
over a period of four years but over a period of four months.

	<B>Mr. Maurice Dumas (Argenteuil-Papineau):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
yesterday, in a surprising declaration, the Minister of Human 
Resources Development clearly stated for the first time his 
desire for an in-depth reform of the old age security system. He 
even had the nerve and arrogance to confront Canadians with an 
odious choice: to either finance the pension system or provide 
training programs for young people.
<P>
	Could the minister, remembering what he and his colleagues 
said when they were in opposition, stop stirring up people's 
emotions by giving Canadians an indecent choice between old 
age security and youth training programs?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Human Resources 
Development and Minister of Western Economic 
Diversification):</B> Mr. Speaker, we in the government are very 
proud of the success achieved by seniors' programs initiated by 
Liberal governments over the last 30 or 40 years but, at the same 
time, we must face the new realities. Next year, the number of 
people eligible for old age security programs will double. As a 
result, we must review the system with Canadians to develop a 
stable and strong program for seniors in the future.
<P>
	As mentioned in the budget speech, a review will be 
undertaken in consultation with all Canadians and with all 
senior citizens to look at ideas, issues and concerns and to 
develop a program for the future. My comments were meant to 
underline the need for serious dialogue.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Maurice Dumas (Argenteuil-Papineau):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
I want to ask a supplementary question. By making alarming 
statements on the old age security system, is the minister 
preparing to hit seniors with a considerable cut in their old age 
security pensions?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Human Resources 
Development and Minister of Western Economic 
Diversification):</B> Mr. Speaker, contrary to what the hon.

honest, full examination of these issues as announced in the 
budget is to ensure that there will be a stable, effective, fair, 
honest system for seniors in the future and to make sure that this 
country can pay for it. That means that we must examine pension 
plans, public service contributions, the entire range.
<P>

	<B>Mr. Jim Silye (Calgary Centre):</B> Mr. Speaker, my question is 
for the Minister of Finance. The minister's budgetary forecasts 
were based on two assumptions, that revenue would increase by 
8 per cent and that interest rates would remain at their current 
low levels for the next three years. Less than three weeks after 
this budget was delivered we are already beginning to see signs 
that these assumptions were overly optimistic.

<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister

-Quebec):</B> Mr. Speaker, the assumptions upon which the 
member based his question are incorrect. We did not assume 
an 8 per cent increase in revenues on a normal basis. As has 
been described there were a number of one shot or unique items 
which in fact depressed this year's revenues which will not be 
present. Our revenues are projected to be approximately 17 per 
cent of GDP which is of course the historical norm in this 
country.
<P>
	As well, the interest rate assumptions in our budget are 
interest rates which at the present time are higher than those in 
existence or those which are projected.
<P>
<B>(1440 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Silye (Calgary Centre):</B> Mr. Speaker, I might have 
to check some of those facts.
<P>
	The minister has seen interest rates in the United States begin 
to climb. In fact he recently mused that interest rates in Canada 
could soon be lower than in the United States. If the minister 
believes that Canadian interest rates can remain stable in the 
face of increasing rates in the United States, would he be so kind 
as to tell us when he thinks the American interest rates will 
actually exceed those of Canada?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional Development

understand the confusion over the numbers. The member 
opposite is not the first person to have that difficulty. It is a 
perfectly understandable problem.
<P>
	In the second question the hon. member is asking me to muse 
again on the issue of interest rates. The Prime Minister pointed 
out to me that it was not really a very good idea for finance 
ministers to muse on interest rates. The only thing I can say to 
him is that I wish he had given me this advice before I did it last

<P>
	The government officially justifies closing the military

However, the total cost of teaching per student is much higher in 
Kingston than in Saint-Jean: over $71,000 in Kingston 
compared to $58,000 in Saint-Jean.
<P>
	Since the minister is so sure that he made the right decision, 
can he tell us precisely how much will be saved by closing the 
military college in Saint-Jean, considering the costs of 
relocation and the need for new facilities in Kingston?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. David Michael Collenette (Minister of National

the member's colleague yesterday that there will be ample 
opportunity to answer all of these questions next Tuesday when I 
appear before the standing committee dealing with the 
estimates. I will have all the information available at that time.
<P>
	Therefore, we do not have to take the time of question period

	<B>Hon. David Michael Collenette (Minister of National

decision that was part of the original proposal for the defence 
cuts. It is one that I opposed, the Prime Minister opposed and 
many people opposed. We would have liked to have done it 
another way rather than close this college. However, from the 
point of view of financial sense in meeting our red book

to concentrate the college in Kingston.

	<B>Mr. Elwin Hermanson (Kindersley-Lloydminster):</B> Mr.

distinguish between pensions and salaries.
<P>

a gold-plated pension plan with no threat of being recalled.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh.
<P>

fired, traded or even sent to the minors. The worst MPs get a 
gold-plated pension plan with no threat of being recalled.
<P>
	When will the government act to let Canadians demote 
ineffective members of their national team through a recall 
mechanism?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
hear what the hon. member is talking about. I would like him to 
explain it to some of his caucus colleagues who are receiving 
pensions from the Alberta government. One of them is sitting 
just behind him, but he is not there at the moment. We would like 
to have examples from themselves too.
<P>
	We said we would look into the pension plan. There will be a 
committee to review it. At the same time I say to everybody that 
members of Parliament today earn $64,000. I can understand the 
member knows that he will not be re-elected so he will never 
have a pension. I understand that. However perhaps those who 
have served in Parliament for a long time, with the type of salary 
they have received and being 51 and going into the market, 
should have a pension.
<P>
	As for the double dipping, we are willing to look into that if 
they get a job in government. If it is a question of having the 
pension too early in life, as it was in the case of one of the 
members of the Bloc Quebecois who quit last year, we will 
review that.
<P>
	At the same time I do not like the tone that leaves the 
impression members of Parliament elected in every riding who 
earn less than a school principal or manager of a hospital are 
overpaid and are not rendering a service to the public of Canada.

<P>
	What I emphasized in the response yesterday and what I wish 
to make clear today is that it is the advice of my own department 
and it is my own view that the present provisions of the Criminal 
Code are quite sufficient to render criminal any assault which 
involves the mutilation of female genitals.

Manitoba College of Physicians and Surgeons aboriginal 
children in Manitoba are four times more likely to die than 
non-aboriginal children, and aboriginal children are 11 times

horrendous social conditions endangering and killing aboriginal 
children?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Ron Irwin (Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern

one of the most serious problems we have in Canada.
<P>
	It is so sad in a nation as rich as ours that we see day in and day 
out a loss of aboriginal children by fire. We see suicides. We saw 
them recently right across the country.
<P>
	I have seen the houses; they are firetraps. I have seen the lack 
of economic opportunity. At the same time I have seen 
successful businesses, aboriginal doctors, aboriginal lawyers, 
aboriginal teachers and great aboriginal leaders. They are 
saying one thing to us, that we should get rid of or dismantle the 
Department of Indian Affairs.
<P>
	As a consequence I have asked aboriginal leaders or chiefs in 
Manitoba to do so in the province of Manitoba. It will be the lead 
province to dismantle Indian Affairs. Hopefully it will be the 
model for the rest of the country.

	I know my hon. friend from Churchill will be in the lead

broken English.

touchtone phones but still have dial phones. We are not all as 
capable or as privileged as the hon. member in having these

not get his touchtone phone.

<P>
	The fact of the matter is that-and this is important-we

service is to provide a major telephone bank that can take in 
surplus calls from across the country, make sure that people can 
be answered in either of Canada's official languages and get 
direct human services, direct responses, which is the reason we 
have established the phone bank.

would the minister not consider, partly for saving bilingual 
bonuses to the tune of $54,000 a year for that centre alone, 
combining the propositions put forward on this side with the 
answers provided on that side to give service to individuals in 
the language of their choice and viva voce as well?

	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Human Resources 
Development and Minister of Western Economic

is a country where, whichever language one speaks, one has full

question is directed to the Minister of Finance. In his budget

unemployment insurance premiums to $3 in January 1995, 
which is next year, will create 40,000 jobs over a period of two 
years.

by reversing the increase in unemployment insurance premiums 
introduced by the government in January?

insurance premiums in January with, as the minister himself

enormous deficit a month and a half or two months after it came 
to power. We admitted it did not make sense, but we were stuck 
with the deficit.
<P>

hon. member's question to be singularly confusing. One day 
members of the Bloc Quebecois tell us to reduce the premiums 
and complain about the measures we take to do it. Now they are 
saying to take them back to the year before which means we have 
to pay for the programs.
<P>
	I want to say to the hon. member we had to introduce the 
increase in order to account for the cost of the programs of the 
previous government. We did not have time in the first six weeks 
of office to make those arrangements. The Minister of Finance 
has now done that in his budget.
<P>
	This move has been broadly supported by all the small 
business organizations across Canada. The Canadian Federation 
of Independent Business has said that this measure will give 
them the mandate to go out and create work.
<P>
	However, we cannot have it retrograde because these 
programs do not come into effect until July 1. Therefore we still 
have to pay for the programs until July 1. At that time we will 
bring in the new measures, acquire the surplus necessary, bring 
down the premiums, create jobs and make the hon. member very

Brunswick?

<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister):</B> I talked with 
Premier McKenna about this and other problems. He knows as 
everyone else knows that we have to have some discipline in the 
expenditures by this government.
<P>
	We have discussed ways and means of ensuring our program 
of job creation moves forward so that people will not have to 
rely on unemployment insurance but will have the dignity of 
having a job.
<P>
	We are collaborating to develop new ways of making sure 
people have jobs rather than having to rely on unemployment 
insurance benefits.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> As hon. colleagues can see we have gone a few 
minutes over the time limit. I would ask all hon. colleagues in 
question periods to follow if perhaps they could make the 
introduction of a question a little shorter and with all respect if 
they could perhaps see that the answers are a little more concise.
<P>
	The reason I am mentioning this is to ensure that both sides 
have a chance to put questions and to have answers to the 
questions. It is a request I hope hon. members will consider and 
keep in mind in future question periods.

Speaker, the hon. Prime Minister in answering a question made 
mention of the fact that a member was not present in the House. I 
wonder if he would retract and apologize for that statement.
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
want to talk of the truth because there is some hypocrisy on the 
other side about this. There are many people who are double 
dipping and getting pensions from the military, or who have 
received bilingual bonuses before, and so on. Now that they are 
in retirement they try to attack other members of Parliament 
who have no other income but from being members of 
Parliament.
<P>
	I am not in the mood to retract anything about the work of 
members of Parliament.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> The practice of this House, of course, is not to 
bring attention to the absence of any member. If the hon. 
member would let me review the statement then we could take 
this up perhaps tomorrow when we return to the House. I thank 
the hon. member for bringing it to my attention.

<P>

<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="FINANCIALSTATEMENTOFMINISTEROFFINANCE">FINANCIAL STATEMENT OF MINISTER OF FINANCE</A></H4>
	The House resumed from March 8 consideration of the motion 
that this House approves in general the budgetary policy of the 
government, and of the amendment.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilbert Fillion (Chicoutimi):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like 
to advise the Chair that members of the Bloc Quebecois who will 
now speak in the debate on the budget will each take ten minutes 
to express their views.
<P>
	I think it is important to compare the government's intentions 
as expressed in the speech from the throne with what the 
government is actually doing in the budget. I would like to quote 
a short passage from the speech from the throne: ``It will be the 
policy of the government to seek to clarify the federal 
government's responsibilities in relation to those of other orders 
of government, to eliminate overlap and duplication, and to find 
better ways to provide services so that they represent the best 
value for taxpayers' dollars and respond to the real needs of the 
people''.
<P>
	Could anyone tell me where in the budget we can find the 
government's response to these good intentions expressed in the 
speech from the throne?
<P>
	Again, the budget brought down by the Liberal government is 
a centralist one, and the burden of reducing the deficit has been 
laid squarely on the shoulders of the taxpayers and the 
provinces.
<P>
	That is not the kind of equity Canadians expected. This is one 
more instance of the government's inertia. Once again, we have 
ample proof that Quebec is stifled by federalism, which tends to 
neutralize any constructive and innovative policy that would be 
useful to Quebec society.
<P>
	The Minister of Finance keeps repeating to anyone who is 
willing to listen that his budget followed an unprecedented 
series of consultations with Canadians, and a costly one at that. 
Yes, he consulted, but he picked and chose his consultants. Did 
he go to the middle class and the neediest in our society to hear 
their views and  concerns? Did he go to the Lac-Saint-Jean area, 
to which the Prime Minister referred as a small community?
<P>
	I represent the riding of Chicoutimi, where unemployment is 
particularly high. The unemployment rate for the metropolitan 
area of Chicoutimi-Jonquière, according to Statistics Canada, 
was 15.7 per cent for January 1994, not seasonally adjusted.
<P>
	The average annual unemployment rate for 1992 was 13.9 per 
cent, while in 1993, the average rate was 16.1 per cent. These 
figures are unacceptable. In January 1994, the 
Chicoutimi-Jonquière metropolitan area had 9,000 
unemployed workers out of a total labour force of 60,000. When 
we speak of 9,000 unemployed persons, we are really talking 
about thousands of other people who are affected, families, 
children and households in dire straits. Furthermore, the rate of 
15.7 per cent does not include those who are no longer looking 
for work, those who have grown discouraged. This figure of 15.7 
per cent does not include seasonal workers either. It is a 
conservative figure which masks a reality that is far bleaker.
<P>
<B>(1520) </B>
<P>
	Did the Minister of Finance consult with the people on the 
streets? This budget contains all kinds of recipes to fight the 
unemployed, instead of unemployment. The maximum period 
during which a person can collect benefits will be reduced. The 
number of weeks of work required to qualify for UI is being 
increased from 10 to 12 weeks. The benefit rate has been 
reduced to 55 per cent, a drop of 3.5 per cent. The overall feeling 
of certain well-known economists is that more than 50 per cent 
of the projected drop in the federal deficit will be borne by 
unemployed Quebecers and Canadians. This is the government's 
recipe for fighting unemployment.
<P>
	People's privacy will not be spared. Various factors, such as 
family status, common law relationships and economic 
circumstances, will be checked. One inquiry after another will 
be made before a person can qualify for the program. Moreover, 
the government has also called for a review of the country's 
social security programs, including unemployment insurance, 
the Canada Assistance Plan, the child tax credit program, 
employment and training programs, established programs 
financing in the education field and social development. What is 
the government planning for the future?
<P>
	After raising some hope among the people by talking about 
job creation, this budget disillusions workers; even worse, it 
attacks the poorest in our society. The Liberals' pseudo-strategy 
for employment is based mainly on consultations, studies and 
committee work.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2049"> 2049 </A></B>
<P>
	There is less and less food in Canadians' refrigerators. Let 
us not wait for the fridge to be empty; otherwise the people will 
rise up and we will have to bear the blame. On October 25, 
1993, Canadians forcefully said that they want change. The 
government side seems to have already forgotten that because 
it is now following in the previous government's footsteps, it 
is repeating the same scenarios.
<P>
	Furthermore, it is the first government since Confederation to 
forecast such a large deficit, $39.7 billion, just under the 
psychological level of $40 billion. No economist and no tax 
expert would have dared to make such a forecast.
<P>
	Surely an infrastructure program where the costs are shared 
with the provinces and the municipalities will not solve all 
problems by itself. Cities and towns will have to go into debt to 
participate in the program.
<P>
	To reduce the deficit to 3 per cent of GDP in 1996-97, it would 
have to be brought down to about $25 billion. The government's 
budgetary objectives are hit or miss. The proposed measures do 
not announce what was promised, namely jobs. The budget 
presented by the Minister of Finance is deficient and 
misleading.
<P>
<B>(1525) </B>
<P>
	In its speech from the throne, the government announced its 
intentions. Today, with its budget, the government is showing its 
colour, the same as the colour of its book. Canada is in the red 
and nothing is being done to fight the underground economy, 
black-market employment.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Bryden (Hamilton-Wentworth):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
would like to thank the hon. member for his remarks which I 
enjoyed very much.
<P>
	I have travelled in the area of Chicoutimi and Jonquière and it 
is a lovely part of the country.
<P>
	I do have one question in the context of his remarks about 
federalism. I want to ask him whether he feels the unemployed 
people of Chicoutimi and Jonquière, of whom he spoke so 
graphically, would be better off, whether they would have better 
job prospects in the reduced economy of a separate Quebec.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Fillion:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for his 
question and I must answer in the affirmative, since a sovereign 
Quebec will eliminate overlapping and duplication, and the 
money saved will be used to create jobs and to invest in our 
province, so that young people can get appropriate training 
based on their needs.
<P>
	Need-related training means training which will lead to 
secure and well-paid jobs. The savings made by eliminating this 
overlapping alone would be enough to revitalize the economy of 
the region.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ian McClelland (Edmonton Southwest):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
would like to address a question to the hon. member, one which 
has been perplexing me for some time.
<P>
	In many parts of Canada it is perceived that Quebec has been a 
net beneficiary in terms of transfer payments from the federal 
treasury.
<P>
	In the hon. member's opinion, if these transfers of moneys 
were to be suspended in an independent Quebec would the offset 
in duplication be more or less than the transfer payments being 
sent to the province at this time?
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Fillion:</B> Mr. Speaker, I will answer by saying that right 
now Quebec does not receive the same percentage of taxes that it 
pays to the federal government. Indeed, we account for 25 per 
cent of the Canadian population, but barely 21 per cent of the 
taxes we pay is returned to us. Right there you have an injustice 
which would be eliminated with a sovereign Quebec.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Maurice Godin (Châteauguay):</B> Mr. Speaker, this 
budget is the failure of a newly-elected government, a 
government with a list of promises as long as your arm.
<P>
	Sadly, we are faced with a double failure. First, this 
government has failed to start off its mandate by taking the 
drastic actions required to put our public finances in order. 
Second, it also failed to find ways to promote economic 
recovery. It has managed to take yet more from the have-nots of 
our society, while sparing the wealthy. It has even managed to 
cause controversy with unfortunate decisions like the closure of 
the Collège militaire royal de Saint-Jean.
<P>
	However much the Minister of Finance tried to prove, with all 
kinds of figures and calculations, that efforts had been made to 
cut expenditures, few people believed him-not the media, and 
certainly not ordinary people-because the figures are there, 
implacable and merciless.
<P>
<B>(1530) </B>
<P>
	Those figures tell us that the budget will again show a deficit 
of disposable revenue over uncontrolled expenditures. This 
government will keep feeding an accumulated deficit by nearly 
$40 billion, an amount that the government is spending on top of 
what the people are able to pay. So, it should not boast about cuts 
and efforts to that effect. Its failure is visible, undeniable, 
because total spending continues to increase.
<P>
	The level of indebtedness of this country is getting ridiculous. 
While this government will be adding some $40 billion to the 
accumulated debt, it will spend about as much just to service the 
debt. In other words, we are getting dangerously close to the 
point where our annual deficit will be equal to the cost of 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2050"> 2050 </A></B>
<P>
servicing the public debt. Will we soon be forced to cut 
government spending just to cover debt charges? The Minister 
of Finance himself admitted that he will not be able to pay off  
Canada's public debt. What about the annual deficit? Could he 
pay it off? Not likely! If only the government could invest as 
much in job creation as it is paying just for debt maintenance.
<P>
	Furthermore, the government could not resist picking up the 
bad habit of hitting on low-income people. We thought we had 
seen everything with the actions the former minister responsible 
for the Unemployment Insurance Program had recently 
announced. He had even tried to fool people by renaming his 
department, using the euphemism of Human Resources 
Development. Can you imagine? But people were not fooled; we 
know what they did with this kind of human resources 
development. In the last election, the Canadian people as a 
whole fired all those who did not understand the difference 
between tackling unemployment and attacking the unemployed.
<P>
	The new government, far from distinguishing itself from the 
old Tory government, followed in their footsteps. Ordinary 
people have trouble understanding how the proposed changes to 
the unemployment insurance program are likely to improve the 
employment picture. I, too, have trouble understanding the 
increase in the number of weeks of work needed to qualify, when 
jobs are increasingly precarious and job security seems to have 
become an obsolete concept.
<P>
	The cumulative deficit of some $6 billion in the 
unemployment insurance account at the end of 1993 is not a 
result of the system as such but of the failure of governments to 
support employment and the economy. It is not the 
unemployment insurance program that creates unemployment. 
The Liberals are confusing the disease with the cure. This 
remedy is not curative but palliative. The Liberals are on the 
same wrong path as the Conservatives; they have the same 
policies, the same lobbyists, the same kind of election fund, the 
same friends, the same protectors.
<P>
	Observers quickly noted how fast the government acted to 
introduce in its current budget measures hitting the middle 
class. Yet, despite all the proposed measures regarding capital 
gains and tax loopholes, the Minister of Finance merely 
announced public consultations and hearings. Not only is there 
no equity in this budget but there is no appearance of equity.
<P>
	While cutting transfer payments to the provinces by $2 billion 
over two years, it does not have the courage to close the real tax 
loopholes available to the rich. We in the Bloc Quebecois are 
always identifying tax trusts or invoking the Auditor General's 
recommendations, for example. If cuts to operating 
expenditures for 1994-95 only amount to $413 million, it is 
because the government did not take immediate action to 
eliminate waste and duplication.
<P>
	It refuses to cut in the right places but does it in the wrong 
places. In his speech, the Minister of Finance called for renewal 
and accountability in social programs. To move in that direction, 
the government could have restored the non-profit housing 
program, for instance. That program provided needy households 
with housing of reasonable size and quality at affordable prices. 
It helped eligible sponsoring organizations to build, acquire, 
renovate and run subsidized rental housing projects. But the 
government did not restore the program, and thus missed a good 
opportunity to show its know-how.
<P>
<B>(1535) </B>
<P>
	Short of a similar program, it seems that the Canada Mortgage 
and Housing Corporation, which was responsible for such 
applications under the National Housing Act, is now essentially 
a mortgage insurer and has given up its role of partner in social 
programs.
<P>
	The office of the president and chief executive officer of the 
Société d'habitation du Québec told us that, in 1993, 782 new 
low-cost housing units had been built across the province, 
thanks to the financial involvement of the federal government. 
Thirty-five of these units are located at 41 Saint-Hubert Street, 
in Châteauguay, thanks to the initiative and efforts of all those 
involved within the community. Do you know how many new 
units are expected to be added in 1994, after this budget? None, 
Mr. Speaker. None at all! Maybe this is the government's 
message! Maybe this is the solution found by the government to 
free itself from its obligations towards the poor.
<P>
	I say to the government that better management is not 
synonymous with reneging on commitments. The necessary 
streamlining of expenditures and operations did not take place. 
It is more than urgent that the government use common sense. 
The Liberals had their red book, but their budget does not show 
that they have the know-how. This is why the Bloc Quebecois 
has every reason to be here in this House. It must make 
representations on behalf of all those who are forgotten and 
neglected by the government, and it must inform this same 
government of the opportunities which exist but that it refuses to 
recognize.
<P>
	As the Official Opposition critic for Veterans Affairs, I was 
surprised to read that the secretary of state was satisfied because 
no programs were affected by any cuts, and that he was 
confident that no service would be adversely affected. These 
comments were reported in the February 24, 1994, issue of the 
<I>Charlottetown Guardian</I>. How can the minister make such 
claims when cuts affecting the department are somewhere 
around $3.2 million? How can these cuts, which will impact on 
the 1994-95 department's operating expenditures, have no 
effect whatsoever? Is the department so badly managed that cuts 
of that magnitude will not be felt at all? I certainly intend to 
ensure that the statement made by the secretary of state is not 
merely exaggerated optimism.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2051"> 2051 </A></B>
<P>
	This budget clearly illustrates the failure of the Canadian 
federal regime. The wheel of the regime is turning with such 
inertia and is under the influence of such external force that 
it does not seem controllable. The result is that the Liberals 
have drafted a budget identical to the one which the 
Conservatives might have tabled, had they been re-elected. It 
is the exact same thing! If the elected government does not 
seem able to control the federal regime, how can Canadians 
have the impression that they can make a difference and change 
things in that regime?
<P>
	We believe that the real solution lies in a major redefinition of 
the controls of public authority. Quebec's sovereignty is not an 
end in itself. It does not automatically mean the end of Canada 
or the will to come to that. Rather, Quebec's sovereignty 
represents the beginning of a new relationship in which 
solutions simply not possible in the present constitutional 
structure could be used to resolve common problems. Canada's 
structural crisis can only be solved if Quebec becomes a 
sovereign nation. This is the option I favour for the benefit of 
our future generations.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Nic Leblanc (Longueuil):</B> Mr. Speaker, I want to thank 
the hon. member for Châteauguay for his excellent speech and 
for his great interest in Quebecers. When he speaks of Quebec 
sovereignty, he speaks of the greater welfare of Quebec, and 
indeed of the greater welfare of the rest of Canada.
<P>
	In his budget speech, the Minister of Finance spoke of 
one-stop shopping for government services. I assume he meant 
federal government services. He forgets that for years now, 
Quebec has been demanding to have similar service centres 
which would also provide Quebec government services.
<P>
<B>(1540) </B>
<P>
	I am interested in what the hon. member for Châteauguay has 
to say about the fact that once again, the Minister of Finance has 
forgotten that this kind of duplication is extremely costly. 
According to the Bélanger-Campeau Commission, duplication 
between Quebec and Ottawa costs between $2 and $3 billion per 
year. If the Minister of Finance had seriously wanted to cut 
spending, he should have realized that it is not a government 
services centre that is required, but a kind of one-stop centre 
that would also include services offered by the government of 
Quebec. I would like to get the hon. member's comments on this 
issue. I feel certain that he has some excellent suggestions to 
make.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Godin:</B> Mr. Speaker, I agree with my hon. colleague from 
Longueuil. As far as I am concerned, a country's revenues and 
production capability are not merely a function of its size or the 
extent of its borders, but rather a function of the way in which 
that country is run.
<P>
	I think that is the problem with Canada today. We have a 
government machine that could in all likelihood adequately 
serve 260 million people, the population of the United States, 
whereas we have a population of barely 26 or 27 million. And 
that is the crux of the problem. There is considerable duplication 
at the federal, provincial and municipal levels. If we cannot 
change or amend this system, then the only option for Quebec, 
the only way for it to achieve a healthy system of government, is 
to become sovereign.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Hon. members, I made a mistake. As a 
rule, after a speech, the Chair must recognize a member from 
another party first.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	I should have recognized first the member for Edmonton 
Southwest. Please be brief, the time is just about up.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ian McClelland (Edmonton Southwest):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
have a great respect for the hon. member for Chateauguay but I 
wish to draw a contradiction that I see in his presentation to the 
attention of the House and perhaps get his response.
<P>
	His first words were that the closing of the military college at 
Saint-Jean is a desperate problem for the province of Quebec. 
Would the member not agree that if Quebec were to separate and 
be an independent country, Canada would no longer have any 
facilities in Quebec? Does not the closing of that one military 
college, which he takes great umbrage at, foreshadow the 
closing of many more federal installations in Quebec to the 
tremendous detriment of Quebec and Canada?
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Godin:</B> Mr. Speaker, I wish to thank my hon. colleague 
for his question. No, I do not believe that additional closures of 
federal installations in Quebec would be detrimental to Quebec. 
One has to understand that any federal investment in Quebec is 
tied to taxation. Whether we take our tax dollars and send them 
to Ottawa only to have them reinvested in the province, or 
whether we spend them ourselves, it is really all one and the 
same thing.
<P>
	However, I would point out to him that there is quite a 
difference between receiving one million for research and 
development, and receiving one million for unemployment 
insurance. If we were the masters of our own destiny, we could 
take the one million and invest it in research and development, 
rather than spend it on unemployment insurance. Then, we 
would be able to put everyone to work.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The Chair is reminded that the time has 
expired. Next time I will be sure to recognize someone from 
another party.

<P>
<B>(1545 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Hon. Brian Tobin (Minister of Fisheries and Oceans):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am pleased to rise in my place and participate in this 
debate. May I at the earliest opportunity on my feet with you in 
the chair express my congratulations to you on taking up these 
most important responsibilities.
<P>
	In beginning my remarks I cannot help but say to my 
colleague opposite who in giving his remarks on this budget 
debate said ``if we were masters of our own destinies'' that we 
are as Canadians in a free and democratic society masters of our 
own destiny. Quebecers are masters of their own destiny. Every 
time Quebecers have been asked to chart a course, to fasten a sail 
and to be captains of their own ship they have decided that their 
fate and their course lies in parallel with Canada, not as a 
separate entity and not as a separate ship.
<P>
	I am confident that Quebecers, if they are again given the 
opportunity to cast a judgment, will again choose to contribute 
to this great experiment on the northern half of the North 
American continent called Canada.
<P>
	Canadians on October 25 gave a very clear mandate to a new 
government to attempt to come to grips with age old problems. I 
submit that never in modern times has a party laid so clearly 
before the people of Canada, fully a month in advance of an 
election, a detailed blueprint for the government's policy and 
plan of action. I am referring now to the Liberal red book.
<P>
	Each of the major initiatives outlined in the red book were 
outlined weeks in advance of the election, something which 
heretofore has been considered to be a politically silly thing to 
do; to actually tell the people in detail, not days, not hours, not 
weeks but a month before an election, to lay it out and say: 
``Here is what we will do if charged with the responsibility to 
govern''. That is something we did.
<P>
	I am proud to say that I belong to a party that not only laid out 
its program but has scrupulously, item by item by item, sought 
to fulfil the contract, which is what it is, that we made with the 
people of Canada when they signed on the bottom line, marked 
their <I>x</I> and gave Liberal members of Parliament a majority and 
the opportunity and responsibility to govern.
<P>
	In Atlantic Canada Canadians by an overwhelming majority 
expressed confidence in the platform of the Liberal Party. 
Atlantic Canadians did not express that confidence because they 
had some kind of simple belief that just by voting Liberal all of 
the social challenges that confront us would suddenly disappear 
or held some simple belief that just by voting for change that 
unemployment would disappear. No.
<P>
	The people of Atlantic Canada marked an <I>x</I> for a party and for 
a program fully aware that the structural problems of Atlantic 
Canada could not be dismissed with the introduction of one 
budget, could not be eliminated just by an expression of good 
will of a new government,  but that our chronic levels of 
unemployment and our structural problems required real 
change, not slogans but substantive change.
<P>
	One of the areas we committed ourselves to change and one of 
the areas where Atlantic Canadians lock arms with us in 
marching forward to accomplish that change is in the area of the 
fishery.
<P>
	We said that we would make two substantive changes in 
fisheries policy, two sea changes in fisheries policy. On the one 
hand we said we would not walk away and turn our backs on 
those in crisis, those dislocated and those out of a job because of 
the closure of fisheries and because of the moratorium on 
Atlantic groundfish stocks. There are now a total of 14 
moratoriums in place. There are 14 groundfish stocks in which 
there is no fishery for the first time in 500 years.
<P>
<B>(1550 ) </B>
<P>
	We now have a situation for those people who live in rural 
Newfoundland on the tip of the great northern peninsula in a 
small rural isolated community where the average income is 
among the lowest in the country and where the capacity to take 
some wild game or jig a few cod is an important component of 
the food basket where I, as Minister of Fisheries and as a native 
Newfoundlander, have had to take away the right even to jig with 
a hook and line, the most basic biblical kind of tool, to go out 
and draw a few fish from the sea. I have had to take away that 
right in the name of conservation.
<P>
	Incredibly, for the first time in 500 years that right was 
removed. There is not a protest. There is not a revolution. There 
certainly is not a celebration. However, there is acceptance. 
There is a bearing down, a gritting of teeth, a desire to pay the 
price that is required to rebuild those cod stocks even if that 
price is to take the fish and the protein out of the sea, right out of 
the cupboards, the freezers and off the tables of the very people 
who have relied on it for 500 years.
<P>
	We said to the people of Atlantic Canada and to the people of 
my province of Newfoundland and Labrador that we will take 
the tough decisions. We have begun the process of taking them. 
We put in place in the budget $1.9 billion to ensure that people 
can retrain where appropriate, that people can be sustained in 
the core fishery where appropriate as the rebuilding process 
goes on.
<P>
	We have publicly identified the need to reduce capacity on the 
harvesting and processing side of the fishery by as much as 50 
per cent. Imagine, standing up in a public place, in a land where 
people for generations have eked out a living on the edge of the 
north Atlantic, drawing the resource from the sea, and publicly 
saying: ``Half of you cannot be sustained. Half of you cannot 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2053"> 2053 </A></B>
<P>
carry on. Half of you must move on to other industries and other 
jobs''.
<P>
	If a decade ago someone had even whispered that thought 
there would have been riots. A decade ago if someone had stood 
in a public place and suggested that people would be separated 
from not just the means of making a living but the way of life 
that generations of forefathers had carved out, he would have 
been run out of town. However, today there is a steely 
determination to bear whatever cost has to be borne, to bear 
whatever pain has to be experienced, to rebuild these cod stocks.
<P>
	I want to take this opportunity to say that all of those who sit 
in steel and glass and ivory towers, in the editorial boards of the 
nation from their vantage point 25 or 30 floors above the 
concrete below, to those who say that Atlantic Canada is 
finished, that the back of the economy has been broken, that the 
spirit of the people has been crushed or broken, those who say 
the solution is simple resettlement, should be moved to Toronto, 
Montreal or Calgary or Vancouver or to somewhere else where 
there is a job. I want to say to those who in their own mind when 
faced with such a challenge as that being faced by the people of 
Atlantic Canada who would fall down and give up that that is not 
the mood, that is not the spirit, that is not the disposition and that 
is not the character of Atlantic Canada.
<P>
	The people of Atlantic Canada and of Newfoundland and 
Labrador do not feel desperation or hopelessness but are 
reaching down and uncovering a wellspring of courage and 
conviction to carry on. We are going to rebuild the industry. We 
are going to restore a new conservation ethic. We are going to 
stand up and ensure that the last fish out there is maintained to 
rebuild that important historical sector.
<P>
	We will pay any price in the name of conservation. We will 
impose 14 groundfish moratoriums. We will impose a 
moratorium on the food fishery. We will take 35,000 people and 
have them park their boats and close their plants.
<P>
<B>(1555 ) </B>
<P>
	We as a nation will pay the price to maintain, sustain and 
retrain them. We will demand no less of foreign nations that fish 
on the nose and tail of the Grand Banks. We will demand no less. 
We say to France, Portugal, Spain, Japan and Russia, with our 
palms outstretched in the realm of generosity, with our hands 
stretched out seeking understanding, that we can do no more 
than we have already done in the name of conservation and that 
they can do no less than to join us in respecting these important 
cod moratoriums.
<P>
	We have said that we will not catch a pound of fish this year on 
the nose and tail of the Grand Banks, the breeding grounds of 
what once was the world's greatest protein resource. Not a 
pound. At a time when we have an agreement in Brussels 
through NAFO, when Canadians have agreed not to fish and 
when our NAFO partners have agreed not to fish, we will not 
allow pirate vessels flying flags of convenience to come in and 
make a mockery out of the sacrifice that Canadians and indeed  
others around the world are prepared to undertake this year to 
rebuild those cod stocks.
<P>
	Monday next I will be in New York. On behalf of Canada I will 
speak to the UN conference on high seas fishing. I will make it 
clear that we want to resolve this matter by agreement. I will 
equally make it clear that we will resolve it by unilateral action 
if necessary.
<P>
	Two years ago when the government of the day came before 
Parliament seeking authority for an assistance program for 
Atlantic fishermen, the then minister stood in his place and 
pointed out that a northern cod stock had collapsed.
<P>
	The minister said against a backdrop of a $30 billion national 
deficit that he needed assistance for 17,000 displaced people. He 
said that assistance would be required for two years. I am back 
two years later. The deficit is not $30 billion, it is $46 billion. 
The number of people requiring assistance is not 17,000, it is 
now 35,000. The timeframe is not two years, it is now five years. 
The scope of the crisis has broadened dramatically.
<P>
	As I said, we want to do all we can to rebuild the fishery by 
restructuring at home, by enforcing reasonable conservation 
measures inside and outside the 200-mile limit. We also know 
that we must rebuild the economy. We have to diversity the 
economy of Atlantic Canada.
<P>
	Let me speak of my own province, Newfoundland and 
Labrador. I know it is not enough to ask my fellow Canadians to 
stand with us, to stay with us during this downturn in the fishery. 
I know we have to demonstrate that Newfoundlanders and 
Labradorians are prepared to go out and to compete, to develop 
their skills and to win in a global economy.
<P>
	That is also a direction we are moving in. I want to share with 
some of my colleagues elsewhere in the country what is 
happening in Newfoundland, where the new opportunities lie 
and where the new leadership is coming from.
<P>
	I submit to members that one of the areas in which we can be 
competitive, where 90 miles of water is not a disadvantage, is in 
the area of the new information and knowledge based industries, 
in high tech, in research and development. That is where the 
future lies and that is where the future is being carved out.
<P>
	In the province today we are seeing the development of new 
companies in the engineering services field. Last year, RDS 
Engineering of Newfoundland won out over national and 
international competition for a $6 million contract on Hibernia. 
A new company, Instrumar, has developed a clean wind 
detection system now being used all across the country, 
technology to develop the presence and thickness of ice, snow 
and other substances on aircraft wings. This company recently 
formed a 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2054"> 2054 </A></B>
<P>
strategic alliance with Allied Aerospace Canada to 
commercialize both nationally and internationally this new 
system.
<P>
<B>(1600 ) </B>
<P>
	Ultima East Data Communications Ltd. has developed a range 
of hardware and software products for communications 
applications, including access to current satellite technology. 
Together with a sister company, Sea Link Ltd., Ultima East has 
been marketing automatic high frequency radio systems 
world-wide. Eighty per cent of the product of this company is 
being marketed not in Canada but internationally and the vast 
majority of its export product is going into Asia. All of the 
software development has occurred in Newfoundland and 
Labrador. That is the kind of future we have to carve out for 
ourselves.
<P>
	Compusult Limited, a St. John's company, recently 
completed a $1 million contract to develop a system for 
Environment Canada to receive and to store ice data. It is now in 
the process of commercializing that technology. EJE 
Trans-Lite, a Newfoundland company, was established in 1988 
to design and market specialized safety lighting products for the 
marine and aviation industries. One of its products, a personal 
rescue light, has sold already in a short period of time more than 
200,000 units and over 80 per cent of that product is being 
exported around the world.
<P>
	Another company, Nautical Data International, recently 
formed a joint venture between two high technology companies, 
one based in Newfoundland and the other in Vancouver. Both 
these companies have put their resources together and are 
digitalizing the data from the department of hydrography in my 
department. It is a unique development. We have privatized the 
information available. We have digitalized that information and 
both the Vancouver and Newfoundland based firms working in 
tandem are marketing that product around the world and around 
North America. It is another new high tech development.
<P>
	I mention these companies because I am not naive. I have 
been here 14 years. I understand that for many Canadians who 
have not had the opportunity to visit Newfoundland and 
Labrador and certain parts of Atlantic Canada, there is a 
perception that the economy is built entirely on the fishery, as 
some Canadians falsely perceive that the economy of Alberta is 
entirely built on red beef. Of course nothing could be further 
from the truth.
<P>
	It is a modern, thriving economy showing great leadership in 
the high tech field, the petrochemical field, the engineering 
field, and so on. A new economy is evolving in Newfoundland. 
Some of it is spinning out from around the offshore oil and gas 
sector.
<P>
	We understand on this side of the House that we have to create 
the environment to allow that new technology, that new 
leadership, that spirit of entrepreneurship to flourish. We have 
to give people the circumstances and the conditions under which 
they can, as a people and as a province dependent too long upon 
a single resource, sprout their entrepreneurial wings and fly, 
successfully  compete in a global economy. That initiative is 
under way today in Newfoundland and Labrador.
<P>
	In the meantime we must never forget, Atlantic Canada must 
never forget, that Newfoundland and Labrador has a historical 
attachment to the ocean, a historical attachment to the sea and to 
the resources of the sea.
<P>
	We must begin to understand that the desecration, the 
destruction of cod resources, northern cod all throughout the 
Atlantic, the destruction of offshore resources is the 
environmental equivalent of the destruction of the rain forest. 
When we take away that resource we take away not an 
opportunity for an income or a livelihood from people in the 
particular region but a resource that is part of the world's food 
basket, a rich source of protein for the planet.
<P>
	We have to begin to understand that the crisis on the east coast 
is not a Newfoundland crisis. It is not an Atlantic crisis. It is not 
a regional issue. It is a question of sovereignty for a nation.
<P>
	If we as a country cannot commit ourselves to rebuilding the 
great Atlantic resource, if we are not prepared to commit 
ourselves to take action to rebuild that resource, to flex our will, 
not only at home but beyond 200 miles, then we have to call into 
question how mature this nation is and how willing and how 
ready we are to stand up and call ourselves a mature and modern 
nation in 1994.
<P>
<B>(1605 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley East):</B> Mr. Speaker, I wish 
to thank the minister for his speech which was very emphatic 
and informative.
<P>
	I did notice a couple of things as you were progressing 
through your list of accomplishments in the ongoing change in 
Newfoundland. You specified how the economy is diversifying, 
the number of jobs being created, and so on.
<P>
	Almost conspicuous by absence is the fact that the 
infrastructure programs that past governments have initiated, if 
I can call them that, the Hibernia project, and so on, are not 
playing a huge part in the rebuilding of Newfoundland.
<P>
	It seems to me there is a lesson to be learned there, possibly 
that the businesses mentioned are small and medium sized 
businesses using the high tech future to grab hold of things and 
sprout wings, as the hon. minister mentioned, to grab hold of the 
new possibilities.
<P>
	Hibernia is not really playing the big part that people hoped. I 
wonder if the minister would comment on future job creation 
projects. I realize the minister is supportive of his own 
infrastructure programs but it seems that billions of dollars have 
been 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2055"> 2055 </A></B>
<P>
wasted in large part on Hibernia. There is going to be another 
billion dollars thrown at the P.E.I. bridge.
<P>
	Would the minister comment on whether that is the best use of 
taxpayers' money. Would it be better to lower taxes, thereby 
helping these small and medium sized businesses?
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Before recognizing the minister, I 
wonder if members could say ``the minister'' or the ``member'' 
rather than ``you''.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Tobin:</B> Mr. Speaker, I did not talk about the Hibernia 
project because I wanted to focus on what I think is an exciting 
new dimension. There are a bunch of young men and women, 
some in their twenties and thirties who are developing software, 
not importing technology or software, adding some value and 
sending it off. The resource is their own imagination.
<P>
	Limitations are those they impose on themselves. They are 
taking tools of modern technology and using those tools to 
create new knowledge based industries and exporting them 
around the world.
<P>
	I find it fascinating this kind of activity happens on an island 
province where traditionally we do not expect that kind of 
development.
<P>
	I want to acknowledge that today. This kind of development is 
every bit as exciting when one young firm with a handful of 
young engineers and a couple of people prepared to write and 
develop new software develops a brand new industry based on 
knowledge and the extent of its own imagination.
<P>
	I find it every bit as awesome to contemplate as Hibernia, 
which is in itself an incredible feat of engineering. It has 
contributed significantly to the economy of the province of 
Alberta.
<P>
	I do not want to belittle Hibernia. It is an important project. 
Another government in another day committed the funds to that 
project. It can lead to a series of new offshore developments. Mr. 
Speaker, knowing your former interest and expertise in matters 
having to do with energy development in Canada, I do not want 
to diminish from the project at all.
<P>
	I simply want to take this opportunity to acknowledge what is 
being done by young incubator companies. They are not waiting 
for your permission or mine or even our acknowledgement. 
They are out there competing and winning in the world market. I 
think that is exciting and ought to be acknowledged and 
encouraged.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Nic Leblanc (Longueuil):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am always 
impressed by the eloquence and verve of the Minister of 
Fisheries and Oceans and of people from Newfoundland 
generally.
<P>
	The minister referred to the Liberal Party's red book, and I 
must say there have been an impressive number of references to 
this document.
<P>
<B>(1610) </B>
<P>
	I wish he would use the same eloquence and the same verve to 
explain why, in the red book, he did not tell Canadians that 
unemployment insurance premiums would be taxed by more 
than $800 million. Why did he not say that companies would be 
paying $1.7 billion in taxes over the next few years? Why did he 
not say that individuals would be paying $1.8 billion in taxes 
over the next three years? Why did the red book not say there 
would be a deficit of $40 billion for the current year? And that in 
1996, the cumulative debt would be nearly $600 billion? Why 
did he not say this?
<P>
	I wish the minister would use the same eloquence and the 
same verve to explain that to Canadians. Why were Canadians 
totally misled by what was said in the red book, if we look at 
what the government is doing now?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Tobin:</B> Mr. Speaker, we have a saying in Newfoundland. 
When someone is awfully bold we say they have more nerve 
than a toothache and a vicious one at that.
<P>
	Here is the member asking me why we did not tell Canadians 
about the fiscal situation of Canada. The hon. member's leader 
made a notable contribution to the leaders' debate during the 
last election and the leader of the Reform Party will remember 
this. He kept asking the then Prime Minister what the deficit was 
and what the deficit would be. Up to that point we were all told 
the deficit this year would be about $33 billion. It turned out 
after we came to office that the deficit was $46 billion, $13 
billion higher than the government had admitted.
<P>
	Having the member ask me why we did not know this is 
amusing, given that the member who just asked the question 
spent his first four or five years in this place sitting on the 
government benches, the Tory party benches.
<P>
	Why the member would now ask me what he was doing 
jumping up and down voting yes every time the government he 
supported proposed a motion, I do not know. I do not know what 
he was doing and I do not know what questions he asked in his 
caucus.
<P>
	What I do know is that he was a loyal follower, notable for his 
capacity to get up and bow yes whenever Mr. Mulroney asked 
his permission to spend more money. It takes a special kind of 
nerve, like an open, raw wound, for this member to stand here 
now and complain. This member ought to be put on the bow of a 
boat out at 200 miles because he bellows so loud and makes so 
little sense that he would scare away all foreign fishing vessels.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jack Ramsay (Crowfoot):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have a similar 
question. I have asked this question to two of the member's 
colleagues in the past and did not get an answer. I have often 
watched the hon. minister on  television during the last four or 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2056"> 2056 </A></B>
<P>
five years and I am always impressed by his intelligence and his 
wit. Therefore, I would like him to concentrate that wit on this 
question and I hope to get an answer.
<P>
	How will the addition of $100 billion to the federal debt over 
the next three years affect the plan to rebuild the fishing industry 
on the east coast as well as a new tech industry that he speaks 
about emerging now in that area?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Tobin:</B> Mr. Speaker, the member wants an answer and I 
am going to give him one.
<P>
	What the member is suggesting, to reverse the situation, is 
that rather than add $100 billion to the debt, he is now referring 
to approximately $30 billion of deficit on average over the three 
years, a little more for $100 billion after three years. The 
member is really suggesting that we should cut out an additional 
$100 billion of expenditure. Is that not true? I see everybody but 
the leader of the Reform Party nodding yes. He is a bit more 
cautious.
<P>
	By cutting out $100 billion we would start, according to the 
hon. member-
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ramsay:</B> Answer the question.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Tobin:</B> I am answering the question. The member does 
not like the answer. We start by cutting the $2 billion for 
fishermen and plant workers. That is what the member wants. 
Then we would cut all unemployment insurance payments in 
total so there would be no more unemployment insurance plan. 
Then we would begin to cut medicare and do away with 
medicare as a universally accessible plan and ensure that people 
would pay their own way. The member is nodding his head yes. 
When done with that we would then cut out all regional 
development funding so that those who lived in areas of highest 
unemployment would be left to their own resources. At the end 
of the day we would simply take the keys to Parliament and the 
notion of parliamentary responsible government and we would 
turn them over to Walmart.
<P>
<B>(1615) </B>
<P>
	The Parliament of Canada is not McDonald's. It is not 
Walmart. It is up to government to use the tools and the 
resources of the nation to give direction and shape to the 
country. We do not give shape to the country by abandoning 
public policy to public accountants. We will not do it.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
rise to address the budgetary policy of the government as 
presented by the Minister of Finance on February 22. My 
principal reason for rising is to register a profound sense of 
disappointment and apprehension concerning the fiscal and the 
human aspects of the 1994 budget.
<P>
	The blunt truth concerning the fiscal aspect of the budget is 
that it does not bring federal overspending, the federal deficit or 
the federal debt under control. Nor does it lay the foundations 
for doing so in the future. Projected spending for 1994-95 is 
$164 billion or $3 billion more than was spent in 1993-94. The 
federal deficit for 1994-95 is $40 billion or 5.4 per cent of GDP. 
The government spending plans add another $100 billion to the 
federal debt over the next three years, a debt which already 
stands at $511 billion.
<P>
	After all is said and done, the only improvements in the 
government's financial position are mere projected 
improvements for future years, projections which are no more 
believable than those of the previous government.
<P>
	It is the implications of the budget for Canadians in human 
terms which turn my disappointment into apprehension and 
even alarm. Because the budget fails to come to grips with 
overspending it offers no hope whatsoever to millions of 
hard-pressed taxpayers for tax relief. In fact it assures them of 
nothing but future tax increases.
<P>
	Because the budget adds another $100 billion to the federal 
debt over three years it diverts another $3 billion to $6 billion of 
revenue per year into interest payments on that debt. Federal 
financial support for health care, education and pensions will 
thus continue to deteriorate. This is bad news for the recipients 
of those services.
<P>
	Because the budget fails to come to grips with the deficit and 
the excessive taxation of Canadians, it sends a strong negative 
signal to private sector job creators. The net effect of the budget 
is to discourage private sector job creation. This is bad news for 
the 2.5 million unemployed and underemployed in the country.
<P>
	In summary, the federal budget stripped of its rhetoric and 
politically inspired optimism is a failure of the first order, a 
failure whose heaviest impact will fall on taxpayers, recipients 
of social services, the unemployed and the underemployed.
<P>
	Based on this assessment it is appropriate for us as members 
of Parliament to consider the following question. If the 
Government of Canada were a great publicly held company with 
27 million shareholders and we were its directors; if we had just 
received a financial statement showing our 21st annual loss in a 
row, this time for $40 billion; if our balance sheet showed we 
were carrying half a trillion dollars worth of debt; and if this 
Chamber were the great board room of that company and we met 
here today, many of us as new directors, with a legal 
responsibility to our shareholders to face up to fiscal realities, I 
ask how would we likely respond.
<P>
	We know that some members would choose simply to deny the 
reality. They would say a $40 billion deficit is not that bad; we 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2057"> 2057 </A></B>
<P>
can always borrow more; the lenders will never cut us off; it 
might happen to New Zealand but it will not happen to us. Others 
might try to escape the fiscal reality by flights of fancy. They 
would say: ``Let us focus on next year; next year things will be 
better''.  Still others would be looking for someone to blame and 
be saying: ``It is not our fault; it was the previous director's 
fault''. Yet again some of us might simply look for an exit 
strategy: ``Let's make sure we don't get hurt. Let's make sure 
our golden parachutes are in order. Let's take some subsidiary of 
the mother corporation, separate it out and go off on our own''.
<P>
<B>(1620 ) </B>
<P>
	There is another response that is possible under these 
circumstances. That response is to face up to the fiscal reality 
that the budget downplays and to develop a contingency plan for 
the day when its shortcomings become evident to all. Instead of 
going into denial or flights of fancy or blaming someone for 
trying to get out, we should say one to another: ``Let us develop 
a contingency plan that really comes to grips with the 
overspending, the deficit and the debt, a contingency plan that 
protects the taxpayer, the workers, the unemployed and the users 
of social services from the injuries the budget will ultimately 
cause. Let me briefly outline the key elements of a contingency 
plan for Canadians to cope with the failures of the 1994-1995 
budget''.
<P>
	First is a contingency plan for real deficit reduction. The 
budget presented by the minister last month proposes spending 
cuts for 1994-95 amounting to only $2.2 billion or about 1.3 per 
cent of total spending, achieved mainly by cuts to defence 
spending and unemployment insurance. Those of us who believe 
federal spending must be reduced more quickly and in greater 
amounts must complete a more detailed and extensive list of 
spending cuts and keep it current as a contingency plan for real 
deficit reduction.
<P>
	The Reform Party has a list of about $20 billion in proposed 
spending cuts which could be updated and made part of this 
contingency plan. This list was tabled in the House during the 
prebudget debate.
<P>
	To his credit the Minister of Finance has said that he and his 
officials would be willing to sit down with us to review the 
feasibility of this expanded list of spending cuts. We look 
forward to that opportunity.
<P>
	Various provincial governments, in particular Alberta and 
New Brunswick, are further along the road to controlling 
overspending than the federal government. Their deficit 
reducing activities should be scrutinized for elements which 
could be incorporated into a federal contingency plan.
<P>
	In any event a contingency plan for real deficit reduction must 
be developed and kept current for the day the government and 
the House realize the federal deficit is much more serious than 
the 1994 budget acknowledges.
<P>
	Second is a contingency plan for taxpayers. The budget 
presented by the minister last month provided for the federal 
government to extract $9 billion more out of the pockets of 
taxpayers than in 1993-94 and $600 million of that from tax 
adjustments contained in the budget itself.
<P>
	The government was wise to heed the wishes of Canadians 
and back off proposals for reducing RRSP contribution levels 
and for instituting new taxes like a carbon tax. The fact remains 
that too many Canadians are responding to excessive taxation by 
going into the underground economy or taking their capital out 
of the country. Those of us who recognize the seriousness of this 
problem need to provide taxpayers with some other options. We 
need a contingency plan for taxpayers and here are four 
suggestions.
<P>
	(1) We can make sure that every major taxpayer group in the 
country becomes aware that further tax increase are inevitable 
unless the government gets far more serious about cost cutting.
<P>
	(2) We can invite taxpayers to communicate their concerns to 
the government, perhaps by sending a tough letter of protest 
with every tax return so that even the most obtuse member of the 
government will realize that further tax increases are not a 
politically viable option for solving the government's fiscal 
problem.
<P>
	(3) We can solicit from taxpayers their proposals for 
government cost reduction and their ideas on what form tax 
relief must take in order to stimulate private sector job creation.
<P>
	(4) We can show taxpayers a tax relief light at the end of the 
cost cutting tunnel. If Parliament would pledge itself to 
reducing the deficit to zero by the end of its term then and only 
then does genuine tax relief become a real possibility.
<P>
	Third is a contingency plan for workers. In its election 
campaign and in its red book the government said that job 
creation was its highest priority. Yet the real job implications of 
the budget are bleak indeed. The most real and immediate job 
impact of the budget is the elimination of 16,000 jobs by the 
defence department; a reduction, not an increase in 
employment.
<P>
	The finance minister predicts a reduction of only one-tenth of 
one per cent in the unemployment rate in 1994 as a result of his 
budgetary measures.
<P>
<B>(1625) </B>
<P>
	The Minister of Industry and the Minister of Human 
Resources Development however are more optimistic. The 
Minister of Industry in his response to the budget spoke well and 
extensively on the new information based, export oriented 
economy emerging in the country. He assured us the government 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2058"> 2058 </A></B>
<P>
had the knowledge and the policies to enable workers and 
businesses to find a place in that new economy. The Minister of 
Human Resources Development in his response to the budget 
said rightly that there was a job crisis in the country and that the 
Chamber must seriously consider how jobs are created.
<P>
	How is a self-sustaining job to be created in the 1990s? The 
government seems to feel that government is the primary engine 
of job creation, whereas Reformers believe that the best job 
creation process is as follows.
<P>
	First there has to be a customer or a consumer somewhere 
with a demand for a good or a service and money to activate that 
demand. Then there must be an entrepreneur or a business that 
sees that demand and decides to fill it. The role of that business 
is to assemble the resources, the capital and the labour required 
to satisfy consumer demand. When that is successfully done 
employment opportunities, jobs, are created for workers 
qualified to fill them.
<P>
	The essential role of the government in all this is not to 
initiate job creation but to support it. The employment aspects 
of a government's budget, therefore, should not be measured 
primarily by how many jobs government spending and programs 
create but by the signals that budget sends to private sector job 
creators, by how many more dollars it leaves in the pockets of 
consumers and investors, and by the support programs it 
provides to workers.
<P>
	Measured by those standards the budget presented in the 
House is a failure. By not coming to grips with the deficit the 
only signal it sends to business and investors is a negative one: 
more tax increases ahead. This signal kills rather than stimulates 
private sector job creation.
<P>
	A contingency plan is required for the unemployed and the 
underemployed whom this budget fails. A part of that plan will 
be the real deficit reduction measures discussed earlier, but the 
second part of that plan must include measures to assist workers 
to find and fill jobs in the new economy referred to by the 
Minister of Industry.
<P>
	In this regard I suggest we submit the government's 
employment enhancing measures to a simple test. The minister 
of defence says that he is going to cut 16,000 jobs in the defence 
department. The Minister of Industry says that he knows there 
are new jobs waiting in the new economy, and the Minister of 
Human Resources Development says that he has the programs to 
equip people to find and fill those jobs.
<P>
	Therefore let the minister of defence submit to the House the 
names of the 16,000 people whom he is laying off. Six months 
from now we will contact them to see how many are on UI, how 
many are on welfare, how many are in dead end jobs in the old 
economy and how many in fact are on their way to jobs in the 
new economy. If even 75 per cent of those 16,000 are on their 
way to jobs in the new economy, we will be the first to 
congratulate the government and to encourage it to further 
refine and develop its employment initiatives. If more than 25 
per cent of those 16,000 are on UI or social assistance or stuck in 
dead end jobs in the old economy, it will be clear to us and the 
whole country that the government does not have an answer to 
the job problem and never did.
<P>
	In other words, if a government cannot guide 16,000 from the 
defence department to jobs in the new economy, who would 
believe that it has the policies and the programs to guide 1.6 
million unemployed to that destination?
<P>
	Finally the House must address the question of where the 
guidance and leadership will come from to correct the failures of 
the 1994 federal budget and to produce a contingency plan for 
Canadians. I am genuinely sad to say it is apparent this guidance 
and leadership will not be coming from our chief executive 
officer, the Prime Minister of Canada. This is regrettable 
because experience in this country and others has shown that 
major efforts at government cost cutting are almost never 
successful unless they are fully and vigorously backed by the 
leader of that government.
<P>
	Unfortunately the present Prime Minister made it clear on his 
visit to Alberta last week that he could not be counted upon to 
provide that kind of leadership. He is quoted as telling an 
Edmonton radio audience there will not be a new round of tough 
spending cuts. There may be some changes in reference to the 
reform of social programs but there will be no spending cuts in 
the next three years other than those announced in last week's 
budget.
<P>
<B>(1630) </B>
<P>
	Second, it is equally apparent that guidance and leadership in 
correcting the failures of the 1994 federal budget will not be 
coming from the Official Opposition. If you analyse the 
speeches made by the Bloc members in response to the budget 
you find they are totally negative with virtually no constructive 
alternatives to offer.
<P>
	It is not enough simply to point out the weaknesses and 
deficiencies of the budget. Anyone can do that. What 
desperately needs to be done is to provide constructive 
alternatives, contingency plans to remedy those weaknesses and 
deficiencies, something the Official Opposition has failed to 
provide.
<P>
	We also notice that underlying most of the budget speeches of 
the opposition is the assumption that you could balance the 
federal budget by simply cutting administrative fat. If Bloc 
members would spend even five minutes studying table 17 on 
page 56 of the budget plan, they would see that federal transfers 
in support of social programs in 1994-95 will amount to $67 
billion or 55 per cent of all program spending whereas the total 
spending on government operations is $20 billion or 16 per cent 
of government spending.
<P>
	In other words you can cut the fat, the tissue, the muscle and 
the bone out of government operations and you will still only 
reduce the deficit by half or, put another way, there is absolutely 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2059"> 2059 </A></B>
<P>
no way the federal deficit and debt can be brought under control 
without reforming social spending.
<P>
	The responses of members of Parliament to the federal 
budgetary problems are totally negative or utterly unrealistic 
and cannot be counted on to develop viable contingency plans 
for this or for any other ship of state.
<P>
	If we cannot count on the Prime Minister or the Official 
Opposition to remedy the failures of the 1994 budget or to 
produce contingency plans for coping with its negative impacts, 
whom can we count upon?
<P>
	Reformers say that in this instance as in all others affecting 
affairs of state we can count first and foremost on the people 
themselves, the taxpayers, the workers, the unemployed, the 
underemployed, the recipients of social services, the people 
whose interests are most seriously injured by the failures of the 
1994 budget and the absence of realistic contingency plans.
<P>
	It is the intention of Reform members to register our 
disappointment and apprehension concerning the 1994 budget in 
debate and in committee, but it is our intention to do more. It is 
our intention to call for the development of a contingency plan 
for Canadians and we invite other MPs and concerned Canadians 
to contribute.
<P>
	We envision a contingency plan that really comes to grips 
with the federal debt, deficit, and overspending by proposing the 
needed additional spending reductions that are missing from the 
budget. We envision a contingency plan that calls upon 
taxpayers to register their opposition to overtaxation and their 
desire to secure tax relief.
<P>
	We envision a contingency plan that puts our social programs 
on a more secure financial footing and that directs public social 
spending to those that are most in need.
<P>
	We envision a contingency plan that responds to the needs of 
the unemployed and underemployed by the stimulation of 
private sector job creation and by supporting workers in their 
journey from the old economy to the new.
<P>
	We envision using our positions, offices, and resources as 
MPs to combine our ideas with those of the public into a 
contingency plan for Canadians to control federal spending, 
secure tax relief, stabilized social services and stimulate private 
sector job creation.
<P>
	This is the Reform response to the 1994 federal budget and 
when the day comes six months, one year, or two years down the 
road and Canadians realize how badly the 1994 budget missed 
the mark there will be a constructive alternative to which they 
can turn.
<P>
<B>(1635 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional Development 
-Quebec):</B> Mr. Speaker, first of all I am delighted to welcome 
the leader of the Reform Party to the debate. As the Prime 
Minister, myself and other ministers went across the country we 
missed his presence in the debate over the last couple of weeks 
and we are delighted to see him back.
<P>
	Let me simply make a couple of points because I know the 
time is very short. The leader of the Reform Party talks about the 
necessity for jobs and in the same breath he talks about the 
requirements for tremendous cuts. I am sure he would recognize 
that even the Alberta treasurer said that as a result of his cuts the 
growth in Alberta was going to be cut by almost a full 
percentage point. I am sure he would not recommend to us as a 
country that wants to create jobs that we begin on the kinds of 
cuts that are simply going to bring the economy to its knees 
which is indeed the result of the kinds of recommendations that 
he has made.
<P>
	What we have done is follow what the OECD has done, which 
is a far more balanced approach, one which will lead to deficit 
reduction at the same time as job creation.
<P>
	The member opposite talks about eliminating the deficit. He 
talks about doing it by the end of this mandate, which is indeed 
his party's program, but the fact is that the deficit is now $13 
billion higher than when he originally prepared that program. I 
would ask where would he make those cuts or what kind of 
growth would he get.
<P>
	In his own projections he talked about growth of $16.5 billion 
in revenues over three years. That is based on assumptions 
which are simply Alice in Wonderland. I look forward to sitting 
down to understand how this country which was not able to grow 
faster than 2.4 per cent last year is going to triple its growth over 
the course of the years to come.
<P>
	I go on. He talks about cuts in OAS. He says he would do it at a 
level of $54,000. An objective assessment of what the member 
opposite has said would in fact talk about having made those 
levels of cuts to people who are making lower than $20,000 to 
$25,000. He would cut subsidies to business by $800 million. 
That is $200 million more than in fact is given to business 
through the regional agencies and basic subsidies. His 
arithmetic is fundamentally wrong or his understanding of the 
public accounts is wrong.
<P>
	He called for a 25 per cent reduction is subsidies to crown 
corporations. I simply ask him: What would he cut? VIA? Would 
he cut the CBC, eliminate it? Tell us. Do not simply give us these 
numbers in the air.
<P>
	I go on. He says taxes. He says we should not have done on the 
tax side what we did. Does that mean he would keep the 
$100,000 capital gains tax exemption of which the previous 
government, according to its own studies, said there was no 
proper evaluation? It was not able to make one iota, one scintilla 
of relationship between that capital gains tax exemption and job 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2060"> 2060 </A></B>
<P>
creation or benefit to the country. Would he keep that? We 
eliminated it and we are very proud that we did.
<P>
	He talks about a carbon tax. He was the first person to raise the 
carbon tax. It is part of an ongoing study set up by the previous 
government which we are continuing, but he is the person who 
raised the carbon tax.
<P>
	I must say to talk about a tax revolt in the House, a revolution 
against the tax of his own imagination, is somewhat specious to 
say the least.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, I know the time is precious, but let me simply 
summarize it by this. The essence of the position of the Reform 
Party is that what we should do at the present time is have a full 
review of the defence policy before any cuts are made, but that 
we should immediately embark upon a savage cut of all those 
government support programs which go to single mothers, 
single parents, senior citizens, widows, and children.
<P>
	I simply do not understand. I do not understand a political 
party which says that the cold war is not over and therefore we 
should continue defence spending, going ahead as we have in the 
past, but on the other hand that we have won the war on poverty. 
That is simply unrealistic.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The leader of the Reform Party will 
have as long as the Minister of Finance just took, which is about 
four minutes.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Manning:</B> We are going to exhaust the question period.
<P>
	The words in the minister's remarks that I think are the ones I 
can agree with are when he said: ``I do not understand''.
<P>
	What we have had in this exchange is perhaps one of the 
problems of debate in this Chamber. The minister made a 
number of statements about the Reform Party's approach to 
deficit reduction in which either he misunderstands our position 
or we have not communicated it clearly.
<P>
	Even our growth projection figures, which are based on about 
3.5 per cent and which we now acknowledge are a little bit high, 
are not that much higher than what the minister is using. We can 
defend our spending reductions. We would be prepared to do 
this. I think the more proper forum for this-and I think the 
minister has invited us to do this-would be on one of these 
nights, away from the media, away from where we are scoring 
political points, for the minister to bring his officials who can 
roll up their sleeves, we will bring ours, and we will hash over 
these numbers.
<P>
<B>(1640) </B>
<P>
	I have enough faith that I think the government is seriously 
enough concerned about this that if we can score points in that 
debate and say: ``Look, here is an area where something more 
could be done'', it will listen. If we are wrong on some of these 
projections, we will back off on those in our public presentation. 
I think that is the place where we are going to make a 
contribution or not.
<P>
	There is a second point I would like to make. I think this is 
where there is a philosophical difference between ourselves and 
the government. It is a question of how jobs are created and what 
is the role of the government in that versus the private sector.
<P>
	I have looked at the minister's budget. I notice that when the 
government talks about reducing unemployment insurance 
premiums by $725 million to $2 billion over three years, it says 
the effect of that will be to create about 40,000 jobs. In other 
words, by leaving money in the hands of businesses and 
taxpayers it is going to create about 20,000 jobs per billion 
dollars. Then the government comes along and says: ``But we 
are going to have an infrastructure program and we are going to 
tax $6 billion between the three levels of government out of 
those taxpayers, and we are going to reinvest that and we are 
going to create 65,000 jobs, in other words about 10,000 jobs per 
$1 billion spent''.
<P>
	There is an inherent contradiction in those numbers. If you 
can create 20,000 jobs by leaving a billion dollars in the hands of 
taxpayers, why would you not leave the $6 billion in the hands of 
those taxpayers and create that many more jobs? This is the 
philosophical difference between our approaches. I look 
forward to hashing it out.
<P>
	What we are interested in, and I am sure other members are, is 
getting answers. We are not interested in just scoring political 
points on this. We want to get to what is the best way to create 
self-sustaining employment. If our way is better we hope you 
would acknowledge it; if your way is better we would be pleased 
to acknowledge that.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Nic Leblanc (Longueuil):</B> Mr. Speaker, in 1984, when I 
ran for the Conservatives, we talked about three things: 
decentralization of government, spending cuts and national 
reconciliation. I would like to say to the leader of the Reform 
Party that, as of June 1990, none of that had happened.
<P>
	National reconciliation had just fallen through. There were no 
cuts; they were spending more. As for the decentralization of 
power and of government management, they continued to 
centralize more in Ottawa, as the Liberals had done. I think that 
is the main reason for the deficit and the national debt and that is 
why I resigned.
<P>
	I would like to know the position of the leader of the Reform 
Party on this. Does he think that a big decentralization, giving 
much more power to the provinces, would lead to better 
manage-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2061"> 2061 </A></B>
<P>
ment and more efficiency, so that expenditures would be lower 
and the economy would grow more?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Manning:</B> I thank the member for his question.
<P>
	I do not think there is a simple answer to the question of 
whether centralization or decentralization is better. We have got 
into a pattern where one generation of politicians seems to think 
that the answer is to centralize all the power in Ottawa-I think 
we had a lot of that under the Trudeau administration-and the 
next generation says ``No, the answer is to flow all the power out 
to the provinces''. I do not think the answer really is either of 
those extremes.
<P>
	It seems that what you have to do in a federation like ours is go 
through the entire set of power. In some cases you want to 
strengthen the federal power or the central power, in other cases 
you want to decentralize.
<P>
	Our program, for example, calls for strengthening the federal 
commerce powers, the ability of the federal government to 
strike down interprovincial barriers to trade. That is a 
strengthening of the federal power.
<P>
	On the other hand, we would like to leave the jurisdiction over 
linguistic and cultural distinctiveness more in the hands of the 
provinces and the non-governmental sectors. Therefore we 
decentralize certain aspects of power and centralize others. I 
think that is the balance we are seeking and not just a knee-jerk 
reaction one way or the other.
<P>
<B>(1645) </B>
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> There are five other hon. members 
standing who wish to make comments or ask questions. Since 
the time has expired is there unanimous consent of the House to 
proceed for another 10 minutes?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Bryden (Hamilton-Wentworth):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
am really delighted with this opportunity to actually put a 
question to the leader of the Reform Party. During the campaign 
I often spoke with candidates so this is a special pleasure.
<P>
	During his speech he remarked that the government would be 
better off cutting social programs which had a lot more money, a 
lot more fat I think he said, than government operations.
<P>
	Could he specify how he would cut these programs, by how 
much and which ones? Perhaps he could give me four or five 
specific examples.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Manning:</B> Mr. Speaker, first of all I should correct the 
impression the member gave in his question. I appreciate the 
member's question.
<P>
	I was trying to make the point particularly for Bloc members 
because I have studied their speeches, that there is no way any 
government is going to get the deficit or debt under control 
without doing something about social spending. This was 
simply my point. The reason is that 55 per cent of program 
spending is in this area.
<P>
	The Bloc often talks as if the deficit could be brought under 
control by cutting administrative fat from the government. My 
point was that the entire government operations sections could 
be cut from the budget and still we would be only halfway 
toward controlling the deficit. I am trying to make the point that 
it is of necessity and not particularly because we want it.
<P>
	My second point is if social spending has to be reduced, the 
way to do it is to target spending to those who are most in need. 
In other words reduce the entitlements for people above a 
certain income level. This is where we could have a great 
dispute.
<P>
	When we get together with Department of Finance officials, 
there are conflicting figures on how much social assistance, how 
much unemployment insurance, and how much OAS is going to 
families above the national household average. Some 
economists say it is up to $20 billion and some say it is far less. 
We have to hash that out.
<P>
	Our point is that spending should be targeted to those in the 
lower income areas. We say that in virtually every social 
spending envelope. Significant amounts of dollars can be saved 
by doing it.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Karygiannis (Scarborough-Agincourt):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, my roots are from the country where the word 
democracy and its practice were born.
<P>
	I listened to the debate of the hon. leader of the third party. I 
also listened to him during the election debates and was very 
impressed to hear that his party was going to come here as a 
constructive group to present alternatives, different views and 
so on.
<P>
	When I heard the words ``let us get together with your 
officials and our officials in private'' I was astonished. Is this 
what the Canadian people elected us for, to get behind closed 
curtains and discuss things? Is this what the Canadian people 
want? I am sure that is not the vision of members of the Reform 
Party. I am sure that is not the campaign style they had. When I 
heard ``let us get together behind closed doors and have a private 
session'' I was astonished.
<P>
	Could the leader of the third party tell me why a debate 
between the minister's officials and other officials has not been 
in public? Is this not the forum where we must have these 
debates? Is this not the forum where we must argue? Is this not 
the forum in which the word democracy should originate? Is this 
not where we should discuss things rather than in private?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Manning:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the member for his 
question. Again I think he is labouring under two 
misapprehensions.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2062"> 2062 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1650 ) </B>
<P>
	First of all we were invited by the minister to have this 
meeting to try to thrash out our views. We welcomed that but we 
did not initiate it. This came from the hon. member's side not 
our side. His speech is well directed but it ought to be directed to 
his side of the House.
<P>
	My second point is we have participated in public debate on 
the deficit and debt reduction for 18 months now. Personally I 
have given thousands of speeches on this subject, many of them 
in public meetings with open question periods. We welcome that 
and we welcome doing it in this House. I was making the point 
that as many members know, when one debates these issues so 
often the partisan aspects get into it and we get away from the 
real issues.
<P>
	We know in question period if we raise some hot topic about 
the jets and the $140,000 expenditure on that we can get a great 
hit on the evening news. We can get a great deal of attention by 
doing that. However if we raise some structural problem with 
the health care system which can probably save $1.5 billion to 
$2 billion that is not even newsworthy because it is complicated 
and it cannot be discussed in short exchanges.
<P>
	I welcome all kinds of opportunities for public debate and 
debate in this House. However I do think there would be some 
merit in accepting the minister's invitation to sit down around a 
table and get into the details of some of these issues. Then those 
discussions could be carried into the House as well.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lawrence MacAulay (Secretary of State (Veterans)):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to stand in my place today and speak 
in support of the budget brought down on February 22 by my 
hon. friend and colleague, the Minister of Finance.
<P>
	We should congratulate the minister on his first budget since 
this government assumed office. He has steered a wise and 
careful course. He has set in motion a measure which will lead to 
major changes in the years to come.
<P>
	As members are aware the Minister of Finance consulted 
widely with Canadians before he brought down his budget. It is 
clear that he was listening. I can tell because I have been 
listening to my constituents and to the people of Prince Edward 
Island.
<P>
	They told me they want action to build the economy and 
create jobs. They want a social security system that is fair and 
compassionate, but they also know that Canada needs social 
security that is affordable. They told me that government has to 
get its finances in order.
<P>
	This budget responds to those concerns. It sets the foundation 
for growth and jobs in the future. At the same time it balances 
the need for social reform and deficit reduction.
<P>
	I know many veterans were concerned about the impact this 
budget might have on them. These men and women have served 
our country well. They devoted the best years of their lives to 
Canada and they have personal  memories of the devotion of 
comrades who made the final sacrifice for Canada and the values 
we hold dear.
<P>
	I can tell members there is no group of Canadians more 
passionately concerned about Canada's future than our veterans. 
There is no group more outspoken about our need to preserve our 
quality of life. I know that veterans across Canada welcome the 
measures to reduce government spending.
<P>
	We are going to launch a review of the government's 
operations so we can get things done more efficiently. We are 
going to look at all our programs and find out where we can 
reduce overlap and duplication.
<P>
	In Veterans Affairs Canada we will be looking at our own 
operations. That is how it should be. We are going to find ways 
to trim administrative costs just like other departments in 
government.
<P>
	However, we are not going to touch veterans pensions or 
allowances. We want to ensure that veterans who need and are 
eligible for benefits receive them. Veterans deserve their 
pensions and allowances and this is the time when many 
veterans need them most. As they grow older many veterans rely 
on us to maintain the quality of life they so richly earned.
<P>
<B>(1655 ) </B>
<P>
	All members in this House have veterans in their 
constituencies. I am sure no matter what region of the country 
they come from hon. members will recognize the fairness of the 
government policy to provide for veterans. It has often been said 
that Canada provides veterans with the finest package of 
veterans benefits in the world. We are second to none.
<P>
	I would like to take a few minutes to talk about my own 
region, Atlantic Canada, and what this budget means to my 
home province of Prince Edward Island.
<P>
	I am very proud that this budget contains provisions to locate 
a demonstration project in Prince Edward Island. This joint 
undertaking by the Department of Human Resources 
Development, the Government of Prince Edward Island and the 
Canadian Association of Community Living will look at ways to 
create opportunities for individuals with disabilities.
<P>
	Canada cannot ignore the potential of its citizens who have 
disabilities, not at a time when we need everyone to contribute 
his or her skills to building Canada's future. The government 
hopes that what is learned with this project in Prince Edward 
Island can be applied in other areas for other persons with 
disabilities.
<P>
	Another budget measure many of my friends, neighbours and 
constituents in Prince Edward Island have talked about with me 
are the changes to the unemployment insurance system. As this 
House knows these changes are the first step in a bigger strategy 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2063"> 2063 </A></B>
<P>
to reform social security in Canada so that it is both fair and 
affordable.
<P>
	Above all we have to rebuild the system so it does not make it 
harder to create jobs. A good job is the best social assistance 
available to any person in this nation. Therefore some of my 
constituents welcome the steps we have taken in the budget to 
reduce the cost of UI to employers.
<P>
	Unemployment insurance is a payroll tax. If it is left too high 
it kills jobs. Back in 1989 the unemployment insurance premium 
was $1.95. This year it is $3.07. Maximum premiums have more 
than doubled for employees. They have more than doubled for 
employers as well.
<P>
	These are taxes. Most important these are taxes on small 
businesses. In my province of Prince Edward Island virtually all 
businesses are small businesses. My constituents cannot afford 
to see the UI premiums increased. The small businesses in P.E.I. 
need some relief from taxes so that they can get on with the job 
of creating jobs.
<P>
	That is why so many of my constituents support the budget 
measures to roll back UI premiums to $3 next year. That is a 
substantial tax cut from the $3.30 that would be in place if this 
government had not made that move.
<P>
	At the same time many Prince Edward Islanders rely on 
unemployment insurance payments to help them get by until 
they find work again. These are tough measures for those who 
are on unemployment insurance and I am not afraid to admit it.
<P>
	My constituents agree they would certainly rather be working 
than on unemployment insurance. We are going to do what we 
can to use the social security system, including unemployment 
insurance, to help Canadians get back to work.
<P>
	In the meantime, we know some people rely on UI not only to 
take care of themselves while they look for another job but they 
also must look after dependants. That is why the budget 
improves UI benefits for those who need them most, people who 
have to take care of a child or a needs parent, or who support a 
non-working spouse.
<P>
<B>(1700 ) </B>
<P>
	After the budget changes to unemployment insurance are in 
place Atlantic Canada will still receive more unemployment 
insurance per capita than anywhere else in Canada.
<P>
	Unemployment insurance recipients in Atlantic Canada will 
receive an average of $970 compared with $540 elsewhere.
<P>
	It shows that the government recognizes the special needs of a 
region where chronic unemployment presents special problems. 
Nowhere are these more evident than in the fishing industry.
<P>
	The previous government did nothing to provide funding 
beyond May 15 to assist those individuals whose livelihood 
comes from the Atlantic ground fishery. This budget provides 
for an Atlantic ground fishery industry renewal and adjustment 
strategy for help over the long term.
<P>
	This government is working hard to find a method of 
supporting some 35,000 Atlantic Canadians who will have no 
income after the current program expires. The Minister of 
Fisheries and Oceans and the Minister of Human Resources 
Development are working on measures that will treat these 
people fairly and with dignity.
<P>
	I have spoken about some of the measures in this budget that 
affect the people in my home province of Prince Edward Island 
and in the Atlantic region as a whole. I have talked about what 
Canada's veterans can expect from this budget.
<P>
	There is one message I hear loud and clear from my 
constituents and from veterans. It is that Canadians know that 
we need to change the way government operates and they want 
to have a voice in the way these changes will be made.
<P>
	The government is on the road to a new approach to job 
creation and social programs and we are going to make sure that 
Canadians have a voice in how those changes will be made.
<P>
	The budget represents the first phase of major reform and the 
government looks forward to our continuing discussions with 
Canadians on how best to reshape our great country to meet the 
challenges of the next century.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Before proceeding to 
questions and comments I would just like to verify with the hon. 
secretary of state if he is sharing his time with a colleague and 
possibly the member for Burlington if I understand correctly.
<P>
	If that is the case, if he would indicate to the Chair we will 
proceed to five minutes of questions and comments.
<P>
	Is the hon. secretary of state sharing his time?
<P>
	<B>Mr. MacAulay:</B> Yes, we are sharing the time.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jack Ramsay (Crowfoot):</B> Mr. Speaker, I heard most of 
the comments of the hon. member and I appreciate them. 
Certainly when he speaks about reform and that we must change 
the way we do business in the country it is a welcomed statement 
on this side of the House. We join him in that.
<P>
	I have asked a question of his colleagues and it is a tough 
question. I have not received an answer. The budget speaks of 
the addition of $100 billion to the federal debt over the next 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2064"> 2064 </A></B>
<P>
three years. It does not say a word about the consequences to a 
number of issues, the consequences to the job creation program, 
the  consequences to social programs, the consequences to the 
one million children reported to be living in poverty in this 
country.
<P>
	I wonder if the minister has any ideas or thoughts that would 
debilitate the government's ability to function adequately and at 
the level the budget suggests in the light of $100 billion to the 
debt over the next three years.
<P>
	What is the danger, if any, of the debt?
<P>
	<B>Mr. MacAulay:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank my hon. colleague from 
Crowfoot.
<P>
	Our approach quite honestly would be a little different than 
his approach. If we were to balance the books which are out of 
line the way the hon. member has proposed we would not have 
UI changes. We would have a collapse of our social system.
<P>
<B>(1705 ) </B>
<P>
	The area that I represent would be devastated. What we have 
done as a government has changed the direction of government. 
We will have a deficit of under $40 billion, which is not great but 
we are on the road to recovery.
<P>
	If we were to take the path of balancing the books, the people 
that I represent would have nothing. This government is a 
compassionate government which cares about people. We have 
to get our books in order. We are on the path to putting our books 
in order but we are not going to devastate the Canadians who 
need our assistance on the way.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Pierre de Savoye (Portneuf):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am still not 
clear about a few things regarding this budget. As we know, the 
government is not always the most efficient provider when it 
comes to delivering certain types of services. Take veterans' 
homes for example. Could someone tell us how much it costs to 
operate these homes as opposed to having comparable services 
provided by hospitals in another sector? Could a comparison be 
made? I think that the difference in costs would be in the tens of 
thousands of dollars. I would welcome comments on that.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. MacAulay:</B> I would like to thank my hon. colleague for 
his question. The Department of Veterans Affairs was heavily 
involved in hospitals over the last number of years. We now 
have two. One is Sainte-Anne's, as the member is well aware, 
and one is in western Canada. I do not have the figures before me 
as to the costs. The number one priority of the Department of 
Veterans Affairs is to make sure that the veteran gets the proper 
treatment.
<P>
	We deal with provincial governments in order to move our 
institutions from the Department of Veterans Affairs to 
provincial jurisdiction. We have two hospitals left and we are in 
discussions with these hospitals as well in order to bring them 
from the Department of Veterans Affairs to provincial authority.
<P>
	The Department of Veterans Affairs always makes sure that 
the veteran gets the best treatment possible. In this country, as 
my hon. friend is well aware, we take great pride in being able to 
say that we are number one in providing for our veterans. I can 
assure the member we are going to remain being number one as a 
nation providing for our veterans.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Paddy Torsney (Burlington):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is a great 
honour for me to be speaking during International Women's 
Week as the member of Parliament for Burlington, Ontario. Not 
only am I excited about representing my home town in the House 
of Commons, but I feel a deep sense of loyalty and purpose 
toward the job I have been elected to do.
<P>
	The people of Burlington have given me the opportunity to 
grow and learn alongside them, and I welcome the challenge and 
the privilege. Already the rewards have been great and I look 
forward to combining the unparalleled energy of the populace of 
Burlington with my own enthusiasm.
<P>
	It is very important to me that I thank not only my family and 
friends, without whose help I would not be here, but also the 
people of Burlington who have graciously given me their 
support, ideas and ultimately their confidence. Many people 
worked very hard to see me elected to this House. My parents 
and my family have supported me wholeheartedly in what seems 
in hindsight to have been a very fast campaign but what during 
the summer seemed endless at times.
<P>
	My parents and my sister came to Canada in 1957 from 
Ireland and my parents inspired in each of their children 
commitment in and loyalty to this country, their chosen nation. 
They taught us the value of hard work and the importance of 
volunteering and giving something back to our community. I 
thank them for inspiring in me this deep sense of commitment I 
feel and for giving me the genes and the energy to fulfil that 
sense of duty.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Now, it is my duty to show the people of Burlington that I am 
worthy of the trust they have put in me. We must create a 
partnership with them to share our knowledge and our vision of 
Canada. I plan to work hand in hand with the people of 
Burlington to make Canada a better and better place to be.
<P>
<B>(1710) </B>
<P>
	I cannot do this on my own, no more than I can work alone in 
this House. We must all join hands and work together. In the 
daily performance of my duties as member of Parliament, I have 
noticed how different my riding was from my colleagues' 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2065"> 2065 </A></B>
<P>
ridings. There are  amazing differences between the 
communities we represent as well as within these communities.
<P>
	I think that our society can only be enriched by such diversity. 
We are not divided by our differences but by our silences.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	It is fortunate that we have a forum such as this Chamber from 
which our travels can begin, where we can discover our 
similarities, share our differences, our ideas, our knowledge and 
ourselves.
<P>
	I envision a walk which encompasses the beauty of our 
country. It will be a colourful walk. There will be mountains to 
climb and prairies to cross, for our walk will be as long as our 
country is vast, yet always there will be colour in the languages 
we speak and in the land around us. We will walk through the 
blooming of springs and the harshness of winters and we will 
come through having understood that we can only succeed if we 
walk together, if we leave no one behind.
<P>
	Just as I will work to see Burlington grow and succeed, I will 
work to ensure that Canada also flourishes. We must build a 
healthy economy for our future generations and a society with 
racial and gender equality. These goals are mutually inclusive, 
for our economy can only be strong if everyone has equal 
opportunity to participate.
<P>
	If we do not have full equality our development as a nation 
will suffer and when we have equal participation in Canada we 
will be at our strongest internationally.
<P>
	This government's first budget sets a stage from which to 
strengthen our country. The reforms being sought by the 
Minister of Human Resources Development will continue that 
process.
<P>
	I am proud to be part of a government that recognizes the 
inequities in our present systems, a government that is 
committed to making meaningful changes for all Canadians.
<P>
	This is a historic budget, the first to note the different 
economic impacts on women in Canada. Too many Canadian 
children are living below the poverty line, especially in single 
parent families headed by women. The budget commits the 
government to examining the issue of child support payments to 
ensure fairness in taxation as it is critical to the future of many 
young Canadians. In my view child poverty in Canada is a threat 
to our economic future and a complete waste of our resources.
<P>
	The budget will have a positive effect on small businesses. I 
am pleased to support Burlington's Business Women's Network, 
a group fostering entrepreneurship and encouraging growth 
among Canada's most successful business starters, women. 
People like Roxeanne Moffat, owner of Hillcrest Florist, and 
Nancy Brewer, who started her own accounting business, are 
models of excellence and commitment to our fellow residents 
and to young people.
<P>
	The axiom think globally, act locally is certainly relevant to 
Canada and is important to remember as we set the course for 
our new Canada. If we improve ourselves at a local level we can 
have a positive effect on the international scene. In Burlington, 
for example, we have various community activities and projects 
which have enriched our region both economically and socially.
<P>
	We have learned the hard way by allowing our once beautiful 
Burlington Bay to be spoiled with the sludge of industry. Now 
we are learning that there is a new sustainable way to develop 
our economy and that Canadians have a commitment to clean up 
our past mistakes and share our expertise internationally and 
profitably.
<P>
	I am pleased by the variety and breadth of local initiatives to 
stimulate innovative entrepreneurship. Burlington's junior 
achievement inspires and encourages young entrepreneurs to 
run their own businesses. They are closely associated with and 
influenced by local business persons who act as mentors and 
peers. It is great to see both young and old working together in 
partnership for a brighter future.
<P>
	Certainly the older citizens of Burlington have incredible 
knowledge and insight to share. Many of Burlington's seniors, 
in age only and not in spirit, have enjoyed a second career by 
being involved in CESO International Services, a not for profit 
volunteer based organizations committed to human and global 
development with a goal of self-sufficiency whether for the 
First Nations of Canada or for other citizens abroad. On average 
CESO's volunteers are 62 years old. They are people like Larry 
and Patricia McMahon and Anthony Miele from Burlington who 
offer their skills and knowledge to others.
<P>
	I believe it is necessary for Canadians to share these resources 
both within and outside our national boundaries. When we take 
positive action at a local level we will improve the quality of 
Canadians' lives. Inevitably this energy will spread beyond all 
boundaries.
<P>
<B>(1715) </B>
<P>
	In Burlington we have an organization that works locally and 
nationally to eliminate violence against women. CAVEAT was 
started by a local mother, Priscilla de Villiers, and is supported 
and sponsored by many people in our community.
<P>
	Internationally, the United Nations has followed Canada's 
lead in working to eradicate violence against women. This is a 
human rights issue as much as it is an equality issue. All of our 
world's citizens will benefit when women need not fear for their 
lives.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2066"> 2066 </A></B>
<P>
	I know that every step we take in the long walk ahead of us 
has been made possible because of the work done by our 
foremothers and forefathers. In my riding women make up 64 
per cent of the population over 75. This is a thriving community 
of women who are vital and spirited. Their contributions to 
Burlington have been many and varied and they continue to act 
as advisers, educators and role models.
<P>
	I am honoured to be able to take footsteps beside those of such 
unique people as Jean Galloway, Burlington's citizen of the year 
for 1993. At 73 years of age, a mother, grandmother and 
volunteer extraordinaire, Jean was the founder of the Society for 
Animal Aid. She works for Meals-on-Wheels, the Red Cross 
and is one of Burlington's foremost lobbyists for improvements 
in our community.
<P>
	In sharing their life experiences with their families and 
friends, the older women of Burlington have given a voice to 
something which has often been silenced; the value of women 
and the work they have done both inside and outside of their 
homes. Indeed, their lives are rich and multifaceted.
<P>
	I would like to take this opportunity to thank the older women 
of Burlington and of Canada for their contributions to society 
which oftentimes have been overlooked. We must learn from our 
elders, both women and men, and rebuild our economy in an 
economically viable manner.
<P>
	Together with all Canadians the government will draw up the 
blueprints for that rebuilding. This budget is the first edition.
<P>
	I am pleased to be able to work with my constituents and with 
this House to bring Canada into the 21st century, into an era of 
equality for all citizens in Canada and in the world. I hope that 
all members of this House will join with me in this walk into our 
future.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Pierre de Savoye (Portneuf):</B> Mr. Speaker, I listened 
with great interest to the speech made by the hon. member from 
the Liberal Party. She praised the entrepreneurship of some of 
her constituents, and I think that, indeed, we must all pay tribute 
to the entrepreneurs in our respective ridings, right across the 
country.
<P>
	The hon. member also referred to the elderly. I have a great 
concern about seniors, and this budget only makes it worse. I 
want to tell the hon. member about it, so that she can give me her 
own opinion.
<P>
	Seniors receive a federal pension. However, those whose 
income is higher than $29,000 will now have to pay back a 
portion of that pension. As you know, quite often these people 
bought a property many years ago. It was a small property at the 
time, and it was affordable. Sometimes, the value of that 
property increased rather considerably over the years, and so 
much the better. However, property taxes represent an 
additional fiscal  burden for these elderly people, who are now 
going to be deprived of part of their pension.
<P>
	I think the government is looking in the wrong place to find 
money which it could get elsewhere, including from those 
businesses which benefit from a number of tax shelters, 
particularly abroad, which I find totally unacceptable. I would 
appreciate it if the hon. member could comment.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Torsney:</B> Mr. Speaker, I think all levels of government 
must work together for the benefit of all Canadians. It is 
necessary to review taxes at the municipal level as well as 
here-
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
-at the federal government and the provincial government 
levels and to make sure that we are not having a double hit on all 
our constituents. Sometimes it is a triple and a quadruple hit in 
Ontario with regional government.
<P>
<B>(1720) </B>
<P>
	I am pleased that the government was able to protect for 75 
per cent of the senior citizens in this country the age tax credit. I 
have heard from many seniors that they are concerned about 
being knocked into the next level and losing that exemption. 
However, many people have said to me that they too want to 
share in rebuilding our economy and pay their fair share. Many 
people recognize that this country needs a lot of work on our 
deficit.
<P>
	I think we have made some positive moves in terms of 
protecting the age tax credit for 75 per cent of the seniors in this 
country. We have a lot of work to do with the other levels of 
government in making sure that we are not harming seniors and 
others in our population. Together we can work on this.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Laurent Lavigne (Beauharnois-Salaberry):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I listened carefully to our nice colleague on the right, 
and I would like to make a few comments to her.
<P>
	I found her speech nice and well presented, except that I do 
not find in the budget, which she calls the budget of the century, 
the super budget, any funds that will help mothers with children, 
especially those who are single parents, when it comes to child 
care. When the government opposite was on this side of the 
House and was the Official Opposition, the present Deputy 
Prime Minister fought to have the government invest in day 
care-I remember her words. There is nothing for it in this 
budget. There is nothing for social housing either. We know the 
huge needs for social housing and we find practically nothing 
about it in this budget.
<P>
	I feel that they have tried to solve the present economic 
problem by attacking the unemployed instead of unemployment. 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2067"> 2067 </A></B>
<P>
I find that regrettable. I think that they should probably have 
rather gone after family trusts, for example, of which we have 
spoken a lot.
<P>
	Since time is pressing, I will let the hon. member opposite 
comment on what I said.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Ms. Torsney:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the member for his 
comments. It was very clear that the government campaigned on 
the issue of child care. We committed ourselves to increasing 
the number of child care spaces available in each year following 
3 per cent growth.
<P>
	I am pleased to be part of a government that recognizes that 
child care is in fact very important to the equality of women.
<P>
	We have also undertaken to look at the issue of taxation and 
child tax credits for those who choose to stay in their own home 
to take care of their children, whether that be men or women in 
our communities. It is important that we make options available 
to them. It is important that we care for their future.
<P>
	I believe our children are our greatest resource and we have to 
do something to make sure they are brought up in a healthy 
environment and that they are cared for and fed. Child care and 
the child care option for many parents is very important and we 
do have to work for that.
<P>
	I for one will be working very hard to make sure that we fulfil 
those commitments in each of the years of our mandate.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> I want to thank the hon. 
member for Beauharnois-Salaberry for his co-operation, as 
well as the hon. member for Burlington for her brief answer. 
Resuming debate.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Nic Leblanc (Longueuil):</B> Mr. Speaker, first I would like 
to refer to the finance minister's<I> Budget in Brief</I>, which outlines 
three central goals: first, to help small businesses; second, to 
ensure a responsible social security system that is fair; and third, 
to restore fiscal responsibility to government.
<P>
	I will express my opinion on the first goal: to help small and 
medium-sized businesses. I refer to page 5, to the first goal: to 
help small business. Last January, just before the budget, the 
minister started by increasing unemployment insurance 
premiums to generate about $800 million in revenue.
<P>
<B>(1725) </B>
<P>
	About half that amount must be paid by businesses and, of 
course, by workers. This means that the government will collect 
$800 million, thus reducing even further people's purchasing 
power. As a result, people will buy less and businesses will 
produce less; this will hurt business. I do not think this is a 
measure to help create jobs, as the minister stated on many 
occasions. This measure is the first example he seem to give to 
illustrate his efforts to help business.
<P>
	He then says they will create a network of business services 
centres that will be expanded to provide access for small 
business in every province. He is talking about a single federal 
government centre. He talks only of this single federal 
government centre when, for several years now, the Quebec 
government, members from Quebec, and members of the Bloc 
Quebecois have been saying that, to substantially reduce 
government management, we need instead one-stop centres 
housing both the Quebec department of economic development 
and its federal counterpart.
<P>
	As we know very well and as I have said many times and am 
repeating again today, the Bélanger-Campeau Commission 
concluded that duplication between the provinces, especially 
Quebec, and the federal government costs between $2 billion 
and $3 billion a year.
<P>
	It is a huge amount. Besides costing $2 to $3 billion a year, we 
know that it is also very inefficient because companies, 
especially small and medium-sized ones, have great difficulty 
making their way through all that.
<P>
	If the Minister of Finance were serious, he would not have 
talked about a single centre; he should have talked about a single 
window with Quebec or the provinces and the federal 
government-one-stop shopping, if you will. You must really 
be unimaginative and your ears must be completely blocked not 
to hear Quebec's demands.
<P>
	Another great advantage that he mentions for increasing 
productivity and job creation in our small and medium-sized 
businesses is that he will consult and study.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, this is my tenth year in the House of Commons 
and for at least ten years we have been consulting and studying. I 
thought that the Liberal Party had such a clear program, because 
almost every day, if not several times a day, they tell us about 
their marvellous red book which had all the answers. I realize 
that the red book was not so complete since, when it comes to job 
creation and aid for small business, the government consults and 
studies and it will go on studying for a long time.
<P>
	On page 5 of <I>The Budget in Brief</I>, it says: ``A special task 
force will recommend, on a fast-track basis, a better regulatory 
regime to help improve the competitiveness of business''.
<P>
	But I thought that the red book was complete and that the 
government was ready to act once it took power. Now they are in 
power. Why study and consult? I am still quoting page 5: ``The 
government will consult the business community on a wide 
range of tariff cuts on imported manufacturing inputs [-]'' 
More studies, but studies already exist on the subject.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2068"> 2068 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1730) </B>
<P>
	A little further, the red book says: ``The Minister of Transport 
will launch an effort, in consultation with provincial 
governments [-]'' Again, more studies and consultations. That 
is how the Minister of Finance can say that he will revitalize the 
economy and create jobs. I do not think that he is really prepared 
to act, so he consults. There is also the House Standing 
Committee on Finance reporting its recommendations on a tax 
to replace the GST. Again, they are not ready to act to create jobs 
and help small and medium-sized businesses create jobs.
<P>
	What has the government done in concrete terms? It has 
eliminated the $100,000 capital gains exemption. That is not a 
bad idea, but I am convinced that abolishing the $100,000 
capital gains exemption is not going to help the employment 
situation or make small business prosper.
<P>
	Also, income tax deductions for entertainment expenses have 
been reduced. But many small businesses, self-employed 
workers and salespersons need tax deductions for entertainment 
expenses if they are to be able to do their jobs properly. We know 
full well-and so does the Minister of Finance, I am sure-that 
the day tax deductions for entertainments expenses were 
reduced, several restaurants felt the pinch and complained about 
the number of jobs lost, because restaurants and hotels are 
losing more and more business. The Minister of Finance is 
aware of the statistics. He claims to want to support job creation, 
but he is actually hindering job creation by reducing tax credits 
for entertainment expenses, an action affecting self-employed 
workers and salesmen, those involved in product promotion and 
the rest.
<P>
	Does the Minister of Finance actually believe that by taxing 
businesses more, he will be supporting job creation? The federal 
government will raise an additional $1.7 billion in taxes from 
small and medium-sized businesses over the next three years. It 
will also raise an additional $1.8 billion from individual 
taxpayers, which translates into $3.5 billion in new taxes for 
businesses and individuals over the next three years. Does the 
Minister of Finance believe that by reducing the spending power 
of businesses and individuals, he is going to create more jobs? 
Surely not.
<P>
	I have here the findings of a survey and they are, in my view, 
rather astounding. The Canadian Chamber of Commerce 
surveyed 658 member businesses and asked them the following 
question: Are you satisfied with the federal government's fiscal 
policies? A full 22 per cent of the businesses surveyed 
responded either that they would consider moving, were 
prepared to move, or had already moved part or all of their 
operations out of the country.
<P>
<B>(1735) </B>
<P>
	The February 15, 1994, edition of <I>La Presse</I> states the point 
clearly: Federal policies are driving businesses out of the 
country. If the Minister of Finance believes that his policies will 
create employment even while his recent budget has placed a 
heavier administrative and tax burden on businesses, if he 
believes this is the way to create jobs, then he should have read 
the survey of the Canadian Chamber of Commerce. It is 
unfortunate, sad and astounding to see that 22 per cent of these 
businesses have decided to move either part or all of their 
operations out of Canada.
<P>
	Times are hard and the debt is very high. However, I think the 
Minister of Finance does not have a clue as to what must be done 
to create jobs in this country.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> I would just like to make a 
suggestion to the House before I recognize the next hon. 
member if in fact there should be agreement to the suggestion 
that I make.
<P>
	I have in my possession a list of speakers to follow. There 
would be four: two opposition members and two from the 
government side. If it were the view and the feeling of the House 
to consider waiving the five-minute question and comment for 
each of the four speakers that would take us to 6.15 p.m., at 
which time I understand we must go on to another business of 
the day.
<P>
	I am not forcing it; I am just making a suggestion. I am in the 
hands of the House. I see in the House the four persons who wish 
to speak on the amendment today. I will wait to hear some 
direction from the House.
<P>
	Possibly the Secretary of State for Parliamentary Affairs 
might want to make that suggestion, or should I ask simply for 
unanimous consent?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Pauline Picard (Drummond):</B> Mr. Speaker, we were 
told that the government's first budget would give new hope to 
Canadians. This hope which the Liberals promised to restore 
during the election campaign, was to be primarily generated by a 
relentless fight against unemployment, a will to reduce the 
deficit, the elimination of frivolous expenditures and waste, as 
well as the near certainty that taxpayers would not be put to 
contribution once again, since they simply could not give any 
more.
<P>
	Nice things were said indeed, but when the time came to 
deliver, last February 22, Canadians were in for a rude 
awakening. First, the message sent by taxpayers was not heard. 
The government will take $500 million from seniors and $500 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2069"> 2069 </A></B>
<P>
million from workers by taxing life insurance premiums. As for 
controlling the deficit, you can forget about that. For the first 
time ever in a federal budget, a government announced that the 
deficit would be close to a staggering $40 billion.
<P>
	In that respect, the minister is confirming that he cannot do 
any better than his predecessors, even though he himself 
strongly criticized their inability in the past. Government 
spending is reduced by a mere $400 million, while the Auditor 
General is proposing useful solutions which would translate into 
savings of $5 billion.
<P>
	As for the evil of unemployment, the government is simply 
using the wrong approach by targeting the unemployed, instead 
of providing effective solutions to solve the problem. Is that the 
kind of hope the government promised to restore? I do not think 
so. I believe that this budget will go down in history as the 
budget of the broken dreams.
<P>
	The government also said that the National Forum on Health 
would ensure an in-depth review of our health system. However, 
this forum will have to allow for a real dialogue to identify the 
obstacles facing the provinces, and to develop appropriate 
solutions, given the need to adequately finance our health 
system and take into account the prerogatives of the provinces.
<P>
	More importantly, this national forum must not be used by the 
government to justify any unilateral change in transfer 
payments for established programs financing which would go 
against the interests of the provinces.
<P>
<B>(1740) </B>
<P>
	If we take a close look at the budget of the Minister of Finance 
and forget all the rhetorical frills, we soon realize it is just 
another version of the Tory budgets which the minister himself 
strongly and openly criticized when he was in the opposition.
<P>
	The present government was elected on a platform for change 
and renewal. However, it seems to have a different concept of 
change. In fact, the Minister of Finance is perpetuating the Tory 
government's policy by freezing the federal per capita 
contributions until 1994-95.
<P>
	In his budget speech, the Minister of Finance said there would 
be a National Forum on Health, specifying that ``no further 
changes in respect to EPF health transfers are contained in this 
budget, in order to set the stage for that discussion. Our 
commitment to maintain the principles of the Canada Health Act 
remains firm and unaltered''. And yet, reality is brutal for 
Quebec and for the other provinces.
<P>
	No further changes, indeed. The minister maintains the cuts 
introduced by the Tories and says that for 1995-96, established 
programs financing will be indexed to the GNP growth rate, 
minus 3 per cent. The federal government has again acted 
unilaterally by refusing to honour its commitments and 
transferring its cash flow problems to the provinces. The 
question arises whether the government will approach the 
National Forum on Health with the same good intentions and the 
same tendency to make unilateral decisions.
<P>
	The Bloc Quebecois has stated repeatedly that the freeze on 
transfer payments will have a major impact on the tax burden of 
the provinces. By perpetuating this policy which was initiated 
by the Tories, the Minister of Finance is putting the provinces in 
the unenviable position of having to deal with the increasing 
cost of health care on their own.
<P>
	The Deputy Prime Minister was also critical of the freeze on 
transfer payments when she was in the opposition. She said the 
precarious state of federal funding was about to provoke a crisis 
in the health care sector in this country. Why did the Minister of 
Finance choose to ignore this very sensible comment? The 
government keeps on unloading a portion of its deficit thinking 
it will get away with it, instead of addressing the real sources of 
the problem and being less stubborn in its desire to maintain 
overlappings and duplications.
<P>
	Two years ago today, on March 9, 1992, in an eloquent speech 
during debate on Bill C-60, Mrs. Diane Marleau, now the 
Minister of Health, denounced the adverse effects of reductions 
and freezes perpetuated by the Conservative government in 
provincial transfers regarding health programs. She noted at the 
time, and I quote: ``Transfer reductions in that area did not 
contribute to a better management of our health system''. Also, 
the minister aptly noted the following: ``We literally shifted the 
deficit burden to the provinces, telling them they had a choice 
between raising taxes and reducing services. In many cases, they 
did both''.
<P>
	This speech, which made a good case, was not given 20 years 
or 10 years ago, but on March 9, 1992, two years ago today. 
What happened during those two years to cause these sound 
perceptions to be so dramatically reversed? There was indeed an 
election. And the people who were rightly denouncing the 
always well hidden cuts in EPF transfers are now in office and 
making the decisions.
<P>
	Now I understand why the budget speech only included five 
lines on the health issue. It is because the Liberals were 
shamefully hiding the same restrictive policies as the 
Conservatives, sweeping under the carpet our valuable 
principles and thereby contradicting the very foundations of the 
election discourse contained in the famous red book with which 
this government got elected.
<P>
<B>(1745) </B>
<P>
	Trickery has its price: the mistrust and loss of confidence of 
our fellow citizens towards political institutions and those in 
government. To illustrate this lack of trust, let me quote a last 
time from the speech delivered by the hon. Minister of Health on 
March 9, 1992: ``Cutting back on the transfers in these areas has 
not contributed to better management of our health care system. 
They have only contributed to the cutbacks and to the fear that 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2070"> 2070 </A></B>
<P>
we feel now across the nation as the middle income group, which 
is the largest group of Canadians, are frightened and afraid of 
what is going to  happen to them in the future. Will there be a 
health care system for them? Will they be able to get the drugs 
that they need at the prices they can afford to pay when they need 
them, when they get to be a certain age. There is this feeling that 
perhaps the federal government is letting go of its 
responsibilities in this matter''. This quote is as revealing as it is 
current.
<P>
	So, the federal government's underfunding of transfer 
payments to the provinces on health care has serious 
consequences, in the end, for users, something that the author of 
the budget tabled on February 22 simply forgot.
<P>
	Let us take, for example, the case of Sainte-Croix Hospital in 
my riding, whose budget shortfall is about $10 million a year. 
Our community has seen the rise of a widespread support 
movement to ensure the survival of this hospital serving a 
population of 90,000. It is not in a developing country that we 
are talking about saving a hospital, it is in Quebec, in the 
Canadian health care system that we like to describe as one of 
the best in the world. Yes, trickery has its price: the mistrust of 
our fellow citizens when they can no longer receive the services 
that were promised to them and that they are entitled to under the 
law.
<P>
	The budget announces the creation of a centre of excellence 
for women's health. What about this centre and how much will 
be allocated to it, when the Medical Research Council's budget 
has been slashed by $10.8 million, cut from the networks of 
centres of excellence program. As for the commitments 
regarding a prenatal nutrition program, is it new money or will 
the funds come from terminating secondary programs-$31.2 
million-or exceptional assistance programs-$30.2 million? 
The figures are misleading and suggest that programs were 
eliminated to make room for those promised by the government 
during the election campaign.
<P>
	The drastic cuts in the Unemployment Insurance Program will 
necessarily result in a certain deterioration of the 
socio-economic living conditions of UI recipients and their 
health will be affected.
<P>
	The most unfortunate aspect of this policy and these cuts is 
that they affect mainly the less fortunate segment of our society. 
How can an individual with an annual income of $25,000 and 
two dependent children support his or her family if the benefit 
rate is reduced to only 55 per cent of insurable earnings? How 
will the health of the less fortunate be affected by this measure? 
Did the government assess the risks and costs of such measures 
which will have an impact on provincial health budgets?
<P>
	This reduction will make it difficult for the poor to afford 
decent food, clothing and housing as well as heat. It will result in 
poorer health and an increase in health care costs. If the 
government hopes to reduce its expenditures by jeopardizing the 
existence of the less fortunate, it is dead wrong.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dan McTeague (Ontario):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have the 
distinct honour today not only to congratulate you on your 
position but at the same time to congratulate the hon. Minister of 
Finance on one of the most balanced and reasonable budgets 
presented to the House in recent times.
<P>
	This is my first opportunity to address the House as the newly 
elected member for Ontario. It is a privilege to be able to stand 
before the House in that capacity. Before me have gone some 
great members who passed through the House. I am thinking of 
the Hon. Norman Cafik, the Hon. Michael Starr and more 
recently Rene Soetens, the member who served here from 1988 
to 1992.
<P>
<B>(1750) </B>
<P>
	I take the House very seriously. The constituents of the 
Ontario riding have given me an opportunity for once to express 
their interests on their behalf. It is a humbling task which I plan 
to serve with diligence, integrity and honesty. I would like to say 
a bit about my riding before I proceed into some of the 
highlights of the budget as I saw it and some important aspects 
of the budget that are worth while pursuing and supporting.
<P>
	Ontario riding is one of the largest populace ridings in the 
country. It stretches to include the ever growing towns of Ajax, 
Pickering and Whitby. It also includes a vast urban-rural area 
known by some who have been in the House before as the 
Pickering airport lands or as the Seaton lands. It is growing 
rapidly and it is in many respects a microcosm of the future of 
Canada. It is one of the reasons it elected one of the youngest 
candidates, one of the youngest members of Parliament on the 
government benches. I am quite privileged to be able to perform 
in that capacity, but in order to understand a bit about the budget 
I had first to understand a bit about my riding.
<P>
	The budget starts the process of getting Canada working again 
to bring our economy from a position of stagnation to a position 
of growth. In previous years we have seen a neo-Conservative 
policy adopted by the government which preceded us. I believe 
the policy did much to hamper our understanding and 
appreciation that the economy around the world including 
Canada has changed fundamentally.
<P>
	The appreciation of that change has allowed us as a 
government to signal and to design a new way, a new approach 
and a new economy, an economy based on ideas, on innovation 
and on the recognition the government plays a very strong role 
in the maintaining, supporting and ensuring of an effective 
direction for economic viability.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2071"> 2071 </A></B>
<P>
	What Canada is about to undertake could otherwise be known 
as planning its own future. It could be known by some as being 
able to prepare ourselves as to where we want to go. A famous 
quoter from years ago made the following comment: ``If you 
do not know where you are going, chances are you are going 
to wind up somewhere else''. I would submit to the House that 
is precisely where Canada was until 1993 and until the budget 
more recently.
<P>
	In this economy we have seen the view that deficits are not as 
important as growth or jobs. I take a different view. In the 
country over the past few months we have seen the faces of many 
people who have lost their employment, businesses that have 
gone underground and companies that have simply shut down. 
That is no longer acceptable in this great land. We have designed 
a policy which we believe will help Canada not only renew itself 
but the people within it.
<P>
	People do not want to live on UI or welfare. Canadians want to 
work, to earn a living and to obtain the respect that having a job 
brings. They want to talk about the personal experiences they 
have in business, how to run one and how to maintain it in 
periods of difficulty.
<P>
	This is an area which the budget has addressed. It has 
recognized the importance of small business. My riding, 
perhaps unlike other ridings, has a higher number of people 
working in the private sector with small businesses, companies 
of 10, 15 or less. It is important for the government to appreciate 
the role it has in terms of access to capital. It is one of the 
reasons I commend the hon. Minister of Finance for his tenacity 
in ensuring that a code of conduct was instilled in the budget.
<P>
<B>(1755) </B>
<P>
	If we did not have such a code of conduct banks would be 
basically able to make suggestions as to where they were going 
to priorize their lending priorities and small businesses which 
are creating wealth in this economy would simply pack up and 
leave or go underground.
<P>
	In order to address the subject of the underground the budget 
focused on the GST. The finance committee has been charged 
with the task of amending or changing what is perceived as the 
most hated tax in modern times in Canadian history. We believe 
the GST if changed could help make a new economy. It could 
help make business work once again.
<P>
	Parliament has an obligation to the people of Canada to put 
forward some sound fiscal policies and to restore faith in our 
political institutions. We have a duty to reform Parliament and 
do away with the perks and privileges to which ordinary 
Canadians do not have access. We must be an example for 
Canadians. Parliament is in no position to ask Canadians to 
make sacrifices if it fails to practise what it preaches.
<P>
	That is one of the reasons as a younger member of Parliament 
I would certainly support an initiative at some point that would 
redress the great and grotesque imbalance Canadians rightly 
perceive between what is  taking place in the real world and what 
is taking place in the House of Commons.
<P>
	Ontario riding has a population of some 200,000. Its size is 
one of the most daunting tasks confronting me as a member of 
Parliament. It is not one I am prepared to take lightly. Daily we 
receive letters from all sorts of constituents addressing any 
number of issues at a given time. I do my best to respond to 
them.
<P>
	In the period leading up to the budget I noted two or three 
issues that the constituents of my riding asked me to ensure were 
taken into account by the Minister of Finance. The first was that 
there be no charge for the benefits of dental and health care. That 
is something the government delivered on. It listened, it acted, it 
delivered.
<P>
	Another area was to try to stimulate the housing industry 
through the use of RRSPs. I note that policy initiated by the last 
government on a temporary basis was actually a ripoff of the 
Liberal Party policy in 1988-89. It was a good policy then. I am 
pleased the government decided to adopt it on a temporary basis, 
but I am even more proud of the Liberal Party for deciding to 
make that permanent. It recognizes that the construction 
industry is not a simple cog in a wheel as far as this economic 
situation is concerned. It realizes it is one of the fundamental 
keys in our economic picture.
<P>
	The budget process is an ongoing additional budgetary 
measure that we should believe will be examined in the course 
of time. It should be brought forward in a few months to allow 
Canadians, certainly people in my riding, an opportunity to 
discuss its many important attributes.
<P>
	I am looking right now at an opportunity for my constituents 
with whom I have had an opportunity to discuss the budget last 
week to become more meaningfully involved in the overall 
decisionmaking not only of a member of Parliament but of the 
actual budgetary process. It is a great tribute to the government 
that it has taken upon itself the opportunity of ensuring there is 
before Parliament a chance for public input.
<P>
	Canada is benefiting as is my riding from the infrastructure 
program. Some $47 million has been allocated to my riding that 
will result in over 1,000 people being employed who might 
otherwise not have had an opportunity to work. I could put that 
into another perspective: a 1,000-job investment in 
infrastructure, sewer and water upgrades, will help the 
economy.
<P>
	I am pleased to support the budget. I thank the residents of 
Ontario for their support.
<P>
<B>(1800 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Charles Hubbard (Miramichi):</B> Mr. Speaker, I welcome 
this occasion to speak on the budget debate and the concerns of 
Miramichi riding in New Brunswick. Speaking in this Chamber 
on behalf of all my constituents is an honour, a privilege and a 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2072"> 2072 </A></B>
<P>
tremendous responsibility toward those people who elected me 
last October.
<P>
	For 15 years Maurice Dionne represented the Miramichi. I 
continue to rely on him for advice. The people of the Miramichi 
are indebted to Maurice for his tremendous efforts on their 
behalf. Last weekend I participated with the Rotary Clubs of 
Newcastle and Chatham in presenting Maurice with the Paul 
Harris award, the highest award in the world of Rotary.
<P>
	The Miramichi is a geographic expression, an identity and a 
free spirit that actually exists across this entire continent. It is a 
rural area that depends on its natural resources.
<P>
	From its early years people had to leave the area in order to 
seek employment. For generations the young people of the 
Miramichi migrated both westward and southward. Yes, during 
past generations the spirit of the Miramichi can be found in most 
Canadian provinces and many American states.
<P>
	Basically the Miramichi is a river that begins in the central 
highlands of New Brunswick and flows eastward into Miramichi 
Bay facing the province of Prince Edward Island. Its people for 
the most part live along the river valleys with the main river or 
one of its tributaries within sight of their homes. We speak of the 
Tabusintac, the Bartibog, the Black, the Napan, the North West, 
the Little South West, the Barnaby, the Renous, the Cains and 
other rivers.
<P>
	Newcastle and Chatham are two small towns. They are the 
business centres of our community. We also have seven 
incorporated villages. We are proud to have three native 
communities at Burnt Church, Eel Ground and Red Bank.
<P>
	Forestry, fishing, mining and agriculture are the main sectors 
of employment. Until last week CFB Chatham was one of our 
major employers.
<P>
	The Miramichi has traditionally been a Liberal riding. With 
one exception since World War II the riding has returned a 
Liberal member to this House. Within the region there is a 
strong tradition of faith in the principles of liberalism and a 
belief that the good times of the people in our area are best 
guided by those who support Liberal policies.
<P>
	A government represents the people. A budget is a plan by 
government for accumulating revenues and regulating 
expenditures. It is a plan that should bring the most good and the 
least pain to the many groups and individuals that make up the 
nation. It is a plan for sharing and a plan that must be fair. It is a 
plan that must balance the available resources with the needs of 
our people. Above all it must be a plan that maintains confidence 
in our economic system by both our own financial institutions 
and the international monetary community. It is my belief that 
the finance minister has walked the tightrope that balances these 
forces. This budget is a good beginning for our new government.
<P>
	I want to point out that we must not lose sight of the most 
important element required to turn our economy around: the 
need for our people to have the necessary confidence so that they 
will spend their money, they will invest in our nation and they 
will look in a positive manner at the economic future.
<P>
	There must be a demand in order for business to sell its 
products. This demand can only be created by the consumer 
wanting the goods and services of business and having the 
necessary moneys for their purchase.
<P>
	Our government must create an atmosphere where 
despondency does not exist, where gloom and doom are no 
longer the bywords of our people. It must be one where 
Canadians believe they are led by a government that has a vision 
and above all a determination to spend its resources prudently 
and in the best interests of all citizens.
<P>
	This budget calls on all Canadians to make sacrifices for the 
good of the nation. Atlantic Canada has been called upon to 
make sacrifices greater than any other area in Canada.
<P>
	The amendments to the UIC program will cause the people in 
our area to lose millions of dollars in payments. Those involved 
in fishing, forestry and the tourist sector will have difficulty 
obtaining the necessary work weeks in order to qualify for UIC. 
Those who do will be able to draw for a shorter period of time. 
The result is that many individuals who relied on this form of 
income support will be short in the moneys needed to provide 
for their families. The New Brunswick economy will lose an 
estimated $200 million in cash flow which affects every 
business in Atlantic Canada.
<P>
<B>(1805) </B>
<P>
	It is important therefore that the review of all social programs 
within the human resources development department must 
address this concern. It should define the status of work as we 
approach the 21st century.
<P>
	More than 150 years ago Great Britain had harsh labour laws, 
conditions that demanded tremendous sacrifice from men, 
women and children. Today we have reduced the weekly hours 
of work to 40, yet most households in the country require two 
wage earners to support their needs. In many cases teenagers 
have little time to enjoy the years of youth because they work 
part time while trying to complete their education.
<P>
	Will history see our present generation as an age where so 
much effort and so much time is required to support the needs of 
one's family? Or can we afford for our people on an equitable 
basis to reduce their work time and offer them more time for 
leisure, relaxation and recreation?
<P>

<P>

<P>
	The Miramichi has made another great sacrifice in this 
budget: the loss of Canadian Forces Base Chatham. The closure 
of this air base, which has been a part of our community for 
over 50 years, means the loss of 240 civilian jobs, nearly 700 
military ones and more than $50 million to our local economy.
<P>
	We all recognize that the Department of National Defence is 
being reduced and must be made more efficient. Unfortunately 
for the Miramichi this cutback is at a time when our pulp and 
paper industry is in recession and our mines at Heath Steele are 
closed due to low base metal prices.
<P>
	Therefore 1994 is a turning point in the future of our region. 
Our people are ready to meet the challenge of developing a new 
economy. However we will need full co-operation and 
assistance from both the federal and provincial governments.
<P>
	The Premier of New Brunswick, the Hon. Frank McKenna, is 
working hard to rebuild the Miramichi. As a member of the 
government I too will devote my energies in this direction so as 
to create a new future for our people.
<P>
	Canada must be represented throughout our nation. I strongly 
believe our government must be decentralized with the 
government departments and agencies spread across this 
country. If Canada is to survive all Canadians must be part of 
this great enterprise.
<P>
	Canada and the federal government must not be portrayed as a 
great bureaucracy located in Ottawa and several major cities. It 
must reach out to our nation and to all Canadians in every region 
of the country. They all must enjoy the fruits of their 
participation.
<P>
	Chatham, New Brunswick with its community college has 
assumed leadership in the electronic highway with distance 
education and multimedia learning. In this age of electronic 
communication any government department, provincial or 
federal, could easily be located in our constituency.
<P>
	In recent years the underground economy has been a major 
loss of revenue for both the federal and provincial governments. 
It is my belief that many Canadians have joined this economy 
because they believe our governments have been guilty of two 
serious offences: overtaxation and unwise and imprudent 
spending of their hard-earned dollars.
<P>
	As members of the 35th Parliament we together have an 
opportunity to correct the situation. It is important that each of 
us work with our constituents and with the civil servants of this 
country to see that moneys are not wasted and the people of 
Canada receive good value for their expenditures.
<P>
	Waste must be eliminated. Efficiency must be improved. 
Above all fairness and equity must be the order of the day. 
Everyone must realize that avoidance of taxes and misuse of 
funds is literally robbing one's  neighbour. It places a heavier 
burden upon those honest people who support the government.
<P>
	Civil service budgets must not be seen as an amount that must 
be spent but rather as a guideline that should not be exceeded 
and hopefully a measure that can offer savings. Those with 
philosophies that budgetary amounts must be exhausted by 
March 31 each year cannot be left in positions of responsibility.
<P>
	In October the people of Canada told us they wanted a new 
system, that they were tired, angry and frustrated by the 
methods, attitudes and behaviour of the former government.
<P>
<B>(1810 ) </B>
<P>
	This budget begins a new agenda. Members on all sides of the 
House have an opportunity to create a new type of government, a 
new atmosphere. Let us hope we can work together to improve 
our nation and everyone's tomorrow. We must not lose sight of 
our goals or we become waylaid by the bureaucracy that 
surrounds us.
<P>
	The challenge is great, but we can work together to achieve 
our goals.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Philip Mayfield (Cariboo-Chilcotin):</B> I am very 
pleased to stand with my Reform colleagues and take part in this 
debate and speak on behalf of the riding of Cariboo-Chilcotin.
<P>
	The Cariboo-Chilcotin constituency rises from the south of 
British Columbia to the high plateau of the central interior. Its 
approximately 103,000 square kilometres lie between the crest 
of the coast range mountains and Wells Gray Park.
<P>
	Cariboo-Chilcotin has long had the reputation of being one 
of the last frontiers. What newcomers today call highway 97 is 
still remembered as the old Cariboo wagon road. This was the 
route that was first designed in the last century by the Royal 
Engineers to carry the wagons of the miners to the gold fields 
and the ranchers and their families who opened up the country 
for the people living there today.
<P>
	Cariboo-Chilcotin is also home to the Chilcotin, Carrier and 
Shuswap aboriginal people. They are an integral part of the 
diverse cultural plurality found in this constituency today.
<P>
	Every year communities throughout Cariboo-Chilcotin 
celebrate their heritage. The city of Quesnel has its Billy Barker 
days. Williams Lake holds the Williams Lake stampede. 
Lillooet has ``Only in Lillooet'' days. The town of Barkerville 
has been restored to how it used to be in the old gold rush days. I 
could go on but suffice it to say the entire riding remembers our 
pioneers and celebrates the way of life these pioneers left for us 
to continue.
<P>
	Today the lumber industry has taken the economic lead. 
However the independent attitude, self-reliance and earthy 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2074"> 2074 </A></B>
<P>
frankness which characterize relations among 
Cariboo-Chilcotin people still continue and may it always be 
so.
<P>
	It gives me much satisfaction to reflect upon these people. 
Many people came to Cariboo-Chilcotin with nothing but the 
determination to get a job and get ahead. They are people who 
have prospered by their ingenuity, determination, shrewdness 
and hard work. Their independence and pride would not allow 
them to ask for special favours or special consideration.
<P>
	What these pioneers really wanted was the opportunity to 
prove their ability to make a life for themselves and their 
families. Many people came with nothing and discovered the 
life they sought.
<P>
	This is the Cariboo, this is the Chilcotin, this is my home.
<P>
	However high taxes and intrusions of big government are not 
making it easy for people looking for lifestyles based on 
independence and self-reliance. Mind you high taxes are giving 
a new meaning to these words. People blessed with ingenuity 
find ways around the obstacles that politicians and bureaucrats 
devise. If this is so in the sultry cities, consider how ingenuity 
thrives in the fresh air of the Cariboo.
<P>
	For example, a couple of weeks ago I was talking to a man 
who invests other people's money for them. From one small 
community in the constituency, population 10,000, he received 
in the month of January alone over $1 million of new money to 
convert to other currencies and invest in foreign countries. He 
went on to tell me that the rate of these receipts increased during 
the month of February. That is one investor in one small 
community.
<P>
	People have some ingenuity. If the government is determined 
to wreck the economy of our country, people who understand 
what is happening will use their ingenuity to do what is 
necessary to protect themselves.
<P>
	In 1993 Canadians bought a record $12.8 billion worth of 
foreign stocks and bonds. A growing number of Canadians are 
moving their assets out of Canada. Last year Canadians bought 
more foreign stock mutual funds than Canadian equity funds.
<P>
	This export of money from Canada is a major problem. It is a 
problem caused by fear, fear that our economy will go the same 
way the economy of New Zealand went. We are seeing the early 
signs in Canada, signs that were present 10 years ago in New 
Zealand. We can soon suffer the same consequences. Ten years 
ago New Zealand's foreign debt was the equivalent of 44 per 
cent of the GDP and its annual deficit was the equivalent of 9 per 
cent of the GDP. Suddenly, very suddenly, the foreign markets 
refused to buy New Zealand bonds.
<P>
	This shortage of revenue forced the devaluation of its 
currency by as much as 20 per cent as well as deep cuts in 
pensions, welfare and medicare. Accounts of wages being cut in 
half and a person's net worth being reduced by 80 per cent were 
commonplace.
<P>
	People taking their money out of Canada are afraid that soon 
the same thing could happen here. Government mismanagement 
of our debt is the leading cause of the present high conversion of 
our currency. Canadians fear equivalent losses as experienced in 
Sweden and New Zealand when deficits hit crisis levels. 
Outflow of Canadian money is preventing the economic 
expansion we require for our nation to prosper.
<P>
	We must take real steps to control the deficit, to assure the 
business community that Canada is a sound place to invest 
money.
<P>
	People from Cariboo-Chilcotin, like Canadians from every 
part of the country, are using great ingenuity and creativity in 
the development of the underground economy. The sad part of 
this growing phenomenon is that so many people feel that 
nothing immoral is being done even though it is illegal. Some 
even consider this means of tax avoidance a positive political 
statement as well as a means of economic survival. The impact 
of the underground economy renders any economic growth 
meaningless to federal revenues.
<P>
	During the 1980s a 1 per cent growth in GDP would result in a 
1.2 per cent increase in tax revenues. Now that same increase 
yields only .4 per cent growth. This budget is another example of 
a government depending on optimism to solve its economic 
woes.
<P>
	We have seen in the past the folly of a government depending 
on economic growth to increase revenues. This budget 
demonstrates that the government has not learned from past 
mistakes. With a half a trillion dollars debt Canada can no longer 
rely on optimism.
<P>
	The underground economy is now estimated by Ernst &amp; 
Young to be 15 per cent of the GDP or $100 billion annually. If 
this revenue could be taxed it would yield $40 billion in tax 
revenue, roughly the amount needed to eliminate our deficit.
<P>
	Michael Manford, chief economist of Scotia McLeod Inc., 
estimates these numbers are even higher with an annual 
underground economy growth rate of 10 per cent to 12 per cent.
<P>
	Canadians have expressed disappointment in the limited cuts 
made in this budget. The red book was part of a campaign based 
on a much lower deficit of only $35 billion. Canadians are 
demanding a balanced budget and the only means left to do this 
is by cutting government spending, not by increasing spending 
or by introducing new programs. The Government of Canada 
must show better judgment in the way tax dollars are spent.
<P>
	Cariboo-Chilcotin is populated mainly by people who left or 
whose ancestors left other places to seek opportunities, be 
independent and prosper. Like those immigrating to Canada 
today many of us have ancestors who came seeking relief from 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2075"> 2075 </A></B>
<P>
domineering and intrusive governments, governments which 
supplanted an agenda of serving the people with being served 
itself.
<P>
	I speak with great pride of Cariboo-Chilcotin but these 
people are simply a microcosm of our great country. Since 
coming to Ottawa I hear people in the stores and on the streets 
saying the same thing as I hear them saying at home. Wherever I 
go I hear a common message given: ``Get our taxes down. The 
taxes are killing us economically''.
<P>
	I do want to take this opportunity to applaud the Minister of 
Finance for some of the steps taken in the budget. For example, 
in the provisions made for small business he certainly has 
listened to some of their concerns. Indeed the fastest way to 
generate real economic activity is to lower taxes and give 
Canadians a reason to work. This is what was promised with the 
rollback in unemployment insurance premiums. We still need to 
target more areas of small business overtaxation and deal with 
those areas.
<P>
	I also commend the government for its common sense in 
making the home buyers' program a permanent feature. Since 
being elected I have received more mail from my constituents 
regarding this issue than any other subject. Home ownership is 
at the top of most people's priority list and this government 
initiative will certainly help.
<P>
	To get back to the issue of taxes, the most effective way to 
control the underground economy would be to offer a real 
decrease in taxes to all Canadians with the legislative promise of 
further decreases if participation in the underground economy 
drops and revenue goes up. As long as the underground economy 
continues to grow so will our deficit.
<P>
	We do need some services. Canadians acknowledge this and 
want them. No one will deny this fact. We want all Canadians to 
have health care, housing, food and all that is necessary for all of 
us to live well. Canadians should have every opportunity to 
supply these needs for themselves. Assistance must be available 
to those who cannot provide these necessities for themselves. 
However, these essentials should be provided on a short term 
basis only to those temporarily facing misfortune and on a long 
term basis only to those who are permanently disabled.
<P>
	To most Canadians it is not acceptable for the government to 
foster a way of life that stifles independence and self-reliance. 
Canadians must once again feel that their input into government 
decisions really counts. Often Canadians vote for the lesser of 
evils when they go to the polls. Hon. members opposite mistake 
this for an overwhelming mandate.
<P>
	When people's concerns are ignored by the government they 
stop participating in society. Some have given up on the political 
process and stopped voting. Even worse are those who have 
given up on the economic process and send their money abroad 
or participate in the underground economy.
<P>
	Canadians on the whole are not cheats and frauds, but right 
now they feel they are being forced to a survival mode under 
threat of losing their jobs, their homes and their way of life. 
They are tired of governments that ignore their concerns. When 
will the government realize that the people of Canada want less 
government interference and most of all want hard earned tax 
dollars spent wisely and frugally?
<P>
	Although the budget has some commendable features, the 
current government must realize that further action has to be 
taken to bring Canada's financial affairs under control.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> It being 6.15 p.m., 
pursuant to Standing Order 84(5), it is my duty to interrupt the 
proceedings and put forthwith every question necessary to

	<B>The Speaker:</B> When shall the bill be read the third time? By 
leave, now?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Martin (LaSalle-Émard)</B> moved that the bill be read 
the third time and passed.
<P>
	<B>Mr. David Walker (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Finance):</B> Mr. Speaker, it gives me great pleasure to speak on 
third reading of Bill C-3. Bill C-3 amends the 
Federal-Provincial Fiscal Arrangements and Federal 
Post-Secondary Education and Health Contributions Act. 
Essentially, Bill C-3 is about one thing, the renewal of the 
equalization program.
<P>
	As members of the House well know, equalization is of such 
over arching importance that the principle has been enshrined in 
the Constitution. The unique sense of Canadian sharing goes 
back to Confederation and shows that the Canadian federation 
works.
<P>
	In considering the renewal of equalization we on the 
government side have had to balance the need to provide 
provinces receiving equalization with the appropriate financial 
resources on the one hand and the need to be fiscally responsible 
on the other.
<P>
	I have no doubt that this bill does both. Equalization is 
projected to rise from $8 billion this year to $10.4 billion in 
1998-99. All seven provinces that receive equalization are 
expected to gain from these increases. Provinces currently 
eligible for equalization are Newfoundland, Prince Edward 
Island, Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, Quebec, Manitoba and 
Saskatchewan.
<P>
	Equalization is the most important federal transfer program 
for reducing disparities in provincial governments. Before 
equalization payments the revenue raising capacity of the seven 
recipient provinces is 85 per cent of the national level. After 
equalization it is roughly 93 per cent of the national average.
<P>
<B>(1900 ) </B>
<P>
	Let me now go through some of the details of Bill C-3.
<P>
	First, it is proposed that equalization be renewed for five 
years. Accompanying a five year renewal is a commitment by 
the government not to change the structure of the formula. This 
means that there will be greater certainty in budgetary planning 
for the provinces. This does not mean that all work on the 
equalization program will cease, rather ongoing work on 
measuring the revenue raising or fiscal capacity of the provinces 
will continue, as will research on the general structure of the 
program with a view to the needs of the next equalization 
renewal.
<P>
	Second, the equalization standard will be unchanged. The 
so-called five province standard measures the fiscal capacity of 
Quebec, Ontario, Manitoba, Saskatchewan and British 
Columbia.
<P>
	Third, as already mentioned, a ceiling will be retained.
<P>
	Fourth, the program floors will remain unchanged. The floor 
provides protection to the provinces against large year to year 
declines in equalization. The floor depends on provinces' 
revenue raising abilities, with the less well off equalization 
receiving provinces receiving the greatest protection.
<P>
	Fifth, a number of tax base changes to update the 
measurement of provinces' fiscal capacity will be introduced. 
This is critical in order to maintain the fairness of the program in 
measuring provinces' revenue raising abilities. For example, 
the recent decline in farmland values has particularly 
disadvantaged Saskatchewan, a technical update to the program 
calculations adjusts for this.
<P>
	Finally, the legislation contains a means to alleviate excessive 
reductions in equalization for provinces with specific and 
exceptionally large proportions of the tax base for certain 
natural resources. This will remove a long standing irritant to 
the provinces on this so-called tax back issue. This will enable 
provinces to retain 30 per cent of the revenues from the relevant 
natural resources rather than losing equalization on a dollar for 
dollar basis. This measure has been welcomed by the affected 
provinces.
<P>
	This is very fiscally responsible and I recommend its passage 
to the House.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Maurice Bernier (Mégantic-Compton-Stanstead):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to rise at this stage of consideration of 
Bill C-3, which was tabled by the government to renew the 
equalization payments program. This bill is yet another proof of 
the inefficiency and inequity of the federal system for the 
provinces, and particularly for Quebec.
<P>
	In principle, this program is basically designed to reduce 
financial disparities between the provinces. It is more than time 
to see if this objective has been reached. In the case of Quebec, 
our province is still penalized, in the long term, by such a 
redistribution of revenue. Of course, some will say that Quebec 
receives more than its share of federal transfers, but let us not 
forget the historical causes which put our province in this 
uncomfortable situation.
<P>
	Indeed, is it not strange that, since the implementation of 
equalization programs, the money given to Ontario was 
intended to cover structural expenditures such as investments in 
research and development, or infrastructure expenditures which 
have promoted a stable economic development for that 
province?
<P>
	All these measures have weakened Quebec's position and, to 
this day, even if our province's contribution still accounts for 
more than 23 per cent of Canadian wealth, it never gets its fair 
share when the federal government decides to distribute monies 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2078"> 2078 </A></B>
<P>
for structural investments.  The statistics are quite eloquent in 
that regard, and I want to mention a few.
<P>
	Between 1979 and 1989, Quebec's share of research and 
development was 18.5 per cent, while Ontario's was 50.1 per 
cent. Again, let us not forget that Quebec's contribution 
accounted for 23 per cent of Canada's wealth.
<P>
<B>(1905) </B>
<P>
	As far as federal investment is concerned, in recent years 
Quebec's share has been 15.4 per cent, with the remainder 
allocated outside Quebec. When we consider the value of 
infrastructures in the defence sector, the figures become even 
more revealing and damning, with Quebec receiving only 13 per 
cent of investments in this sector, compared with 25.8 per cent 
in Ontario, 34 per cent in the West and 27 per cent in the 
Maritimes.
<P>
	While we are on the subject of infrastructure, there is also the 
St. Lawrence Seaway which goes back at least 30 years, in which 
although it did provide opportunities for ports in Quebec to 
expand, also stimulated development of ports in Ontario and 
especially the development of the automobile industry in 
Southern Ontario.
<P>
	Meanwhile, Quebec was allocated funds for unemployment 
insurance and welfare benefits, symbols of a negative outlook 
for Quebec's economic development. As we have seen, the 
difference in fiscal capacity between Ontario and Quebec 
continues to exist, despite supposedly generous equalization 
payments to Quebec.
<P>
	As a result, Quebec has become increasingly dependant on 
federal transfer payments, because its unemployment situation 
has always been worse than Ontario's. For decades, 
unemployment in Quebec has always been from 3 per cent to 5 
per cent higher than in Ontario. It was a situation bound to 
please those who favoured authoritarian federalism.
<P>
	Bill C-3 provides that the ceiling on equalization payments 
will not be abolished but extended for a period of five years. 
However, this measure negates the very principle of 
equalization by failing to provide for equitable redistribution of 
Canada's wealth. In a particularly underhanded way, it will 
actually reduce transfers to the provinces, and Quebec will again 
be stuck with paying most of the bill.
<P>
	If the rate of growth of the GNP reaches 5 or 6 per cent a year, 
as predicted by our very optimistic Minister of Finance, that is 
under the best possible assumption, Quebec will suffer a loss of 
$900 million, or 60 per cent of the planned $1.5 billion reduction 
in transfer payments, solely as a result of freezing the ceiling for 
the next five years. That is the perverse effect of this bill.
<P>
	Once more, the federal government is passing the buck in 
terms of the deficit to the provinces by giving Quebec and other 
provinces less money while their citizens require the same level 
of services. It means that they will have to raise taxes.
<P>
	I can already imagine what the members opposite are going to 
say. They are going to say loudly that the critics from the 
Official Opposition are exclusively motivated by crass 
sovereigntist-if not separatist-intentions, since it seems that 
last week the Prime Minister learned that the Official 
Opposition intended to pull Quebec out of the Canadian 
federation.
<P>
<B>(1910) </B>
<P>
	Let us come back to Bill C-3. The Quebec minister of finance 
and Premier Johnson form the most federalist pair imaginable; 
yet even that minister of finance could not help but make some 
negative comments on the bill dealing with equalization 
payments. Naturally, as a good champion of Canadian unity, 
Minister Bourbeau said that he was generally satisfied with the 
results of the Federal-Provincial Conference of Finance 
Ministers held in Montreal last January. However, Minister 
Bourbeau made some negative comments on this bill. His 
criticisms take on a very special significance since Mr. 
Bourbeau is member of a Quebec Liberal Cabinet which was 
ready, as we saw with the Charlottetown Accord, to accept any 
shady deal to save a semblance of Canadian unity.
<P>
	So, that was what the Quebec minister of finance told us in a 
press release dated January 21. We can consider that that 
declaration is still in order today. The minister said, and I quote: 
``However, I have a hard time accepting that the federal 
government decided to maintain the ceiling on equalization 
payments''. If the Quebec minister of finance, who is definitely 
a federalist, declares that that decision is hard to swallow, that 
means it is simply ridiculous and unacceptable to the population 
of Quebec.
<P>
	With this ceiling, we are moving away from the aim inscribed 
in the Constitution, which is to give provinces enough revenues 
to be able to provide quality public services based on more or 
less comparable taxation systems from one province to another.
<P>
	It is always surprising to hear a Quebec minister, and a keen 
partisan of federalist orthodoxy, declaring himself satisfied 
with a provision that moves away from one of the major aims of 
the Canadian Constitution. But the contradiction did not end 
there, and the Quebec finance minister, as we saw recently, will 
not let a contradiction stop him.
<P>
	Indeed, the minister went on to say in the same release: 
``Property taxes are the second largest source of revenue used to 
calculate equalization payments, and Quebec's fiscal capacity 
in that area is clearly overestimated, which results in a serious 
shortfall in that regard. For the Quebec government, the fact that 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2079"> 2079 </A></B>
<P>
we have to wait for five years before this standard of fiscal 
capacity is significantly improved is hard to swallow''.
<P>
	How can anybody claim to be pleased with a measure that is so 
detrimental to him? The answer is quite simple and is matter of 
common sense. Everybody knows the perfectly legitimate 
position of the Quebec finance minister and his government on 
the preservation of federal ties. Everybody knows as well that a 
general election is looming in Quebec and the provincial 
government has nothing to gain from a confrontation with a 
newly elected federal government, and a Liberal one at that.
<P>
	Not too many people are pleased with Bill C-3. One positive 
proof that sovereignists are not the only ones to condemn the 
ceiling on equalization payments is the declaration of the 
Manitoba deputy minister of finance, Mr. Newman, who 
recently said to the Standing Committee on Finance, right here 
in Ottawa:
<P>
<B>(1915) </B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	``The proposed ceiling on equalization payments violates the 
spirit and intent of the Constitution. Continued application of 
the ceiling is unwarranted and detrimental to Canadians living 
in the less affluent provinces''.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	If you combine the principle of transfer payments to 
provinces with the various discretionary powers of the federal 
government, as is the case presently, you get a result which is 
particularly bad for Quebec.
<P>
	Let us see what happens: first, in order to finance programs 
which, in many instances, are of provincial jurisdiction, the 
federal government levies taxes on Canadian and Quebec 
taxpayers. Then that same federal government creates 
supposedly national standards which everyone from coast to 
coast must observe. This is pure and simple interference in 
provincial affairs, and such interference is especially 
unacceptable, even indecent, when the federal government 
reduces its own contribution to programs while maintaining 
national standards that provinces must keep on respecting.
<P>
	In other words, the federal government is asking the 
provinces to maintain the same level of services while giving 
them less money to do so. That is exactly what happened in 
Quebec in the health and post-secondary education sectors, 
which are still exclusively provincial jurisdictions, according to 
the Constitution of Canada. Between 1977 and 1993, the federal 
government's share for the provision of these two programs was 
cut from 47 to 34 per cent of total costs.
<P>
	Then this same federal government told Quebec that it was 
going to keep on taxing the province more and more, as shown in 
the finance minister's recent budget speech, to fund both these 
programs. But it was going to give Quebec less money to 
provide services to its people. If you call such transfer payments 
fair, I do not know what fairness is!
<P>
	In the health care area, while the federal government was 
continuously decreasing its share of contributions, it compelled 
the provinces to abide by health standards it had set. Quebec is 
not getting greater control over its health care system, it is 
getting the power to cut without being able to decide where to 
cut. Another one of the great inequities of the present system of 
transfer payments to the provinces can be found in established 
programs financing, under which the federal government comes 
and takes money from Quebecers to implement national 
programs according to Canadian standards, even though they do 
not always fit the Quebec reality.
<P>
	The distinct society is much more than a hollow formula 
which emerged one day out of a lake that was the scene of a 
so-called constitutional agreement-the distinct society is, for 
believers, and we are among those, much more than that; it 
means also that Quebecers are a nation and that their specificity 
is rooted in a very real social and political situation.
<P>
<B>(1920) </B>
<P>
	A nation draws its sense of identity from the values shared by 
its people. Its programs and infrastructures should be based on 
these values, which should also be reflected in government 
programs which will determine people's standard of living. 
Quebecers have come to identify less and less with the standards 
imposed on them by the federal government. For its part, the 
government still refuses to recognize Quebecers' 
distinctiveness.
<P>
	Let me give one example which the Minister of Health herself 
used in this House a while ago. I am talking about the network of 
local community service centres, or CLSCs, which Quebec 
established without the help or advice of the federal 
government. This network was set up in the early 1970s and the 
minister cited it as a model for service delivery. This mechanism 
which allows Quebecers to benefit from health care and social 
services right in their own community was fully developed and 
funded by Quebecers.
<P>
	The Bloc Quebecois advocates radical changes to improve 
federal transfer programs to the provinces. By carrying out 
small sectoral program reforms, the federal government is 
manipulating the figures and pushing through changes which are 
not in the best interest of the provinces. As we have seen with the 
recent budget, the budget which is now before us, on the one 
hand, the government is slashing $2 billion from established 
programs financing in the area of post-secondary education and 
the Canada Assistance Plan, while on the other hand, it is 
maintaining the ceiling on equalization payments, despite the 
resulting inequity that I described earlier. All this just to confuse 
people and to make believe that the federal transfer payments 
system has been upgraded, when it is not so.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2080"> 2080 </A></B>
<P>
	The Bloc Quebecois is strongly opposed to Bill C-3, which 
renews-
<P>
	<B>Mr. Milliken:</B> It is unbelievable!
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bernier (Mégantic-Compton-Stanstead):</B> Yes, and I 
repeat it, it is opposed to Bill C-3 which renews the ceiling on 
equalization payments, a measure which, I want to remind you, 
means a loss of 900 million dollars for Quebec and perpetuates 
the federal government's tradition of unloading its problems on 
the provinces.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stephen Harper (Calgary West):</B> Mr. Speaker, before I 
discuss Bill C-3, the bill to renew the equalization provisions of 
fiscal transfers for the next five years, I would like to thank the 
government for allowing us to have this debate tonight.
<P>
	Originally the government had wanted to discuss this bill on 
Friday when I and the critic for the Bloc would be unable to 
attend. We were able to reach an agreement to debate this bill 
this evening. I say that in all sincerity in spite of the fact that I 
will oppose the bill. I will also express some concerns about the 
process not so much on this bill but the general process followed 
in reviewing such pieces of legislation.
<P>
	As I have indicated my party opposes the bill. I want to take 
the time tonight to reiterate the nature of that opposition and 
also to review concerns about the process of discussion and 
debate used here in deciding some of these matters.
<P>
	Our party does support some elements of this bill and it is 
important to indicate that. We support for example the concept a 
ceiling. It is important for anybody who is serious about fiscal 
responsibility and the nature of the problems we find ourselves 
in to not have a situation where the federal government finds 
itself liable for open-ended transfer payments. That certainly 
could be the case without some kind of a ceiling.
<P>
<B>(1925) </B>
<P>
	We also support the concept in this bill of some kind of 
compensation for excessive tax back of unique resource sources 
in the equalization formula.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	While making these remarks, I would also like to say that the 
position of my party is not that of the Bloc Quebecois or that of 
the member from Mégantic-Compton-Stanstead. Despite his 
well-thought out remarks, our views are totally different.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	I would like to take a few minutes to mention those 
differences in perspectives. As a party we support the concept of 
equalization. I would point out to all here that the concept of 
equalization is embedded as a principle in the Constitution Act, 
1982, which our party recognizes and which we believe all 
provinces of Canada are part of. I understand that is a very 
different position from that of the Bloc Quebecois.
<P>
	I also want to point out that in spite of whatever shortcomings 
this bill or other federal programs may have, this particular 
program is very generous to the province of Quebec. This has 
come up before. This year roughly $3.8 billion of the $8.4 
billion spent under this program will be directed to the 
Government of Quebec, none to the Government of Alberta and 
none to the Government of British Columbia. While there may 
be shortcomings in the bill it is important to acknowledge that. 
All Canadians should acknowledge the importance of these 
transfers not only symbolically but in dollar terms.
<P>
	I also point out, although we will get into this debate at a later 
date, that the Bloc Quebecois at some point is going to have to 
address more seriously than it has its support for independence 
and opposition to the Constitution Act on the one hand and its 
apparent love for some of these social programs and some of this 
spending on the other. In spite of the considered words of my 
friend there is a contradiction in not liking Canada and having 
such great love of the Canadian dollar. However we will discuss 
that at a later date.
<P>
	The nature of our opposition is primarily the expenditure size 
involved and the fact we are making enormous commitments 
without proposals for comprehensive reform in this area. Our 
zero in three plan had called for reductions in the area of 
equalization as part of some fairly small reductions over all to 
the level of transfers to the provinces.
<P>
	I note with this program even with the ceiling that the 
projected growth rates for equalization are about 5 per cent per 
year. That is very high in comparison with the expected rate of 
growth for spending on federal programs generally. It is 
certainly higher than most programs which involve federal 
transfer payments to the provinces. The cost of the equalization 
program will grow from $8.4 billion to about $10.4 billion over 
the five year period, fiscal years 1995 through 1999.
<P>
	On top of that we are making these kinds of commitments in 
the absence of a comprehensive reform proposal. This bill was 
tabled and second reading debate occurred before the tabling of 
the budget, before the infamous red ink book.
<P>
	We know the federal government in making this 
announcement reiterated its commitment to federal transfer 
programs. It implied as it had during the election that it would 
never consider cuts to social programs or to federal transfers. 
However the budget revealed that despite the renewal of this 
particular program, the renewal of the current dollar levels, 
there were going to be planned cuts in transfer payments in other 
areas, some of which we do not particularly support.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>

<B><A NAME="2081"> 2081 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1930) </B>
<P>
	I note, for example, the budget talks about additional caps to 
the Canada assistance plan that would kick in the 1995-96 fiscal 
year. We would begin to limit spending in absolute dollar terms 
to the level of 1994-95 combined with established programs 
financing for post-secondary education. In 1996-97 the 
combined total of CAP and EPF post-secondary will not be 
allowed under the budget to exceed spending for those two 
programs combined in 1993-94.
<P>
	This raises the spectre of something I think has been missed in 
much analysis of the budget, that is planned expenditure 
reduction by the government in the area of post-secondary 
education which is not a target that we deficit cutters have 
specified. We certainly have not found support in the country for 
making that a priority for reduction.
<P>
	It is very funny that while we advocate some cuts in our plan 
the government is saying it is renewing this program. It is 
planning cuts to transfer payments to the provinces but there is 
no particular plan for any kind of comprehensive reform or 
rationale.
<P>
	This is interesting considering that debate on the bill both at 
second reading and in committee has raised the fact that there 
needs to be such an examination in the case of equalization as 
well as in the case of other transfer programs. Generally 
speaking there is a lack of clarity on the objectives and the 
operations of the equalization program.
<P>
	The hon. member for Lethbridge pointed out during second 
reading and in committee that if the formula created equity in 
federal programs, if we had equalization for that purpose, why 
would we then support in a number of ways special funding over 
and above this that recognized have not provinces in particular 
programs in other areas? I think, for example, of the 
infrastructure program, RRAP or the cap on CAP in the case of 
the have provinces. There is definitely a duplication of efforts 
and clear objectives.
<P>
	As well there are problems that go back to the very beginning 
of equalization. Professor Tremblay of the University of 
Montreal pointed out to the finance committee in his 
presentation the original economic justifications for programs 
like equalization based on economic deficits and surpluses 
created by the system of tariff payments in the country. Those 
things are now obsolete, particularly with the implementation of 
free trade. That is not to say the program is unnecessary but the 
original economic justification of the program has been 
eclipsed.
<P>
	Important questions were raised not only by Professor 
Tremblay but by other people in committee and at second 
reading: the impacts of equalization on regional dependency and 
on structural unemployment and whether it prevents natural 
adjustment to market forces and outward migration of 
population from areas with low income potential.
<P>
	These are all very important questions. We are undergoing an 
examination in certain federal programs-unemployment 
insurance and welfare-of the effects of these programs on 
individuals and the restructuring of incentives. It certainly 
would be appropriate to undertake a similar study here on the 
effects of these programs on large governments both provincial 
as well as municipal.
<P>
	The government in its defence of the bill has said that it now 
requires certainty in the area of federal transfer payments to the 
provinces, in particular certainty on the equalization formula. 
This is one reason it is anxious to support it and one reason 
government members gave for supporting it.
<P>
	I would point out to the Chair that in the course of our 
committee hearing one government representative we did hear 
from, Mr. Neumann of the Intergovernmental Affairs Office of 
Manitoba, indicated considerable doubt about that as the 
previous speaker from the Bloc indicated. There is not 
unanimous provincial agreement with this particular approach. 
Governments are expressing some doubt about the issue of 
certainty. Mr. Neumann had indicated over and above his 
concerns about the ceiling, which I do not share, that some 
particulars in the calculations lend themselves to uncertainty 
about future receipts and that we should be examining those 
sorts of things. Of course we did not.
<P>
<B>(1935) </B>
<P>
	There are other specifics that are difficult with this. This bill 
leaves on an indefinite basis choices between two different 
kinds of equalization options for certain Atlantic provinces. We 
continue to have inequities in the equalization formula. They are 
well documented.
<P>
	The treatment of natural resource revenues can be very 
different depending whether they are owned by crown 
corporations or private enterprise. The formula is extremely 
complex, difficult to understand and administer. On top of that, 
the formula does not use any kind of standard measures of fiscal 
capacity. It is a very unique formula developed only for this type 
of transfer and once again, there is no particularly clear 
rationale, at least to myself and to others I have talked to, 
between the particulars of the program and the objectives of the 
equalization program.
<P>
	I have tried to lay out not only our general objection to the 
cost but also the fair range of issues that this bill really provoked 
both at second reading and in committee. I point this out because 
this is my first time as a new parliamentarian being a critic for a 
particular piece of legislation and being part of the system and 
seeing how it works.
<P>
	We had the debate here. We went to committee with these 
bills. Points were made in the committee by members of the 
<P>

<B><A NAME="2082"> 2082 </A></B>
<P>
opposition in both parties in opposition to the bill. Points were 
made, concerns were raised about the bill and about the 
philosophy of the bill by witnesses who appeared before the 
committee.
<P>
	What was quite interesting to me was that the government 
members, generally speaking, who engaged in debate here and 
who talked in committee generally made no effort or only the 
most minimal effort to refute or to comment on any of the points 
raised.
<P>
	I am not trying to be critical of any individual but the general 
defence of the bill offered by government members was 
certainty. The other was that equalization is about sharing and 
sharing is good, therefore let us pass the bill.
<P>
	With that kind of orientation, we proceeded to pass the bill. 
We had two committee hearings and then proceeded to move to 
clause by clause, somewhere between 30 seconds and a minute, 
sums of money totalling $45 billion to $50 billion over the next 
few years.
<P>
	I suppose an option available to myself or to members of the 
Bloc Quebec or other members of the Reform Party or perhaps 
any member would be to endlessly filibuster the bill, to bring 
speakers forward, to continue to raise these points in committee 
and in the House.
<P>
	I follow our leader's example on this. There is no point saying 
that one is going to practise economy in government if one 
cannot practise economy in words. I am not interested in 
endlessly filibustering this bill but surely the point of the 
process is that we do an examination and even if we do not reach 
agreement that we at least sharpen our arguments so that we can 
better rationalize this bill.
<P>
	Of course this does not happen because in our system with the 
pattern we have fallen into of government confidence on every 
motion and lack of free votes, the issue becomes not the 
substance of legislation but simply what party one belongs to.
<P>
	Unlike in other legislatures, for example in the Congress of 
the United States, the one closest to us, it is unnecessary for us 
as individual members to defend or explain our position on 
pieces of legislation, even pieces of legislation that we are 
personally responsible for. All we have to know is that the 
government voted for it. If one is a government member, they 
had to support it.
<P>
	That disappoints me. I am not suggesting that there are not 
members of the government who do not understand the 
equalization bill or who could not give good defences of this 
piece of legislation but this certainly did not transpire in the 
debates that I was involved in.
<P>
	Why are we rushing this? This has all occurred very quickly. 
The bill was tabled before the budget. The government 
originally wanted it through committee around budget time. It 
certainly wants the bill through this House and has our limited 
co-operation to do so because as I say we are not interested in 
endless filibustering. It wants the bill through the House by 
March 31. Why? Because the program is slated to kick in on 
April 1 and is to go for so many years. In spite of the fact that we 
do not really have full provincial agreement this decision has 
been taken.
<P>
	The bill had only been debated or on the order paper for a 
couple of weeks when I was contacted by Professor Boothe of 
the University of Alberta who has written extensively on federal 
transfer programs to the provinces. He would have liked to have 
said something on this but the committee hearings were done 
before he was aware we had a bill.
<P>
	Why does this occur? This kind of rush occurs not because 
there is any real necessity or that there will be any collapse of 
the federal-provincial system if we do not pass this bill by 
March 31. It is because there is an attitude of the government, an 
attitude passed over from Parliaments in the past, that this 
process is a formality. This is a rubber stamp. It does not matter 
the sums of money that are involved, the objective is to pass it. 
In fact the decisions have been rendered in the executive. They 
were rendered in some other forum and there is no particular 
need to become knowledgeable only to get it through and maybe 
we will defend it at the next election.
<P>
	These kinds of things concern me. I do not make these 
criticisms of the bill or of the process here as attacks on any 
particular government member or even on this government. This 
is the pattern of legislative process that we have fallen into in 
this country. It does not work. It is how we got ourselves into the 
kind of financial mess we have in this country.
<P>
	I remind members once again that in many, many areas of 
public policy we spend more money than just about every 
country in the world, whether it is on education or health or 
unemployment insurance, transfer payments to lesser levels of 
government or whatever. We are spending as much or more than 
our competitors. The results are simply not comparable to what 
is required to compete in the international marketplace.
<P>
	I think I have said my piece on that, Mr. Speaker. As I said, we 
anticipate the bill will pass. We oppose it on principle and will 
oppose it on division.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Is the House ready for the

House to adopt the motion?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> On division.
<P>
	(Bill read the third time and passed.)
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> It being 7.40 p.m. this 
House stands adjourned until tomorrow at 10 a.m. pursuant to
