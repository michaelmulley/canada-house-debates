	<B>Mr. Raymond Bonin (Nickel Belt, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to draw the attention of the House to a unique Canadian 
scientific initiative in my riding of Nickel Belt which will soon 
help unlock the secrets of our universe.
<P>
	Sixty-four hundred feet underground in Inco's Creighton mine in 
the town of Walden, the finishing touches are being added to a 
neutrino observatory. Underground and shielded from cosmic rays, 
the observatory will study neutrinos, small particles emitted from 
the centre of the sun. The results could very well change our 
understanding of the universe and the very foundations of physics.
<P>
	The observatory represents an international consortium made of 
Canadian governments, the U.S., the United Kingdom, universities 
and Inco Limited. It is a model of how governments and the private 
sector can partner to achieve great things. It is also a partnership 
led by Canadians.
<P>
	I wish to extend my congratulations to all the contributors and in 
particular to Inco for showing us once again that mining in Canada 
is on the cutting edge-

	<B>Mr. Dale Johnston (Wetaskiwin, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, take back 
the street rallies are becoming all too common in cities and towns 
across Canada. From the east coast to  the west coast, Canadians 
are calling on the government to get tough with convicted 
criminals.
<P>
	The years of lenient sentences, pampered prisoners and lax 
parole laws that favour offenders' rights over victims must end. 
Too many innocent lives have been snuffed out because this Liberal 
government is stuck in neutral.
<P>
	Respondents to my recent householder demanded a return to law 
and order. Canadians want a say on capital punishment through a 
binding referendum. People want justice put back in the justice 
system.
<P>
	Canadians are sending a wake-up call to the Minister of Justice. 
If he does not respond quickly, the voters will ensure that he and his 
colleagues are on this side of the House after the next election and 
will be watching a Reform government implement the changes that 
they were afraid to make.

<P>
	This week Jean Swanson, president of the National Anti-Poverty 
Organization and Guy Caron, chairperson of the Canadian 
Federation of Students, have launched in Ottawa a National Fast 
for Fairness co-ordinated by the Action Canada Network.
<P>
	Their fast, joined and supported by people across Canada, 
including churches, universities, food banks and union locals, 
draws attention to the CHST and the devastating impact it will have 
on people's lives, our economy and our vision of Canada.
<P>
	New Democrats join our voices in calling for national programs 
with national standards and adequate funding and in supporting the 
alternative federal budget.

personal leadership on this profoundly important issue.

rise today to extend my heartfelt congratulations to President 
Gosnell and the Nisga'a people on the signing of the agreement in 
principle this past Friday. Our colleague, the Minister of Indian 
Affairs and Northern Development, is also to be congratulated for 
his important role in seeing this historic moment to fruition.
<P>
	Those who know the history of this agreement know that it is 
long overdue. The Nisga'a have been turned away too many times 
by too many governments for too many years.
<P>
	The signing marks the end of 20 years of negotiations, two 
decades at the negotiating table watching federal and provincial 
governments come and go. For the Nisga'a this has been going on a 
lot longer than 20 years. The Nisga'a people have been working at 
this for over 100 years, quietly, patiently, with dignity and 
persistence.
<P>
	The time is long overdue. Our government has a chance to 
change history and we will do so.

	<B>Mr. Robert Bertrand (Pontiac-Gatineau-Labelle, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, last month, Pontiac made headlines across the 
country. The mayors of the Pontiac regional county municipality 
had decided to consider a motion proclaiming the territorial 
integrity of the Pontiac RCM, should the yes side win the next 
referendum.
<P>
	In the end, on February 16, the Pontiac RCM mayors signed a 
joint statement asking: ``That the Prime Minister of Canada, 
provincial and territorial premiers spare no effort to reach a 
compromise eliminating the option that would result in altered 
territorial borders''.
<P>
	The next day, a local paper ran an article under the headline 
``Sixteen Pontiac Mayors in Favour of Secession''. This catchy title 
in no way reflected the content of the Pontiac mayors' final 
statement, and I question the real purpose of such statements.

so many hardworking volunteers who organized this event, 
Edmonton was a showcase to the world.
<P>

<P>
	All programs were sold out and the economic impact to the city 
of Edmonton was over $40 million. The figure skating 
championships had a huge television audience with over one

<P>
	I also want to take this opportunity to congratulate Shae-Lynn 
Bourne and Victor Kraatz for a fantastic performance which won a

anniversary.
<P>
	The Mascouche board of trade has managed to stay the course 
and reach full maturity. Through hard work, efforts, motivation, 
and perseverance, its members, headed by Richard Boies, have 
shown their ability to help businesses.
<P>
	Success in business requires a great deal of consultation and 
flexibility on the part of individuals, who must join forces to 
succeed. In these difficult economic times, we must recognize the 
need to work together and merge our energies to reach our goals.
<P>

	<B>Mr. Bob Ringma (Nanaimo-Cowichan, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, a 
preliminary agreement has been signed transferring a B.C. highway 
to the Nisga'a people.
<P>
	Given the number of conflicts that have arisen in both British 
Columbia and Quebec these past few years around road access, 
signing this agreement with the Nisga'as sets a precedent that will 
be a source of conflict and will cause more roadblocks to be 
erected.
<P>
	Thus far, the Bloc Quebecois has been supportive of the 
agreement with the Nisga'a. However, if a similar agreement were 
negotiated in Quebec, they would have a problem with that and 
would probably not go along with it. Why does the Minister of 
Indian Affairs support this irresponsible precedent and how can the 
Bloc be in favour?
<P>
	The Bloc has supported every major government initiative 
regarding aboriginal people outside Quebec.  Interestingly enough,

Speaker, I am pleased to announce that the Valley Regional 
Hospital in my riding of Annapolis Valley-Hants is leading the 
way in health care reform in Nova Scotia.
<P>
	The Valley Regional Hospital will be the first in the province to 
come under the jurisdiction of one of our four new regional health 
boards. These boards were established as part of last year's 
provincial health reforms.
<P>
	Since its inception in 1904, the Valley Regional Hospital has had 
a distinguished history. This new designation does not represent the 
end of an era but is one more example of how the hospital has 
always responded positively to change.
<P>
	I would like to take this opportunity to congratulate the 
tremendous contribution of retiring director Peter Mosher, to Betty 
Mattson, the hospital's new acting general manager, the staff and

	<B>Mrs. Madeleine Dalphond-Guiral (Laval Centre, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, on March 25, Greece celebrated 175 years of 
independence. It was on March 25, 1821 that the Greek people 
started their struggle to regain their independence after 500 years 
of Turkish domination. Their sense of identity as a people enabled 
them to set off on this difficult journey that required tenacity, 
courage and above all solidarity.
<P>
	The people of Greece-birthplace of western civilisation, 
especially in the fields of arts and science-were oppressed by the 
Ottoman Empire for hundreds of years without ever losing sight of 
their quest for independence.
<P>
	Today, we salute the Greek people, who, through their 
determination, succeeded in regaining their freedom and their 
place in the world community. We share with Quebecers and 
Canadians of Greek origin the well-deserved pride of Greece for 
achieving its freedom and sovereignty.

	<B>Ms. Judy Bethel (Edmonton East, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
premier of Alberta mistakenly subscribes to the notion that 
meetings of provincial premiers are the best means of defining 
change to our Confederation.
<P>
	The premier of Alberta calls the premier of Quebec a great 
Canadian. Why? Because he needs his support to grant federal 
powers and erode national standards. He does this without 
consultation, without the consent of any Albertan but himself and 
perhaps his cabinet.
<P>
<B>(1410)</B>
<P>
	What about the great Canadians who live and work in Alberta, 
those who have positive and constructive suggestions for the 
renewal of our Confederation? Does he value what they think? 
Does he even ask what they think?
<P>
	The most powerful message that I have heard from Albertans is 
that there is a need to be inclusive, to fully involve the people of 
Alberta. It is their collective wisdom that will build bridges of 
accommodation and understanding between people, provinces and 
regions.

	<B>Mr. Nick Discepola (Vaudreuil, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
Montreal Botanical Garden recently inaugurated its new facilities, 
built at a cost of $22.3 million.
<P>
	The work done includes the renovation of the administrative 
buildings, the construction of a new complex for visitors, and the 
refitting of the laboratories. The new additions and the modernized 
existing facilities will definitely increase the potential of the 
botanical garden and the interest that it generates among tourists, in 
Quebec and abroad.
<P>
	Last year, the garden welcomed over one million visitors and the 
economic spinoffs greatly helped Montreal's economy. The 
Canadian government invested $5.7 million in this partnership 
initiative with the Quebec government, the City of Montreal and 
the Université de Montréal.
<P>
	This shows once again that such partnerships between the 
governments of Canada and Quebec are the best way to ensure the 
economic recovery of the Montreal region.

	<B>Mr. Michel Daviault (Ahuntsic, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
economy of the Montreal region is currently undergoing a major 
crisis. The unemployment rate is alarming, 48,000 jobs were lost 
between the months of November and January, and the 
unemployment insurance reform is forcing more and more people 
to turn to on social assistance.
<P>
	What is the federal government doing to correct this 
unacceptable situation? Nothing. The mayor of Montreal, Mr. 
Bourque, came to Ottawa to ask for federal assistance. He went 
home empty handed. Minister Stéphane Dion wants to divide 
Montreal into small blocks, while the Minister of Human 
Resources Development calls the unemployed lazy people and 
agitators.
<P>
	Montrealers are still waiting for the jobs promised by the Liberal 
Party during the election campaign. So far, they only got cuts in 
social programs, in the UI program and in the transfer payments to 
the provinces. The Liberal government's performance regarding 
Montreal is a real shame.

once again the justice minister fiddles while victims of crime burn. 
And the smouldering anger felt by victims' families is spreading 
like wildfire across other groups concerned about justice.
<P>
	When will the justice minister wake up to the overwhelming 
demands to repeal section 745? Even when the public protest 
spreads to the grassroots of his own party, he insists on talking 
about weak-kneed amendments.
<P>
	Yesterday the Canadian Police Association smoked him out on 
his use of convoluted logic to defend his foot dragging. The CPA 
also joined Reform in demanding a complete repeal of section 745. 
Amendments will not do.
<P>

this minister is stubborn as a rock, even when in the minority in 
public opinion, among victims groups, with police, even in the

<P>
	The <I>Bluenose</I>, launched in Lunenburg in my riding of South

industry in my riding. The lumber mills, blacksmiths, shipwrights, 
sailors, fishermen and all those who either helped to build her 
decks or worked upon them are the very roots of our heritage and 
our communities.
<P>
	The <I>Bluenose</I> is not only a legend on the South Shore, she is 
known the world over as one of the greatest sailing ships of all

cargo carrying schooner as well as her prowess as a racing vessel 
have marked her place. She continues to be celebrated on 
something each of us carries with us every day, the dime.
<P>
	It is important that we recognize Canada's seafaring history and 
make it a part of our national identity. Nova Scotians will salute 
this vital part of our heritage this year by celebrating the Year of the 
Wooden Boat. We must hold on to the memory of this great 
national icon for generations of Canadians to come.

<P>
<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="FEESFORMARINESERVICES">FEES FOR MARINE SERVICES</A></H3>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, over the years the federal government has made a number 
of decisions that have had a negative  impact on the economic 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1287"> 1287 </A></B>
<P>
development of Quebec. I would remind you, if I may, of the 
Borden line, which in the early 1960s literally killed the 
petrochemical industry in east Montreal, and the more recent 
decision to build Mirabel airport, which did considerable harm to 
Montreal's air traffic and is currently causing problems the federal 
government is washing its hands of. Now, once again, the federal 
government is getting ready to impose a unilateral decision with 
the potential of disastrous consequences for all of the ports along 
the St. Lawrence.
<P>
	My question for the Prime Minister is as follows: Are the federal 
government's proposals to first of all divide Canada into two main 
maritime regions, east and west, and then to subdivide the east into 
three parts-the Atlantic ports, the St. Lawrence ports and the 
Great Lakes ports-not likely to isolate the St. Lawrence ports and 
to place them in a delicate situation with respect to the new fee 
structure the government wishes to implement?
<P>
	<B>Hon. David Anderson (Minister of Transport, Lib.): </B>Mr. 
Speaker, in my capacity as minister, I have not yet reached a 
decision concerning the organization of Canada's ports, whether in 
Quebec or in the other provinces.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, my supplementary question is for the same minister.
<P>
	By isolating the St. Lawrence region, if the minister were to 
decide to do so, does he not acknowledge that the St. Lawrence 
ports are at risk of being extremely ill served by the new fee 
schedule he is planning to implement, particularly the charges for 
icebreaking and dredging?
<P>
	<B>Hon. David Anderson (Minister of Transport, Lib.): </B>Mr. 
Speaker, I have not yet reached a decision. If I do make such a 
decision, I can assure the hon. member that we have no intention 
whatsoever of isolating the ports in the province of Quebec, or the 
province itself, as they themselves wish to.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am pleased to see that the Minister of Transport is more 
reasonable than his fisheries colleague, who has been the one 
responding in this matter until now.
<P>
	I will ask the Minister of Transport to give us some hope for the 
future by bringing his fisheries colleague around to see reason and 
ensuring that no decision is made on charges for navigational aids, 
icebreaking and dredging operations.
<P>
	Can he commit to no decision being made by the government 
until the period of consultation is completely over and the report 
tabled, so that an informed decision can be made, rather than a 
half-informed one, as his colleague in fisheries wishes to do?
<P>
	<B>Hon. David Anderson (Minister of Transport, Lib.): </B>Mr. 
Speaker, I am always ready to listen to representations by the hon. 
member, and I am always ready to consult my colleagues here.
<P>
	But the hope for the future of Quebec's ports, for the province of 
Quebec and for Canada, lies in the results we obtained in the 
byelections, which indicate that we are now well placed to keep 
Quebec's ports properly integrated within the Canadian system.
<P>
<B>(1420)</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Yvan Bernier (Gaspé, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, some Wednesday 
afternoons things get a bit topsy turvey. I understood from the 
Minister of Transport's second response that he would not be 
making a hasty decision. I am sorry to say that he will not be 
making one, since the coast guard now comes under the Minister of 
Fisheries and Oceans.
<P>
	My question is therefore to the new Minister of Fisheries and 
Oceans. He can take note of what his cabinet colleague just said. 
Consultations are currently under way on the subject of the fees the 
coast guard will charge for marine services. I would remind the 
minister that these consultations are to conclude in the middle of 
the month of April. The deputy minister in question, the 
commissioner for the coast guard, announced last week that the 
minister would reach a decision within two weeks, even before the 
end of the consultations.
<P>
	Here is my question, since those opposite seem to be in a hurry 
today. Is the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, who is responsible 
for the coast guard, prepared to put off his decision to impose 
charges for navigational aid services until April 19 at the earliest, 
so the Standing Committee on Fisheries and Oceans can complete 
its work?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Fred Mifflin (Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, the hon. member knows full well what is happening 
here. His question is one of total rhetoric. He serves on the 
committee, he sits on the committee, but for the benefit of the 
House here is what is happening.
<P>
	The commissioner of the coast guard along with others has had 
many consultations, three months of consultations. We are now 
before the committee. The fisheries committee will hear witnesses 
and further consultation until I believe the second week in April. 
No decisions have been made and consultations will continue to 
take place.
<P>
	If the hon. member is concerned about decision making, no 
decision has been made. It will not be made while the committee is 
doing the study and it will not be made until completion of the 
committee's work.

<P>
	<B>Mr. Yvan Bernier (Gaspé, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I think we can 
assume the minister has said he has yet made a decision and will let 
the committee complete its work.
<P>
	Since the minister is prepared to put off his decision until we 
have finished our work, is he, while we are on a roll, prepared to 
take into account the recommendations to be made by the Standing 
Committee on Fisheries and Oceans and especially requests 
coming from people in the industry, from the St. Lawrence and the 
Great Lakes, because, until now, the coast guard commissioner has 
had four bosses, none of whom has taken the time to listen to the 
industry? So I ask him to wait.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Fred Mifflin (Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I assure the House that the commissioner of the coast 
guard has been more than patient in hearing the consultations and 
the intonations of all interested parties in all ports in Canada from 
one coast to the other.
<P>
	In the navy we had a thing called obey the last order, but 
consultation does not mean that you obey the last order, that you 
listen to the last person. The consultation will take into 
consideration all the points that have been made from January until 
whenever the committee is finished its work.
<P>
	In addition to the hearings of the committee there will be a staff 
of the commissioner of the coast guard attending these committee 
hearings. When the committee is finished its work we will not start 
from scratch all over again because we will take into consideration 
the ongoing consultations so that a decision can be made in time to 
collect these fees for the whole year.

to balance their budgets or post surpluses. This means they will be 
in a position to offer tax relief to consumers and businesses and 
therefore stimulate real job creation for the unemployed. The only 
government left dragging its feet on budget balancing and tax relief 
is the senior government in Canada, the federal government.
<P>
	If eight provinces can balance their budgets and even the 
separatist premier of Quebec can commit to deficit elimination, 
why can the federal government not do likewise?
<P>
<B>(1425)</B>
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, as I have said many times in the House, we have a plan 
that is working very well.
<P>
	Interest rates are down by 3 points since last year. This morning I 
was reading in a newspaper that all the agencies evaluating the 
rating of Canada in terms of quality investments said it is now one 
of the best places in the world to invest. It is working very well.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):</B> The federal 
government has a plan, Mr. Speaker, but it happens to be the 
slowest plan in the country for reducing the federal deficit.
<P>
	Why should the national government, the one that is supposed to 
provide leadership, be the last to commit itself to balancing its 
budget? It ought to be the first.
<P>
	If the Prime Minister simply cannot put together a balanced 
budget plan, would he be willing to hold a Canadian economic 
summit, like the one in Quebec, and allow business, labour and 
provincial leaders to put together a balanced budget plan for him?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, as I said, we have a plan that is working very well. When 
we look at the OECD nations and at the group of seven, it is Canada 
that has the best performance at this time because of our steady 
decline in the deficit in relation to GDP. When we became the 
government it was 6.2 per cent; it went down to 5 per cent; it went 
down to 4 per cent; it went down to 3 per cent; and it is going to 2 
per cent.
<P>
	As everybody knows, if we move too fast we could create all 
sorts of problems, including a recession. When that happens less 
revenue comes in and the deficit increases.
<P>
	To be balanced, like the Liberal Party tends to be, not to the 
extreme right, not to the extreme left, that is the way Canadians do 
things, and it is working very well.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the Prime Minister compares his government's financial 
performance to that of the OECD countries. He ought to compare it 
to the provinces in Canada. Eight provincial governments are on a 
faster track for deficit elimination and tax relief than the federal 
government.
<P>
	On this countdown we are hearing, from a $40 billion deficit, to 
$30 billion, to $20 billion, to $10 billion, the other side that is never 
spoken of is the federal debt's going from $450 billion to $500 
billion, from $550 billion to $600 billion.
<P>
	I will ask one more time. What is wrong with the decision 
making and financial planning apparatus of the federal government 
that it cannot produce a budget balancing plan when eight other 
governments in Canada can?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, we came to be the government only two years ago. If we 
had been the government before that we would not have the 
situation we have today.

	<B>Mr. Gilbert Fillion (Chicoutimi, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the Minister of Industry.
<P>
	Yesterday the Minister of Industry attempted to play down 
Liberal patronage in Statistics Canada recruitment. Yet, patronage 
has reached such a point that Statistics Canada management found 
it necessary on March 25 to issue a memo, of which I have a copy, 
recommending that its commissioners act with intelligence and 
discretion in order to avoid, and I quote: ``-having people in high 
places halt the process again''.
<P>
	I call upon the minister to inform this House. Who are the people 
in high places who halted the process? Are they from his 
department or his office, because quite obviously they are not from 
Statistics Canada?

<P>
	<B>Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry, Minister for the 
Atlantic Canada Opportunities Agency, Minister of Western 
Economic Diversification and Minister responsible for the 
Federal Office of Regional Development-Quebec, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, we went through this fairly painfully and slowly 
yesterday. I will try not to take too much time today.
<P>
	I would remind the hon. member that we did-
<P>
	<B>Mr. Young:</B> Could you draw pictures, John, for him?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Manley:</B> -in the past employ a political reference system 
in naming census commissioners in this case.
<P>
	It has come to my attention that of the names that were referred 
from the province of Quebec the most successful patronage boss of 
them all, I am afraid to say, was the independent member for 
Beauce who had 19 per cent of his recommendations accepted. The 
Bloc had 18 per cent and my colleagues in the Liberal Party had 17 
per cent.
<P>
	He perhaps ought to ask his colleague, the hon. member for 
Laurier-Sainte-Marie, who somehow managed to get 61 per cent 
of his accepted.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilbert Fillion (Chicoutimi, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is indeed 
a painful answer. Can the minister explain to us why the census 
commissioners had to have their priority lists referred through a 
member of his office, in this instance Franco Iacomo?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry, Minister for the 
Atlantic Canada Opportunities Agency, Minister of Western 
Economic Diversification and Minister responsible for the 
Federal Office of Regional Development-Quebec, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, as I explained yesterday, there are priority lists for the 
recruitment of census representatives. Priority is given to the 
names referred through my office. If hon. members wish to ensure 
their names are referred they need only call my office.
<P>
	However, they cannot both rely on a system of political referrals 
and then suggest it should not occur. The hon. member making that 
suggestion reminds me of the veterinarian who set up shop with a

two months ago and not five years ago when the internal 
investigation was done?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Herb Gray (Leader of the Government in the House of

can the hon. member explain why in the House and outside the

CSIS? Perhaps the hon. member better withdraw her allegations 
and go back to the drawing board.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Val Meredith (Surrey-White Rock-South Langley,

CSIS employee had committed numerous breaches of the service's 
security policy he was confident in how CSIS had handled the 
issue.
<P>
	Yet in 1988 when Kwan Lihuen, a CSIS translator in Vancouver, 
was found to have had unreported contact with targets of the 
service he was immediately suspended and then fired when his 
security clearance was pulled. Even when SIRC and the federal 
court ruled that Kwan's clearance should be reinstated, CSIS 
refused to rehire him.
<P>
	Can the minister explain why CSIS was so rigid in that case and 
so lax in this one?

	<B>Mrs. Pierrette Venne (Saint-Hubert, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the Minister of Industry.
<P>
	A memo from Statistics Canada dated December 5 said, with 
regard to priority lists, and I quote: ``A candidate who scored 60 
per cent in the written exam and 56 per cent in the oral exam has 
priority of employment over a person from another source who 
scored, for example, 80 per cent and 75 per cent in the same 
exams''.
<P>
	Does the minister not find unacceptable the fact that some 
people who get better scores in the exams are not hired only 
because their name is not on the priority list?
<P>
	<B>Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry, Minister for the 
Atlantic Canada Opportunities Agency, Minister of Western 
Economic Diversification and Minister responsible for the 
Federal Office of Regional Development-Quebec, Lib.): </B>Mr. 
Speaker, many of my colleagues have had the same experience. 
These people were chosen to fill the positions of census 
commissioner. There was no priority list.
<P>
	In fact, that is why a priority list was established for the positions 
of census representatives.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The choice was made on the basis of a written test followed by 
an oral examination. Many people in all parts of Canada and from 
all parties passed the written test but did not pass the oral 
examination. That gave rise to the numbers I quoted earlier which, 
if anything, indicate this test was very stringent.
<P>
	By far the bulk of the people retained to perform the work on the 
census will have come from no political list at all. About two-thirds 
will come from sources other than political referrals.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Pierrette Venne (Saint-Hubert, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
unfortunately, the minister has misunderstood what I said. It is not 
those who have the highest scores who are hired, but those who 
have lower scores. That is what the memo says.
<P>
	The memo says that those who score 60 per cent and 56 per cent 
in the exams will be hired, but those who score 80 per cent and 75 
per cent will not necessarily be offered a job. The department does 
not want to hire them. The memo says that those who score 60 per 
cent and 56 per cent will be hired and that those who score 80 per 
cent and 75 per cent will not be hired. That is what the memo says.
<P>
	Can the minister explain to us why his department writes these 
kinds of memos and will not hire the most competent candidates?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry, Minister for the 
Atlantic Canada Opportunities Agency, Minister of Western 
Economic Diversification and Minister responsible for the

Speaker, again the hon. member seems very confused by the 
process.
<P>
	If the hon. member were saying we were hiring people who did 
not pass the test because of their political affiliation, I would agree 
with her that we would then have a problem. However, the reality is 
that nobody is being hired unless they prove their qualifications.
<P>
	There is no priority list, save for the census representatives. We 
have asked that priority be given to the names referred from my 
office provided they pass the required test.
<P>
	I am advised that the hon. member for Saint-Hubert has sent us 
names, and those names will be on the priority list. If she wishes us 
to remove them from the priority list we will endeavour to do so.

recognition day was passed by the assembly in Quebec in 1990. It

<P>
	If the Nisga'a deal was in Quebec rather than in British

<P>
	<B>Hon. Ron Irwin (Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern

but a comparison of what the Bloc and Reform do is interesting. 
The party to my far right, Reform, has opposed the Yukon 
legislation, the Nisga'a legislation, the Davis package, the Arctic 
exiles package, the B.C. treaty process.
<P>
	The Reform Party has voted against every piece of aboriginal 
legislation brought to the House except the Norman Wells 
legislation that benefited an oil company. If Reform members want

piece of legislation, Reformers would be at least tied with the Bloc.

possible to prevent irreversible damage. The Quebec government 
and CN recently said they wanted to do their part in saving this 
heritage property, a world-famous masterpiece of civil 
engineering.
<P>
	Does the minister admit that the federal government is the only 
stakeholder that still refuses, unlike CN and the Quebec 
government, to do its part in restoring the Quebec City bridge?
<P>
	<B>Hon. David Anderson (Minister of Transport, Lib.): </B>Mr. 
Speaker, the federal government is fully aware of how important 
the Quebec City bridge is. The hon. member should know that the 
Quebec City bridge was transferred to CN in 1993, which means 
that the federal government no longer has any economic or 
financial interest in it.
<P>
	CN wants to continue maintaining the bridge and will do so, but 
it also wants to come to an agreement with the Quebec government 
regarding the repairs to be done within a few years.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Antoine Dubé (Lévis, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I think the

of transport which has the responsibility for this bridge.
<P>

<P>

no. There were a number of times in opposition and previous times 
in my life when I certainly criticized the GST. In fact, I would

precisely to deal with those problems.
<P>

harmonizing the GST would make it virtually impossible to get rid 
of it?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
first we are talking about a replacement tax that would make it 
better for consumers and better for small business.
<P>
	Second, as with any tax, a subsequent government or this 
government is capable of dealing with it. There is nothing in any 
single tax that would so bind a government, either federal or 
provincial, that it could not deal with it and not deal with its own 
revenues.
<P>
	The government is going to do what it said in the red book. It is 
going to do what was promised on page 22. That is what was 
promised Canadians. The tax system will  be dealt with in a way 
that will allow Canadian companies to create jobs, allow them to be 
competitive and allow consumers to have a lower rate. In fact, we 
are going to do a great deal to make this economy better and better

	<B>Mrs. Dianne Brushett (Cumberland-Colchester, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans.
<P>
	Most often when we talk about the Atlantic fishery we hear only 
of the downturn of the cod fishery. However, the shell fishery in my 
riding and across the Atlantic provinces is doing extremely well 
and is a mainstay of the economy of the fishery at this time.
<P>
	Will the minister tell the House of the growth and the success of 
this bright sector?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Fred Mifflin (Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I do thank that the hon. member for her question. The 
Atlantic shellfish fishery is a very vibrant part of the Atlantic 
fishery and of the Atlantic economy as a whole.
<P>
	In recent years prices have increased substantially and the 
landings have been up. The indications are that prices were pretty 
stable last year. Early indications are that they will be stable over 
this season as well.
<P>
<B>(1455 )</B>
<P>
	In addition, the landings are not expected to fluctuate over the 
period of time that we are looking at. For the Nova Scotia economy, 
the shellfish landings represent 40 per cent of the quantity of fish 
and 80 per cent of the total fisheries landing.
<P>
	This resource is so important that efforts will be taken to make 
sure that strict conservation measures are applied and the quotas 
will be given in a fair and reasonable manner.

	<B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, last year, more than 25 per cent of the contributions paid 
by employers and employees into the UI fund, or $5 billion out of 
$18 billion, were used for purposes other than providing assistance 
to the unemployed. The Minister of Finance will divert another $5 
billion this year, and more than $5 billion next year to reduce his 
deficit at the expense of the unemployed.
<P>
	Why does the minister persist in calling UI premiums money 
that no longer goes back to the unemployed and which, in fact, 
constitutes a hidden tax?
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1294"> 1294 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
when we came to power, the UI fund was running a deficit in 
excess of $6 billion. By the end of 1995, this deficit had turned 
into a surplus of approximately $735 million. It certainly is not 
more than $1 billion today. We have made it very clear that we 
wanted to build a cushion to protect the workers in times of 
economic decline.
<P>
	The hon. member talks about diverting funds and that sort of 
thing. Look, we do not even have a $1 billion surplus to spend on 
Canadian workers.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, why is it then that, last week, senior officials at the 
Treasury Board and the assistant auditor general confirmed our 
fear, a fear we have had for the past six months, of seeing employer 
and employee contributions used to replenish the federal 
government's consolidated revenue fund like any other tax or 
revenue collected by the federal government. Someone somewhere 
is not telling the whole truth.
<P>
	In this context, I would like to ask the Minister of Finance the 
following question: Could he confirm that his government's refusal 
to transfer any active employment measure to the Government of 
Quebec may have been motivated not only by his own centralizing 
designs and those of the Minister of Human Resources 
Development, but also by the fact that this would create a shortfall 
of a few hundred million dollars in the federal government's annual 
budgetary revenue, letting its real deficit show a bit more?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
can only repeat once again that UI premiums have been used to 
absorb the deficit, which amounted to about $6 billion. Today, the 
surplus does not exceed $1 billion.
<P>
	It is obvious that the funds were not used for any purpose other 
than to make up the deficit we had inherited.
<P>
	Now, the deficit, I mean the hon. member-
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Ha!
<P>
	<B>Mr. Martin (LaSalle-Émard):</B> There is no difference.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Martin (LaSalle-Émard):</B> No, no, I meant to say the hon. 
member. It was a slip of the tongue, Mr. Speaker; I take it back.
<P>
	This is a matter of accounting. In 1986, the auditor general 
insisted that the UI fund was part of the federal government's 
consolidated account. It is purely a matter of accounting. We are 
only following the auditor general's instructions. If the auditor 
general is prepared to instruct us otherwise, we are prepared to sit 
down with him. But this is all a matter of accounting. This is 
unfamiliar ground for an economist.

	<B>Mr. Jack Frazer (Saanich-Gulf Islands, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the information commissioner has found that officers in national 
defence headquarters altered and destroyed documents relating to 
the Somalia affair to prevent them becoming public.
<P>
	He stressed that this deception was deliberate and the result of 
clear and direct orders. How can the House, the commissioners on 
the Somalia inquiry, or the Canadian public believe anything this 
minister or his department says when his officials are proven guilty 
of this kind of cover up?
<P>
<B>(1500 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of National Defence and 
Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like to 
remind the hon. member that it was the deputy minister of defence 
who drew this matter to the attention of the information 
commissioner immediately upon learning of the irregularities.
<P>
	We welcome the report of the information commissioner. 
Indeed, his findings and the facts in his report are consistent with 
those that have been revealed in the military police investigations.
<P>
	All of the matters addressed by Mr. Grace in his letter to the 
deputy minister have either been addressed or are being addressed.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jack Frazer (Saanich-Gulf Islands, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
believe the department was dragged kicking and screaming into the 
arena to declare this information.
<P>
	The information commissioner advises in his report that he gave 
the Minister of National Defence the names of those ``who gave 
clear and direct orders to destroy all original versions'' and the 
names of those ``vigilant, courageous and honourable employees of 
national defence, both military and civilian, who delayed in 
obeying''.
<P>
	What has the minister done to punish those who gave the orders? 
What has he done to ensure the protection of those who did the 
right thing?
<P>
	<B>Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of National Defence and 
Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, with respect to 
the kicking and screaming, I would like to quote from a letter 
written by Mr. Grace to the deputy minister: ``There is a silver 
lining to the cloud which these cases represent for national defence. 
The wrongdoing which occurred was first brought to my attention 
by the deputy minister of defence''. In other words, it was brought 
to the attention of the commissioner by the department itself. There 
was no kicking, screaming or dragging.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="1295"> 1295 </A></B>
<P>
	Obviously this is a disconcerting series of events and all of 
those matters will be addressed.
<P>
	What the hon. member has also failed to reveal in the House is 
that his party, together with members of the national media, 
maligned the present chief of defence staff. Mr. Grace in his letter 
has since said that the chief of defence staff, General Boyle, has 
had nothing whatsoever to do with any of the wrongdoings.
<P>
	I expect apologies from the Reform Party and the national media 
with respect to the actions taken against the chief of defence staff.

Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans. It 
concerns the very serious Pacific salmon treaty impasse. Salmon is 
of vital importance to the B.C. economy.
<P>
	Will the minister make public the report of the mediator that was 
rejected by Alaska and the United States? Will he push for binding 
arbitration of this dispute? Should this fail, will the minister stand 
up for Canada and take tough measures from rigorous customs 
inspections of U.S. vessels up to a transit fee as suggested by 
Premier Glen Clark? Will he stand up for Canada?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Fred Mifflin (Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, the hon. member's question does represent the 
sensitivity of this issue with fishermen in British Columbia. I am 
very sensitive to that. I have been there twice and have spoken with 
them and I will be going out again soon.
<P>
	The hon. member is aware that as we speak, the Minister of 
Foreign Affairs is in the United States. He will be discussing both 
with the Secretary of the Interior and the Secretary of State, Mr. 
Christopher, exactly the points the member is making.
<P>
	I want to reassure the hon. member and those fishermen on the 
west coast of British Columbia who are so concerned that we will 
do whatever is considered necessary to ensure that the principle of 
equity, which is their concern with salmon, is achieved. The best 
arrangement possible will be made for this year through the Pacific 
Salmon Commission and in future years as a result of tough 
negotiations with our neighbours as necessary.

<P>
	She said: Madam Speaker, this bill seeks to amend the Criminal 
Code concerning child sexual exploitation abroad. Right now, 
Canada cannot prosecute an individual who is a Canadian resident. 
This bill would make it possible to prosecute anyone who commits 
such a crime abroad. It seeks to prohibit the sexual abuse of minor 
children abroad. It also seeks to introduce the principle of 
extraterritoriality, which would allow Canada to prosecute a 
person. The bill would also make it an offence for a person to be 
involved in the transportation of individuals going on a trip abroad 
for sexual purposes.

	<B>Mr. Paul Forseth (New Westminster-Burnaby, Ref.)</B> moved 
for leave to introduce Bill C-247, an act to amend the Criminal 
Code (trespass).
<P>
	He said: Madam Speaker, it is my pleasure to introduce this bill. 
I have received numerous complaints that persons are trespassing 
on property causing a public disturbance and destroying a sense of 
community and liveability for children, yet are unable to be 
removed permanently. For example, we know that malls are a 
popular place for youth to hang out. If the security of the mall is 
forced to remove a problem person, that person can re-enter the 
mall within minutes. The only way the person can be charged is if 
they resist. Therefore if the person never resists, the act could 
continue over and over.
<P>
	There is a serious technical gap in the law which has been 
identified by the New Westminster city police in my riding as they 
have a storefront office in a local mall.
<P>
	To come to the aid of the community which is being subjected to 
this loophole in the law, I am proposing an amendment to section 
41 of the Criminal Code, making it a summary conviction for a 
person who has already been lawfully removed from real property 
or a dwelling house not to be able to lawfully return for 24 hours.
<P>
<B>(1510 )</B>
<P>
	The Criminal Code is full of gaps like this one and while this bill 
may only fill one of the holes, it is certainly a good start. Our laws 
need to support the law-abiding citizen rather than provide a legal 
invitation for repeated mischief without ensuing consequences.

from the federal standpoint. My constituents want amendments 
made to the Criminal Code in order to make penalties tougher and

complete latitude in determining when general elections and 
byelections will be held. This is unacceptable to Canadians who 
want a little more certainty as to when they will go to the ballot 
box.
<P>
	This bill would not contravene the Constitution Act of Canada, 
but would make changes to existing legislation so there would be 
fixed elections. General elections would generally be held every 
four years and byelections could only be held in the fall or the 
spring of the year, thus bringing certainty to a very uncertain era.

<P>
	(Motion agreed to.)
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Ringuette-Maltais):</B> When shall the 
bill be read a third time? By leave, now?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Goodale (for the Minister of Justice, Lib.)</B> moved that the 
bill be read the third time and passed.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gordon Kirkby (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Justice and Attorney General of Canada, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, 
I am very pleased to rise today in support of Bill C-9, an act 
respecting the Law Commission of Canada.
<P>
	I would first like to thank the members of the Standing 
Committee on Justice and Legal Affairs for their work in reviewing 
and amending the bill in the previous session. The amendments 
adopted by the committee, incorporated in Bill C-9, will contribute 
positively to the implementation of the legislation.
<P>
	The passage of the legislation fulfils an important commitment 
made by the government in the red book that we would restore at 
the national level an independent capacity for law reform.
<P>
	Bill C-9 will achieve that goal and it will do it in keeping with 
the government policy of ensuring that advisory organizations 
provide essential services that are cost effective and efficient. It is 
part of a broader effort to establish a more efficient and effective 
legal system.
<P>
	We have made every attempt to reflect the results of our 
nationwide consultations in the legislation before members today. 
The legislation proposes a lean commission, flexible in form, 
multidisciplinary and inclusive in function with an emphasis on 
streamlining the legal system.
<P>
	The preamble provides a guiding framework, a philosophy by 
which the new commission would be governed. This framework 
takes the form of specific principles identified in the consultations 
including openness, inclusiveness, responsiveness, a 
multidisciplinary approach, innovation and cost  effectiveness. The 
law commission visualized in Bill C-9 will be different from that of 
the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1299"> 1299 </A></B>
<P>
former commission in its attention to the process of reform and the 
stakeholders involved.
<P>
<B>(1525)</B>
<P>
	The commission's mandate will be to study and to keep under 
systematic review in a manner that reflects the concepts and 
institutions of the common law and the civil law systems the law of 
Canada and its effect with a view to providing independent advice 
on improvements, modernization and reform that will ensure a just 
legal system that meets the changing needs of Canadian society and 
of individuals in that society.
<P>
	In exercising its mandate the commission will provide advice on 
the development of new approaches to the law; measures to make 
the legal system more efficient, economical and accessible; 
partnerships and co-operative arrangements with other 
communities in Canada to stimulate critical debate; the elimination 
of obsolete laws an anomalies in the law.
<P>
	An important consideration underlying this legislation is the 
particular balance struck between the independence of the 
commission and the need for accountability.
<P>
	The commission will be an independent arm's length body 
reporting through the Minister of Justice to Parliament and will set 
its own agenda. This independence would be balanced by a 
requirement in the legislation ensuring that the minister be 
consulted before the agenda is set.
<P>
	The legislation provides for a ministerial reference power but 
also requires that the minister consult with the commission before 
making such a reference.
<P>
	The commission, through the minister, would table study 
reports, agendas and annual reports before Parliament. Similarly, 
the minister would be required to respond to any report received 
from the commission.
<P>
	The commission will consist of five commissioners, a small 
permanent secretariat, a volunteer advisory council and volunteer 
subject panels. The president will be full time while the other four 
commissioners will serve part time. Instead of retaining a large in 
house staff to conduct studies, the commission will contract for 
research from outside sources or enter into joint arrangements with 
existing institutions and agencies.
<P>
	To provide the commission with the capacity to examine the law 
of Canada in a manner that reflects the concepts and institutions of 
the two juridical systems in Canada, common law and civil law, an 
amendment was introduced by the committee to require that 
members of the commission be chosen, taking into specific 
consideration the need for commissioners as a group to have 
knowledge of the two legal systems.
<P>
	As an indication of the desire for the new commission to conduct 
business in an open and inclusive fashion, the advisory council will 
be established in legislation to provide advice on the strategic 
direction of the commission and to review its performance.
<P>
	To further ensure that the commission will be provided with 
advice reflecting the principles enunciated in the legislation's 
preamble, the committee proposed that the same factors be taken 
into consideration when appointing members to the advisory 
council, as in appointing the commissioners.
<P>
	Therefore although membership is not limited to the legal 
community, members should be broadly representative of the 
socioeconomic and cultural diversity of Canada, represent various 
disciplines and reflect knowledge of common and civil law 
systems. I believe this amendment enhances the legislation and the 
ability of the commission to fulfil its mandate.
<P>
	I mention the amendment made to the mandate of the advisory 
council, clause 19. Rather than operating at the request of the 
commission, the advisory council will have an obligation to advise 
the commission in matters related to its strategic direction, 
program of studies and performance.
<P>
	In other matters related to the purpose of the commission the 
advisory council will have discretion in exercising its advisory 
function. This amendment, introduced in committee, is critical to 
ensuring a transparent and inclusive process intended to be open 
and responsive to Canadian society. I strongly support this 
amendment.
<P>
	The existence of the advisory council and the ability to create 
subject panels will be a significant departure from the structure of 
the former Law Commission of Canada. It is through these bodies 
that consultations will be institutionalized.
<P>
<B>(1530)</B>
<P>
	In addition, the commission will be designated a departmental 
corporation to enable it to receive funds from outside sources, from 
private and voluntary sectors and to generate revenues through the 
sale of annual reports and other publications.
<P>
	In conclusion, the commission envisioned by the legislation 
represents and number of significant differences from the former 
Law Reform Commission of Canada. Its broadened approach to the 
process of law reform is to be inclusive, multi-disciplinary and 
open to all sectors of Canadian society. There will be greater 
emphasis on the efficiency and economy of the legal system. It will 
have a leaner budget and a structure employing part time 
commissioners, a small secretariat and the use of outside 
researchers optimizing joint arrangements, collaboration and 
partnerships, notably with the academic community. It will have a 
more inclusive manner of operating, using an advisory council  and 
subject panels. Innovative approaches, including new information 
technol-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1300"> 1300 </A></B>
<P>
ogies, will support a commission which will approach its task with 
more vigilant attention to cost.
<P>
	The purpose of the bill is to bring a wide ranging, integrated 
approach to the improvement, modernization and the reform of the 
law of Canada. The law is the infrastructure of our social and 
economic life and in this context, law reform is an essential 
ingredient to nation building.
<P>
	I am confident that the Law Commission of Canada as proposed 
in Bill C-9 will make an important contribution to this vital 
enterprise. I urge the House to pass this bill.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Pierrette Venne (Saint-Hubert, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, 
here we are at third reading of Bill C-9, which provides for the 
creation or rather the exhumation of the Law Commission of 
Canada. Whatever the case may be, the Minister of Justice today 
wants to revive this useless body, which cost taxpayers $105 
million over its 20 years of existence and which made few 
recommendations that Parliament actually used.
<P>
	The Law Reform Commission was established in 1971 under the 
Law Reform Commission Act. Its role was to systematically study 
and review Canada's laws. It did three main types of research: 
substantive criminal law, criminal proceedings and administrative 
law.
<P>
	In its last year of existence, the commission had a budget of $5 
million. In addition to the commissioners and employees, the 
commission hired a number of consultants on contract. More than 
82 per cent of the commission's expenditures went to salaries and 
special professional services-primarily university researchers and 
lawyers hired as consultants for short periods. In this area, the 
accent is on research and not on practical management.
<P>
	Unrealistic research programs and astronomical costs were the 
two main reasons the government of the day chose to abolish the 
commission.
<P>
	When the commission was dismantled, the Department of 
Justice received interim credits so that the work that was furthest 
along could be completed, particularly the work in the 
multiculturalism and justice project, undertaken at the request of 
the minister.
<P>
	In addition, in June 1993, Treasury Board gave final approval to 
the funding needed for the Department of Justice to set up and 
implement a long term law reform strategy. One of the aims of the 
program was to provide the department with the resources it 
needed to study more law reform issues internally, for example, by 
paying experts on a contract basis in the areas under study; to work 
with other organizations such as the Quebec law reform institute 
and other major institutions in the field of justice.
<P>
	The annual budget for projects in the law reform division ranges 
from $500,000 to $600,000. The studies funded by the division 
dealt not only with multiculturalism and justice but also with a 
whole range of problems related to law reform such as human 
rights, euthanasia, changes to the preliminary investigation 
procedure, jury selection and many others.
<P>
<B>(1535)</B>
<P>
	The division now includes three full time and one part time 
employees. The minister wants to set up a new commission when 
there is already a competent staff ready to respond to the 
government's requests.
<P>
	The division is doing a very good job. The minister could very 
well entrust this law reform division with all the work needed to 
direct and reform Canadian law and to find innovative solutions to 
endemic problems. When I think about how this government is 
slashing the budgets of the NFB, Telefilm Canada and the CBC, I 
feel like hitting someone.
<P>
	The Canadian government would rather waste $3 million a year 
on a commission that will carry out consultations. The Minister of 
Justice finds it desirable to appoint 29 federalist friends to this 
commission. The minister of consultation may not like it, but Bloc 
members will not be fooled. Ironically, it is the law reform division 
that, in May 1994, distributed a consultation paper and 
questionnaire on the creation of a new law reform commission to 
884 individuals and organizations.
<P>
	Of the 884 questionnaires that were mailed out, 126 were 
returned to the department. These are the extensive consultations 
referred to in the bill's preamble. Former members and researchers 
of the old commission were undoubtedly consulted. However, it is 
not so clear that consultations were held outside that community. 
But the consultation paper and questionnaire were distributed to all 
senators and members of the House of Commons.
<P>
	One thing is clear: the provinces as legal entities were 
overlooked. The desire to seek out people's views is expressed 
several times in Bill C-9 but nowhere in the text could I find some 
concern about consulting the provinces as major stakeholders in 
Canada's legal community. According to the constitutional 
distribution of legislative powers, the federal government must 
legislate in its areas of jurisdiction. By creating a new commission, 
the federal government may well overstep its jurisdiction.
<P>
	What concerns me the most is that the new commission's 
mandate is, and I quote: ``to study and keep under systematic 
review, in a manner that reflects the concepts and institutions of the 
common law and civil law systems, the law of Canada and its 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1301"> 1301 </A></B>
<P>
effects with a view to providing independent advice on 
improvements, modernization and reform that- meets the 
changing  needs of Canadian society and of individuals in that 
society''.
<P>
	In light of this statement of principle, we must conclude once 
again that the federal government is seeking to centralize reforms 
and to standardize legislation across the country without taking 
regional disparities into consideration and above all without 
considering Quebec in its study and review of both legal systems in 
Canada. It is outrageous on the federal government's part to claim 
to be reforming and reviewing ing Quebec's civil law, since it has 
absolutely no jurisdiction.
<P>
	The Minister of Justice should reread carefully section 92 of the 
1982 Constitution Act. It is very upsetting to see him condone such 
inappropriate legislation. What are the real motives and goals of 
federal authorities concerning the new commission's role? Will the 
commission be yet another centralizing instrument? Is this not an 
indirect way of doing what is prohibited by the Constitution? The 
federal government's intentions are clear: It wants to standardize 
the law, whether civil or criminal, across the country.
<P>
	The unavowed dream of federal authorities is to move into 
various areas of provincial law under the cover of direct 
consultations with the public, while ignoring the provinces. They 
want a single federal law from coast to coast.
<P>
<B>(1540)</B>
<P>
	This emphasis on the consultation by the commission can only 
be done at the expense of the research component, particularly if its 
budget is two million dollars less than that of the former 
commission, even with the use of new communication 
technologies. Indeed, these technologies involve costs which will 
probably be as high as the travel expenses incurred by the former 
commission, if not higher.
<P>
	One has to wonder how an agency such as this one, with an 
annual budget of $3 million, can truly conduct or commission 
research and develop various programs to that end, while also 
holding major public consultations.
<P>
	Bill C-9 provides that the research and analysis responsibilities 
that are incumbent on a reform commission will be assumed 
primarily by various social bodies independent from the 
commission itself. This is how the federal government will ensure 
the financing of its initiative.
<P>
	Indeed, the Minister of Justice seeks to have the provinces 
indirectly finance research activities relating to law reform by 
having such activities conducted by university research centres, 
and even the Institut québécois de réforme du droit.
<P>
	Under cover of a partnership and a streamlining of resources, the 
federal government is once again showing us that we have to keep a 
close eye on it. The cost of the  research conducted by the 
commission will be borne by the provinces.
<P>
	The mandarins in Ottawa, led by the Minister of Justice, view 
the provinces, and Quebec in particular, as nothing more than 
pressure groups, on the same footing as a gun manufacturers 
association, a seniors club or a chamber of commerce.
<P>
	The bottom line is that the field of action of the new commission 
will not be limited to federal law. On the contrary, it appears from 
the policy statement and the preamble that the federal government 
will not make any bones about stepping into the provinces' fields 
of jurisdiction. The consultation paper published May 16, 1994 was 
already ominous. It says, and I quote: ``-the need for law reform 
stems from the inability of existing laws to deal effectively with 
problems, and the root causes of those problems often involve the 
complex interaction of social, economic, health, education, and 
other factors''.
<P>
	What is the most worrying is that, with Bill C-9, Quebec loses its 
guarantee of representation on the commission. In effect, 
subsection 4(3) of the old Law Reform Commission Act 
guaranteed that two of the five commissioners came from Quebec. 
Not only is the federal government not consulting Quebec in the 
areas that concern it, but it is also excluding it outright by not 
having a representative from our province.
<P>
	In addition to the absence on the commission of Civil Code 
experts from Quebec, the skills and abilities of the commissioners 
are extremely vague. I note in passing that the government has 
completely ignored the recommendation by the Canadian Bar 
Association that women be represented equally in the composition 
of the commission.
<P>
	If we look at clause 7 of Bill C-106, before it went to committee, 
all we find is the following passage, and I quote:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>7. As a group, the Commissioners should be broadly representative of the 
socio-economic and cultural diversity of Canada and represent various 
disciplines.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	In committee, we attempted to reason with government 
members, but they turned a deaf ear. At the very most, and as often 
happens with this government, we are left with an empty shell, in 
the form of clause 7(3) as it now stands:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>7.(3) As a group, the Commissioners should be broadly representative of the 
socio-economic and cultural diversity of Canada, represent various disciplines 
and reflect knowledge of the common law and civil law systems.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>(1545)</B>
<P>
	This means that, if the commissioners have a knowledge of the 
civil law, they do not have to come from Quebec. What explanation 
can there be for this lack of logic? What explanation can there be 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1302"> 1302 </A></B>
<P>
for the only province in Canada with civil law and which comprises  
one quarter of the Canadian population not being represented on 
the commission?
<P>
	The federal government's intention to shove Quebec aside is still 
more obvious in the English version of Bill C-9. It states, and I 
quote, that the commissioners ``represent various disciplines and 
reflect knowledge of the Common law and Civil law systems''. In 
the English version, then, they need only reflect a degree of 
knowledge of the Quebec system and can, just as easily as not, 
come from British Columbia or the Yukon. This is shameful.
<P>
	Not only does the federal government wish to interfere with 
areas that are not within its jurisdiction, but it has the audacity to do 
so in a cavalier fashion. This is a situation in which incompetence 
comes very close to deception.
<P>
	The composition of the Supreme Court ought to have been the 
exampled followed. The Supreme Court Act calls for at least three 
of the nine judges to be from Quebec. It is totally logical for the 
highest court in Canada to reflect the two legal systems in the 
country. Why did the Minister of Justice not subscribe to the same 
logic?
<P>
	A final consequence of the federal approach is that, by allowing 
the future commission to address provincial law, the provinces face 
the risk of bowing to pressure for uniformization. This will be even 
stronger, to the point of being unbearable, if the provinces do not 
have a hand in determining the composition of the commission and 
its mandate, and in approving that mandate. For this reason alone, 
Bill C-9 is unacceptable.
<P>
	This is not all. Unlike the former Law Reform Commission Act, 
clause 4 of the bill accords less importance to the new 
commission's research role and focusses more on lucrative and 
other organizational and promotional activities. This contradiction 
is striking, to say the least.
<P>
	These new requirements are indeed surprising and a long way 
from the role that should be played by a commission responsible 
for reforming the law and carrying out the mission set out in clause 
3 of the bill. The reason is simple. The Minister of Justice wants to 
make his commission into a propaganda tool through a basic shift 
in its mandate.
<P>
	Not only is he broadening the scope of the commission in order 
to encroach in areas of provincial jurisdiction, not only is he 
dropping Quebec's representation on this commission, but he has 
the gall to use his new commission as a marketing tool to promote 
federal interests.
<P>
	How do you expect the Bloc to support such a bill? The minister 
wants us to believe that his commission will be independent. In 
clause 3, the bill clearly provides, and I quote, that:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The purpose of the Commission is to study-the concepts-of the common 
law and civil law systems-with a view to providing independent advice on 
improvements, modernization and reform-</BLOCKQUOTE>
	This is bunk. The appointments of the five commissioners are 
clearly partisan. It reeks of payment for loyal services. The five 
commissioners will be appointed by the Prime Minister on the 
recommendation of the Department of Justice. The commissioners 
will also be appointed during pleasure. In other words, they will be 
relieved of their duties if they are unsuitable and fail to follow the 
party line and the legislative program of the government in power.
<P>
	Following their appointment, the commissioners then appoint 
the members of the advisory council. There will be 24 of them. 
They too are appointed during pleasure. They are not paid for what 
they do, but do receive travel and living expenses. These 29 people 
will make up the Law Commission of Canada. With 29 partisan 
appointments, the Minister of Justice is creating his own fan club 
of intellectuals, who will philosophize over the ins and outs of the 
law.
<P>
	They will be so far removed from reality, that the Minister of 
Justice will soon realize his error and put an end to this 
commission.
<P>
<B>(1550)</B>
<P>
	In a different but equally important connection, any reform 
agency has problems inherent to its nature and mandate. The 
former commission never overcame the intrinsic problem of time. 
The more complex and lengthy the bill, the longer its consideration 
takes and, consequently, the higher the chances that the 
sociopolitical context has changed drastically between the time 
when the commission started studying the bill and the time when it 
finished, which makes it more difficult to adopt reform proposals 
as submitted.
<P>
	The former commission was severely criticized in this respect by 
the Office of the Auditor General of Canada in the House of 
Commons. In 1985, the auditor general's office conducted an 
in-depth audit of the operation and management of the former 
commission. In his report, the auditor did not mince his words 
about the project management approach of the commission.
<P>
	One excerpt speaks volumes; it says, in essence, the following: 
``Since 1972, the commission has neither reviewed its initial 
research program nor submitted a further program, in spite of the 
fact that its work has changed considerably. There were also major 
delays in the implementation of its research program and major 
cost overruns compared to 1972 cost estimates. For example, not 
one of the completion deadlines were met, and in many cases, 
projects have yet to be completed 10 years after the original 
completion date''.
<P>
	In paragraph 10.30 of his report, the auditor general points out 
that the absence of written guidelines and  procedures has caused 
deficiencies in the commission's contracting process. The report 
cites among other examples the fact that the basis for selecting 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1303"> 1303 </A></B>
<P>
various consultants or researchers were not put in writing. The 
report concludes that, unless it goes to tender, the commission 
should justify its choices in writing to ensure that any given choice 
was reasonably motivated.
<P>
	Bill C-9 does not act on the auditor general's recommendations. 
A follow-up audit conducted by his office in 1998 showed that, 
three years after it was initially recommended that it do so, the 
former commission still had not undertaken a comprehensive 
review of its program effectiveness.
<P>
	If I interpret the commissioners' complaints correctly, the 
former commission was in greater need of direction and control 
than of an arm's length situation and mandates as broad as they are 
ill-defined. The justice department never assumed its responsibility 
as a regulatory body. The situation had been allowed to deteriorate 
to the point where the government did not have a choice any more. 
It had to get rid of the commission and integrate some of its 
resources into the Department of Justice, hence the establishment 
of the law reform division.
<P>
	I would like to say that the justice minister cannot be serious 
when he describes the future commission as a streamlined law 
reform commission of Canada. If he was serious about 
streamlining, he would let it be. A streamlined commission already 
exists within his department.
<P>
	The Minister of Justice did not learn from the mistakes of the 
former commission. He chose to ignore the report in which the 
auditor general severely criticized the former commission. It has 
not gotten through to him yet that there is already, within his own 
department, a division whose sold purpose is to reform Canadian 
law. By failing to learn from past mistakes, he runs the risk of 
making the same mistakes.
<P>
	Moreover, and the minister will not be warned again, Quebec 
will not be fooled by this cheap trick aimed at invading its areas of 
jurisdiction, spending public money needlessly in the process. The 
Bloc Quebecois cannot condone this kind of manoeuvring.
<P>

<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary North, Ref.):</B> Madam Speaker, 
for the information of Canadians watching this debate, we are 
debating Bill C-9, formerly introduced in the last sitting of the 
House as Bill C-106. Essentially it sets up a law reform 
commission. The purpose of the commission is to advise 
government on needed changes and modernizations to the existing 
laws of Canada.
<P>
	We opposed this bill when it was introduced to the House at 
second reading and we oppose it now at third  reading. I hesitate to 
take the House's time by reiterating the same concerns and 
arguments that were made in the debate on October 19, but there 
are a couple of new developments which need to be discussed and 
which I would like to bring to the attention of the House. There 
have been a couple of amendments suggested to the bill and those 
should be dealt with.
<P>
	The commission is being set up as a ``departmental 
corporation''. This is to be in aid of increasing or underlining the 
independence of the commission from government and also to 
allow it to generate revenues which is an acknowledgement of the 
concern that has been raised about the cost of this ever increasing 
circle of commissions and other groups which keep being created.
<P>
	I would hesitate to predict what a departmental corporation 
could bring in or recover from the sale of its reports. I suggest it 
would certainly not be a very considerable amount. Even 
Parliament itself seems very uninterested in many of these reports. 
They gather dust on shelves. I would be extremely surprised if 
members of the public laid out cold hard cash just for the pleasure 
of reading them. I would also point out that the research work done 
to generate these reports in the first instance is funded solely from 
taxpayers' dollars. For taxpayers to have to pay additional money 
to look at the reports they paid to have generated in the first place 
does seem to be a bit much to ask of any member of the public.
<P>
	The Reform Party suggested two amendments to this bill at 
committee stage. The first one was to correct what we felt was an 
unjustified inclusion in the bill of the words ``after extensive 
consultation''. We feel that the legislation which is put before 
Parliament should be defensible and should be accurate in the way 
it is framed. We really felt that extensive consultation was a 
misnomer for the process that had taken place in bringing back this 
idea of a law reform commission.
<P>
	The consultation in fact consisted of 844 questionnaires of which 
only 126 were returned, a less than 15 per cent return rate. The 844 
questionnaires went out to, among other people, every MP and 
every senator. About half of all these questionnaires went to 
members of Parliament who have to vote on whether or not this 
whole thing goes ahead. It seems redundant to preview the opinions 
of members of the Canadian Parliament and then call this 
consultation. When we use the word consultation the public thinks 
of it as we are consulting members of the public at large, or 
extensively some other interests besides the law makers and the 
decision makers in Parliament, but that was not the case.
<P>
	We felt for the integrity of the legislation and the plain speaking 
that would be required of legislation that the reference to extensive 
consultation should be deleted. However, it is still in there. 
Canadians are being given to understand that there was extensive 
consultation and extensive discussion across the country about 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1304"> 1304 </A></B>
<P>
bringing  back the commission and it should be put on the record 
that this was definitely not the case.
<P>
<B>(1600)</B>
<P>
	The other amendment which we proposed would increase the 
role of the Standing Committee on Justice and Legal Affairs in the 
appointment of the commissioners and the advisory body to the 
commission.
<P>
	When I criticized the Minister of Justice for this at second 
reading he rose in the House and said that this body was going to be 
both independent and accountable. It would be independent of the 
minister and it would be accountable to the House through the 
minister. At that time I asked, and I still have not received a 
satisfactory answer to this difficulty, how a body could be 
independent of a minister when it is accountable to the House 
through that minister.
<P>
	There are so many areas in the legislation where not only is the 
commission accountable through the minister, it is directly a 
creature of the minister. The minister, for example, appoints the 
five commissioners. How can a body which is appointed by a 
minister, through his recommendations to council, be even 
remotely considered to be independent of that minister?
<P>
	The commission must consult with the minister before setting its 
agenda. The commission must carry out studies or prepare reports 
at the request of the minister. The response to the recommendations 
of the commission is at the minister's discretion. The minister 
could simply ignore or neglect to do anything about the 
recommendations of the commission.
<P>
	There is so much leeway and control over the process by the 
minister that to say it is independent of him or her is simply 
incorrect. There is absolutely no basis on which to make that 
argument.
<P>
	To say that the commission is accountable is again a notion 
which cannot be supported by the facts. For example, the 
commission will be given $3 million a year on which to operate. 
However, it will be set up as a departmental corporation. 
Supposedly, it is like another crown corporation which is at arm's 
length from government, therefore, not only can government not 
tell it what to do unless it wants to do that, members of Parliament 
cannot obtain information from it through the Access to 
Information Act.
<P>
	The departmental corporations are totally independent bodies. 
They are corporations in the private sector. As members of 
Parliament, even though these bodies are totally funded by 
taxpayers, we have no right to obtain information from them.
<P>
	The grain commission is a good example of this. The 
commissioners on the grain commission set their own 
remuneration. They set their own terms of reference. They set their 
own pensions. The people served, the taxpayers of Canada, and 
even members of Parliament,  cannot obtain information from it 
because the commission is at arm's length and has such a level of 
independence that it is accountable to no one.
<P>
	This commission has been set up in the same way and yet the 
minister tells us that it will be accountable. However, in the way it 
has been set up, the accountability is once again shielded behind all 
of these arm's length mechanisms. We are going to have the same 
situation as we have with the other bodies.
<P>
	For example, ACOA was asked by the taxpayers how many jobs 
it had created with the millions and millions of dollars the 
taxpayers had given to it in order to create economic activity in 
Atlantic Canada. However, they cannot obtain an answer. ACOA is 
not required to give that information to the people who are giving it 
money.
<P>
	To set up another body like this is a slap in the face to taxpayers. 
Members have to realize that taxpayers work very hard for the 
money they give to bureaucrats and politicians.
<P>
<B>(1605 )</B>
<P>
	They should have some means of ascertaining that they are 
getting bang for their buck. However, we have no certainty of that 
in this legislation. Another $3 million is floating around the 
countryside with the accountability mechanism very uncertain and 
loose. We should object to that very strongly.
<P>
	For example, we have so many services which taxpayers 
desperately need in order to take advantage of economic 
opportunities, to get health services and the education of our young 
people and our workforce. The $3 million is being cut from the 
kinds of services that Canadians are demanding. Here is money 
being used to set up a commission that Canadians are not 
demanding but which they pay members of Parliament to carry out.
<P>
	The whole job of members of Parliament is to recommend and 
put forward legislative measures that are needed to deal with issues 
facing the country. The whole point of having members of 
Parliament is to update and modernize the laws so they meet the 
changing needs of Canadians.
<P>
	Why on earth are millions of dollars being spent on members of 
Parliament who come with all different perspectives, meeting in 
committees, studying issues, travelling the country, debating in the 
House of Commons and analysing bills and then all of a sudden 
another $3 million is being thrown into the hat to have another 
commission of buddies of the justice minister, whomever he 
decides to appoint, to do the very same work that members of 
Parliament are elected and paid to do?
<P>
	In my speech on this matter on October 19, I made an offer to the 
justice minister. I said: ``If you are really so desperately in need of 
a law commission, then we as Reform Party members in the House 
of Commons will  gladly do that job for nothing. We will study 
these issues and give you recommendations. We will certainly be 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1305"> 1305 </A></B>
<P>
truly independent. We will not cost you a nickel. We will do the 
kind of research and advising that you say you need''.
<P>
	Many resources are open to members of Parliament and certainly 
to the justice minister. There are professors in universities in the 
area of law and law reform whose mandate is to do independent 
research. They would be delighted to share the fruits of their 
labours with lawmakers. However, all of a sudden even more 
researchers will be hired to do even more research when there is 
plenty being done.
<P>
	This bill is not needed. It does not do the work that it is supposed 
to do. It sets up yet another bunch of appointed people to be used by 
the minister to validate what he wants to do anyway. This is a very 
bad piece of legislation, especially at a time when the country is 
going deeper into debt by millions of dollars every day.
<P>
	I would urge the House to reject the setting up of yet another 
body and yet another commission, that we get on with the job of 
doing this work with the elected people who we are already paying 
and that we forget and scrap these kinds of measures. They are not 
needed and they will not do a better job for Canadians than is 
already being done.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay East, Ref.):</B> Madam Speaker, in 
looking at this bill, I have been trying to figure out what it is that 
the Liberals are attempting to accomplish. The thesis of my speech 
today is Liberal patronage.
<P>
	The question has to be asked: Where is the money coming from 
that will create the new agency whose work is already being done 
by the justice department? When the law reform commission was 
abolished some of the funding was redirected to the justice 
department. Is the $3 million for this new commission coming 
from the justice department which is already doing that type of 
work? Will there be a cut in the department's budget to make way 
for the new commission?
<P>
<B>(1610 )</B>
<P>
	It is rather instructive to look at what was said by the previous 
government when it cut the law commission. The Hon. Gilles 
Loiselle, President of the Treasury Board and Minister of State for 
Finance on April 30, 1992 said:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The Law Reform Commission was created in 1971. It has played a useful role 
in conducting an ongoing review of the statutes of Canada, in co-ordinating 
non-governmental research on legal issues, and in providing independent 
advice to the Minister of Justice.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The government has concluded, however, that these functions can be fulfilled 
without maintaining a separate organization. Responsibility for commissioning 
outside research will be assigned to the Department of Justice, with the minister 
and the department seeking the views of researchers and practitioners in 
universities and elsewhere. The Law Reform Commission will  accordingly be 
wound up and any necessary continuing resources transferred to the Department 
of Justice.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	The Liberals are trying to make work for their Liberal lawyer 
friends and are revisiting the Liberal law reform commission. 
Where did the $3 million come from? Did it come from the 
resources that were returned to the justice department by the 
previous Conservative government or has the government just dug 
a little bit deeper into the trough so that it can reward its Liberal 
lawyer friends?
<P>
	By eliminating the law reform commission in 1992 the 
government of the day was moving toward eliminating duplication. 
My Liberal friends of today do not necessarily understand the 
concept of eliminating duplication, particularly if they can be 
setting up more boards to employ more Liberals.
<P>
	The government wants to bring the law commission back. Much 
of the work can be done by the justice department which has far 
greater resources. I refer to comments by Peter McCreath who was 
Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of State (Finance and 
Privatization) on April 30, 1992. He said:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>It is not as if the kind of work that has been done by the Law Reform 
Commission of Canada will cease if the law reform commission ceases to exist. 
It is very important that kind of research continues to take place-</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Law reform is possible in Canada even without the Law Reform Commission.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	In the name of logic, are the Liberals of today actually saying 
that the work previously being done by the law reform commission 
over the last four years has not been done? That is a little bit of a 
stretch in terms of credulity.
<P>
	I am trying to drive home the reason why the Liberals of today 
are trying to bring this back for their Liberal lawyer friends. The 
members of this new commission will be order in council 
appointees. It may be another chance to let the few remaining 
Liberal supporters in this country who do not have government jobs 
get on the government payroll. In short, the commission has the 
opportunity to be a haven for political appointees.
<P>
	I would like the member for Kingston and the Islands, who loves 
to kibitz on this, to directly refute that this commission will not be 
a place to put the wonderful Liberal lawyer friends of this 
government today. In fact that is the reason why this is being 
redone.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Milliken:</B> I hope it is.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Morrison:</B> But he is a lawyer.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Abbott:</B> Is he a lawyer?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Morrison:</B> Of course he is a lawyer.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Abbott:</B> Is he a lawyer? We listen to him talk and talk and 
talk so he must be a lawyer.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1306"> 1306 </A></B>
<P>
	We have seen the Minister of Justice begin politicizing our 
courts by several of his recent appointments of defeated Liberal 
candidates and Liberal riding presidents to the benches.
<P>
	I am going to deal with the issue of patronage in detail at the 
conclusion of my speech but I am still working to develop this case. 
Actually I do not have to work to develop this case. It is so obvious.
<P>
	The Minister of Justice will have to be consulted before the 
agenda of the commission is set. As was pointed out by my 
colleague, the hon. member for Calgary North, this is very clearly 
not an arm's length organization. Is it not really just Liberal logic to 
say that these people are independent-
<P>
	<B>Mr. Martin (Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca):</B> Is there such a thing?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Abbott:</B> Is there such a thing as Liberal logic? Well, these 
things do happen.
<P>
	The minister states that the commission will operate at arm's 
length. That is really magic because there is a little discrepancy 
here. He wants it to be independent, but he wants it to do what he 
wants it to do.
<P>
<B>(1615)</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Martin (Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca):</B> Selfish.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Abbott:</B> I do not know about selfish, but it certainly defies 
the whole idea of-
<P>
	<B>Mr. Martin (Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca):</B> Liberal logic.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Abbott:</B> -Liberal logic. You got it.
<P>
	The minister also gets a say in the appointment of council 
members. In short, it appears that the new law commission will be 
an extension of the minister's and the department's staff. If it is 
simply an extension of the minister's and department's staff, why 
are we setting it up? Why not just give the justice department 
another $3 million and say to get on with the job? If that is what 
this whole process is all about, there certainly would have been a 
less expensive way than going through the whole business of 
coming up with this legislation. Why did he not ask for an extra $3 
million from the Minister of Finance?
<P>
	It is interesting that the former member for 
Edmonton-Strathcona on November 25, 1992 in talking about the 
old Law Reform Commission said: ``It costs $4.9 million each 
year''. I should point out that the Liberals always start low and aim 
high. They are only starting at $3 million right now. Who is to 
know where the cost of this commission is going to go? I come 
back to the member's comments: ``It costs $4.9 million each year. 
It has five full time commissioners and''-believe it or not-``a 
staff of 36. That is a lot of staff and a lot of commissioners, and it 
costs a lot of money. It is my belief that in Canada we have created 
too many commissions,  too many boards and in a certain way we 
have devalued Parliament''.
<P>
	What is really scary is that the situation of creating too many 
commissions and getting things out of the control of 
parliamentarians was started by the Liberals and the Conservatives 
attempted to terminate it in their feeble little way. Now that the 
Liberals are back, guess what? We have the re-creation of yet 
another commission. Terrific.
<P>
	``I would rather see'', the member said, and this reflects the 
comments of the member for Calgary North, ``work of this nature 
done by parliamentary committees-. I say to my colleagues in 
response, we have had an independent agency that has done a lot of 
good work but it is time we ourselves did this work and brought 
some prestige back to Parliament. Let us not devalue Parliament by 
giving its role to outsiders''.
<P>
	Reflecting on the most recent legislation by this Liberal 
government, it does devalue the whole role of Parliament and 
parliamentarians. It just treats this place like a rubber stamp. When 
the Liberals are not getting their own way they simply bring in the 
pile driver of closure to make sure that it gets through, as witness 
the reintroduction of this piece of legislation.
<P>
	The member said: ``We can do that independent work. There is 
also a fiscal argument here. It is an expenditure of $5 million a 
year. We have had a deficit over the past years of roughly $30 
billion a year,''-and of course it has gone up since then-``now 
$34.6 billion has to be borrowed. We have to borrow that money 
each year and then we have to borrow money to cover the interest 
on that money each year''.
<P>
	In parenthesis I point out to all the Liberals present that their 
government, in the life of this government, will increase the annual 
interest charge on the debt that they have accumulated by $11 
billion a year. It is an increase. That is only the difference between 
what the interest charge was when this government came in. When 
these people are kicked out of office in 1997, they will have added 
an annual interest charge of $11 billion a year to service the debt, 
yet they are perfectly prepared to spend another $3 million a year.
<P>
	The member went on: ``We have to borrow that money each year 
and then we have to borrow money to cover the interest on the 
money each year. It is a vicious cycle. The government has to take a 
hard look at where we spend our money. Some of this work will be 
contracted out but there will be a net saving''.
<P>
	The point of my speech today very simply is that this 
government did not learn anything. The Liberals were booted out 
for a nine year period when there were people here who tinkered 
around the edges. They really did not get anything done but at least 
they understood that we cannot spend money we do not have. 
Those  
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1307"> 1307 </A></B>
<P>
people on the other side of the House to this day still do not 
understand that basic concept.
<P>
	There was an interesting article in the November 21, 1995 
<I>Financial Post</I> in which Deborah McCorkell-Hoy, director of the 
law reform division of the Department of Justice had some really 
interesting comments. I quote from the article:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>When the commission was set up, McCorkell-Hoy said, everyone agreed that 
it should be as independent as possible, but it ``needs to be tied to the needs of 
Canadians''.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>To put that into effect, the bill creates a 25 member advisory council ``to 
advise on the strategic direction of the commission and review its 
performance''.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>As well, specific reform projects will be monitored and advised by panels of 
expert specialists.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>McCorkell-Hoy points out several areas that could attract business partners 
and funding:</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Intellectual property and its relationship to new information technologies.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Biotechnology, a subject in which law reform ``has tremendous implications 
for the economy of the country, and yet the law is unknown''.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>(1620)</B>
<P>
	Well, of course, we are dealing with the Liberal government.
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Federal financial regulatory mechanisms, especially in international 
commercial law.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Since the bill gives the commission a wide mandate to develop ``new 
approaches to, and new concepts of, law'', it's not inconceivable that other 
federal areas such as taxation, corporate law, labour law, unemployment 
insurance or immigration could be research targets.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Right there, in the words of this official from the justice 
department, we have a very clear and very specific indication that 
this bill is being set up to reward the government's Liberal lawyer 
friends. That is what it is all about. It is a make work project.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Martin (Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca):</B> Patronage.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Abbott:</B> Well, was it not a minister who said that we should 
have more transparent patronage? Is that not what he said in the 
House the other day? Only the Liberals would say that.
<P>
	The point I am trying to drive home and for the people of Canada 
to understand, is that when the Liberals run out of work they can 
give to their friends, they come up with some kind of a make work 
project like this one. What do we have in Canada as a result of the 
charter of rights and freedoms but a charter industry populated by 
high priced lawyers who go around trying to figure out how many 
angels can dance on the head of a pin. This is only in the wonderful 
world of the Liberals.
<P>
	We have stated, since its inception, that the country needs less 
government, not more. Canada has no lack of agencies, boards or 
commissions. Creating another  agency when the work proposed is 
already being done makes absolutely no sense, which is the thesis 
of my speech.
<P>
	It is not a matter of privatizing law reform. There is no mention 
of making cuts within the justice department when its work will be 
done by the commission. This is a make work project for the 
government's Liberal lawyer friends. That is it, plain and simple. 
This is a Liberal patronage bill.
<P>
	Look at the fact that the Prime Minister is not satisfied to just 
appoint Liberal bagmen to the other place. People go there and 
travel at taxpayers' expense going around and collecting funds for 
the Liberal government for the upcoming election. He is not 
satisfied with that.
<P>
	As a matter of fact, Senator Taylor, the most recent appointment 
to the other place, was very open, honest, candid and frank when he 
said: ``This is a patronage appointment. I have been a Liberal all of 
my life and this is what I get for it''. He got appointed to the other 
place so that he can travel around and pick up money for those 
people. It is absolutely shameful.
<P>
	If we value the work of an independent commission, why is the 
justice minister so closely involved in the process? Because this is 
not an independent commission. That is why. This is a process of 
making work for Liberal lawyer friends.
<P>
	The justice minister picks appointees, he has a say on the agenda 
and will have flexibility in response to the commission's 
recommendations. Even after these lawyers get paid all of this 
money, the justice minister will have flexibility. If we were to 
translate that, the justice minister can ignore the recommendations. 
These recommendations have the potential of being of absolutely 
no value except the value that has been siphoned out of the pockets 
of tax paying Canadians.
<P>
	If we are truly interested in the modernization and reform of 
Canadian law, why would we not have a completely independent 
body without such a large role for the Minister of Justice?
<P>
	I rest my case. The plain fact of the matter is that because of the 
very, very close tie-in, the connections, the absolute control by the 
minister of justice, this law does nothing except make work for 
Liberal lawyer friends.
<P>
<B>(1625 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca, Ref.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I would like to congratulate my hon. colleague on a very 
logical, well put together and erudite examination of Bill C-9.
<P>
	There are huge problems today in the justice department and in 
the ability of our men and women in uniform who go out on the 
streets every day to defend the rights of innocent civilians. They 
put their lives on the line every day. If we speak to them we will 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1308"> 1308 </A></B>
<P>
find they are incredibly dissatisfied with the justice department and  
the laws and regulations it has put forth over the last 20 years which 
have significantly hampered their honourable goals for Canadian 
society.
<P>
	What constructive suggestions does the hon. member feel we 
could put forth, such as victims rights, repealing section 745 and 
such? I would like to hear his views on these very important issues.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Abbott:</B> Madam Speaker, there are many issues the justice 
minister is absolutely ignoring and I might suggest at his peril and 
the peril of the Liberal Party. They are issues like section 745 
which has the absolute backing of the majority of the members of 
this House and the majority of people in Canada. It also has the 
backing particularly of the victims of the people who are currently 
incarcerated who may become eligible under section 745. There are 
many, many bills like that.
<P>
	It is so obvious and seems quite clear to me, to return to my 
original thesis, that this bill is simply a make work project. The 
justice minister is not listening. We could not only save the time of 
this House and the cost of putting this bill through, but we could 
also save the $3 million a year that will be forked out to the Liberal 
lawyer friends.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Marlene Catterall (Ottawa West, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, 
I understand the member has a substantial interest in law and order 
issues. The speech he has just given indicates that this bill in 
particular is of great interest to him. Perhaps the member for 
Kootenay East could explain to the House and to his constituents 
why he never turned up in committee to discuss the bill.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Abbott:</B> Madam Speaker, as you would be aware and I know 
the member is aware, a member of Parliament has many 
responsibilities be they in revenue, in heritage, whatever the case 
may be.
<P>
	This issue is of tremendous importance to people in my 
constituency. As a matter of fact, I devoted my most recent 
householder entirely to the issue of crime and what the ordinary 
citizen could be doing about crime even under the meagre, pitiful 
laws the Liberals are presently toying with.
<P>
	As we have been given the opportunity today, when I do have 
some time available to speak to this issue, I speak on behalf of the 
people of Kootenay East. They say to this government to get on 
with the job, change the justice system and do not tinker and play 
with it with these silly make work projects.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Peter Milliken (Kingston and the Islands, Lib.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I am so glad the hon. member for Kootenay East was able 
to clarify why at the beginning of speech he was asking all those 
questions about the bill. He wanted to know various details about 
the bill, why the minister was not doing this, why the minister was 
not doing that, why the bill did not do this, why the bill did not do 
that. We all know why he does not know the answers. He did not 
attend the committee meetings.
<P>
	I am astounded the hon. member would say in justification for 
his failure to show up to discuss the bill in committee that what he 
did was put out a householder to his constituents about law and 
order issues. Why did he not put out one on his attendance?
<P>
<B>(1630)</B>
<P>
	I suggest that had he put out one explaining where he was when 
he was not at the justice committee discussing what he says is a 
very important bill, perhaps his constituents would have 
understood a bit more about his views on justice matters.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Abbott:</B> Madam Speaker, of course we are talking to the 
now defunct, failed, fired parliamentary secretary who used to 
spend all of his time in the House.
<P>
	Maybe I could ask him the same question. Did he attend the 
justice committee? Did he attend the finance committee? Did he 
attend the heritage committee? Did he attend the natural resources 
committee? Did he attend the environment committee? What was 
he doing wasting his time here in the House, running around like he 
did before, making all sorts of these little yattering noises?
<P>
	We all know very well that what really goes on is when a 
member of Parliament comes to Ottawa, unfortunately even if he is 
six foot five and 250 pounds, he cannot be dissected and sent to this 
committee, that committee and also be in the House to answer the 
inanities of the former parliamentary secretary.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Morris Bodnar (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Industry, Minister for the Atlantic Canada Opportunities 
Agency and Minister of Western Economic Diversification, 
Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, the hon. member for Kootenay East 
managed to get through that particular matter without answering 
the question as to why he was not in committee. He has made 
comments about the member for Kingston and the Islands who was 
fulfilling his duties in the House, quite different from some of the 
members opposite. Again, he has not mentioned why he was not in 
committee.
<P>
	I am sure he cannot make that comment about me in the justice 
committee because I was in that committee all the time, even on 
this bill. I never saw him once. Perhaps he can now take this 
opportunity to answer why he was not at any time at any of those 
committee meetings dealing with this bill.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Abbott:</B> Madam Speaker, it is interesting that the member 
speaks about fulfilling his duties. I wonder if the member would 
care to stand up perhaps in the next segment in debate when he can 
answer the question of how he fulfilled his duty in that committee 
on Bill C-68 when the people in his constituency clearly and 
demonstrably gave him direction that he was to vote against Bill 
C-68.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1309"> 1309 </A></B>
<P>
	I suggest the reason he did not fulfil his responsibility to his 
people in his constituency was that he knew if he kept quiet on 
Bill C-68 he just might have a chance of being appointed the chair 
of that committee.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca, Ref.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, today we are speaking about Bill C-9, an act to create the 
Law Commission of Canada.
<P>
	This commission was set up to do some relatively general things. 
It was set up to study, analyse and give advice on measures to 
improve our justice system.
<P>
	This is another sad day in Parliament. This is another example of 
what I call studyitis. When we have problems in this country do we 
address those problems? Do we bring forth constructive solutions 
to impact on those problems in an effective way? No. What do we 
do? We study them. We analyse them. Perhaps we give advice on 
them.
<P>
	There have been thousands of studies on ways to improve justice 
in Canada. All we need to do is come together to look at those 
solutions, take the best solutions out of those suggestions and 
impart those to the Canadian justice system for all Canadians.
<P>
	As we speak people are being raped, murdered, assaulted, 
robbed, all manner of terrible things are happening to them, and the 
justice department has been largely ineffective, particularly in the 
last 10 years, in dealing with these problems.
<P>
	We have another Pavlovian response by the government to some 
very serious problems that exist in Canada today. It is not benign. It 
will cost taxpayers $3 million to bring the commission together. 
Again we have to ask why. Why are we doing this when 
constructive solutions already exist?
<P>
<B>(1635)</B>
<P>
	I do not agree with the commission. I challenge the Minister of 
Justice and the solicitor general to work together with our party, 
which has put together many constructive improvements for the 
justice system, to enact those improvements. I send that challenge 
out to them and I hope they respond.
<P>
	I would like to introduce constructive solutions on which we can 
work to improve the justice system.
<P>
	First, we have a problem with the time it takes an individual who 
is arrested to be tried and convicted. Today we have a very onerous 
system. It takes a great deal of time before the person who is 
charged is brought to justice. One of the things we could do to 
expedite the time involved would be to eliminate preliminary 
hearings. They are expensive, time consuming and they delay 
justice. Justice delayed is justice denied.
<P>
	Second, we could limit the number of appeals available to 
convicted persons. Appeals must happen. It is the only fair way to 
have a balance and a check in the existing system. However, to 
allow individuals to continually appeal is wrong. It is a waste of 
taxpayer money.
<P>
	Third, we could limit the number of adjournments which lawyers 
can introduce during the course of a trial. Currently lawyers can 
introduce umpteen adjournments. They cause an incredible 
backlog in the courts. There must be a fair number of adjournments 
to ensure that due process takes place. However, if we limit their 
number we could expedite the process while ensuring the accused 
receives a fair trial.
<P>
	Fourth, the Minister of Justice could introduce a DNA data bank. 
This would enable police officers across Canada to take DNA 
samples from accused individuals and place them into the data 
bank. It would help police officers to speed up their analysis of 
criminals. If a person is innocent they have nothing to fear. Is this 
an abrogation of an individual's rights? Absolutely not. It is 
something we could introduce today for the collective good of all 
Canadians. A DNA data bank would expedite a person's guilt or 
innocence.
<P>
	Fifth, it is very important that we repeal section 745. I have 
heard the intervention by the Minister of Justice. He said there are 
many exceptions to this rule. However, we have to understand that 
section 745 applies to individuals convicted of first degree murder. 
It is very difficult to convict a person of first degree murder. Those 
who are convicted are guilty of heinous crimes, including the 
murder of a police officer. The number of individuals convicted of 
these crimes and who were released after 15 years is shocking. It 
sends a very bad message to those contemplating vicious crimes.
<P>
	Consider the juvenile system. Juvenile violent crime is on the 
increase. It is the fastest growing aspect of crime in the country. 
Something must be done about it. Unfortunately the solutions 
attempted by the government have been wholly inadequate. It is 
high time the government began to implement constructive 
solutions for youth. Youth crime is a tragedy.
<P>
<B>(1640 )</B>
<P>
	What we should do is name youths convicted of a crime. This 
would show them they cannot hide behind anonymity when 
committing a heinous crime. We have to speed the process from 
apprehension to trial, as I mentioned before. We need to have 
constructive solutions to address the precursors to those children 
who lead a life of crime.
<P>
	This comes down to some of the determinates of health which 
have not been widely looked at. Many of these juveniles go on to 
live a life of crime. I have worked in adult and juvenile jails both as 
a doctor and as a correctional officer. Many of these individuals 
have had tragic family histories. They live in a family milieu which 
breeds a psychology that can lead to conduct disorders and then to 
crime.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1310"> 1310 </A></B>
<P>
	When we identify these family circumstances, we need to bring 
to bear the full resources we have to try to ameliorate these 
circumstances. Sometimes this cannot be done. Unfortunately the 
system we have today ensures that those children continue to 
remain in the tragic, harmful, often violent and always repressive 
situation. Sexual violence often exists within the family and if not 
that, physical violence and an enormous amount of neglect.
<P>
	The mindset we have today within our social programs and the 
justice department is to keep these children basically where they 
are. This is a mistake. A child cannot change his or her pattern of 
behaviour if they are living under these very tragic family 
circumstances. It is imperative that these children be removed from 
the home for as long as it takes for the family situation to become 
sufficiently better so that the child's basic needs are met and their 
personal safety is ensured.
<P>
	Work and skills training should be made obligatory not only for 
adults but for juveniles. This will be imperative if they are to 
become a functional member of society when released from jail.
<P>
	Many individuals, particularly in adult institutions, have 
problems with substance abuse. Jails do try to some extent to 
address the problem but the way they do it is wholly inadequate. 
Conditional on their release, if substance abuse is identified as a 
contributing factor to their criminal behaviour, they should take 
part in effective substance abuse programs in the judicial system.
<P>
	We must also look at the rights of the victims, something we 
have not heard much about in the House. This is absolutely 
imperative. We have to hold the rights of victims as the 
pre-eminent issue in justice. We must protect the rights of innocent 
civilians above those of criminals, period. That is the primary role 
of justice. Right now that is not what we are seeing.
<P>
	My colleague earlier today in question period, when asking a 
question to the Minister of Justice, gave a profoundly tragic 
example of a woman who was murdered because she could not get 
the information needed from the judicial system that the individual 
she was with was violent and that her life was at risk. Who are we 
trying to protect, the criminals or the victim? We must protect the 
victim. I do not care about these spurious arguments put forth about 
protecting the human rights of an individual. The person whose 
human rights must be protected first and foremost is the victim. 
Therefore our party has put forth many constructive solutions, 
including making obligatory victim impact statements, appropriate 
restitution to the victim and counselling.
<P>
<B>(1645)</B>
<P>
	I will give a really sad example that happened in my 
constituency. A lady came to my office. Her 13-year old son, an 
invalid, was sexually abused by an older boy, a  17-year-old. When 
they went to court and the older boy was convicted of sexually 
abusing the handicapped 13-year-old, the 17-year-old said he was a 
victim.
<P>
	The 17-year-old got more counselling, money from this 
institution, from the justice department, than the victim, much 
more. That is not justice at all. Who are we trying to protect?
<P>
	We need balance. The accused and the convicted must be treated 
too. To ignore them is to ignore society at our peril. We must also 
first and foremost be able to protect, treat and deal with the victims 
of some terrible crimes that exist in society.
<P>
	We see little justice in the justice system. We see a crisis of 
conscience within those men and women who put their lives on the 
line every day to protect us.
<P>
	I spoke with some members of a police force yesterday. They 
echo what is said by police officers in my riding, that the system we 
have today simply does not work. We cannot merely tinker around 
the edges. We have to impact some good, strong, effective 
solutions and we need to do it now. If we do not do it now, more 
innocent civilians will be unnecessarily hurt.
<P>
	We can address the precursors to the individuals who commit 
these crimes. By doing that, we will be saving ourselves not only 
money but a lot of grief and individuals who need not be hurt in the 
future.
<P>
	It is up to us in the House to look at these effective solutions 
today and enact them. It is not up to us to enact another bill, to 
develop another commission to do more studying, to give more 
advice, to do more analysis to enact solutions that are already on 
the books.
<P>
	The solutions are there and I challenge the government once 
again to look at those solutions and bring them to the floor of the 
House. Let us have a vigorous debate and pick the best ones. There 
are many that were done by learned individuals.
<P>
	I hope hon. members opposite will take it upon themselves to 
bring forth some effective solution for all Canadians to protect 
them and to prevent further crimes. It must be done today.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Ringuette-Maltais):</B> Before we 
proceed with questions and comments, it is my duty, pursuant to 
Standing Order 38, to inform the House that the question to be 
raised tonight at the time of adjournment are as follows: the hon. 
member for Burnaby-Kingsway, health.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay East, Ref.):</B> Madam Speaker, I was 
really interested in the comments by my colleague from 
Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca. One of the thoughts that crossed my 
mind was a term I was trying to think of earlier in the most recent 
exchange. What we are looking for here is Liberal logic. Basically 
he has asked them to take a look at some very logical, rational ideas 
that would put the rights of the victim first.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1311"> 1311 </A></B>
<P>
	Would he agree with me that the term Liberal logic is the 
ultimate oxymoron?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Martin (Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
thank my hon. friend for the question. It never ceases to amaze me 
why, with all the resources we have, with all the intelligent people 
who sit in the House today, we do not enact these solutions. The 
power to do this lies with the government. Liberal logic is indeed 
an oxymoron. Here the Liberals have the opportunity for a solution 
and they play politics with it and fritter it away. Why? The goal of 
the House is not to enact solutions, the goal is not to bring forth 
good solutions to the Canadian public. The goal is the maintenance 
of power. The problems of the country become secondary to 
effective solutions to address the problems of the country. The 
problems become secondary to the acquisition and maintenance of 
power. That is a huge disservice to the Canadian people.
<P>
<B>(1650)</B>
<P>
	If the Canadian public only knew what went on in the House and 
how we are living in a very pyramidal system where the important 
decisions of the country are made by approximately 12 elected 
officials and a number of non-elected and unaccountable officials, 
it would be shocked.
<P>
	All is not lost, however. If the government would remove itself 
from its profound and primary desire to maintain power and looked 
beyond that to build a better House of Commons which gives the 
ability to individual members of Parliament, across party lines, to 
represent their constituents effectively and to put forth effective 
solutions, which gives the power to committees to bring forth 
solutions and legislative initiatives to the House, there would be a 
much more democratic situation in the country. By doing so we 
would build a stronger Canada.
<P>
	Instead we have a situation in which the frontbenches and the 
whip structures cower members in the back to do exactly what their 
leader tells them to do.
<P>
	That does their constituents a disservice because there are 
numerous good solutions that the backbenchers have which I have 
spoken to many times. There is no reason why those solutions 
cannot be brought forth for the public to digest, debate and for us to 
debate in the House.
<P>
	If we accept the current so-called democratic situation we have 
here today, we should be ashamed of ourselves. The House is far 
from being a democracy.

<BLOCKQUOTE>``(2) Any order made under subsection (1) is subject to the adoption by the

	As Quebecers, we supported the free trade agreement with the 
United States. We support, in principle, free competition. We 
worked very hard to give Quebec access to the vast U.S. market. 
We know that, at times, the Canadian market was harder for 
Quebecers to penetrate than the U.S. one. Deregulating internal 
trade seems like a good idea.
<P>
	We must deregulate so as to not impede free competition or the 
movement of goods, services and people. During the last 
referendum campaign, we Quebec sovereignists spoke at length of 
an economic partnership with the rest of Canada. This measure is a 
step forward that will allow for the free competition and the 
partnership that we sought to have with the other Canadian 
provinces.
<P>
<B>(1700)</B>
<P>
	As I said a moment ago, we have always been very favourable to 
free trade and, I repeat, we would like to see a very open economic 
partnership among the provinces so that we can work much more 
freely with the other provinces in Canada and, naturally, at least 
have the possibility of conducting trade as easily between 
provinces as with the United States.
<P>
	That is what we are proposing in this motion, and particularly 
with respect to disputes, the committee which will settle disputes 
between provinces. We have a committee that settles disputes 
between Canada and the United States, but the bill that deals with 
an internal trade agreement sets up a committee to settle disputes 
that will arise over time.
<P>
	This is where we have a problem. The process is rather complex. 
We are told there will be a complaints secretariat; if a complaint 
cannot be settled internally by officers of the permanent secretariat, 
there will be three other possibilities. First of all, there is the 
possibility of consultation, at the request of the secretariat. We will  
also have an internal trade committee. This committee will be a 
permanent one, with representatives from all the provinces, 
appointed by the provinces through a rather special procedure, with 
which we are also in agreement.
<P>
	It will also be possible to form a special group, a sort of 
arbitrator for very serious conflicts between certain businesses that 
are not adhering to the rules of the agreement. If the working group 
decides on a course of action that is not sufficiently stringent or 
accepted, then the next step will be trade action taken by the 
government.
<P>
	This is where we have a problem. Trade action can be 
implemented by order of the governor in council, in other words, 
by cabinet. That is why I am tabling this motion. We do not agree 
that the government should be allowed to decide by order to act, 
because I feel that the governor in council could decide, almost in 
secrecy, to act.
<P>
	This is where the problem lies. There could be conflicts between 
economic sectors of activity or conflicts between certain 
businesses or ways of doing business. There will be some 
economic sectors in conflict with others, with the bulk of a given 
economic sector under the control of one or a few provinces, to the 
detriment of another.
<P>
	This goes beyond trade and might affect the economy of a 
province, any province. That is why we in the Bloc Quebecois 
propose in this motion that there be a debate of at least two days in 
the House of Commons before the order takes effect. We feel that 
this is very important because it could affect a province.
<P>
	This is not only a matter of trade. In some cases it may lead to 
confrontation between certain provinces.
<P>
<B>(1705)</B>
<P>
	This is the reason we believe there must be more transparency 
and a public debate, before the government acts. I have referred to 
the entire process, an excellent one, for settling differences. It is 
very well organized, very safe and complex and will, I think, be 
able to play an effective role. But, if the process cannot work, I 
envisage serious repercussions which must be revealed publicly 
and debated publicly.
<P>
	For this reason, I find this is a bit risky. Some provinces, in any 
case, might be affected on the economic level. This is why we feel 
there must be debate for two days before we go ahead with a 
ministerial order.
<P>
	These are the main reasons. We in Quebec are also somewhat 
concerned to see the federal government taking this decision via an 
order. We see this as just one more power the federal government is 
giving itself. It is another example of the federal's centralization. 
Since this is an agreement between the provinces why, in the long 
run, is it the federal government which will settle the  matter by an 
order. This strikes us as somewhat dangerous. The federal govern-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1313"> 1313 </A></B>
<P>
ment might favour one province over another because of the power 
it has given itself to settle certain problems relating to internal 
trade.
<P>
	Overall, we are in favour of liberalizing trade between the 
provinces, but we strongly insist-and I address these words 
particularly to the government members who will be having to vote 
on this-that they support this motion, so that MPs from the party 
in power will have the opportunity to have their say. Perhaps the 
government members representing certain regions will express 
themselves freely, so that their region, or their province, will be 
protected in sectors which might affect another province.
<P>
	For this reason, we deem it very important to debate the matter 
in a way that is both open and transparent. I hope the government 
members will take this motion under consideration.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Leon E. Benoit (Vegreville, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise today 
to speak to Motion No. 2 regarding changes to the bill that will 
implement the agreement on internal trade.
<P>
	During my address today I will explain that without the inclusion 
of my amendment, Bill C-19 will not address the concerns of 
Canadian taxpayers who are tired of the onslaught of patronage 
appointments from this Liberal government.
<P>
	I will explain how my amendment will improve this legislation 
to serve the best interests of Canadians by providing a transparent 
system of scrutinizing governor in council appointments as they 
pertain to the agreement on internal trade.
<P>
	The amended clause would read as follows:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>14(1) The Governor in Council shall, by order, appoint any person to fill any 
position that may be necessary or advisable, in the opinion of the Governor in 
Council, for carrying out the purposes of the agreement only after scrutiny and 
approval by the appropriate committee of the House of Commons.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Government ministers have made a practice of conducting the 
business of governor in council appointments in secret. The 
salaries which are bestowed on these appointees are paid for by the 
taxpayers. It is only right that these same taxpayers should have a 
say in how many appointments are made and how much the 
commissioners are paid.
<P>
<B>(1710)</B>
<P>
	This amendment establishes elected members of Parliament 
serving on committees as scrutineers to patronage appointments. It 
will ensure that Canadians, through their elected members of 
Parliament, play a role in governor in council appointments.
<P>
	The process thus far has been anything but open. Even though 
the Liberals campaigned on integrity in  government and pledged 
to award governor in council appointments based on merit, Liberal 
Party affiliation has been at least as important as merit. I would 
suggest that it has been far more important in many of the 
patronage appointments made by the government.
<P>
	This amendment will help the Liberals to keep their election 
promise. After all, everyone needs a little help now and again.
<P>
	The agreement on internal trade, which will be implemented by 
this legislation, was contrived from executive meetings involving 
cabinet officials of the 12 provinces and territories along with the 
federal government. These 13 government bodies are defined as 
parties to the agreement. Their objective is the removal of 
interprovincial trade barriers which cost Canadians between $6 
billion and $10 billion a year. The objective is, indeed, admirable. 
The government is to be congratulated for taking the first step in 
freeing up trade within Canada. Unfortunately, it is only a very 
small first step.
<P>
	The result of this process so far is a seriously flawed agreement 
which identifies the problems, yet does very little to solve them. 
The important thing to remember is that all provinces and 
territories signed the agreement showing an intent to remove trade 
barriers. The problem exists in the means available to remove those 
barriers.
<P>
	The agreement on internal trade outlines a series of legitimate 
objections which allow exemptions to the agreement. These 
objections are based on public security and safety; public order; 
protection of human, animal or plant life and health; the protection 
of the environment; consumer protection; protection of the health, 
safety and well-being of workers; and affirmative action programs 
for disadvantaged groups. If it can be proven that any of these 
provisions will be infringed on by the removal of a barrier, they 
will be exempt from the agreement. By doing this a party can 
protect specific interests very easily.
<P>
	The fact that all agreements are based on the unanimous support 
of all parties leaves the door open to protectionist practices. This is 
evident in the removal of a dispute settlement mechanism in the 
energy sector. Just last week the House debated the Churchill Falls 
power contract. The trade barrier created by the contract is costing 
Newfoundland and Labrador close to $1 billion a year in lost 
energy revenue.
<P>
	The very principle on which the agreement on internal trade is 
based is contravened by that contract. The people of Newfoundland 
and Labrador look to the new agreement on internal trade to right 
the wrong. Unfortunately, the process of deliberation between the 
provinces does not provide any real hope for the resolution of this 
problem as the agreement now stands.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1314"> 1314 </A></B>
<P>
	The definition of a legitimate objective is extremely vague. It 
encompasses nearly every protectionist measure implemented by 
the provinces and ensures that barriers will continue to exist.
<P>
	It is obvious from this language that disputes between parties 
will arise. It is imperative that a trade agreement contain a dispute 
settlement mechanism which is fair, effective and binding.
<P>
	It remains to be seen whether the dispute settlement mechanism 
in the agreement will be effective. However it has met with 
considerable criticism from a wide range of groups, individuals and 
companies that have examined this agreement.
<P>
<B>(1715)</B>
<P>
	The process that individuals and governments have to go through 
to settle a dispute is lengthy, complicated and limits the access of 
individual businesses to the mechanism. The Minister of Industry 
and his provincial counterparts had the arduous task of striking an 
agreement which not only addressed the barriers to trade in Canada 
but was also agreeable to all parties on all issues. This was partially 
accomplished, although many of the sectors were not addressed 
effectively. That is the problem. Some were not addressed at all.
<P>
	The committee of ministers set out objectives for designing the 
dispute resolution mechanism. This was to include: (a) disputes are 
to be directed by governments rather than private parties; (b) 
non-confrontation resolutions are to be used wherever possible; (c) 
no access to the courts will be granted in dispute settlements, no 
room for court interpretations; (d) restrict access to private parties 
in order to minimize the possibilities of frivolous claims being 
used as a means of harassing governments, resulting in financial 
burdens.
<P>
	I want to repeat part of the last criteria set out by governments in 
this agreement: to restrict the access of private parties in order to 
minimize the possibility of frivolous claims being used as a means 
of harassing governments. This agreement is more concerned with 
protecting governments from harassment than it is with protecting 
individual Canadians and individual Canadian companies. That 
shows there is a real flaw in the thinking that has gone into the 
dispute settlement mechanism.
<P>
	I question the rationale for restricting individuals access to 
dispute resolution mechanisms. As stated earlier, trade barriers cost 
Canadians money and jobs. Therefore Canadians need to be 
assured that their concerns on the existence of these barriers will be 
duly heard and acted on.
<P>
	Access to dispute resolution mechanisms by individual 
Canadians ensures that the concerns of small businesses that rely 
heavily on internal trade will be dealt with. The purpose of this 
agreement is not to appease governments but rather to ensure 
access to markets across Canada. That is the purpose of this 
agreement.
<P>
	The agreement on internal trade includes a provision which 
allows individuals access to the dispute resolution mechanism. The 
following is a brief outline of that provision. As I go through it, 
members will acknowledge that the mechanism is much too 
complex, much too slow and has no teeth.
<P>
	First, an individual company is to contact its party to the 
agreement. Its party is either a provincial or the federal 
government, depending on jurisdiction. If the government involved 
refuses to act on its behalf, the party that wants to use the 
mechanism can contact the internal trade secretariat and apply for 
individual to government consultation.
<P>
	Before access is granted, an individual has to undergo a 
screening process which determines whether the individual's claim 
is frivolous or vexatious. If it is deemed to be frivolous or 
vexatious, then the claim is disqualified and the individual 
company is not allowed to go through the dispute settlement 
mechanism.
<P>
	If the claim is deemed valid, then the dispute will be heard by a 
panel of experts. This is where my amendment comes in. Each 
province and the territories, along with the federal government, 
will appoint five panelists to a roster that will consist of 65 
panelists.
<P>
	The terms of reference of these experts, their pay and their 
accountability is not mentioned in either the agreement or in this 
bill. The agreement also calls for the appointment to the office of 
the secretariat of internal trade of screeners and others as needed by 
the governor in council. The bill asks Canadians to sign a blank 
cheque for an undetermined number of people, to be paid an 
undetermined amount of money, to do an undetermined job.
<P>
<B>(1720)</B>
<P>
	Canadians are tired of this kind of patronage appointment. They 
want accountability. In fact, when the Liberals were in opposition 
they too wanted accountability of order in council appointments. 
They suggested that there be established a non-partisan nomination 
and confirmation procedure for order in council appointments. Is it 
not interesting now that the Liberals are the government they forget 
what they wanted when they were in opposition?
<P>
	My amendment will deal with this problem of openness in order 
in council appointments.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Morris Bodnar (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Industry, Minister for the Atlantic Canada Opportunities 
Agency and Minister of Western Economic Diversification, 
Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, with the two motions on the floor I will deal 
first with the matter that was brought forward by the hon. member 
from the Bloc Party.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1315"> 1315 </A></B>
<P>
	I would suggest this amendment is one that really reflects a 
continuing misunderstanding of how the dispute resolution 
procedures of the agreement are intended to operate.
<P>
	The amendment is quite unnecessary because then the federal 
government would be tied to a procedure to which none of the other 
parties under the agreement are tied. There are 13 parties and the 
other 12 would not be tied to the procedure.
<P>
	Further, Motion No. 1 is nothing but an attempt to restrict the 
scope of action that the government may legitimately expect to 
have to ensure that it is able to protect the national interest in the 
negotiated balance of benefits in the agreement on internal trade.
<P>
	The proposed amendment by the hon. member for the Bloc is a 
cumbersome procedure. It is unnecessary and it is time consuming. 
It is unnecessary because the government in any retaliatory 
procedure under the act, the retaliatory measures first of all by the 
government must be fully consistent with the agreement on internal 
trade. Second, they are matters that are entirely within the 
government's constitutional jurisdiction.
<P>
	Again I emphasize that the procedure being suggested is one that 
only the federal government would be required to follow. None of 
the other parties would have to follow it.
<P>
	The amendment in effect would be an attempt to unilaterally 
amend the agreement that all parties have agreed to already. This 
cannot be done. The amendment is a disguised effort to delay or to 
impede the ability of the government to act in the national interest 
in areas that are clearly within its own jurisdiction. For these 
reasons I suggest that this amendment does not warrant the support 
of the House.
<P>
	The amendment proposed by the hon. member from the Reform 
Party involves a much broader question. It that involves the 
question of approval of government appointments. This was dealt 
with in committee and has already been rejected.
<P>
	The committee was not the place where this matter should have 
been dealt with. The motion should be dealt with in another 
committee if the Reform Party is intent on pursuing such a matter.
<P>
<B>(1725 )</B>
<P>
	This amendment proposes a complex method of making 
appointments. It is obvious the Reform Party has one intention, to 
tie up the House continuously in matters like this so business 
cannot go ahead. That is all on which the Reform Party is intent. 
The amendment is an attempt to grandstand, it is not an attempt to 
try to see that the business of the House proceeds in an orderly 
manner.
<P>
	I would suggest this is a matter that it is not appropriate to deal 
with at this time and it should be rejected.

<P>
<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="BROADCASTINGACT">BROADCASTING ACT</A></H3>
	<B>Mr. Roger Gallaway (Sarnia-Lambton, Lib.)</B> moved that 
Bill C-216, an act to amend the Broadcasting Act (broadcasting 
policy) be read the second time and referred to a committee.
<P>
	He said: Mr. Speaker, it is my pleasure to begin second reading 
debate on Bill C-216, an act to amend the Broadcasting Act 
(broadcasting policy). The act has one objective and that is to 
control the relationship more completely between the Canadian 
Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission, which 
Canadians love to call the CRTC, and the public. For the purposes 
of this discussion I refer to the public as those people who presently 
receive television services by way of cable transmission, but this 
bill will also cover those Canadians who will soon receive 
television services by way of telephone lines or direct to home 
satellite services.
<P>
	Controlling a relationship is never easy, we all know that. Yet 
this is a relationship, the connection between the CRTC and its 
public, which the Government of Canada through the Broadcasting 
Act brought into  existence and which we by Bill C-216 can once 
again bring back under control.
<P>
	There are three components or factors to this argument which I 
refer to for discussion purposes as the three <I>c</I>s. These are: cost, 
choice and culture.
<P>
	Last year when the CRTC authorized the grouping or bundling of 
new programs on to cable carriers and at the same time allowed 
cable companies across this country to charge more for them, that 
commission, those people who are supposedly protecting us and 
nurturing Canadian culture, forgot, ignored, or what I would 
suggest, turned their collective backs on Canadian cable 
subscribers. The consumers had two choices: they either paid more 
or they received less.
<P>
	Who in this place could forget the anger, the vitriol and the 
simple disgust of those who were being held for ransom? We, the 
representatives of the people in this place, were besieged, 
harangued and generally deluged with hundreds of calls from angry 
consumers who from their perspective generally knew that their 
pockets were being picked with the express consent of the CRTC, 
the very government agency which was put there to protect them.
<P>
<B>(1800)</B>
<P>
	Canadian consumers quite simply were held ransom by an 
industry with an astounding 52 per cent return on its capital 
investment. Who can forget at the same time the reaction of the 
CRTC, which referred to this practice of negative option billing as 
a necessary evil?
<P>
	From my perspective as a representative of a certain group of 
people, it was a necessary evil to tell my constituents that they 
would receive, wrapped in the bundle of new channels, Canadian 
culture.
<P>
	As to the issues of cost and choice, the CRTC chose not to do 
anything. Who can forget that Keith Spicer, the architect of this 
policy, was out of the country on vacation when this storm struck?
<P>
	Keith Spicer, the so-called czar of Canadian culture, was on a 
foreign holiday as Canadians received a post Christmas gift they 
did not want.
<P>
	While Keith was out exploring foreign cultures, members of the 
House were publicly stating, to use one quote, that the CRTC was 
in bed with the cable companies. Newspapers across the country 
gave anecdotal reports of what individual consumers felt and 
planned to do. All ridings across the country are certainly aware of 
that.
<P>
	Let us in the House not forget that it was not the cable companies 
that decided Canadians would receive seven new channels they did 
not ask for. It was the CRTC that licensed the new services after 
deciding which, in its collective wisdom, were best for the whole 
country.
<P>
	At the same time, it was the CRTC that permitted the packaging 
of new channels, totally unsolicited by  Canadians, with popular 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1318"> 1318 </A></B>
<P>
programs such as ``CNN'', an American network, to give its 
favourite seven infant channels a chance of survival.
<P>
	The <I>Globe and Mail</I> noted in its editorial of January 7, 1995: 
``Effectively the commission was levying a tax on television 
viewers to support quality broadcasting''.
<P>
	Canadians some 15 months later understand what the Consumers 
Association of Canada observed in January 1995, that the equality 
for the practice was backward.
<P>
	The CRTC and the cable industry justified the negative option 
tactic in the name of culture, but in reality it was driven by business 
imperatives. It is very interesting.
<P>
	It was reported on January 7, 1995 that the president of Rogers 
Cablesystems, Colin Watson, in an interview which was reported 
widely across the country stated that this sleight of hand called 
bundling or negative option billing was the only way that Rogers 
Cablesystems could sign up enough new customers.
<P>
	I do not have to suggest to anyone in the House or anyone 
watching the proceedings today that every business in the country 
would love to be the beneficiary of this kind of largesse which the 
CRTC was doling out but for which the Canadian consumer was 
being told they would pay.
<P>
	Canadian viewers were being told what they could watch and 
what they would pay in the name of Canadian culture. Is it not 
interesting that one of the conduits of Canadian culture has today as 
its most popular program, according to the rating agencies, reruns 
of the ``Mary Tyler Show'', a great Canadian show, and that 
another has that hybrid of <I>Cosmopolitan</I> and <I>Vogue</I> magazines 
called the ``Fashion File'' as its most popular program.
<P>
	In return for this, seven new networks were guaranteed cash for 
life-that is my term-by the CRTC. Cable companies, as we now 
know, reluctantly bent to public pressure. They bent in the sense 
that they apologized for the behaviour and most gave a window of 
opportunity to opt out of the new channels, but never did they allow 
Canadians to decide up front that they could decline the channels.
<P>
	The onus, the burden, the obligation was decidedly on the 
individual within a certain timeframe to either cancel the channels 
or pay for them. This is a unique and tragically Canadian way of 
selling Canadian culture.
<P>
	More important, did Canadians receive any assurances from the 
CRTC that this would not happen again? Apologize? The cable 
companies did. The CRTC? Certainly not. Mr. Spicer and his 
commission, in my opinion, are much too busy regulating to 
acknowledge any errors.
<P>
<B>(1805)</B>
<P>
	Last week my office received from the CRTC a recent bulletin 
which stated: ``The CRTC regulates the rates but expects each 
cable operator to inform subscribers in  advance what subscribers 
must do to have optional packages removed''. I have to emphasize 
``removed'', not ``added''.
<P>
	The Canadian public today, 15 months later, does not have real 
choice on what services are to be added but only, in the words of 
the CRTC, what can be removed. Quite simply, negative option 
billing still survives. It is very much alive and well.
<P>
	Canadians would also be upset to learn the CRTC is about to 
consider 40 new applications for specialty channels. Members of 
the House and Canadians will be pleased to know that the potential 
exists to receive, if the CRTC will bless them, such great Canadian 
programming as the ``Horse Network'', the ``Home and Garden 
Network'' and the ``Mystery Network''.
<P>
	Forty corporations, most of them individuals who have recently 
incorporated shell companies, are poised to sell a concept which 
they hope will be richly rewarded by these guardians of Canadian 
television.
<P>
	Soon telephone companies and direct to home satellite services 
will be channelling TV programming into homes across the 
country. What can those people expect? If we follow Mr. Spicer, 
the chair of the CRTC, in a speech delivered to the Canadian Cable 
Television Association, he noted that Canadian consumers want, 
deserve and will increasingly settle for nothing less than the 
maximum control possible over which services they select and pay 
for. As a consumer, Mr. Spicer agrees 100 per cent with that goal. 
He went on to say that full pick and pay, beyond a few rock bottom, 
common national interest services, can come only after this decade, 
meaning sometime in the year 2000 or thereafter.
<P>
	With 40 applicants lining up, with new carriers pressing to enter 
the marketplace, we in the House have a choice, a choice we must 
make for consumers. That choice is clear. Bill C-216 would amend 
the Broadcasting Act, specifically section 3, so that consumers 
from this time forward will be given control over what they receive 
and the cost of what they receive.
<P>
	Section 5 of the act imposes an obligation on the CRTC to 
regulate and supervise all aspects of the Canadian broadcasting 
system with a view to implementing the broadcasting policy which 
is set out in the act.
<P>
	This bill would amend the broadcasting policy section, section 3, 
so that a cable distributor or other distribution undertaking, which 
could be a telephone company or a direct to home satellite 
company, could not demand money from a person for the provision 
or sale of a new programming service when the person has not 
agreed to receive the new service. In the vernacular, consumers will 
not pay for what they do not want. Certainly this is what consumers 
want.
<P>
	The Consumers Association of Canada liked this bill. It issued a 
press release yesterday which called on members  of the House to 
support it. At the same time the Public Interest Advocacy Centre 
has endorsed it. That group noted there are generations of laws 
protecting consumers against unsolicited goods and yet still today 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1319"> 1319 </A></B>
<P>
cable companies, as merchandisers of goods, do not have to await 
the consumer's choice.
<P>
<B>(1810 )</B>
<P>
	Section 3 of the Broadcasting Act imposes a statutory duty on 
the CRTC to be ``responsive to the evolving demands of the 
public''. Since the CRTC has been silent for 15 months, we as 
members of the House can now move to respond to the demands of 
the public. There are those who would suggest that as members of 
the House we have a statutory duty to uphold the laws of the 
country.
<P>
	As is often the case there is always the question of powers 
between the federal government and the provinces. Certainly in the 
House we have the authority to regulate in this domain throughout 
Canada and we, the members of the House of all parties, have the 
opportunity to take in hand the rights and the interests of 
consumers.
<P>
	The issue of provincial versus federal jurisdiction is as old as the 
country. The question of whether a law is intra vires or ultra vires 
has always been a healthy industry for the legal profession and 
certainly has kept the judiciary busy.
<P>
	When the storm erupted over this issue last year the then 
minister of Canadian heritage stated, as was reported by the press, 
that this was a matter of provincial jurisdiction. He then a few days 
later acknowledged that broadcasting was four square within 
federal jurisdiction.
<P>
	We must remember that cable companies as federally regulated 
undertakings can claim immunity from provincial laws, especially 
consumer protection laws. Quebec has a consumer protection act 
which would appear to forbid the practice. In section 5 of that act 
the following are exempt from the application of the title on 
contract regarding goods and services: contracts regarding any 
telecommunication service supplied by an operating company 
within the meaning of section 2.
<P>
	Professor Hudson Janisch in an interview with the Ottawa 
<I>Citizen</I> January 7, 1995 noted that provinces are free to control 
commerce but they lose that control. Quebec acknowledged that in 
section 5 when it comes to federally regulated industries such as 
cable.
<P>
	Professor Janisch, an expert and professor in regulatory law at 
the University of Toronto, pointed out that the Broadcasting Act 
instructs the CRTC to protect consumers as set out section 3 of that 
act.
<P>
	There are a number of underlying factors we must realize. 
Consumer protection is not clearly federal, it is not clearly 
provincial. The federal government has jurisdiction over cable 
television pursuant to its powers.  Consumer protection legislation, 
whether enacted by the federal or provincial governments, usually 
provides a remedy. This bill does not provide a remedy. Proposed 
Bill C-216 does not provide this remedy to consumers because 
clearly it is not consumer protection legislation.
<P>
	The CRTC does not prohibit cable companies from using 
negative option billing, we all know that, to sell new discretionary 
services because it does not regulate discretionary services. It 
could regulate discretionary services but it has decided not to do so.
<P>
	Instead it informs cable operators that it expects them to notify 
subscribers when they will be given new services and how to opt 
out if they wish. The CRTC is required by section 5 to regulate and 
supervise all aspects of the Canadian broadcasting system with a 
view to implementing the broadcasting policy set out in section 
3(1).
<P>
	We know that cable companies have used negative option 
billing. There are 40 applicants which now want to get on the 
system and enter the homes of Canadians. There is a new method 
by which cable providers could still slide those services in without 
using negative option billing. If we assume there are four new 
channels, they will provide these services free for six or eight or 
twelve months and then will apply for a rate increase. We have the 
opportunity by this bill to stop these hybrid variations on negative 
option billing.
<P>
	There will be those who say this bill is not necessary. I have 
heard representations from public servants who maintain this 
legislation is not necessary; it can be done by regulation, it can be 
done by ministerial directive, it can be done by all sorts of 
methods. We know that regulation changes. Regulation is not law. 
It is not in a statute. All of us know that ministers come and go and 
that ministerial directives can easily be changed.
<P>
<B>(1815)</B>
<P>
	The only assurance anyone could possibly give would be that 
there is no assurance at the moment unless Bill C-216 is passed. We 
must embody in statute, in the Broadcasting Act, that this practice 
is policy in this country. On behalf of Canadian consumers we must 
be willing to build a firewall between the CRTC and the consuming 
public to ensure that this does not happen again, either directly as it 
did last year or in some other hybrid variation.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gaston Leroux (Richmond-Wolfe, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
am happy to speak to Bill C-216, an act to amend the Broadcasting 
Act, which was introduced by my colleague from 
Sarnia-Lambton. I am happy to participate in this debate both as 
the member for Richmond-Wolfe and as the official opposition's 
critic on heritage and cultural industries.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1320"> 1320 </A></B>
<P>
	I would like to tell my colleague from Sarnia-Lambton that 
I applaud his initiative because it clearly shows his concern for 
consumers, who are too often left to fend for themselves when 
dealing with organizations such as the CRTC. Also organizations 
like the CRTC and others often let things slide without taking a 
stand.
<P>
	The purpose of the bill introduced by the hon. member for 
Sarnia-Lambton is to protect consumers against a questionable 
business practice called negative option billing that forces people 
to pay for a cable service they did not request. They receive this 
service and, if they do not ask for it to be stopped, they are 
considered to have bought it.
<P>
	For the benefit of our listeners and my colleagues, I would like to 
put the situation in context. I would remind you that, by amending 
section 3 of the Broadcasting Act, this bill provides that a cable 
distributor should not demand money from a person for the 
provision or sale of a new programming service where the person 
has not agreed to receive the new service. It seems to me that, in 
our society, people should not have to pay for a product or service 
they did not ask for.
<P>
	This business practice of selling programming services to 
consumers who have not asked for them, which is called negative 
option billing, started in 1994 when the Canadian Radio-Television 
and Telecommunications Commission or CRTC granted eight new 
special cable service licences.
<P>
	Why were eight new licences issued? The CRTC had one main 
goal, namely to strengthen the Canadian presence in the Canadian 
broadcasting system in anticipation of this system being inundated 
by American services, thus preventing an American invasion of 
Canadian distribution systems.
<P>
	This goal in itself is certainly commendable. However, after this 
decision was made by the CRTC, in many cases, new channels 
were added to cable subscribers' discretionary service package. 
This means that those who already paid for a cable package now 
had this service added, and that made them angry. Why? Protests 
were sparked by this marketing strategy used by cable operators, 
which consists in imposing new and unrequested services on 
consumers and charging them extra for it.
<P>
	No one in this House has to pay nor wants to pay for services 
they never asked for, that appear out of nowhere.
<P>
<B>(1820)</B>
<P>
	The CRTC decision resulting from the public hearings on the 
industry's structure released in 1993 kicked off a number of 
regulatory reforms that were implemented when the eight 
dedicated cable broadcasting licences were issued. Marketing 
strategies based on negative optioning  were debated and tacitly 
agreed to, since the CRTC did not take a stand.
<P>
	The CRTC never regulated or attempted to regulate the negative 
optioning marketing practices of cable operators.
<P>
	It seems obvious that a deliberate choice was made not to make 
public statements on the appropriateness of such practices. The 
CRTC did not react. It gave tacit approval by letting cable 
distributors set the rules themselves. It seems that, in the past, such 
practices helped new specialty services succeed on the market, 
while also promoting the cultural development goals set out in the 
Broadcasting Act.
<P>
	So, the CRTC said: ``Since this has worked before, we will leave 
them alone''. Monopolizing consumers' ability to buy at their own 
expense is definitely a curious way to protect the culture of Quebec 
and Canada. Consumers are the ones who should decide on the 
content and the services they want.
<P>
	During the 1993 public hearings on the industry's structure, 
however, some witnesses expressed their concern regarding the 
negative option billing for new services. Later, consumer 
protection groups expressly asked that the Broadcasting Act be 
amended to force the CRTC to protect the interests of consumers, 
not just cultural interests, when regulating the monopoly that the 
cable television industry is.
<P>
	We agree that the content should be Canadian and should 
protected from neighbouring countries, but not at the expense of 
consumers, not by leaving them at the mercy of cable distributors. 
This does not make sense.
<P>
	Cable television subscribers had already started rebelling. The 
CRTC's way of looking after their interests was to merely urge 
cable distributors to pay greater attention to consumers' requests. It 
said to those who provide the service and make money in the 
process: ``Set your own rules, but please act properly''.
<P>
	In reality, the marketing component in the Canadian cable 
distribution industry is left to the association itself. In the end, the 
association is the one that sets the marketing standards advocated 
by the national Cable Television Standards Council. As regards this 
issue, it is clear that not only the CRTC but also the Liberal Party 
dragged their feet and did not take their responsibilities on time, 
since consumers had to send a wake up call.
<P>
	On January 5, one year after consumer associations protested 
against negative option billing, Rogers Broadcasting Ltd., the 
largest cable distributor in Canada and the initiator of that practice, 
gave up the idea and apologized for its mistake. The company 
called itself to order, which is a good sign. But it was the result of 
pressure from consumers and not the government acting 
responsibly and declaring that, in this field, the commercial 
practice was unacceptable. From now on, says the Canadian Cable 
Television Association, in an  attempt to reassure us, the practice of 
negative 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1321"> 1321 </A></B>
<P>
option billing is a thing of the past and the cable distribution 
industry will listen to consumers.
<P>
	Thus, the bill introduced by the hon. member for 
Sarnia-Lambton merely confirms a single practice. This brings 
me to the question of duplication. A single practice. The bill 
confirms an intrusion into the jurisdiction of provinces that have 
already taken responsibility in this area. This is not the case in all 
the provinces, I admit, but for Quebec particularly, where the 
Consumer Protection Act is strong and has been around for a long 
time, the proposal of similar legislation in the House of Commons 
represents a direct intrusion into one of Quebec's areas of 
jurisdiction.
<P>
<B>(1825)</B>
<P>
	I am pleased to see this initiative by the hon. member, because he 
is, to all intents and purposes, reminding his own government of its 
responsibilities. He has just told it: ``You have neglected the 
situation''. And unlike in Quebec and in another province that has a 
consumer protection act, in all the other provinces, no action is 
taken and cable distributors are asked to regulate themselves and 
decide on their own what the rules should be.
<P>
	The Government of Quebec has already established its 
jurisdiction by way of its Consumer Protection Act through a 
general prohibition on the sale of any service through negative 
option billing. Paragraph 230 (a) of this act is very clear. By 
regulating the commercialization of cable distribution services 
through an amendment to its Broadcasting Act, Ottawa reveals 
once again its determination to interfere in an area of provincial 
responsibility.
<P>
	In Quebec, however, any contractual agreement between a 
consumer and a cable distributor has been subject, since the 
introduction of these services, to the Consumer Protection Act.
<P>
	I must therefore reiterate that any such bill tabled in this House 
is very clearly a duplication of regulations and an intrusion of the 
federal government into the jurisdiction of the State of Quebec. It is 
not ill will on the part of the member. It is because his own 
government has not taken its responsibilities and he is calling it to 
order. He is also reminding the government that many provinces 
have no consumer protection legislation and that the present 
government, with the CRTC, is sending a very clear signal to cable 
distributors to take whatever action they see fit.
<P>
	In terms of the content of the bill and the concerns of the hon. 
member for Sarnia-Lambton, I would say to him that we think 
alike. But as for the principle of tabling a bill in this House that 
represents a direct intrusion into the province's area of jurisdiction, 
we have no choice, as the official opposition, but to vote against 
Bill C-216.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay East, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise to 
speak on behalf of the Reform Party. Our position on this bill, 
subject to individual members' votes, is that we would be 
supporting the bill.
<P>
	Part of the problem and one of the hesitations I had as heritage 
critic in recommending to my caucus that we look at supporting 
this bill is the fact that it does not really deal with the issue. It is a 
little band-aid on a great big problem.
<P>
	Anybody who comes to my home will see some of the 
construction I have done. It is really quite laughable and 
identifiable. There is a fairly broad piece of trim which covers up 
the error I made when I was trying to put the corners together. On 
top of that broad piece of trim is a medium size piece of trim to 
cover up the errors I made when I was crafting the broad piece of 
trim. Then there is a very small piece of trim which actually covers 
up the problem that was created with the medium size piece of 
trim. In other words, I am not a particularly good carpenter and it 
requires a tremendous amount of work to cover up the fact that the 
whole thing is being held together by chicken wire and chewing 
gum.
<P>
	It seems to me that is a word picture of what we have with the 
CRTC and the fact we are dealing with this issue. This bill is a 
band-aid, a small piece of trim on a far larger problem. This is the 
reason there was concern about supporting the bill.
<P>
<B>(1830 )</B>
<P>
	The heritage minister has called for a review of the CRTC. I am 
not sure how serious she was. It seems to me that just about every 
time she wakes up in the morning she has some new ideas and then 
her department has to run around after her picking up the pieces. 
Whether or not she was really serious about a CRTC review, I do 
not know.
<P>
	The problem is that there is a need for a CRTC review. The 
CRTC reflects what would be best classed as horse and carriage 
electronics. What I am saying is we have moved from the horse 
past the car to the jet, to the space age piece of equipment, while 
the CRTC mandate itself and the way it goes about doing its 
regulations is held back still feeding oats to the horse. An awful lot 
of the regulations show the results of feeding the oats to the horse 
by the road apples.
<P>
	The problem is the CRTC comes forward with the kind of 
regulations that it does, particularly the kind of decisions it makes 
with respect to content. It ends up effectively forcing the cable 
companies to find creative ways to get around the problem, that 
somehow they are going to have to get dollars for some of these 
programs and some of the content that is going to be put on the air.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1322"> 1322 </A></B>
<P>
	Clearly with the way the technology is right now in 1996 in the 
majority of homes in Canada, there cannot be  true competition in 
the cable industry. In fact, we have to go outside the cable industry, 
speaking of technology, in order to create competition for the cable 
industry.
<P>
	The marketplace probably would take care of this kind of 
negative option billing, this kind of high handed approach that was 
exercised by the cable companies in trying to come forward and get 
the revenue the CRTC said they had to get for these channels that 
nobody wanted. It would have worked out.
<P>
	For example, there would have been competition if we had had a 
coherent policy from this government with respect to direct to 
home satellite service. Right now the DTH and the decision cabinet 
made to not interfere with the CRTC is driving a grey market of 
gigantic proportions.
<P>
	Across the border from my constituency is a very small town in 
the northern area of Idaho. On a very busy day I do not think we 
would find 50 people in that town but amazingly there are 600 
mailboxes. I wonder why there would be 600 mailboxes for 50 
people. I bet it has something to do with the fact that if someone 
wants to get into the satellite grey market they have to have a post 
office box in their name in the United States. I will bet that is the 
answer.
<P>
	That is the reality of what is going on, not only to people who are 
adjacent to the border as my constituency is but to people further 
north, in northern areas of British Columbia and in northern areas 
of Alberta. That is what is going on in western Canada. Quite 
frankly if it is not happening in Atlantic Canada, Ontario, the 
prairies and Quebec, I would be very surprised. That is going on 
because of the very bad, antiquated, out of touch, out of date 
policies this government is having the CRTC enact. We are driving 
people to become electronic Americans. That is the shame of it.
<P>
	This is the same cabinet that made the decision not to interfere 
with, not to question the decisions that were made with respect to 
the direct to home satellite. This is the same cabinet which said: 
``No, we cannot do that''. It is the same cabinet which on the same 
day decided it was going to interfere for the second time with 
digital audio services that had been proposed by Shaw Cable. It 
defies logic to have people believe that the same cabinet which 
would not overturn the boneheaded position of the CRTC with 
respect to direct to home satellite service, on the same day by some 
coincidence would interfere with a Canadian company trying to 
bring digital audio services to Canadians on a Canadian service. It 
defies logic for the cabinet to suggest that it could not do one but 
could just happen to do the other.
<P>
<B>(1835)</B>
<P>
	It is for that reason, if the heritage minister is serious and if she 
is calling for a real CRTC review from top to bottom particularly 
with respect to its mandate, we would be fully supportive of that. 
However, I do have a caveat  on that as well. The difficulty is that 
these little mental droppings she gave to us about her thinking of 
having a CRTC review, which I happened to see in ink in the 
newspapers, indicated that she was going to have the CRTC review 
itself.
<P>
	Heaven forbid that we should get into another $2.5 million 
Juneau boondoggle as we did with the CBC review. That was pretty 
ridiculous when the budget for the CBC review I believe was struck 
at around $900,000 and the Canadian taxpayer ended up paying out 
over $2.5 million for it. I am not recommending that.
<P>
	On the other side of the coin I also think it is very short sighted, 
narrow minded and myopic on the part of the minister for her to 
say: ``Why don't we have a review of the CRTC by the CRTC for 
the CRTC so that it can tell me about the CRTC and what it should 
be doing''. The minister does not seem to have a tremendous 
amount of control over a lot of things, quite frankly.
<P>
	Let me get back to the issue of Bill C-216. The reason I support it 
and in spite of the fact that I see it as being a necessary little 
band-aid on the larger issue of whether the CRTC should be doing 
these things is that I do believe there has to be protection in our 
society for tactics that can be used by people in a broadly based 
commercial marketplace.
<P>
	Let me make my position really clear on that. I do not believe in 
overregulation in a narrow marketplace. The reason I do not 
believe in overregulation in a narrow marketplace is that I do 
believe in the basic assumption in business of caveat emptor, let the 
buyer beware. Far too often we try to mandate with government 
action things that could be better handled by the free market.
<P>
	In this instance, there is a very broadly based marketplace and 
there are seniors and people who require some protection. 
Therefore, I would support and I am recommending to my 
colleagues in the Reform Party to support Bill C-216 to afford that 
protection to a broadly based marketplace.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Alex Shepherd (Durham, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is a great 
pleasure to enter into the debate on Bill C-216 introduced by my 
colleague from the riding of Sarnia-Lambton. I applaud his 
initiative in this matter.
<P>
	Generally I recognize the importance of maintaining the cultural 
industries within our country. I believe it is part of the mandate of 
the CRTC to ensure that there is a cultural identity that goes from 
sea to sea to sea. I also believe this is part of its mandate that the 
CRTC attempts to do reasonably well.
<P>
	Having said that, I also realize that the concept of dividing up 
our country into areas where cable providers can function is a 
method of granting monopolies. From someone who believes in 
free competitive forces in the marketplace, I have initial 
reservations about that process.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1323"> 1323 </A></B>
<P>
	I have also realized that there is a significant advantage to 
Canadians rationalizing their marketplace to provide enough 
revenue for some of these businesses to do research and 
development. We are talking about convergence in the 
communications businesses throughout Canada. Canada has been 
able to compete internationally and allow the penetration in 
telecommunications because we have taken these initiatives.
<P>
<B>(1840)</B>
<P>
	When creating a monopoly it must be done with a certain degree 
of caution. We do not want people to use their market areas in such 
a way that they disadvantage their customers. This is the essence of 
the bill. It attempts to address a practice which for some reason has 
become acceptable to the cablevision industry but clearly is not 
acceptable to everyday Canadians. Why do I say that?
<P>
	Most of my riding is serviced by the Rogers cablevision network 
system, on which I do a program once every two weeks. When this 
process of negative option billing was introduced, there was an 
immediate outrage among my constituents. It would appear that 
governments had allowed the monopolistic part of the CRTC 
regulatory environment to gouge them. It was not really any 
different from a neighbourhood theatre sending a bill to someone 
for a movie they have never seen or ever desire to see. This is what 
we did to average Canadians.
<P>
	It was not that Canadians were upset about the concept of 
Canadian content. Maybe if somebody took the time to explain to 
them the need for Canadian content, they would pay more 
themselves directly or they would agree to support it through their 
governmental system, as we do with the CBC, or possibly through 
public broadcasting arrangements. The bottom line is that they 
were not given the choice and that is what upset them.
<P>
	I talked to my local cablevision company to see what was the 
fallout to this, what actually happened after the smoke cleared. 
Rogers said it was sorry and so on but the bottom line is that most 
people, after having been given the option to send in a little card to 
say they want out of the system, did not do that. In reality, the 
negative option billing system was successful for Rogers and that 
industry.
<P>
	Why do we need negative option billing in the first place? It is 
interesting to note a comment from Mr. Watson who was a director 
at the time. He said: ``Outlawing the negative option sales 
tactic''-I underline the word tactic-``would decrease 
subscribers' acceptance rates, cut cablevision services expected 
revenue and choke new channel source of cable fees and 
advertising''. What he is saying is that this tactic was designed for 
the express purpose of making people pay for things they would not 
normally have. He is saying that if they were given this choice, 
they probably would not do it.
<P>
	We have set up a governmental process that is unacceptable to 
the average Canadian. It is clear that the essence of this bill is to 
address that wrong. For that reason, it is highly appropriate.
<P>
	A number of other things were going on in the cablevision 
industry at that time. There was a concept of consolidation. In my 
area it used to be Maclean's. Maclean's became Rogers and Rogers 
became a huge organization. Part of that consolidation cost a lot of 
money. People got some money out of this. They were paid off and 
so forth. How will that be financed for rationalization? It will be 
done through a fee structure. That is exactly what this is all about. 
The CRTC acquiesced in that situation. Possibly it saw the 
rationalization of the cablevision market to be a long term goal for 
Canada. Maybe it is. I have not really taken the time to study all 
that.
<P>
<B>(1845)</B>
<P>
	However, the bottom line was that Rogers, in particular, gave a 
new definition to the word over-extended. Indeed, by subsequently 
reducing its rates, I suspect it is having financial problems.
<P>
	Nobody took the average Canadian into consideration. Some of 
my colleagues have noted that at least two provinces already have 
legislation in place that prohibits negative option billing. In 
addition, the industry is attempting to develop the technology to 
give recipients of cablevision the choice.
<P>
	At the time, a Regina company had the facilities to give certain 
numbers, approximately 9,000 of its 50,000 subscribers the option 
to say no. If they did not want certain channels coming into their 
houses they did not have to pay for it.
<P>
	The industry realizes the importance of individual choice. As I 
understand it, the industry is now working on the technology to 
provide that very service. In four or five years from now people 
will have the choice of channels. They recognize the importance of 
consumer choice. It appears that the menace of negative option 
billing is still within the system today. The purpose of this bill is to 
eliminate it.
<P>
	In conclusion, I believe this has told us that we must have 
another way to sell Canadian content. Maybe we need to allow free 
access to home environments for a period of time so that people 
can become adjusted to new programming and learn to accept or 
reject it. People cannot be charged for services they did not ask for. 
It is just not fair within the existing marketing system.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Svend J. Robinson (Burnaby-Kingsway, NDP):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I will be very brief.
<P>
	I want to take this opportunity on behalf of my colleagues in the 
New Democratic Party to indicate our support for the bill that has 
been proposed by the member for Sarnia-Lambton.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1324"> 1324 </A></B>
<P>
	As the member of Parliament for Burnaby-Kingsway, I recall 
the tremendous sense of outrage and the anger of my constituents 
at the time that Rogers Cable proposed the negative option billing. 
There were many calls and letters. I spoke out at the time against 
that option and urged the government to move forward with strong 
and effective legislation. Therefore, I am pleased to see that this 
bill is now before the House.
<P>
	I also want to note that the New Democratic government of 
British Columbia has also shown national leadership on the issue. I 
know that members of the House and those watching would want to 
know that the B.C. New Democratic government has shown 
leadership and has moved on this front at the provincial level under 
consumer legislation to ban negative option billing in the province 
of British Columbia.
<P>
	However, this is a matter that falls within federal jurisdiction 
under broadcast regulations. I welcome the opportunity to support 
the legislation and I hope members of the House will pass this bill.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John English (Kitchener, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, like the other 
speakers in the debate on Bill C-216, I too received hundreds of 
calls over a period of one week in my constituency office. This 
issue is perhaps the one on which I have received the most calls 
during my period as a member of Parliament. One resident of 
Kitchener continues to call me every two or three days on this 
topic.
<P>
	The importance of this issue to my constituents is clear. I do not 
intend to talk today about the questions which have been raised by 
the member for Kootenay East or the member for Durham, which 
were on technology and the CRTC regulations in general.
<P>
<B>(1850 )</B>
<P>
	The questions of negative option billing and consumer choice 
are important to me and to my constituents. Negative option billing 
is not something new to the cable industry in Canada. It is a 
practice which has been sanctioned and condoned by the CRTC. 
With the rapid change in telecommunications and the way in which 
television is delivered with black box decoders and satellite dishes, 
the cable industry faces major difficulties in adjusting to market 
changes.
<P>
	We know fairly clearly what is in the cable companies' interests 
in this regard, but we must ask ourselves what is in the interests of 
the consumers.
<P>
	When this issue first arose and when I heard about the intention 
of the hon. member for Sarnia-Lambton to introduce this bill, I 
immediately decided that I would second it when he asked me to do 
so. I did so because of the interests of my consumers and also 
because this practice raises other problems in the area of consumer 
choice.
<P>
	Some have spoken about Canadian content and have seen that 
issue to be of particular difficulty. I do not  share that concern. In 
fact I talked to many of my constituents about their reaction to the 
action by the Rogers cable system. It led some of them to be 
concerned about Canadian content. Indeed, they even suggested 
imposing higher Canadian content rules because of negative option 
billing. In short, there were unintended consequences of the action 
which impaired the support that Canadian cultural content has had 
in Canadian broadcasting.
<P>
	There is a danger. Canadian content is very important. The 
CRTC, through its regulations, has accomplished some fairly 
important things. It has promoted the Canadian music industry.
<P>
	We have heard a great deal about Alanis Morissette recently. At 
the Grammy awards Canadian entertainers did extremely well. 
CRTC practices may have in fact created this very strong and 
vibrant Canadian music industry.
<P>
	Canadians, in general, support the cultural practices of previous 
governments in supporting the CRTC and its regulations. However, 
they do not support a policy which misleads consumers. As the 
hon. member for Durham said a few moments ago, this is a tactic 
which has developed. People take these channels without realizing 
the additional cost. Even after the controversy ended, it turned out 
that most did not opt out.
<P>
	This approach undermines moral principles. The CRTC received 
a lot of criticism. Rogers cable system admitted that this practice 
would not be accepted. There was negative publicity about the 
entire industry. The fact that negative option billing still exists is 
unacceptable to all Canadians.
<P>
	The government should listen to the statements which were 
made by consumer groups. The Consumers' Association of Canada 
was mentioned earlier. I would like to read into the record a 
statement which was made by the executive director of the

<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The new telecommunications environment is about competition and 
choice-this Bill will help to make sure that Canadians are informed and willing 
consumers of cable services.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Of course the bill she was talking about is Bill C-216.
<P>
	The executive director of the Public Interest Advocacy Centre 
stated:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Bill C-216 drags the regulation of the Canadian cable industry into the 
twentieth century. Governments have long recognized that consumers should 
not pay for unsolicited goods. No matter what the motive is behind negative 
option marketing, it is an abuse that must be corrected.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Further, Michael Janigan of the Public Interest Advocacy Centre 
stated:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>This Bill is an important precedent for the future, when multi-media program 
services will be fighting for a niche on the Information Highway. Consumers 
have every right to know what they are receiving and to obtain only what they 
request.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
	The consumers of Canada have spoken. The member for 
Sarnia-Lambton has listened and I stand with him supporting the 
interests of the consumers of Canada.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Maloney (Erie, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to 
speak on private member's Bill C-216, an act to amend the 
Broadcasting Act with respect to broadcasting policy, put forward 
by my colleague from Sarnia-Lambton.
<P>
	In the week between Christmas and New Years in 1994, my 
office, like those of my colleagues, received a deluge of calls from 
Erie constituents who were concerned with their cable package and 
the billing option that was to take effect on January 1, 1995. They 
were angry and they had had enough. I certainly did not fault them. 
They were right. Negative option billing is unacceptable.
<P>
	I am in favour of Bill C-216 because it would ban negative 
option billing. It would apply not only to cable companies but to 
any other company that provided a distribution undertaking which 
is defined under the Broadcasting Act as ``an undertaking for the 
reception of broadcasting and the retransmission thereof by radio 
waves or other means of telecommunications to more than one 
permanent or temporary residence or dwelling unit or to another 
such undertaking''.
<P>
	Today we are looking at more players entering the market for 
broadcasting services such as telephone and satellite companies 
which will soon provide competition to cable companies. By 
passing Bill C-216 we can ban negative option billing for new 
programming services no matter who provides them.
<P>
	My constituents were calling me because the cable companies 
are federally regulated by the Canadian Radio-television and 
Telecommunications Commission, commonly referred to as the 
CRTC.
<P>
	In 1994 the CRTC licensed six new English language and two 
new French language specialty services. The commission's two 
primary objectives in doing this were to strengthen the Canadian 
presence in the Canadian broadcasting system, especially in 
anticipation of an invasion by American direct to home satellite 
services and to ensure that the widest possible selection of new 
Canadian services would be available at a reasonable cost.
<P>
	I support these objectives. I support strong Canadian content and 
a strong Canadian presence in the entertainment industry. However, 
this cannot be achieved by taking advantage of the Canadian 
consumer. My constituents were not upset there were eight new 
channels on January 1, 1995. They were angry because they would 
automatically be billed for a service they did not request. They felt 
manipulated through higher fees and the repackaging and 
repositioning of channels-
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> I am very sorry to interrupt. 
Unfortunately the time has expired.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Arseneault:</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. The hon. 
member is in the middle of his speech. We are wondering if he 
could have the unanimous consent of the House to finish. Perhaps 
the Speaker would not see the clock for the remainder of this 
member's speech.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Is there unanimous consent to let the 
member have three more minutes to finish his speech, if that is 
sufficient?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Maloney:</B> Mr. Speaker, I appreciate your indulgence and 
that of my hon. colleagues.
<P>
	In recent years Canadian producers have proved themselves to 
be formidable broadcasters, able to compete at home and around 
the world in the fields of drama and entertainment. Many of these 
new specialty channels licensed by the CRTC offer excellent 
programming and would have survived without having to be forced 
on anyone. However, I am afraid that the consumer backlash did 
little to enhance the popularity of the new specialty channels.
<P>
	On January 5, 1995 a major cable company had partially 
capitulated, apologizing for its mistake in not presenting the new 
services as a separate discretionary package. It offered consumers 
the choice of keeping only their current package of specialty 
services at additional fees. However, the much disputed negative 
option marketing scheme used to launch the new line-up remained 
firmly in place, leaving the onus on the consumer to refuse the new 
package.
<P>
	This brings me to my role as a parliamentarian and a 
representative of my constituents in this House. Some would argue 
this is a consumer rights issue under the jurisdiction of the 
provinces but provincial consumer laws do not apply to cable 
companies which are clearly under federal authority.
<P>
	I do not understand how the protection of the choice of Canadian 
cable consumers is a matter outside of federal broadcasting 
jurisdiction, as some have suggested. Section 5 of the federal 
Broadcasting Act creates an obligation for the CRTC to regulate 
and supervise all aspects of the Canadian broadcasting system with 
a view to implementing the broadcasting policy set out in the act. 
Proposed changes to section 3 of the Broadcasting Act would ban 
the practice of negative option billing for new programming 
services.

<B>(1900)</B>
<P>
	There is no doubt that over the next decade the cable industry 
will change drastically. More and more consumers are beginning to 
demand that they pay only for those channels they want. However, 
I understand the technology to allow this is not to be realized until 
the turn of the century. Thus television and the cable  industry are 
currently in a period of transition. Program selection is increasing 
but the technology to give viewers real choice has not yet arrived.
<P>
	In May 1994 the CRTC chairman acknowledged that television 
consumers want more control: ``Consumers want, deserve and will 
increasingly settle for nothing less than the maximum control 
possible over which services they select and pay for. As a consumer 
and the CRTC chairman, I agree 100 per cent with this goal''.
<P>
	Cable television services in Canada are distributed either as part 
of a basic service or on an discretionary basis. Basic cable service 
is a standard package of services provided to all subscribers within 
a cable company's service area. It consists of a number of 
mandatory or priority Canadian programming services, including 
the CBC English and French network services, local and regional 
stations, provincial educational services, a community channel as 
well as various optional services.
<P>
	The proposed changes in my colleague's bill are timely because 
commencing May 6 of this year the CRTC will consider licensing 
more TV channels and all these new channels will be scrambling 
for an audience. My constituents must be allowed to make a 
positive choice to obtain these services. Some may not realize a 
response is necessary or even possible. Some may inadvertently 
forget. They do not want to have to call their cable company to say 
stop these extra channels.
<P>
	I criticize the negative option billing approach used to introduce 
the new services on the grounds of fairness and consumers' right to 
choose. Consumers should have the right to select the brand of 
programming they want rather than having it imposed on them by a 
paternalistic regulator and monopolistic industry.
<P>
	Negative option marketing favours corporations and 
disempowers consumers. The Broadcasting Act is too one sided in 
requiring the CRTC to protect only Canadian cultural interest, not 
consumer interest.
<P>
	As MPs we have a golden opportunity to respond to Canadian 
consumers who demanded that we put an end to negative option 
billing for new programming services. Government have long 
recognized that consumers should not pay for unsolicited goods. 
No matter what the motive behind negative option marketing, it is 
an abuse that must be corrected.
<P>
	I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The item is dropped to the bottom of the 
order of precedence on the Order Paper, the time having expired.
<P>

<P>
	A motion to adjourn the House under Standing Order 38 deemed 
to have been moved.
<P>
<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="HEALTH">HEALTH</A></H4>
	<B>Mr. Svend J. Robinson (Burnaby-Kingsway, NDP):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, March 31, a profoundly important deadline for Canada's 
medicare system, is approaching.
<P>
	Earlier this month I asked a question of the Minister of Health 
concerning the impact of NAFTA on Canada's medicare system. I 
asked the minister to show some leadership with respect to some 
very serious differences in interpretation of NAFTA and its impact 
on the medicare system in Canada.
<P>
	It was on March 13, the day I asked the question, that a legal 
opinion was made public by Dr. Brian Schwartz, a respected 
lawyer. He indicated that there are serious ambiguities in annex II 
of the NAFTA agreement. He went on to note in his legal opinion 
that there are a number of grey areas that exist in the health care 
sector, and that U.S. providers and their federal government will be 
exerting political and economic pressure on Canada and the 
provinces to open up markets.
<P>
	He went on to point out that United States trade representative 
Mickey Kantor has issued an interpretation of annex II of the 
NAFTA agreement that is very alarming because it opens wide a 
tax on Canada's medicare system. Mickey Kantor said that if social 
services are supplied by a private firm on a profit or not for profit 
basis, chapter 11 and chapter 12 apply.
<P>
	In other words, what he is saying is that the United States 
considers Canadian not for profit health providers subject to the 
full force of NAFTA's investment and services rule. That means 
they are wide open to big American for profit corporations to move 
in on those sectors.
<P>
<B>(1905)</B>
<P>
	Much of Canada's health care system is delivered through the 
non-profit sector. A large majority of our health delivery takes 
place in the private sector through non-profit agencies such as 
hospitals, labs, nursing homes, community clinics, regional health 
boards and so on.
<P>
	If our government and if the Minister of Health do not stand up 
for Canadian medicare and do not reject this interpretation by the 
United States trade representative vigorously, it is clear we will 
open up the Canadian medicare system to U.S. corporate health 
care giants. We know the power of these giants. They have taken on 
Bill Clinton on health care reform.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="1327"> 1327 </A></B>
<P>
	I support the B.C. minister of health, Andrew Petter, who has 
shown leadership on this issue. I urge the Government of Canada to 
show the same kind of leadership and to stand up and say we will 
protect the Canadian medicare system against this kind of narrow 
interpretation of the United States trade representative.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Joseph Volpe (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Health, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it goes without saying that we are 
better than prepared on this and we will not shirk any of our 
commitments and that medicare is one of the highest priorities of 
the government. It will not be unprotected in NAFTA or open to 
competition by the NAFTA signatories.
<P>
	The federal government has been working for over a year with 
the provinces to ensure the broadest possible protection for our 
health system within the existing provisions of NAFTA.
<P>
	In recent weeks the Minister of Health has been working very 
closely with his colleagues, the Minister of Foreign Affairs and the 
Minister for International Trade, to clarify and resolve the issue.
<P>
	Within NAFTA, Canada, the U.S. and Mexico each has its own 
social service reservations entitled annex II which exempts health 
and other social services from key NAFTA requirements such as 
the most favoured nation or national treatment. This exemption 
protects our health system. It means Canada and provincial 
governments maintain the flexibility and control they need to 
operate and decide what is best for the health system.
<P>
	The exemption for health and other services applies to the extent 
that these sectors exist for ``a public purpose''. Each of the NAFTA 
partners must interpret the meaning of public purpose to the 
situation in its own country. NAFTA does not make that definition.
<P>
	The scope and coverage of annex II are being interpreted as 
broadly as possible to provide maximum protection for Canada's 
health system. The great majority of health services exist for public 
service and are considered to fall within the exemption of annex II 
reservation.
<P>
	I know you are trying to get me to close, Mr. Speaker, but 
perhaps you will allow me to make the point the hon. member 
opposite so clearly wants to have made. Do I have the unanimous 
consent of the House?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Robinson:</B> Mr. Speaker, on a point of order, I welcome the 
opportunity to give unanimous consent to the member to clarify the 
government's position with respect to Mickey Kantor's very 
narrow interpretation.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> My reading of the clock is that the 
member's time has expired. Is there unanimous consent to let the 
member have another 30 seconds to finish his answer?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Volpe:</B> Mr. Speaker, I will try to address the government's 
policy, which is what the member wants to hear. Canada's 
interpretation of annex II includes the fact that the test of a public 
purpose under NAFTA is not restricted to whether a health service 
is wholly funded or insured by a provincial health insurance plan.
<P>
	Annex II is the main protection for our health system. For health 
services wholly funded by provincial health plans there is no 
question of exemption under NAFTA. Under annex I, with its 
March 31, 1996 deadline, there is also provision-
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The time has now expired. The House 
stands adjourned until tomorrow at 10 a.m.
<P>
	(The House adjourned at 7.09 p.m.)
