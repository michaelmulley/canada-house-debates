<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="POINTOFORDER">POINT OF ORDER</A></H3>
<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="PRIVATEMEMBERS'BUSINESS">PRIVATE MEMBERS' BUSINESS</A></H4>
	<B>Mr. Ray Speaker (Lethbridge, Ref.):</B> Madam Speaker, I rise on 
a point of order which I will make very brief. I know there is a very 
important debate on Bill C-33 before the House.
<P>
	This point of order is relative to the business of the House 
tomorrow and concerns the private member's motion in the name 
of the member for Glengarry-Prescott-Russell, which is listed 
as Motion No. M-2 on today's Order Paper. This motion is 
scheduled for debate tomorrow during private members' hour and I 
believe that you should rule it out of order.
<P>
	Beauchesne's sixth edition states that the conduct of a member 
may only be discussed in the House of Commons by way of a 
substantive or a distinct motion, that is, a self-contained proposal 
submitted for the approval of the House and drafted in such a way 
as to be capable of expressing a decision to the House.
<P>
	That is a very key point. This is the first time that a motion 
charging another member with contempt has been scheduled for 
debate under the new rules governing private members' business.
<P>
	Before the rule change, all private members' items were votable. 
If a member attempted to use a private members' motion to charge 
another member with contempt under the old rules, the motion 
would be automatically votable.
<P>
	The situation in which we find ourselves today is a first. It will 
be the first time that the House receives a non-votable motion that 
charges another member with contempt. If allowed, it will set a 
dangerous practice because there is no conclusion at the end of the 
process.
<P>
	If a member is going to make a charge against another member, 
then he or she had better present the House with a votable motion. 
If you are going to make a charge you had better put your money 
where your mouth is.  Anything else would be unjust, improper and 
against the practices of the House.
<P>
	If this motion is allowed to come forward, we will be engaging 
in an unfair and dishonest hit and run attack on a member. It is 
unparliamentary and unethical because of a loophole.
<P>
	When the rules changed, no one considered the point I am 
raising today regarding a charge of contempt. The subcommittee on 
private members' business, or the committee it reports to, does not 
have the power to deny debate on this motion. Also, it is not 
obliged to automatically deem such motions votable. That is why it 
is up to you, Madam Speaker, to decide whether or not it is right to 
deal with this matter. I ask for your guidance.
<P>
	Charging another member with contempt of Parliament is not 
something we in this House take lightly. Considering that every 
reference and every precedent of a charge of contempt against 
another member from Erskine May, Beauchesne, Maingot's 
<I>Parliamentary Privilege in Canada</I>, without exception, take the 
form of a votable motion, we should not now break with this 
practice and allow a motion charging a member with contempt to 
go forward if we are not prepared to take action.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Don Boudria (Glengarry-Prescott-Russell, Lib.):</B> 
Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of order. There are a few things 
wrong with what we just heard.
<P>
	What we are discussing is whether or not the motion in reference 
to the Reform Party, wanting itself to be designated as the official 
opposition, is the whole issue to which we are referring to. I have 
not heard that party, particularly this week, asking that it be 
designated as the official opposition.
<P>
	That is a debate for another time. The facts are that, first, the 
clerk of the private members' business was informed yesterday-it 
can be verified-that I am unavailable to debate the motion 
tomorrow. That is a matter of record. The notice was sent yesterday 
and that can be confirmed.
<P>
	Second, the proposition brought to your attention, Madam 
Speaker, as a point of order this morning is irreceivable because the 
matter is not before the House at the time we are having this 
conversation.
<P>
	Third, I find it rather ironic that someone is complaining that my 
motion has not been designated by a committee of which I am not a 
member to be votable.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2524"> 2524 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Ringuette-Maltais):</B> It is my 
understanding that tomorrow the motion in question will not be 
debated because the clerk has received advice that the hon. 
member is not available. I will take your point of order under 
consideration and will come back to the House with a ruling.

<P>
	I wish to point out that, during the previous legislature, the

all the organizations that have appeared before the committee, 
including the representative of the Office of the United Nations 
High Commissioner for Refugees, levelled some very harsh

<P>
	He said: Mr. Speaker, the impact of drug use on youth is a 
significant problem of ongoing concern to Canadians that must be 
addressed. Protection of our youth is a primary concern. By 
increasing penalties on pushers who deal drugs near schools we 
will deter criminals from trafficking drugs in and around those 
schools.

<B>(1015)</B>
<P>
	This bill amends the Food and Drug Act and the Narcotic 
Control Act to impose minimum prison sentences of one year for 
the first offence and two years for a further offence in cases where a 
person is convicted of trafficking a controlled or restricted drug or 
a narcotic within 500 metres of an elementary school or a high

<P>
	Drug related crime was estimated to be the source of 85 per cent 
of all criminal activity in Canada in 1992. This bill will address

<P>
	The petitioners request that Parliament not amend the human

to heterosexual couples should not be extended to same sex 
relations, and whereas societal approval including these privileges 
would be given to same sex relations if amendments were made to 
the human rights code, they therefore pray and request that 
Parliament not amend the human rights act to indicate societal

	They pray and request that Parliament oppose any amendments 
to the Canadian Human Rights Act or any other federal legislation 
that will provide for the inclusion of the phrase sexual orientation.
<P>
	The second petition is along the same lines. People in and around 
my riding pray and request that Parliament not amend the human 
rights act or the charter of rights and freedoms in anyway that 
would tend to indicate societal approval of same sex relationships

which continues to occupy East Timor, has inflicted violence and 
has caused the deaths of hundreds of thousands of East Timorese.

	<B>Mr. Martin Cauchon (for Minister of Justice and Attorney 
General of Canada, Lib.)</B> moved that Bill C-33, an act to amend 
the Canadian Human Rights Act, be read the third time and passed.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gordon Kirkby (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Justice and Attorney General of Canada, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, 
I am pleased today to speak on third reading of Bill C-33, an act to 
amend the Canadian Human Rights Act.
<P>
	With this amendment we will fulfil a political commitment to 
the people of Canada and implement a long standing policy of the 
Liberal Party of Canada. This amendment will bring the Canadian 
Human Rights Act up to date with court decisions, with the 
Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, and with the human 
rights legislation of the majority of the provinces which already 
have such legislation in place. It will give effect to the fundamental 
principle and value in Canadian society that individuals should be 
treated fairly.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2527"> 2527 </A></B>
<P>
	The commitment is clear. The Prime Minister said during the 
last election campaign this amendment would be introduced. In 
the 1994 throne speech the government promised amendments to 
the Canadian Human Rights Act. Since then the Minister of Justice 
has repeated the commitment.
<P>
	The position of the Liberal Party of Canada is clear and has been 
so for a long time. The amendment has been the policy of the 
Liberal Party for nearly 20 years.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Nearly 20 years ago, the Liberal Party passed a resolution in 
support of offering protection against discrimination on the basis of 
sexual orientation.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Further resolutions to this effect have been passed, most recently 
two weeks ago at the Liberal Party meeting in Windsor, Ontario. In 
1985 an all-party House of Commons committee unanimously 
passed a resolution that this amendment should be made.
<P>
	The position of the Liberal Party of Canada has for many years 
been to prohibit discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation. 
Having formed the government we are following through on the 
commitment.
<P>
	Now I would like to talk about Bill C-33, its purpose and its 
effect. It is important to look at this carefully and objectively so 
that we clearly understand what the bill does and what the bill does 
not do. I have listened to the debate on the bill and I want to address 
the misconceptions and misperceptions that may exist about it.
<P>
	Let us talk about the scope of the Canadian Human Rights Act. I 
think this has sometimes been lost in the debate so far. It is 
important to remember the real scope of the Canadian Human 
Rights Act.
<P>
<B>(1030 )</B>
<P>
	First, the act applies only to employment and the provision of 
goods and services coming under federal jurisdiction.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	This includes the federal government and federally regulated 
employers such as banks, railway companies, air transportation and 
telecommunications common carriers.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Second, this means that only about 10 per cent of the Canadian 
workforce is covered by the Canadian Human Rights Act. The rest 
of the workforce is covered by provincial and territorial human 
rights codes. The vast majority of employers and service providers 
come under provincial jurisdiction. Religious, cultural and 
educational institutions come under provincial  jurisdiction and 
therefore are subject to the provincial codes, not the federal codes.
<P>
	The scope of the Canadian Human Rights Act and this bill is 
limited to what I have heard said about it. This brings me to another 
very important point. This amendment is hardly revolutionary and 
hardly new, not only in respect of the Canadian Human Rights Act 
but in respect of all those areas to which, as I have said, the 
Canadian Human Rights Act does not apply but provincial laws and 
the charter of rights and freedoms do apply.
<P>
	Sexual orientation is already in the majority of human rights 
laws by court order or by legislative action. Eight provinces or 
territories with 90 per cent of the population in Canada have 
already added sexual orientation to their human rights legislation, 
that is, to prohibit discrimination on the grounds of sexual 
orientation within the provincial legislation: Quebec, Ontario, 
Manitoba, Yukon, Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, British Columbia, 
and my own province of Saskatchewan. Some of these provinces 
implemented this legislation as long as 20 years ago.
<P>
	The Supreme Court of Canada has held that section 15 of the 
Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, part of the Constitution 
and thus part of the supreme law of the land, prohibits 
discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation.
<P>
	The Ontario Court of Appeal ordered in 1992 in the case of Haig 
v. Canada that the Canadian Human Rights Act should be treated as 
though sexual orientation were already a prohibited ground of 
discrimination. Since that ruling, cases have been dealt with in 
legal fora under the act regardless of this amendment.
<P>
	This amendment merely confirms what has already been put in 
place by the courts. The amendment in Bill C-33 will bring the 
Canadian Human Rights Act into conformity with these court 
rulings and with the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.
<P>
	It is time for parliamentarians to act on this. Canadians should 
not have to turn in cases such as this where we are dealing with 
discrimination or protection against discrimination to find out what 
the law is. The law should be plain on its face and there for 
everybody to see.
<P>
	The law is composed of statutes, court decisions and common 
law. When a court decision has the effect of changing or modifying 
a statute, it is important that the court decision changes the statute 
in a manner which reflects or deals with the court decision so the 
law is plain on the face of it.
<P>
<B>(1035)</B>
<P>
	Courts have made these types of decisions for many many years, 
even before the charter of rights and freedoms came into effect. 
Legislatures and Parliaments across this land since then have dealt 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2528"> 2528 </A></B>
<P>
with legislation that  has been altered or modified by court 
decisions to make the legislation more clear.
<P>
	It is the responsibility of Parliament to articulate and codify 
principles of equality. This should not be left to the courts. I have 
listened to some people suggest that we have not had time enough 
to debate this issue, which is not so. This issue has been around for 
20 years. It has been discussed and debated. Parliament has 
addressed this issue many times.
<P>
	There have been many private members' bills. There was 
legislation introduced by the previous government. There has been 
an all-party report by a parliamentary committee which held 
hearings across Canada. The Supreme Court of Canada has 
addressed the issue. The government has received countless letters 
and submissions. The elected legislatures of eight jurisdictions in 
Canada with almost 90 per cent of the population have voted to 
enact such amendments.
<P>
	Much has been said on this issue and much time has been taken 
already. The issues are clear and now it is time to make a decision. I 
know there are strong feelings and beliefs on this issue which I 
respect. As a matter of fairness and justice we have to address this 
issue. It is an issue of how we treat people in the workplace and in 
the marketplace. We have tried to explain this.
<P>
	I will take the opportunity to talk about what this amendment 
does and does not do. This amendment will prevent basic forms of 
discrimination. It is to prevent what we all agree is unjust: firing 
someone from a job because they are gay or lesbian; denying 
someone service at a bank because they are gay or lesbian. This is a 
matter of simple fairness. Canadians do not think it is fair to fire 
someone from a job or refuse them service only because they are 
gay or lesbian.
<P>
	I have heard it suggested that this bill provides special rights. 
Nothing could be further from the truth. Bill C-33 will not give 
special rights to anyone. If an individual is discriminated against 
on the basis of colour, whether black or white, they are protected by 
human rights legislation. If an individual is discriminated against 
on the ground of religion, be they Protestant, Catholic, Jewish, 
Muslim or some other religion, they are protected by human rights 
legislation. Similarly, if an individual is discriminated against on 
the basis of sexual orientation, be they heterosexual or 
homosexual, human rights legislation offers protection.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Protection against discrimination on the basis of sexual 
orientation at the federal level means that a person who has been 
fired by an air carrier or a railway company or was denied service 
by a bank is offered a remedy under human rights legislation.
<P>
<B>(1040 )</B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Human rights laws are intended to ensure that individuals can be 
hired and employed and services provided to them on the same 
basis as everyone else, not to be fired or refused a service merely 
because of their colour, religion, sex or sexual orientation. This is 
not special treatment; it is the very opposite. It is intended to stop 
employers or service businesses from singling out homosexuals, 
blacks or religious minorities and instead treat them the same as 
everyone else. This is not special rights. It is equal treatment.
<P>
	The law will protect heterosexuals as well as homosexuals. But it 
is clear that it will protect those who need the protection the most, 
that part of our society that has been subject to historical 
disadvantages and stereotyping, to discrimination and worse. The 
evidence is clear. Gay bashing, discrimination within the 
workplace, discrimination in obtaining goods and services: 
tribunals and courts are replete with such examples of 
discrimination and we must move to remedy that situation.
<P>
	The Parliamentary committee that looked at this issue wrote as 
follows:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>We were shocked by a number of the experiences of unfair treatment related 
to us by homosexuals in different parts of the country. We heard about the 
harassment of and violence committed against homosexuals. We were told in 
graphic detail about physical abuse and psychological oppression suffered by 
homosexuals.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	The amendments will reinforce the message that Canadians do 
not tolerate prejudice and discrimination. We will not permit our 
colleagues, our friends, our relatives, our sons or daughters, our 
fellow citizens to suffer simply because of their sexual orientation.
<P>
	What is the impact on the family, on marriage, on other societal 
institutions? The bill will not detract from marriage and family. 
Marriage, whether it is solemnized according to provincial laws or 
is common law, and the family are fundamental parts of our 
society. Nothing is going to change that. In our laws, our policies, 
our practices, we will continue to provide support to these 
institutions. That will not change now or ever.
<P>
	The preamble of Bill C-33 makes this abundantly clear. It 
recognizes the family as the foundation of Canadian society. It also 
affirms that the amendment will not alter the fundamental role of 
family in our society.
<P>
	As mentioned above, the Canadian Human Rights Act deals with 
discrimination in employment and the provision of goods and 
services. It is not broader than that; it is not more than that. I will 
repeat it again because this has been the source of some 
misunderstanding. The Canadian Human Rights Act and the 
amendment we are dealing with deals with discrimination in 
employment and the provision of goods  and services only. The 
purpose of the preamble 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2529"> 2529 </A></B>
<P>
is to keep the focus on this and to make it clear that the amendment 
will not detract from the importance of the family.
<P>
	What about marriage? This amendment cannot change marriage 
because the Canadian Human Rights Act has absolutely no 
application to marriage. The act applies to employment and the 
provision of goods and services. Maxwell Yalden, chief 
commissioner of the Canadian Human Rights Commission, said 
last month before the Senate committee studying Bill S-2: ``We are 
not talking about who is married and who is not married. That is 
none of the business of our commission''.
<P>
<B>(1045)</B>
<P>
	That is right. The Canadian Human Rights Act simply does not 
apply to marriage. The common law has always provided that 
marriage is the union of a man and a woman. The common law has 
equal force with the statute law.
<P>
	When this law was challenged under section 15 of the charter, 
protection against the discrimination on the basis of sexual 
orientation, the court held: ``The common law limitation of 
marriage to persons of the opposite sex does not constitute 
discrimination''. This is the law across Canada.
<P>
	The inclusion of sexual orientation in the charger and in the 
majority of provincial human rights statutes has not changed this. 
As I said, the Canadian Human Rights Act and this bill cannot 
change this because they, without a doubt, have no application to 
the laws on marriage.
<P>
	I have also heard people worry about the grounds of family 
status in the act. In 1993 the Supreme Court of Canada decided in 
the Mossop case that family status does not include same sex 
relationships. That was the decision of the court then and it remains 
the law today.
<P>
	While some have expressed concern about the court revisiting 
this, the concern has been resolved. In the Egan and Nesbit case last 
year the Supreme Court of Canada made it clear that issues about 
benefits in respect of same sex relationships will be dealt with as a 
matter of sexual orientation. This is now in the law by court order.
<P>
	The grounds of family status and marital status were not 
involved. It is clear there is simply no need for the courts to reopen 
the definition of family status or for a definition of marital status to 
be legislated.
<P>
	I have also heard suggested that the bill affects adoption. This is 
plainly and clearly wrong. This is a simple matter of the 
constitutional division of powers between the federal government 
and the provinces. Adoption is a matter of provincial jurisdiction. 
This law covers only matters coming within federal jurisdiction. 
This amendment does not, cannot and will not affect adoption.
<P>
	I have been asked about the question of benefits for same sex 
partners. Let us be clear that this amendment makes a simple 
change to the Canadian Human Rights Act. It does not change the 
law on benefits. Whatever we do here, the issue of benefits is 
already before the tribunals and courts. Whether we make this 
amendment or not is not relevant.
<P>
	The tribunals and courts are already dealing with the benefits 
question. This amendment will not change that. It will not change 
the law. Moreover, in the Egan case last year the Supreme Court of 
Canada held unanimously that sexual orientation is a prohibited 
ground of discrimination under the equality provision, section 15 
of the charter. The court also held that such discrimination did not 
support the extension to same sex partners of the pension benefits, 
the issue in that case.
<P>
	As I mentioned earlier, eight of the provinces and territories 
prohibit discrimination on the grounds of sexual orientation. 
Although the prohibitions have been around for some time, these 
provisions have not led to the automatic extension of benefits to 
same sex partners.
<P>
	Sexual orientation has been in provincial human rights statutes 
going back as far as 1977. It has also been included by the courts in 
section 15, the equality right guarantee, of the Canadian Charter of 
Rights and Freedoms.
<P>
	As a result there have been a considerable number of cases in 
which tribunals and courts have looked at discrimination on the 
basis of sexual orientation. They have interpreted it to mean 
homosexuality, heterosexuality and bisexuality. The courts and 
tribunals are clear on this. There is a clear understanding of this. 
The definition is clear.
<P>
<B>(1050)</B>
<P>
	Further, the seven provinces which have added sexual 
orientation to their human rights legislation have not defined it. 
Even the Supreme Court of Canada, which considered sexual 
orientation under the charter in the Egan and Nesbit case last year, 
saw no need to define the term.
<P>
	It is clear this law protects lawful conduct, nothing else and 
nothing more.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Any currently prohibited behaviour will remain unlawful under 
the Criminal Code and be afforded no protection through this 
amendment.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	To remove any doubt, the preamble of the bill provides that the 
law applies only in respect of lawful conduct.
<P>
	I have heard it suggested that it would be better to drop the list of 
grounds from the Canadian Human Rights Act rather than add 
sexual orientation. Again, I  am not certain if I understand the 
point. If we drop the list of grounds, what would it be replaced 
with? How would we protect against discrimination on the basis of 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2530"> 2530 </A></B>
<P>
race, religion, sex and sexual orientation? How would we know 
what forms of discrimination are prohibited and which are not? I 
simply do not understand what this would accomplish. Either we 
protect against discrimination on the basis of race, religion, sex, 
sexual orientation and the other listed grounds or we do not.
<P>
	In my view it is mischievous to suggest dropping the list. I 
believe ultimately the suggestion is meaningless. It is simply 
designed to stir up controversy, trouble and confusion. It is 
intended to avoid the real issue.
<P>
	If we are to protect against discrimination on the basis of sexual 
orientation the amendments in the bill will do that. There is no 
other way.
<P>
	I have tried to address the questions I have heard, the fears and 
the misconceptions. When we look at this amendment issue by 
issue, point by point, we can develop a better appreciation of what 
the bill does and what it does not do. We develop a better 
appreciation of what the amendment is all about. It is about human 
rights. It is simply a matter of justice and fairness.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	It is a matter of justice and fairness.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Today's debate comes down to a basic question. Do we think it is 
right to discriminate against gays or lesbians, to fire them from 
their jobs or refuse them service because of their sexual 
orientation? We believe the answer is no. The answer flows from 
the Canadian tradition of tolerance and fairness.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	This is a proud tradition.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	These are values we all hold close.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	These values are fundamental to our identity as Canadians.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	After having reflected on this thoughtfully and carefully I think 
the way is clear. I believe the bill deserves the support of the House 
of Commons.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Réal Ménard (Hochelaga-Maisonneuve, BQ):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I thank the parliamentary secretary for his speech. I also 
appreciated his efforts to deliver a few words in French and would 
like to tell him his French is excellent and that I have no doubt 
things will improve. As the member knows, I try to speak English. I 
am taking courses three days a week at 8 a.m., with the firm  
objective of becoming perfectly bilingual within two years. This, 
however, is not the subject of today's debate.
<P>
<B>(1055)</B>
<P>
	There is no way we can forget that all sorts of remarks have been 
made on the subject of Bill C-33 in the past two weeks, since the 
debate got under way. Some remarks have caused us to grow, some 
have caused us to blanch and some have caused us outrage.
<P>
	I would like to continue in the same vein as the hon. 
parliamentary secretary and try today to remain very generous, 
very open in what I have to say and try especially to put a number 
of things back into context.
<P>
	I would recall that our debate today concerns an amendment to 
the Canadian Human Rights Act. So we are not talking about the 
charter. Sometimes journalists and perhaps our fellow Canadians 
get these two mixed up, but the act is an organic law with the same 
status as all the laws we pass in this Parliament. The difference 
between it and the Canadian Charter of Human Rights is that the 
charter is enshrined in the Constitution and cannot be amended 
without a round of constitutional negotiations and the use of the 
seven and fifty amending formula, which requires seven provinces 
representing fifty per cent of the population to approve any 
amendment to the Constitution Act of 1982, which is the country's 
supreme law.
<P>
	That said, the Canadian Human Rights Act is a very important 
act because it is one way we have as parliamentarians to put a stop 
to potential discrimination in this country. There are in fact three 
ways to do this: the charter, of course, which has already been 
mentioned; the Canadian Bill of Rights, which was passed in the 
early 1960s by the Diefenbaker government and which continues to 
apply; and the Canadian Human Rights Act, which, and I do not 
think it can ever be said clearly enough, applies to firms under 
federal jurisdiction and to individuals receiving services from the 
federal government. So, we are talking about some 10 per cent of 
Canadian workers.
<P>
	The Canadian Human Rights Act has been in existence since 
1977. It is worth remembering that, first, when the Canadian 
Human Rights Act first came into effect-I was rereading the 1977 
debates-some parliamentarians proposed including sexual 
orientation with the nine other prohibited grounds for 
discrimination. For a whole lot of reasons that do not warrant going 
over this morning, it was not possible. What we are doing today as 
parliamentarians-a little later in the day, at 5.30 p.m., if my 
information is correct-is changing the Canadian Human Rights 
Act to include an 11th item in the list of prohibited grounds for 
discrimination.
<P>
	Now, let us have a closer look. What is discrimination, under the 
Canadian Human Rights Act, which applies to businesses under 
federal jurisdiction and to people receiving services from the 
federal government?  Discrimination is defined as follows, and I 
think we should bear the definition in mind during the debate. To 
discriminate against someone is to treat that person in a different, 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2531"> 2531 </A></B>
<P>
negative or unfavourable manner, for no valid reason. When the 
courts have had to interpret discrimination they, of course, 
stumbled over two elements of the definition: ``to treat'' and ``no 
valid reason''.
<P>
	As we are speaking, there are prohibited grounds of 
discrimination and I want to mention them. There is of course 
discrimination based on race. As we know, an extreme form of such 
discrimination can lead to tragic cases of intolerance, as we have 
seen all too often during this century. Then there is national or 
ethnic origin. No one can be deprived of services or discriminated 
against regarding employment, based on his or her race, national or 
ethnic origin, or colour. This reminds me of comments made by 
some members which were, and I know you will agree, absolutely 
unacceptable in Parliament and in society in general. Then there is 
religion. Under the Canadian Human Rights Act, it is prohibited to 
discriminate against someone on the basis of religion.
<P>
<B>(1100)</B>
<P>
	Then there is age. As we know, it is because this is in the list of 
prohibited grounds of discrimination that the government cannot, 
for example, force an individual to retire at age 65. Madam 
Speaker, you could, if it is the voters' wish and yours as well, 
remain in the Chair beyond the age of 65.
<P>
	Then there is sex, including the fact that one is pregnant. Other 
prohibited grounds are marital status, family status and conviction 
for an offence for which a pardon has been granted. Indeed, all 
those who were found guilty by the courts and who served a jail 
sentence, but were then granted a pardon under the established 
practice in our legal system, cannot be discriminated against 
because they have been granted such a pardon. Physical or mental 
disability is of course another important item on the list of 
prohibited grounds of discrimination.
<P>
	What the bill seeks to do is to add sexual orientation to this list. 
The parliamentary secretary mentioned it earlier. I think we have to 
say it, and I agree with the government. There are certain issues 
regarding which I fully endorse the government's views. Then, of 
course, there are others regarding which I do not want to be 
associated with it. However, this time, it would have been a serious 
mistake on the government's part to try to define sexual 
orientation.
<P>
	Why not define sexual orientation? First, because between 1977 
and 1993, out of the seven provinces and one territory that sought 
to provide such protection regarding sexual orientation in their 
human rights code, none defined sexual orientation. They did not 
include a definition because, given existing legal precedents, this  
expression clearly refers to three possibilities: homosexuality, 
heterosexuality and, of course, bisexuality.
<P>
	The saddest thing that has gone on in this debate, where certain 
members, which the most elementary courtesy prevents me from 
naming, have unforgivably overstepped the bounds, is of course the 
absolutely ridiculous, idiotic, confused and unfounded connections 
made between the protection we want given on the basis of sexual 
orientation, and pedophilia.
<P>
	I rely on all the strength of my convictions in telling members 
and listeners that there is no possible connection between what we 
are now discussing and pedophilia. And do you know why? For two 
reasons. First, because it is very clear, as both the parliamentary 
secretary and the justice minister have said, that what is prohibited 
under the Criminal Code will, in all circumstances, continue to be 
prohibited.
<P>
	It is very clear, under the Criminal Code, under conventions, in 
the case law, that pedophilia is an offence. There is not a living 
soul, and certainly not the one now speaking to you, who, however 
liberal he might be, is going to tell us today that protecting people 
against discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation in the 
work place or in the delivery of services by the federal government 
will lead to the recognition of pedophilia.
<P>
	Pedophilia is a criminal offence. Not only is it a criminal 
offence, but I challenge-I do not know if I may do so through you, 
but I challenge-any member of the Reform Party to rise in this 
House, with statistics to back him up, and to put his seat on the line 
and table studies or rulings showing that either administrative or 
legal tribunals have, in the past, offered protection on the basis of 
sexual orientation to pedophiles. It has never happened, and it 
cannot happen, because pedophilia is a criminal offence and must 
continue to be one.
<P>
	It must continue to be a criminal offence because it depends on 
the exploitation of a child by an adult. Once there is exploitation, 
non-consent, and this is true for rape, it is very clear that the 
provisions of the Criminal Code come into play. I find it utterly 
dishonest, and I am being polite, to make the sorts of comparisons 
that have been made by certain members of the Reform Party.
<P>
<B>(1105)</B>
<P>
	It is not only dishonest, but irresponsible. It is irresponsible 
because it suggests that all homosexuals are pedophiles. 
Furthermore, according to the rigorous studies that have been 
conducted, 98 per cent of all pedophilia charges laid in the last 20 
years-not last year, not two years ago, but in the last 20 
years-were laid against heterosexuals. Make no mistake: 9.8 out 
of 10 people who commit the crime of pedophilia are 
heterosexuals.
<P>
	I am not saying that our society must not try to rehabilitate 
pedophiles. It is clear that it is a deviant  behavior, that it is truly 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2532"> 2532 </A></B>
<P>
pathological in the etymological sense of the word, but, for pity's 
sake, let us be responsible and stop drawing parallels that are not 
supported by jurisprudence, psychology or criminal law.
<P>
	Although the government should probably have acted earlier, I 
am happy that it has finally done so. What matters is the outcome. 
The government knows it could not find a better ally in this debate 
than me, but why did it have to introduce a bill like Bill C-33? 
Because people forget-I do not want to alarm you with this, 
because I know you have many other concerns-that the Canadian 
Human Rights Act is unconstitutional. That is a fact.
<P>
	In 1992, the Court of Appeal of Ontario ruled that some of the 
provisions in the Canadian Human Rights Act were 
unconstitutional.
<P>
	Let me remind the House of the events that led to that point. In 
1990, an officer in the Canadian Forces-``there's no life like 
it''-went to see his commanding officer and told him he was 
homosexual. The year was 1990, and the commanding officer 
applied a directive. He did his duty in applying the directive then in 
force in the Canadian Forces. Although it is no longer in force, that 
1990 directive provided for the demobilization-that is the word 
used in the directive-of those members of the Canadian Forces 
who declared themselves or were presumed to be homosexual.
<P>
	The officer in question, Mr. Haig, brought the case before the 
courts. Officer Haig was demobilized. He tried to avail himself of a 
provision and filed a complaint with the Canadian Human Rights 
Commission. The commission was unable to hear his case because 
there were no grounds for filing grievances based on sexual 
orientation.
<P>
	Officer Haig tried to avail himself of the protection based on 
marital status but his complaint was rejected. The Canadian Human 
Rights Commission, which is in fact an administrative tribunal, 
suggested that Mr. Haig, who was demobilized because he had 
admitted being homosexual, take his grievance to an ordinary court 
of law.
<P>
	So the legal saga from an administrative tribunal to the Court of 
Appeal of Ontario led to some of the provisions in the Canadian 
Human Rights Act being ruled unconstitutional.
<P>
	I do not remember whether the decision was unanimous or not, 
but the fact remains that the Court of Appeal of Ontario ruled that, 
under section 15 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and 
Freedoms-which the parliamentary secretary was referring to 
earlier and which, as you may recall, came into force in 1985 and is 
part of the Constitution-every individual is equal before the law.
<P>
<B>(1110)</B>
<P>
	That is why, since 1992, not only has the Canadian Human 
Rights Act been declared unconstitutional, but also it has become 
common practice to construe that the charter and the Canadian 
Human Rights Act should be read as including sexual orientation as 
a prohibited ground of discrimination.
<P>
	In 1992, Kim Campbell was the Minister of Justice. This may be 
a good or a bad memory for this House, but the historical fact 
remains that Ms. Campbell was the Minister of Justice at the time. 
Kim Campbell, as the Minister of Justice, decided-and we should 
be grateful to her for this-not to appeal the case. As a result, not 
only did the Ontario court's decision become binding in Ontario, 
but Ms. Campbell decided to make it binding across Canada.
<P>
	That is why the government decided, in its generosity, to include 
sexual orientation in the Canadian Human Rights Act. In fact, 
legally speaking, and I know that the hon. parliamentary 
secretary's many qualifications include a law degree, we had no 
choice but to make this change.
<P>
	I have followed the debates on Bill C-33 assiduously, as you 
know. I was here the whole time, but not once did Reform members 
rise to call attention to this obligation. Not once did they take the 
logical line of reasoning of saying that, parliamentarians' wishes 
aside, what we are about to do a few hours from now-and there is 
no doubt that we will win this battle-is to bring the legislation in 
line with a decision made by a court, a court of appeal, an ordinary 
court of law, namely the Court of Appeal of Ontario.
<P>
	I think that our viewers, anyone who is concerned with human 
rights must be reminded of these historical facts.
<P>
	We started down the slippery slope of confusion and dismay the 
moment you and those before you gave the floor to the Reform 
Party. Then we heard about everything but the kitchen sink. We 
were threatened with just about everything except being prohibited 
from eating our Corn Flakes with milk, if this bill went through. 
Canada was going to turn into some kind of Liberia and was facing 
potential anarchy.
<P>
	Fortunately, this debate is an opportunity to get our facts 
straight. First, let their be no mistake. I think it must be out of some 
freudian obsession that every member of the Reform Party told us 
the definition of marriage would be altered if this bill were passed. 
I bet you a quart of beer of your choice, Madam Speaker, that the 
next Reformer to speak after me will make the same point.
<P>
	We must bear two things in mind. First, the solemnization of 
marriage comes under provincial jurisdiction. Second, nothing in 
this bill-it is merely three clauses long; it cannot be all that 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2533"> 2533 </A></B>
<P>
difficult to  read-will in any way, shape or form, directly or 
indirectly, change the definition of marriage.
<P>
	In fact, if the government had wanted, which is doubtful, to 
make any change to the concept of marriage, its decision would 
most likely have been invalidated. Do you know why? Because, in 
1995, last year then, a judgment was handed down under common 
law. I wish to dedicate this judgment to my Reformer friends.
<P>
	In the matter of Layland and Beaulne versus the Province of 
Ontario, the claimants challenged under section 15 of the charter, 
to which I referred earlier-it provides for equality for all and 
therefore protects against discrimination on the basis of sexual 
orientation-the requirement under common law that marriage be 
the joining of a man and a woman in matrimony.
<P>
	The charter, which is enshrined in the Constitution, takes 
precedence over any other act. In essence, the Layland and Beaulne 
judgment said the following: ``The restriction imposed by common 
law in that marriage must be entered into by persons of different 
sexes does not constitute discrimination against the claimants in 
violation of section 15 of the act''.
<P>
<B>(1115)</B>
<P>
	Until now, no court of justice has ever sought to change the 
definition of marriage under section 15, and it is unlikely that we 
should ever see such a ruling. Of course, other countries in the 
world, such as Denmark and Norway, while not allowing same sex 
marriages, do authorize declarations of civil union. This is not a 
sacrament: it is a declaration of civil union allowing spouses to 
enter into a mutually benefitting contract.
<P>
	I tried to be as clear as possible in making this clarification. I 
hope that those who are listening, including Reform Party 
members, will understand that this bill does not change the notion 
of marriage. There are legal precedents in these countries and, 
without predicting the future, I think that if a fellow Canadian, 
whether from Newfoundland, Ontario, Quebec, Saskatchewan or 
anywhere else, were to attempt, under the Canadian legislation or 
the charter, to change the notion of marriage, there are firm 
guarantees that, under the common law, a marriage can only take 
place between two people of opposite sex.
<P>
	This is not to say that I am not personally in favour of giving 
some guarantees to same sex spouses. I even tabled a bill to this 
effect. However, this is another issue, and it definitely does not 
involve marriage. These clarifications had to be made regarding the 
case law and the justice system.
<P>
	Another often heard misconception is that, should the legislation 
go through, the family will suddenly, as if by magic, be 
undermined in our country.
<P>
	First of all, this bill concerns individuals. Those who file 
complaints to the Canadian Human Rights Commission involving 
possible challenges relating to sexual orientation are definitely 
individuals. In recent years, such complaints accounted for 4 to 10 
per cent of the total number.
<P>
	Second, there is no reason to believe that a bill such as this one 
will allow us to redefine or to undermine the family. The justice 
minister, unnecessarily in my view, played it safe and added a 
preamble stating that the family remains the basis, the foundation 
of Canadian society.
<P>
	I am not necessarily any happier that this preamble is there, 
because I do not think it is necessary. But it is there, so be it, and we 
are not going to amend it, we will live with it.
<P>
	So, there is confusion between couples and families. It is true 
that, in the past, the Canadian Human Rights Act-in fact, not just 
the Canadian Human Rights Act, but various administrative 
tribunals, including certain labour relations boards-has forced 
employers to give certain benefits to same sex partners.
<P>
	You are indicating that I have only ten minutes left, Madam 
Speaker. How time flies. I wonder if there would be consent to let 
me have more time. I would guess not. I will therefore try to wrap 
up my remarks, but ten minutes is more than I need.
<P>
	The fact is that certain rulings have been made under the 
Canadian Human Rights Act by tribunals throughout the country, 
particularly administrative tribunals, allowing certain benefits to 
same sex partners, in the case of dental or health insurance for 
example. That is true, it would be dishonest not to mention it, but 
that in no way changes the definition of the family.
<P>
	A couple is a couple. It is true that I myself think that a couple 
can consist of a man and a woman, two men, or two women, but 
this does not constitute a family.
<P>
<B>(1120)</B>
<P>
	However much of an activist I may be, recognition of same sex 
partners will not lead me to say that two lesbians or two 
homosexuals constitute a family. It is not true, and it is not what we 
are talking about in this bill.
<P>
	I think another distinction should be made. You will remember 
that in 1985 a parliamentary committee toured Canada. It included 
the member for Mount Royal, whom I would like to salute, because 
of her strong commitment in recent years to promoting human 
rights. The year 1985, you will remember, was the year section 15 
of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms came into effect. 
It identified various discrimination scenarios, scenarios that 
continue to exist today.
<P>
	Still, in 1995 and 1996, there are people who are not promoted 
because they are gay. There are people who are deprived of federal 
services because they are gay. There  are people who are deprived 
of services. Not so long ago a group that was at my house reminded 
me that a priest of a parish, a parish I will not name, had refused to 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2534"> 2534 </A></B>
<P>
rent them a hall, because the group was openly identified with 
promoting homosexual rights.
<P>
	We are, today, not only updating legislation, we are sending a 
very clear message to all elements of Canadian society that we as 
legislators cannot allow discrimination to continue.
<P>
	Most important is the fact that we are able to work so that, in ten 
years, should we find ourselves again in the midst of a debate, 
things will have changed and people who are 14, 15 or 16 and 
discover they are homosexual may know that there are guarantees 
under the law and also that legislators, those who have a public 
voice, out of respect for the family and the constituent majority, 
will ensure that we may tell homosexuals they have their rightful 
place in society, like all taxpayers. They have a rightful place as 
producers, creators and citizens.
<P>
	This is the most important aspect of the bill. Today as legislators, 
we will say on both sides of the House that we assume our 
responsibilities, that we disapprove of discrimination and that we 
want their rights and the services they receive protected under the 
federal system. We will not tolerate discrimination.
<P>
	Allow me to close with one point. We had one day where we 
heard witnesses in parliamentary committee. There was a 
pediatrician from Calgary, a city represented by the Reform Party. I 
am going to talk to the Reformers and thus be out of order. The 
pediatrician in question is a university professor. He had done a 
longitudinal study, that is, one over several years. He reminded us 
that, in Canada, two million young people die by their own hand 
each year, for various reasons of course. Of these, 60 per cent, 
according to the professor from Calgary, are unable to cope with 
the discovery of their homosexuality.
<P>
	This is what Bill C-33 is about. It, with a number of other 
measures, because the problem is not solved, will allow us to say to 
young people who are homosexual-Because do not think for an 
instant that it is a matter of choice, that you wake up one day and 
say: ``Today I am homosexual, tomorrow I will be heterosexual, 
and on the weekend, who knows?''
<P>
<B>(1125)</B>
<P>
	But that is not the case. When one discovers one is 
homosexual-and, as you are aware, I know what I am talking 
about-one knows it is not a choice but a matter of 
predetermination. That is why Bill C-33 is important, because it 
will tell young people across the country-whether they live in 
rural or urban areas, whether they are students or workers, whether 
they want to become professionals or technicians-that we 
recognize their rights as first class citizens.
<P>
	Not only do we recognize their rights as first class citizens, but 
we will not tolerate discrimination. Not only will we not tolerate 
discrimination, but we want them to succeed on the basis of what 
they are in their professional environments. I sincerely believe that 
all those in this House who will rise in a few hours to vote against 
this bill are committing a serious, an irreparable violation of human 
rights for which they will have to account some day.
<P>
	I will say in closing that both the parliamentary secretary and the 
Minister of Justice were very eloquent in this regard, and I hope 
that I too made some impression. What we are discussing today is 
legislative protection. Nothing in this bill will change the family. 
Nothing in this bill will prevent someone who is proud to be 
heterosexual but who is tolerant deep down inside from receiving 
services from the federal government or having the sex life he 
wants for himself.
<P>
	May I make a final appeal to Reformers; I know there are 
generous people among them. I know that, like us all, they too were 
elected and that all of us in this House share the same mandate. To 
them I make a final appeal to review their position and vote in 
favour of this bill.
<P>
	We may well disagree on economic policies or on the national 
issue. I, for one, will continue to defend my ideas on economic 
matters-which may sometimes go against those of the 
government-and I will remain a sovereignist. However, when we 
as parliamentarians witness open discrimination, we have a duty to 
help end these practices. To Reformers I make a final appeal to 
review their position and find it in their hearts to vote in favour of 
this bill.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Sharon Hayes (Port Moody-Coquitlam, Ref.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I am pleased to speak to Bill C-33, as it addresses 
amendments to add sexual orientation as a prohibited ground of 
discrimination under the Canadian Human Rights Act.
<P>
	I want to review and put into the record how we feel about the 
inclusion of sexual orientation as a protected category in the 
Canadian Human Rights Act.
<P>
	We have considered the arguments for and against the inclusion 
of these words and we take the following positions. We affirm that 
all Canadians, including homosexuals, are entitled to life, liberty, 
security of the person, freedom from discrimination regardless of 
personal characteristics, and that these entitlements should be 
strictly enforced.
<P>
	We affirm that these entitlements should be based not on 
personhood, not on sexual orientation or any other personal 
characteristics.
<P>
	We oppose the tendency of the courts and of Parliament to create 
or recognize different categories of persons in Canada for the 
purpose of defining or  augmenting their rights under the charter or 
the Canadian Human Rights Act. We oppose the practice of 
granting undefined or unlimited rights under the charter or the 
Canadian Human Rights Act.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2535"> 2535 </A></B>
<P>
	We oppose the government's announced intention to specifically 
include sexual orientation as a prohibited ground of discrimination 
in the Canadian Human Rights Act as both unnecessary and 
inadvisable.
<P>
	As I begin to speak to Bill C-33, I salute the people in the House 
who have stood against the tide. During the last one and one-half 
weeks there has been a gargantuan effort to pull together strategies 
and an information battle by the government and the press, a 
campaign of misinformation or diversion from the real issues.
<P>
<B>(1130)</B>
<P>
	I state today that the government is bereft of credibility in the 
program it has put before the Canadian people. It has been driven to 
hide its own deficit in integrity through what it has done here.
<P>
	We see the government's cheap political ploys, innuendo and its 
working with the media to stir up controversy rather than looking at 
what needs to be asked and addressed. We see things happening 
that cover the fact that the Liberals failed on their GST promise. 
They failed on their handling of the Somalia affair, the Krever 
commission, the Westray mine. The families and people involved 
are looking to this place and asking: ``What are you doing?'' The 
unity debate, what have we done there? This government has failed 
the Canadian people in so many ways.
<P>
	Two and one-half years ago I came to this place not to save the 
country. Many people here have certain reasons for coming to this 
place. Certainly part of what was in my heart was to address the 
weakening structure of this country's families. I say that from the 
heart. There is not a lot of glitz. There is not a lot of glamour in 
saying that I stand for family, but our families and the institutions 
surrounding them are fundamental to so many things.
<P>
	The importance of the family within Canadian society is like 
building a wall of defence for this country, but it can only be built 
one brick at a time. And the wall will only be as good as the bricks 
that make it up. If those bricks are fractured, chipped or substituted 
with something else, the building blocks will weaken the wall of 
defence. We will have a wall that is open to decay, open to attack 
and open to a loss of security for this very country.
<P>
	Today, that wall which has been built with the bricks of families 
is crumbling beneath us. We see it in our justice system. We see it 
in our economic system. Families in distress. We see it in the loss 
of hope of Canadians.
<P>
	The heroes of our day are those who invest their time and effort 
into brick making, that is, creating strong and  healthy families to 
build this country. Those folks are in our homes, in our 
communities, in our churches right across this land. Those people 
are on both sides of this House. They have stood bravely.
<P>
	Today I am pleased to express not just my concerns about Bill 
C-33 but convictions that I hold. First, I believe in the equality of 
all Canadians. The basic principle that Canadians are equal under 
all our laws is one which defines the policy and approach of the 
Reform Party. It has affected many of our policies.
<P>
	In our unity principle for Canada, we stand on the fact that 
Canada is created of 10 equal provinces under this great 
Confederation. There are no special rights for any one province. 
The equality principle extends to the basic definitions of the rights 
and privileges of every individual in this country.
<P>
	The Reform Party and I utterly reject the definition of equality 
based on a listing of groups and the promotion and protection of 
certain categories based simply on historical disadvantage. Where 
in that is true equality today?
<P>
	The Liberal mindset is to list categories, to elevate or to look at 
the different rights of different people and elevate the rights of one 
group which by definition is at the cost of another.
<P>
	For instance, we see the failed policies of employment equity 
rejected by Canadians, that is, the right to hire and to promote 
people based not on their ability, based not on getting the best 
person for the job but based on their membership in a category in 
one of those lists. I say shame on that mindset. That makes the 
rights and privileges of these individuals unequal. In fact, some in 
our society become more equal than others.
<P>
<B>(1135)</B>
<P>
	The Reform Party rejects the listing of categories in the 
Canadian Human Rights Act and in the charter.
<P>
	If we look back in history we see that it was Trudeau's 
repatriation of the Constitution that brought in our charter of rights. 
It brought in that first list. The charter of rights replaced the 
pre-existing bill of rights which had no such list. But a man 
introduced a list and the impression of equality by category.
<P>
	In this debate I learned that the American bill of rights and 
before that the French declaration of the rights of men and citizens 
of the 18th century have no lists. Equality is simply stated as the 
universal right of every individual. That is the model used in many 
countries of the world.
<P>
	However, for whatever reason, our Prime Minister of years past 
decided that a list was the way to go. It has allowed the courts to pit 
the rights of some Canadians over others. It has introduced a 
system of special rights by inclusion in the list and lesser rights by 
exclusion from it.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2536"> 2536 </A></B>
<P>
	An hon. member mentioned earlier how we could question a 
list. Great thinkers in history have done very well without a list. 
The list is again mirrored in this approach to the Canadian Human 
Rights Act. Interest groups are lining up to be included.
<P>
	Our party has said it would delete the entire list, not add another 
category to something that is already at fault. We believe in 
equality before and under the law for everyone and the equal 
protection from discrimination under the law which is provided in 
the charter. We believe that all Canadians should have their rights 
protected, including the very right we are discussing today, the 
right to freedom from discrimination. My first conviction is that 
equality for all Canadians is a basic right.
<P>
	The second conviction I bring to the House today is that the 
government has abandoned Canadian families. The family is the 
foundation of society. As our families go, so will society go. The 
Liberal attempts to redefine it to reflect our changing times do not 
make sense. We should be looking at how we can strengthen this 
institution. It is the basic building block of our society. It has been 
defined through time and tradition. When anyone attempts to alter 
its importance in society it should not be taken lightly. Our families 
build this world. It is strength in our families that will lead to 
strength in our nations.
<P>
	Today I would like to demonstrate where the government has 
abandoned the family. Under the guise of human rights it will 
promote the reconstruction of the basic definitions and the 
understanding of this basic building block of our society. It will 
open up a gateway of interpretation for our courts once it is passed. 
This gateway of interpretation will facilitate a social reconstruction 
which will affect more Canadians in more aspects of their lives 
than we can image.
<P>
	The government has abused its majority. It has rammed through 
this legislation. To prevent the implications from being realized, 
the government has rammed this legislation through in 
approximately two and one-half days of debate and one and 
one-half days in committee. Even then the committee was loaded 
with pro government witnesses and pro government MPs. This is 
an abuse of power and it is a deception of the Canadian people. It is 
a lack of integrity within the process that would address this most 
important issue.
<P>
<B>(1140)</B>
<P>
	It was interesting in committee. Two people on that committee 
also sat on the 1985 all-party committee which has been quoted so 
often in the House. That was the very committee which 
recommended for the first time that sexual orientation be added to 
the Canadian Human Rights Act. It was interesting that the chair of 
the present committee, who was also on the 1985 committee, 
admitted it was the member for Burnaby-Kingsway who wrote 
that committee's report.
<P>
	In my earlier presentation to the present committee I said that the 
1985 committee went beyond its mandate. I challenge this House: 
Who is it that authors reports from committees in this place? Why 
was a member from a third or fourth party-whatever it was at that 
time-assigned to author that report? That report is quoted again 
and again to justify what we are doing today.
<P>
	Most members were in the House last night. We saw graphically 
the lack of promises. The avoidance of the issue was demonstrated 
once again. The justice minister time and time again either has put 
forward statements which I believe are misleading or has refused to 
answer specific questions. Those issues were put to the test last 
night.
<P>
	We asked the minister to make promises or to clarify where the 
bill was going. In committee, within this House and in dialogue 
with him we asked what were the implications of the bill. Last 
night, those members with concerns about the bill spelled out their 
concerns and put them forward as amendments. They are the 
concerns not only of people in this place, but of Canadians from 
coast to coast. With just a few days to ask these questions, we put 
them forward. We put it to the government to answer the question 
of what the effect will be of this bill. Our concerns should be the 
concerns of every Canadian and I believe they are.
<P>
	What is the government record? The justice minister has said 
that this legislation is simply a matter of adding two words to the 
act, a very simple bill of two clauses and that those two words 
would prevent discrimination and would have no bearing on other 
legislation. He also said that there are eight provinces with similar 
legislation which has not caused any problems and why in the 
world would we be worried about such a thing here. I will briefly 
look at four major areas of concern which were brought up last 
night.
<P>
	One of the questions Canadians are asking is whether this will 
authorize same sex benefits. Will spousal benefits come out of 
what we are looking at in this bill today? Report stage Motion No. 
14 sought to verify that no change would be implicit in this bill in 
regard to spousal benefits. It added a new clause to affirm that 
nothing in the bill would result in same sex benefits, a very simple 
amendment. The amendment was defeated by the government in a 
vote of 166 to 50. The government was not prepared to make any 
commitment on that promise even though it seemed to indicate it 
on every side.
<P>
<B>(1145)</B>
<P>
	The Ontario bill 167, last year when it was brought in for a free 
vote, as supposedly this one is, they were at least honest enough to 
explicitly state it would change benefits and some other things. 
Last year in a free vote in Ontario it went down to defeat.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2537"> 2537 </A></B>
<P>
	Bill C-33 neither states this will be an implication nor has it 
been given any time for public discussion or debate. Again the 
claim by the minister is that the bill is simply basic protection 
from discrimination.
<P>
	The Minister of Justice wrote a memo to Liberal MPs not long 
ago stating this amendment will not result in the extension of 
benefits to homosexual partners. I am sure Liberal members said 
``good, I can go home and tell my constituents they have nothing to 
fear''.
<P>
	Government officials and the justice minister have admitted this 
will logically lead to a provision of spousal benefits. I quote Max 
Yalden, chief commissioner of the Canadian Human Rights 
Commission, March 15, 1994: ``We are strongly in favour of an 
amendment to the human rights act that would prohibit any 
discrimination based on sexual orientation. That means if benefits 
are paid to a heterosexual couple, the same benefits should be paid 
to a couple living in the same situation, except that they are two 
men or women''.
<P>
	The justice minister in an exclusive interview with a 
pro-homosexual newspaper in March, 1994 is quoted as saying: ``If 
the government takes the position that you cannot discriminate, it 
follows as a matter of logic that you have spousal entitlement to 
benefits''. He and Max Yalden seemed to agree at that time 
anyway. However, neither is willing to admit it at this time either to 
the House or to the Canadian public.
<P>
	If the Canadian Human Rights Act has nothing to do with 
spousal benefits, why is the majority of cases dealing with same 
sex matters before the Canadian Human Rights Commission based 
on spousal benefit? It is those cases which are waiting for a 
decision to be made here. It will happen.
<P>
	The second question every Canadian is asking is whether this 
will lead to a redefinition of family, family status, marriage or 
spouse. This was addressed last night by several of our 
amendments. Motion No. 11 simply added a clause to the bill 
affirming that sexual orientation will not define marriage, family, 
spouse in any act of Parliament. That is very straightforward.
<P>
	Motion No. 21 suggested adding a clause reflecting a definition 
of family that would be understood by the majority of Canadians. 
The definition of family is those related by blood, marriage or 
adoption. A marriage is defined as a union of a man and a woman, 
as defined by law. That definition is what most Canadians would 
abide by.
<P>
	When the justice minister came before the committee he 
steadfastly refused to put any definition or proposed definition to 
the word family in the preamble of the bill. The justice minister in a 
press release of April, 1996 said: ``The proposed amendment will 
have no bearing on definitions of marriage, family or spouse. It 
will simply guarantee human rights''.
<P>
<B>(1150 )</B>
<P>
	In the committee both the member for Burnaby-Kingsway and 
I, for two different reasons I am sure, pressed the justice minister 
time and time again. We asked if this would include same sex 
unions and what kind of definition of family are we talking about. 
Neither one of us could get any kind of answer from the justice 
minister.
<P>
	I was reading a summary of Canada v. Mossup of February 25, 
1993. This case had to do with benefits, as many cases do. I quote 
from it. It is in relation to definitions within legislation. At that 
time it was looking at the definition of family status: ``Parliament's 
decision to leave family status undefined is evidence of clear 
legislative intent that the term's meaning should be left for the 
commission and tribunals to define. The enumerated grounds of 
discrimination are established so that the meaning is not frozen in 
time and scope and may evolve''.
<P>
	It admits at this time that the lack of definition for the term 
family status is specifically so that courts can change that 
definition.
<P>
	Logically from that, the lack of will to define family within 
legislation leaves it within the purview of the courts not only to 
define it but to evolve that definition. It means redefinition by 
courts by not defining it.
<P>
	In 1993 Chief Justice Lamer of the Supreme Court of Canada 
commented on the effect of the inclusion of sexual orientation in 
the Canadian Human Rights Act. He said if sexual orientation had 
been included in the act we are looking at today, his interpretation 
of the case which he had just reviewed could have been or very 
likely would have been that homosexual couples would have legal 
family status.
<P>
	With sexual orientation in the Canadian Human Rights Act 
would change the definition of family status. It would change the 
definition of spouse. It would change the meaning of over 50 
federal statutes in relation to those definitions.
<P>
	Will this lead to affirmative action programs for homosexuals? 
That is a concern for many Canadians. Motion No. 18 last night 
stated that nothing in the addition of the words sexual orientation in 
the two sections will result in the inclusion of those terms in 
section 16, the section dealing with special programs or affirmative 
action.
<P>
	Even though specifically these words are not included in section 
16 of this proposed amendment of the government, these words are 
included in section 3. The first words of that section read ``for all 
purposes of this act'' and then goes on to include sexual 
orientation.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2538"> 2538 </A></B>
<P>
	Therefore it is not only possible, probable, but perhaps surely 
sexual orientation will be read into section 16. Last night the 
government again defeated the amendment that would have 
clarified that concern.
<P>
	Why are the words sexual orientation now appearing on 
application forms in post-secondary institutions? Why in this 
upcoming census for all Canadians, a census whereby the 
government gets the proportions to use in affirmative action 
programs, for our employment equity program, will sexual 
orientation questions appear? It would appear that will become part 
of the government program.
<P>
	In the committee we had the Ottawa police delegation. It 
admitted it now uses employment equity practices in its hiring and 
in its promotion. Right now it is actively and proactively recruiting 
gays and lesbians for the force. It does not take a lot of imagination 
to see that becoming part of its total employment equity program.
<P>
<B>(1155)</B>
<P>
	Will individual freedoms such as the freedom of religion, 
expression and association be affected? This is a concern of every 
Canadian.
<P>
	The justice minister in his opening speech on the bill gravely 
misquoted the Catholic catechism in his speech. This is in terms of 
freedom of religion. He spoke that day for religions and basically 
said the legislation did not offend any religion. In saying this, the 
justice minister made a gross intrusion on and a gross 
misrepresentation of many Canadians. He abused the jurisdiction 
of his office in saying that.
<P>
	I have letters from different religious organizations firmly 
opposed to what is going on here today, the Ontario Association for 
Catholic Families, the Canadian Conference of Catholic Bishops, 
the Christian Ministers Association, British Columbia-Yukon 
District Pentecostal Assemblies of Canada, the First Baptist 
Church in Nanaimo, the Vancouver Chinese Evangelical 
Ministerial Fellowship, the Bishops Office of the District of 
Kamloops, to name a few.
<P>
	How could the justice minister have been so blatantly wrong in 
making that statement? The justice minister also stated the 
provincial experience indicates there have been no conflicts and no 
ill effects of implementing sexual orientation in their human rights 
acts.
<P>
	I have just a couple of examples. There was a legal case in 1980 
in Quebec. The Catholic school board of Montreal was forced to 
rent out its facilities to the homosexual association of Quebec. The 
Catholic school board of Montreal argued homosexuality was 
condemned by the church and it, as an educational institution and 
as a church, had the right to resist renting out its facilities. The 
courts did not agree.
<P>
	A second example is in Alberta, Queen's Bench, 1994. The 
employee of a religious institution was dismissed  because he did 
not comply with that institution's policy on homosexual practice. 
The right to his employment was struck down on appeal. It has 
been said the very movement at the federal level for introducing 
this term into the federal Canadian Human Rights Act has been 
precipitated by the fact that this provincial court struck this down, 
and in order to ensure this would be the direction of this particular 
place the legislation had to be done sooner rather than later.
<P>
	However, the issue remains a religious institution challenged as 
to its own choices and who should work with it.
<P>
	A third example is the Manitoba Human Rights Commission, 
March 1993 in Winnipeg. The case was Kippen v. the Big Brothers 
Association of Winnipeg. It was alleged that the Big Brothers 
Association of Winnipeg discriminated against this individual 
when it refused to match this individual with a little brother 
because he was gay. Big Brothers did have a policy not to match a 
gay person with a little brother unless the parents specifically 
indicated a gay man would be acceptable to that match. However, 
that provision was not good enough. This was challenged within 
the Manitoba Human Rights Commission.
<P>
	This was deemed to fall under the category of provision of 
services, which falls under the Canadian Human Rights Act, but it 
went against the Big Brothers Association of Winnipeg.
<P>
<B>(1200 )</B>
<P>
	A fourth example is a decision by the B.C. Council of Human 
Rights, dated August 4, 1995. In this decision it was determined 
that a doctor discriminated against a lesbian couple when he 
refused to provide them with artificial insemination services 
because they were lesbian.
<P>
	It is interesting to note that this doctor had provided this type of 
service to a previous lesbian couple, had been caught up in their 
litigation and so had decided to withdraw from this kind of scenario 
for his own reasons. The doctor, who had previous artificial 
insemination litigation, argued that professionals should be able to 
provide services to whom they choose. However, the council did 
not agree with him and so it was struck down.
<P>
	The two people involved in this litigation, Tracy Potter and 
Sandra Benson, are constituents of mine and I have met with them. 
Last year I received a birth announcement from them so obviously 
they found someone who would meet their need. In the meantime 
there was a human rights challenge against this doctor.
<P>
	A fifth example has to do with the effects of provincial 
decisions. The justice minister claimed that what happens in the 
provinces has been fine and has no effect through the country.
<P>
	The Leshner case was before the Ontario board of inquiry and 
the Canadian human rights report,  September 1992, states that 
the majority concludes that the definition of marital status be 
read down to remove recrimination based on marital status by 
reading out the phrase ``of the opposite sex''. Further, it urges 
the Government of Ontario to make every effort to persuade the
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2539"> 2539 </A></B>
<P>
Government of Canada to change the Income Tax Act, and if 
political persuasion is unsuccessful then to take legal action.
<P>
	In addition to these court cases I would also like to put to the 
Canadian public and to the members of the House that when we 
think of lists and categories, I think of the experience with visible 
minorities here in Ontario. I am familiar with police departments 
that are not allowed to keep criminal statistics by visible minority 
categories.
<P>
	Yesterday the issue was raised that these are facts that would 
help society not to discriminate against a group but to help the 
whole. If there is problem within a group that should be addressed 
and not be denied on the basis of discriminating against a group.
<P>
	However, last night a member of my party was challenged when 
he brought forward health statistics. What will happen if statistics, 
if facts, if the very things that will create decision processes are not 
allowed to come forward whether it be for treatment, funding or 
anything. What if these facts can be put down and made 
untouchable, groups made unaccountable, because of the 
protection of this word discrimination.
<P>
	What about freedom of expression? I am aware that a 
homosexual lifestyle is already being taught as equivalent to a 
heterosexual lifestyle in our schools. I am also aware there is 
federal involvement through Heath Canada in our schools. There 
has been a curriculum development through violence initiative 
funding or it had been there.
<P>
	The government has put out a guideline to sexual health that is in 
every province. It has outlined curriculum for sexual health and 
those guidelines go from kindergarten to grade 12.
<P>
	Do Canadians know this has happened? I do not think so. Has 
there been freedom for parents to speak up and choose what it is 
that is being taught to their children, and the freedom to know of 
government involvement in this area, or what it is their children are 
being taught or suggested by the government?
<P>
<B>(1205 )</B>
<P>
	I believe Bill C-33 is a gateway to the agenda of a powerful 
special interest group. It is not about individual discrimination, it is 
about special rights. It is about an invasion of family rights and 
privileges.
<P>
	I believe that the family deserves special recognition in our 
society. It should not be tossed away lightly by a government which 
has already been responsible for much of its decline. In the name of 
progress, openness and rights, the family is increasingly becoming 
the unfortunate casualty.
<P>
	I have a shocking quote from a government witness to the 
committee on Bill C-33. The first vice-president of the Canadian 
Association for Community Living said last week: ``While we hear 
a great deal of lamenting of the fact that the traditional family is 
deteriorating, we must acknowledge that many of those changes 
have benefited women, children and society at large''. This seems 
to be the mindset of the government. It seems to be the mindset of 
the bureaucrats. It is definitely not the mindset of the vast majority 
of Canadians.
<P>
	I am reminded of one of my experiences when I was in China. 
While there I visited the great wall of China. The people of China 
wanted security behind the wall from the barbaric hordes that lived 
to the north. The wall was so high they thought that no one could 
climb over it. It was so wide they were convinced that no one could 
break it down. It was an awesome sight to look in both directions as 
far as the eye could see to see this wall snaking across the top of the 
mountains. It was wide enough for a chariot to drive on. Even today 
they say it is the only man-made structure which is visible from 
outer space. It is not surprising that the Chinese settled behind that 
wall, secure in their accomplishment.
<P>
	During the first 100 years of the wall's existence China was 
invaded three times. Not once did the barbarians break down the 
wall, nor did they climb over it. Every time they bribed the 
gatekeeper and marched right through the gates in the wall. The 
Chinese were busy relying on wisdom and accomplishment and 
forgot the importance of integrity.
<P>
	The process that we have seen in the last few days is bereft of 
that integrity. It is true that integrity will not come from edicts and 
legislation. Governments, try as they might, cannot legislate the 
moral fibre of the nation, but governments and the laws which they 
make can and do have a profound effect on those institutions which 
are the bedrock of society. Integrity is the most important single 
quality for any individual or nation. It is born and thrives in the 
bosom of the homes of the nation. To blithely reorder society's 
foundation is to threaten the nation's future.
<P>
	Our future lives in the institution of family, faith and cultures. 
The lawmakers that deny or attempt to disregard the fundamental 
necessity to safeguard these historic institutions will eventually 
undo the fabric of the nation.
<P>
	I would like to move:

<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The hon. member did not include the 
word ``not'' in her amendment. I assume she meant it. Would she 
so indicate?
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Hayes:</B> Yes it is, I believe.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Allmand:</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order on exactly 
that point and the balance of the wording in the amendment. It is 
my understanding that only a reasoned amendment can be moved at 
this time. I question whether the amendment as worded meets the 
requirements of a reasoned amendment.
<P>
	We are on third reading. We cannot, at this time, amend the 
clauses of the bill. The traditional type of reasoned amendment can 
be made but-the House leader is not here and the whip is not 
here-the wording of that amendment does not meet the 
requirements of a reasoned amendment.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The member neglected to read the word 
``not'' which is in the text. The amendment was submitted in 
advance. People who are far more knowledgeable than I am in 
these matters have ruled that it is an acceptable amendment. 
Accordingly, it is a receivable amendment.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Godfrey (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister for 
International Cooperation, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I will be sharing 
my time with the member for Hamilton West. I rise to offer my 
unqualified support for Bill C-33.
<P>
	It was not my original intention to speak on this bill. I came to 
Parliament for a number of reasons, as did the member for Port 
Moody-Coquitlam. My reasons were long. I came here to try to 
promote national unity, to help with wealth and job creation, to deal 
with Canada's participation in an expanded NAFTA, to promote 
programs for early childhood support-my contribution to the 
family other than having a two-year-old-and to support issues in 
science and technology, to defend Canadian culture and the 
environment.
<P>
	I did not really think I would be standing here and speaking on 
this motion today. My original view of Bill C-33 was that it was so 
restricted in its application, so obviously necessary, so consistent 
with the principles of my party that it was hardly worth debating or 
discussing. It is precisely this debate and this division within the 
House and indeed within my own party, this passion, which has 
convinced me not only to support the bill, something I had always 
intended to do, but to speak today.
<P>
	What is the bill about? This bill simply adds sexual orientation 
to a list of prohibited categories for discrimination. We are talking 
about basic human rights here. We are not talking about lifestyle 
choices. It is  simply about outlawing discrimination for that 10 per 
cent of Canadians who work within institutions covered by federal 
jurisdiction.
<P>
	With respect to the hon. member for Port Moody-Coquitlam, it 
has nothing but nothing to do with the five examples she gave us 
from Ontario, Quebec, Manitoba, British Columbia and wherever 
else she spoke. All of those are strictly a matter of provincial 
jurisdiction. They are covered in the 90 per cent of the population 
that this bill does not deal with. It is not about provincial 
jurisdiction, despite the examples she cited.
<P>
	This bill does not cover 90 per cent of Canadians who live and 
work outside federal institutions. It does not apply to marriage, 
which is a provincial matter. It does not apply to adoption, which is 
a provincial matter. With respect for the member for Port 
Moody-Coquitlam, it does not apply to the family. Indeed, the 
preamble to the bill ``affirms the importance of family as the 
foundation of Canadian society''.
<P>
	Oddly enough, it is not even about religion. To suggest such a 
thing is to read things into the text which simply are not there. We 
could add a number of things which it does not concern. It is not 
about the Canadian Wheat Board. It is not about Pearson airport. It 
is not even about the Great Wall of China. Nowhere do the words 
Great Wall of China appear in the text.
<P>
<B>(1215)</B>
<P>
	Let us go through some of the arguments made by the member 
for Port Moody-Coquitlam. The first one is why a list and why a 
specific reference to the category of discriminated persons. It is 
obvious. In the absence of a specific reference to sexual orientation 
one can quite categorically affirm that there have been examples of 
blatant discrimination within federal institutions, notably within 
the armed forces.
<P>
	The second point is the family, which I have already alluded to. 
It is not about the family, even though we have reaffirmed our basic 
faith in the family in the preamble. The member asked why is there 
no definition of family. The member answered her own question by 
her inability to give one when pressed without a piece of paper in 
her hand. If it is that complicated, why on earth should we put the 
definition of a family in that she could not provide under pressure?
<P>
	The third argument the hon. member raised had to do with 
ramming through. Who is ramming through? I thought we had 
declared this a free vote. I noticed that on our side there was some 
division of opinion last night and there may even be later today. 
What I did not detect was any sign of a free vote on the other side of 
the floor from the very member who made the point. Those who 
had views on either side seem to have been excluded, whatever the 
moderation or extremity of the views. Who is ramming through 
what?
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2541"> 2541 </A></B>
<P>
	The hon. member said there were no references in the 
legislation to same sex benefits. I find this a very curious logic. 
On the one hand the member asked us to add all sorts of detail 
to define the family, to talk about marriage, benefits and so on, 
but on the other hand eliminate any reference to categories of 
discriminated persons. Either in logic one believes everything 
should be included in the bill, that is to say both lists of 
discriminated persons and exemptions and exceptions and all the 
concerns she raised, or one is for simplicity in law. To be half for 
simplicity and half for complexity leaves me a little confused.
<P>
	Given what the bill is about, which is modest, and what it is not 
about, which is vast, what is the real reason for this passion in the 
debate? Without giving a detailed psychological analysis of all 
present, which would probably not be appreciated by anyone, it 
seems the bill carries on its thin and bony shoulders the weight of a 
tremendous burden; that is, the weight of all changes that have 
taken place in Canadian society since 1950, plus the Great Wall of 
China to boot.
<P>
	It is simply an expression of fear of change. A fear of the 
differences which are emerging in our new Canadian society. That 
is what the passion is about. That is not what the bill is about. 
Therefore those are the reasons that convince me to vote for the bill 
and to speak in favour of the bill; however, it is this very passion, 
this very fear, that convinces me we need such a bill.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stan Keyes (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Transport, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, this has become an extremely 
controversial debate. However, my constituents in Hamilton West 
will know I have never shied away from addressing important 
issues such as this one.
<P>
	They will know I have consulted with many of them and I have 
read their correspondence. My constituents know where their MP 
stands on the issues.
<P>
	My constituents are entitled to know my position on Bill C-33. 
Therefore I consider it a privilege in the House today to clarify my 
reasons for voting in favour of the proposed amendment to the 
Canadian Human Rights Act.
<P>
	Amid the current angst over same sex relationships and other 
related issues, it seems rational considerations have been 
overshadowed by narrow minded, sometimes self-righteous 
statements from some members in this place. As opposed to 
embracing one of the conveniently packaged positions, for 
example the news headlines that scream out right wing 
fundamentalist homophobe or gay rights activist, it is worthwhile 
to examine Bill C-33 for what it is. It is an act to amend the human 
rights act.
<P>
<B>(1220)</B>
<P>
	It is truly unfortunate that the central focus of the bill has been 
distorted by other peripheral issues. In recent days I, like many of 
the other members in the House, have received phone calls and 
letters from individuals in  my riding who have some very 
passionate but often ill informed views on this issue.
<P>
	As a member of Parliament I am concerned about the general 
welfare of my constituents. Consequently from time to time I, like 
many of my colleagues on this side of the House, do everything I 
can to help my constituents address various needs and deficiencies 
related to the federal government and federally regulated services 
and operations.
<P>
	In keeping with this I am primarily concerned with identifying 
how the proposed legislation, the bill before us today, will help us 
ensure federally regulated workplaces are tolerant and free from 
unwarranted discrimination.
<P>
	I take this opportunity to address some of the specific concerns 
raised in various letters I have received from my constituents with 
respect to Bill C-33. For example, in their letter John and Judy 
wrote: ``It is only used to promote tolerance for a particular 
lifestyle today. What will it protect tomorrow, pedophilia, incest? 
Also, we feel it will break down the family unit which God has 
instituted from the very beginning. Why should we pay for benefits 
for same sex couples when our country is in debt already?''
<P>
	Pedophilia is not a sexual orientation. It is a crime. It is a crime 
regardless of whether the offender is heterosexual or homosexual. 
The suggestion that pedophilia may be read into the phrase sexual 
orientation has no legal basis.
<P>
	Seven provinces have had similar wording entrenched in human 
rights legislation for almost two decades. In that time the term of 
sexual orientation has never been used as a defence against 
criminal charges of pedophilia. Clearly pedophilia would not be 
protected by human rights legislation under any circumstances.
<P>
	With regard to the definition of the family, no changes are 
planned or necessary as a result of this amendment.
<P>
	On the issue of same sex spousal benefits, the amendment will 
not extend same sex benefits to partners of gays and lesbians. On 
this point it should be noted that in Egan v. Canada the Supreme 
Court of Canada held unanimously that sexual orientation is a 
prohibited ground of discrimination under the equality provision, 
section 15, of the charter. In that case the court also held that such 
discrimination did not support the extension of pension benefits to 
same sex partners.
<P>
	In another letter, Ruth wrote: ``I do not desire the bill to be made 
law that gives homosexuals equal rights to be married and adopt 
children''.
<P>
	First of all, marriage and adoption fall under provincial 
jurisdiction. This amendment deals with discrimination in 
employment, accommodation and provision of services, and 
nothing else. It does not condone or condemn homosexuality or 
heterosexuality.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2542"> 2542 </A></B>
<P>
	In his letter, Norman wrote: ``This addition removes the right 
of upright individuals to teach and practise moral convictions 
based on the truth of the Holy Bible simply to accommodate 
individuals practising the most loathsome, unnatural and filthy 
lifestyle''.
<P>
	On the same point, Paul wrote: ``In all probability it will be 
illegal to teach, even in places of worship, that homosexuality is 
immoral, even though this is clearly the doctrine of many faiths, 
including Christianity''.
<P>
	It should be noted, however, that churches, religious 
organizations and schools are not under the federal jurisdiction. 
The amendment to the Canadian Human Rights Act will not affect 
the way they teach or the way they operate.
<P>
	Throughout this debate there has been confusion with the 
provision of special privileges or immunities and prohibiting 
discrimination. The bill represents the latter and not the former. 
The Canadian Human Rights Act and the amendment we are 
speaking of today are intended to prohibit acts of discrimination 
based on, among other things, age, race, religion, colour and sexual 
orientation.
<P>
	As evidenced by the recent racist and homophobic remarks 
uttered by several members in the Reform Party, it appears we need 
legislation just like this in order to illustrate in very clear terms our 
distaste for discrimination and the rejection of racist and 
homophobic attitudes in society.
<P>
<B>(1225 )</B>
<P>
	Once again to be clear, the purpose of this legislation is to make 
certain that workplaces in federally regulated industries are 
tolerant and free of unwarranted discrimination. The clear majority 
of Canadians support this amendment and have for many years 
according to various opinion polls. Most people do not even 
consider the issue to be extremely controversial.
<P>
	I am proud my colleagues on this side of the House and some of 
the more progressive members opposite have shown such 
overwhelming support for the government's attempts to protect the 
basic human rights of our fellow citizens.
<P>
	In the first session of the 35th Parliament the government passed 
legislation to toughen sentences for hate crimes and moved to 
address the needs of vulnerable communities in society. Not only 
does the government realize that discrimination exists in society, 
but we are ready, willing and able to deal with it head on through 
the legislative process.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Williams (St. Albert, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I continue 
to hear members on the government side saying how great this 
piece of legislation is and how they think it will advance society.
<P>
	We have one law dealing with sex in the workplace, the sexual 
harassment law. It states sexual innuendo, sexual  prowess, sexual 
adventure, sexual escapades, sexual anything are absolutely not to 
be tolerated in the workplace. Courts have passed judgement on 
that. The Treasury Board has issued guidelines on that. There are 
numerous investigations by the Treasury Board of complaints by 
civil servants who feel they have been sexually harassed in the 
workplace.
<P>
	Now Minister of Justice has introduced this piece of legislation 
which states sexual orientation is fine in the workplace. I have to 
scratch my head and wonder which legislation will take 
precedence. Will sexual harassment now be tolerated in the 
workplace if someone can identify or show their sexual orientation 
is somehow important and they need to have that protected? Or will 
sexual harassment still be absolutely and totally forbidden?
<P>
	Does the member support the sexual harassment legislation? If 
he does and says that sexual anything is not allowed in the 
workplace, what will he allow and what will this piece of 
legislation do to sexual harassment? Will it be allowed or will it be 
forbidden?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Keyes:</B> Mr. Speaker, I have heard the comments of the 
member opposite and of many of his colleagues. I can only 
conclude we are witness to the ill intentioned conversing with the 
ill informed. That is precisely why we are bringing forward this 
kind of legislation.
<P>
	The legislation before us has nothing to do with all the peripheral 
items the members opposite and those who are ill informed in the 
community are trying to bring forward. They are trying to make 
something out of this bill, out of the amendment that is just not 
there.
<P>
	Why not see the amendment to this bill for what it is? Why not 
recognize that in today's society we have to deal with communities 
fairly and forthrightly? The amendment does precisely that, and 
that is all it does.
<P>
	Members opposite can try to drag in all types of different 
arguments, for example arguments on what constitutes the family. 
Can the member opposite provide for me a definition of family? 
We heard it from the member for Port Moody-Coquitlam, man, 
woman, child or children.
<P>
<B>(1230)</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Williams:</B> And married.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Keyes:</B> And married says the hon. member, proudly.
<P>
	My best friend in my riding was married once and divorced. The 
lady he lives with was married once and divorced. They both had 
two beautiful children from each of their previous marriages. They 
came together to live and reared those children from the ages of 10 
until today those four children are now gone. They have left the 
nest, as they say, and have gone on to become productive members 
of society. They have gone on to do what they have to do to get jobs 
and get an education.  That now leaves my best friend, who is 
divorced and not married, living with his lady friend. Does that 
make them any less of a family in the member's eyes? Is this 
couple, who have brought up their children from previous mar-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2543"> 2543 </A></B>
<P>
riages and have been living under the same roof for over a decade, 
not a family?
<P>
	One can imagine if we had to try to define what is a family. Is a 
single mom living with her daughter not a family? I can understand 
the complications that would come about as a result of trying to 
make that kind of a definition.
<P>
	Again even I find myself straying from the main point which is 
that the purpose of the bill is strictly an amendment to the Canadian 
Human Rights Act. Let us deal with it for what it is and not what 
hon. members opposite might want it to be.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Svend J. Robinson (Burnaby-Kingsway, NDP):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it was 16 years ago in the special committee on the 
Constitution of Canada that I as a new member of Parliament 
having been elected in 1979 first introduced an amendment to the 
Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, the equality rights 
section of the Constitution of Canada, section 15.
<P>
	That amendment was to include the two words ``sexual 
orientation''. That amendment was defeated overwhelmingly. I 
will never forget the words of one of the committee members in 
speaking against that amendment. He said: ``A family cannot 
include every barnacle and eavestrough in the Constitution of 
Canada''.
<P>
	I was then what he would have called a barnacle or an 
eavestrough. I am a gay man but it was not to be until the spring of 
1988 that I came out publicly and affirmed that it was a part of who 
I am as a human being.
<P>
	We have travelled a long road in 16 years. I recall another 
committee I sat on in 1985, a special committee on equality rights. 
That committee held hearings across Canada about what the 
meaning was of equality in Canada in section 15 of the charter of 
rights and freedoms. The committee was made up of five 
Conservative members of Parliament, one Liberal member of 
Parliament, the member for Mount Royal, and myself.
<P>
	We travelled across this land. We held hearings on my private 
member's bill that would include sexual orientation in the 
Canadian Human Rights Act. That committee was moved by the 
power and the eloquence of those witnesses we heard, in some 
cases behind closed doors, appealing to their elected 
representatives to do the right thing and recognize that gay, lesbian 
and bisexual people in Canada are entitled to basic equality.
<P>
<B>(1235 )</B>
<P>
	Basic equality, not special rights. How many times have we 
heard the suggestion that this amendment is about special rights? 
This amendment has nothing  whatsoever to do with special rights 
or privileges. This amendment is simply sending out a signal from 
the Parliament of Canada that gay and lesbian people are entitled to 
be treated in law as equals. It is not a revolutionary change.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	It will soon be 20 years since these changes were made in 
Quebec, in 1977. Quebec was the first province to list sexual 
orientation as a prohibited ground for discrimination in its charter 
of rights and freedoms.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Since then seven provinces and the Yukon territory have done 
the same thing. The courts have moved. Indeed in 1991 the Ontario 
Court of Appeal, in an appeal by Graham Haig and Joshua Birch, 
wrote in the words ``sexual orientation'' in the Canadian Human 
Rights Act. It said if Parliament was not prepared to ensure that 
equality was included, the courts would do it for Parliament.
<P>
	Here we are today, five years after the courts have said this is 
what this section requires. I find it incredible that the two words 
``sexual orientation'' should still generate such emotion. Gay and 
lesbian Canadians are not people from another planet. We are 
brothers and sisters, sons and daughters, neighbours, friends, 
mothers and fathers, and co-workers. We are saying that our time 
has come. Indeed, it is long overdue.
<P>
	I want to make it clear that this day would not have arrived had it 
not been for the tremendous courage, strength and commitment of 
many gay and lesbian people across this land, people like Jim Egan 
and his partner Jack Nesbit. They have been together for over 40 
years. They fought to the highest court of the land, the Supreme 
Court of Canada, for the right to have their relationship treated as 
equal, to have their relationship affirmed in law.
<P>
	I think of people like Doug Sanders. He was there in the 1960s in 
one of the first groups, the Association for Social Knowledge, 
fighting courageously for awareness and for equality. I think of 
people like Michelle Douglas. She is a former captain in the 
Canadian Armed Forces. She was one of the finest young officers 
the forces had seen. She was told one day that her job was gone 
simply because she was lesbian. She fought back and she won. I 
think of people like Jane Rule, Timothy Findley and others who 
have put into such beautiful words, such powerful and eloquent 
words, the struggle of our people for equality and justice.
<P>
	There are so many others who I cannot name, but who made it 
possible for me to take the step of coming out publicly in 1988 at a 
time when many of my colleagues suggested it would be political 
suicide. The people of Burnaby-Kingsway have re-elected me 
twice since then. They have sent a powerful message that what 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2544"> 2544 </A></B>
<P>
matters is not one's sexual orientation, but one's ability to do the  
job. That is what this bill is all about. Nothing more, nothing less.
<P>
<B>(1240 )</B>
<P>
	The bill sends a signal to the people of this country. While we 
cannot change their attitudes, if they want to send gay and lesbian 
people to the back of the shop, if they want to fire them from their 
jobs, if they want to deny them access to goods and services or to 
homes, they are not going to be allowed to do that solely on the 
basis of sexual orientation. For anybody who thinks that it does not 
happen, it happens all too often. This law will be a signal from the 
Parliament of Canada that it is not acceptable and there is a 
recourse in law to the Human Rights Commission.
<P>
	As long as someone is afraid of losing their job or being thrown 
out of their home, that has a profound impact on another area as 
well. The committee that studied this bill heard from Chief Brian 
Ford of the Ottawa Police. I want to pay tribute to Chief Ford and to 
members of his hate crime section, Dan Dunlop, David Pepper and 
others. They pointed out that if someone is afraid of losing their job 
and if gay bashers beat them up, they are not going to report it.
<P>
	Two weeks ago I was in Red Deer, Alberta. I was told about a gay 
man who was beaten up in Calgary the previous month. Both his 
arms were broken, his ear was cut off and he was in a coma. Why? 
Because he was gay. In some cases people like that are afraid to 
report the bashing because they do not want to lose their job. That 
is not good enough.
<P>
	It is shameful that still today in some jurisdictions in this country 
fear exists because there is no human rights protection: Alberta, 
Prince Edward Island, the Northwest Territories, Newfoundland 
and Labrador. This is another reason for the bill, to send out that 
signal that this is not acceptable.
<P>
	Some members of the House have asked about the possibility 
that this might recognize gay and lesbian families. Let me say that 
when gay and lesbian people are involved in committed loving 
relationships, caring relationships which survive against incredible 
odds, we as communities, we as a country should be affirming and 
celebrating those relationships and not denying them. If this bill in 
any small measure helps to affirm and to recognize those 
relationships, then I say that is a good thing.
<P>
	The courts have ruled on discrimination. Supreme Court of 
Canada Justice Cory was supported by Judge Sopinka and a 
majority of the court when he said: ``To treat persons of the same 
sex who represent themselves as a common law couple differently 
from persons of the opposite sex representing themselves as a 
common law couple is a differentiation which must be based upon 
sexual orientation''. He is right.
<P>
	I hope that this legislation, this modest amendment will be 
another means whereby the Human Rights Commission and the 
courts can indeed extend that equality to committed loving gay 
families. If anybody needs any proof of that love and commitment, 
look at the AIDS ward in a hospital in Toronto, Montreal or my 
own city of Vancouver. Look at the kind of compassion and love 
that is demonstrated in the face of this epidemic that we as gay 
people are living in. If those are not traditional family values, if 
those are not values that should be affirmed and celebrated, I do not 
know what is.
<P>
	This bill is a response to the plea of my late friend Kevin Brown, 
one of the founders of the B.C. Persons with AIDS Society. He 
talked about how gay and lesbian people have to confront the HIV 
virus but they should not have to confront another virus, the virus 
of homophobia, of hatred, of fear. This bill is a small step in 
confronting that virus as well.
<P>
	This bill is not the last word. This is a change in law which 
ultimately must change a society which allows widespread hatred 
and discrimination which is doubly profound and serious for those 
who have to face racism, sexism, anti-Semitism. Ultimately the bill 
is not about liberation, which is the ultimately objective of gay, 
lesbian and bisexual people, because there are many steps that 
remain to be taken.
<P>
<B>(1245)</B>
<P>
	We still have to recognize the struggles of trans-gendered people 
who too often are invisible, whose struggles are not acknowledged, 
in some cases even in gay and lesbian communities.
<P>
	We cannot speak about full freedom and justice as long as gay, 
lesbian and bisexual youth still have levels of attempted suicide 
and suicide which are devastatingly high. Only aboriginal youth 
have comparable levels.
<P>
	On the fear, the alienation that too many gay, lesbian and 
bisexual youth experience in their daily lives, the fear of coming 
out, we heard very powerful evidence from child psychiatrists 
before the committee about the impact this has.
<P>
	I remind the House that alone, among all minority groups, gay, 
lesbian and bisexual youth in some cases cannot even turn to their 
own families for love and support. Their greatest fear is their 
families may find out, so they struggle alone in silence. They 
cannot even in some cases turn the church because they are 
condemned as sinners by too many of the churches.
<P>
	I want to acknowledge and celebrate the struggle of those 
working within the churches to change those attitudes, people like 
Bill Siksay in the United Church, the Metropolitan Community 
Church, groups such as Dignity, Affirm, Integrity and many others, 
pleading with their churches to recognize and celebrate the reality.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2545"> 2545 </A></B>
<P>
	I refer to a Catholic priest who wrote a letter to the Vancouver 
<I>Sun</I> at the time the member for Central Nova was speaking out 
in a particularly hateful way. In the letter, Father Norman Birch 
spoke about a young gay parishioner who had been rejected by 
his family. He was told by his father ``if I was there, I would kill 
you''. His mother said do not come home. Father Birch told the 
young man that God loved him and that Jesus rejected no one. 
Father Birch said the day after he met with him that this young 
man took his life.
<P>
	At the prayers before the funeral his two sisters and his lover 
were there, but no parents. When the casket was opened, he said: ``I 
looked at that young man and I realized that homophobia and 
hatred had put him there. We buried Eddie in a beautiful place at 
the Gardens of Gethsemani. May he rest in peace''.
<P>
	Father Birch said: ``Then I read that the MP for Central Nova 
said people like Eddie defile humanity, destroy families and 
annihilate mankind. In this case the reverse happened. Eddie was 
annihilated by mankind, represented by good Christians like the 
member for Central Nova. Whatever happened to `love one another 
as I have loved you'''. I ask that question. What happened to ``love 
one another as I have loved you?''
<P>
	I feel a tremendous sense of privilege to stand before the House 
today as an out and proud gay man and to speak for equality, 
justice, dignity and for respect for a community which has too 
often been denied that.
<P>
	The bill is not the last word, but it is an important word. It is 
important that members of the House from all parties affirm we as 
gay and lesbian people are entitled to equality. It is important 
because it may save a few young lives. It may prevent a few people 
from losing their jobs. It may encourage a few more people to be 
out, to be open. It may mean our communities, our 
neighbourhoods, our country are more decent and equal places.
<P>
<B>(1250)</B>
<P>
	We are global citizens. Of course there is still much to be done 
internationally. There are many countries, many jurisdictions in 
which it is a crime to be in any way openly gay. As our government 
has acknowledged in a variety of international fora, we must do far 
more at the international level. I commend the Minister of Foreign 
Affairs for the leadership he has demonstrated on this issue at the 
international level.
<P>
	I thank the Minister of Justice for moving ahead with this 
legislation. It is an important step forward. For 16 long years I have 
been battling for this. The first bill I tabled was almost 16 years 
ago. I have sat on many committees, questioned many ministers.
<P>
	For me as an individual, for me as a gay man and as a member of 
a community that has struggled for many years, this is an important 
day. As long as gay and lesbian people continue to be victims of 
bashings, as long as gay  and lesbian youth are taking their lives 
and attempting suicide, as long as people are losing their jobs and 
are not treated as full and equal citizens, as long as our families are 
not recognized and celebrated, there is still much work to be done.
<P>
	Today let us join in celebrating this very important step.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Tom Wappel (Scarborough West, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, as 
always, I listened very carefully to the hon. member for 
Burnaby-Kingsway because I know that over the years he has had 
a very passionate interest in this subject and has worked very hard 
to promote his point of view.
<P>
	I find it very interesting that if one is arguing in favour of the 
hon. member's point of view, it is quite all right to quote members 
of various churches. If one is arguing against the hon. member and 
one quotes anyone from a church, all of a sudden one is bigoted, 
one is homophobic.
<P>
	My friend quoted directly from a letter from a Catholic priest. I 
ask my friend the following question based on the catechism of the 
Catholic church. My friend brought the subject up, not I.
<P>
	The catechism of the Catholic church states: ``Homosexuality 
refers to relations between men or between women who experience 
an exclusive or predominant sexual attraction toward persons of the 
same sex. Basing itself on sacred scripture which presents 
homosexual acts as acts of grave depravity, tradition has always 
declared that homosexual acts are intrinsically disordered. They 
are contrary to the natural law. They close the sexual act to the gift 
of life. They do not proceed from a genuine effective and sexual 
complementarity. Under no circumstances can they be approved. 
Homosexual persons are called to chastity''.
<P>
	This clearly does not accord with the hon. member's view.
<P>
	Since this is fundamental tenet of a recognized religion in this 
country, does the member consider that statement to be 
homophobic, and if he does should people who believe this as a 
fundamental tenet of their religion be categorized as homophobic 
and should this type of religion be outlawed in Canada?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Robinson:</B> Mr. Speaker, I do not believe labels are at all 
desirable in this debate. I think we have seen too much of that.
<P>
	What is important is to acknowledge that there are a variety of 
deeply held religious beliefs in this country. Certainly the belief the 
hon. member for Scarborough has quoted from is one shared by a 
number of members of the Catholic religion.
<P>
	One of the things we celebrate is not only, one would hope, 
freedom from discrimination but at the same time freedom of 
religion. I have fought long and hard for  freedom of religion in this 
country and I will continue to speak out for freedom of religion.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2546"> 2546 </A></B>
<P>
	At the same time I take this opportunity to note that part of the 
campaign of distortion around this legislation from the member for 
Scarborough West and others has been the suggestion that 
somehow this amendment would open the door to a variety of 
criminal practices. Nothing could be further from the truth. It is 
absolutely despicable to link homosexuality with illegal practices 
such as pedophilia.
<P>
<B>(1255)</B>
<P>
	The reality is, as has been documented very powerfully in a 
study published by the American Academy of Paediatrics in July 
1994, which I would be pleased to table in the House-
<P>
	<B>Mr. Wappel:</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. I have to 
assume that in his remarks the hon. member is suggesting I have 
linked pedophilia with homosexuality. That is absolutely false. I 
call on him to apologize because that is a slur-
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The hon. member for Scarborough West 
will probably have the time to make that point in a moment as a 
matter of debate, which I submit it is.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Robinson:</B> Mr. Speaker, I briefly want to note the results of 
this study of 269 cases of child sexual abuse. This was published in 
the <I>Journal of Paediatrics</I>. The title is ``Sexual Abuse by 
homosexuals?'' Of the 269 cases, two offenders were identified as 
being gay or lesbian. In 82 per cent of the cases, the alleged 
offender was a heterosexual partner of a close relative of the child.
<P>
	I am delighted to hear the hon. member is not making that link. 
Certainly that is not clear from reading the documentation he 
circulated to the House. I welcome his affirming that during the 
course of this debate.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Tom Wappel (Scarborough West, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
there is not a single piece of material bearing my name that the hon. 
member can show anybody that shows I have linked pedophilia to 
homosexuality. That is absolute nonsense.
<P>
	It has been a propaganda tool used by those who are opposed to 
the views I advocate to make me seem something I am not. What I 
have said and will continue to say is sexual orientation, as a phrase, 
means far more than heterosexuality, homosexuality and 
bisexuality. Recognized experts in the fields of law, medicine and 
psychiatry who have appeared before various committees of the 
House have given that testimony. It is not I, but they.
<P>
	None of them has made any link between homosexuality and 
pedophilia. What they have said is various types of sexual 
orientations are within that term. They have said pedophilia is a 
type of sexual orientation. That is the debate and that has 
constantly been twisted by  the hon. member and others to indicate 
that I have somehow linked pedophilia with homosexuality. That is 
a total and complete falsehood.
<P>
	I ask the hon. member if he would agree with me that Dr. 
Stephen J. Wormith, chairperson, and Dr. Howard Barbaree, 
member of the criminal justice psychology section of the Canadian 
Psychological Association, have indicated that sexual orientation is 
a key and fundamental component of pedophilia.
<P>
	John Conroy, chair of the committee on imprisonment and 
release, national criminal justice section of the Canadian Bar 
Association said: ``I would take the definition that you raised a 
minute ago. That has certainly been the definition I have always 
understood, homosexual, heterosexual or some other sexual 
orientation. It could be any kind of sexual orientation and it could 
be something that is illegal''.
<P>
	My point is that if we are to have debate, that is fine. Let us stick 
to the facts, not lies.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Robinson:</B> Mr. Speaker, I trust at the conclusion of my time 
you will want to draw to the attention of the hon. member his 
unparliamentary language.
<P>
	On the definition of sexual orientation, perhaps the hon. member 
is not aware these words have been included in legislation in 
Canada since 1977, in the province of Quebec since 1977, in seven 
provinces and one territory. They have been included in 
jurisdictions throughout the world and not once, never, have those 
words ever been used to defend any illegal conduct.
<P>
	For the hon. member to suggest that somehow sexual orientation 
could be interpreted in a way that would include illegal conduct of 
whatever nature flies totally in the face of reality. If this were to 
happen, I would suggest that somewhere in the world in the course 
of the last 20 years someone might have raised that point. Nobody 
ever has.
<P>
<B>(1300)</B>
<P>
	It is just as when we talk about the definition of family. This is 
another example where the hon. member has said this legislation 
might actually lead to the recognition of gay and lesbian families.
<P>
	The fact of the matter is that gay and lesbian people are involved 
in committed, loving relationships. The fact of the matter is that 
family in Canada today is a concept that certainly extends well 
beyond the definition that was proposed by the Reform member 
from Edmonton yesterday who talked about family being a 
heterosexual couple with children.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> That's right.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Robinson:</B> A Reform member says that is right. Are they 
saying that single parent families are not families in Canada? That 
is absolutely unbelievable. For a party that suggests it believes in 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2547"> 2547 </A></B>
<P>
the family to say that the only families it recognizes are families 
which are  headed by mothers and fathers and have children is 
unbelievable. That is what Reformers are saying.
<P>
	It is ironic that the best known Canadian family around the world 
was a family composed of a brother and sister, Matthew and 
Marilla Cuthbert, an older brother and sister who were never 
married and their adopted child, Anne Shirley, otherwise known as 
Anne of Green Gables. When Matthew died, Marilla's friend, 
Rachel came to live with the family and they adopted twins.
<P>
	God forbid: the Anne of Green Gables family is not the tradition 
family. When I hear the member for Scarborough West and when I 
hear Reform Party members saying that we should define family to 
exclude gay and lesbian families I say they should wake up and 
look at the reality of the constituents they represent because it 
includes gay and lesbian families.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The hon. member has raised the question 
of the use of the word lies. The Chair did not think the member was 
addressing the word lies to accuse that member of using lies. 
Would the member for Scarborough West wish to clarify that 
point?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Wappel:</B> Mr. Speaker, of course I was not referring to the 
hon. member. I had already stated that the attempt to link those two 
has been done by many. I did not wish to cast any aspersions 
whatsoever on the hon. member, and he knows that.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Nick Discepola (Parliamentary Secretary to Solicitor 
General of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like to advise the 
House that I will share my speaking time with the hon. member for 
Vancouver East.
<P>
	As the member for Vaudreuil, I am especially proud of the fact 
that the government tabled this bill. This bill recognizes sexual 
orientation as a prohibited ground of discrimination in Canada.
<P>
	The bill amends the Canadian Human Rights Act by adding 
sexual orientation to the prohibited grounds of discrimination 
already listed in the act, including race, colour, religion and sex.
<P>
	This will bring the wording of the act in line with court decisions 
prescribing that sexual orientation be included in or added to the 
list of prohibited grounds of discrimination contained in the act so 
that the act will be consistent with the Canadian Constitution.
<P>
	The Supreme Court of Canada unanimously recognized that 
sexual orientation was a ground of discrimination similar to those 
listed in section 15 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and 
Freedoms. The charter applies to all legislation passed by this 
Parliament, including the Canadian Human Rights Act.
<P>
	The proposed amendment will make this act consistent with the 
rights protected under the charter as well as with court decisions 
granting gays and lesbians the same  protection against 
discrimination as other Canadians enjoy.
<P>
	Those who object to sexual orientation being recognized as a 
prohibited ground of discrimination make it a matter of moral 
values, when this is mainly a legal matter. No one in this country 
should be discriminated against on the basis of sexual orientation. 
This is a basic matter of justice and fairness. We have no business 
judging people on the basis of their homosexuality or 
heterosexuality. On the other hand, we have a duty to protect all 
Canadians against discrimination in our society.
<P>
	The courts and people of Canada have recognized the fact that 
gays and lesbians form a vulnerable group. They have historically 
been disadvantaged and been the victim of stereotypes, social 
biases and considerable discrimination in our society.
<P>
<B>(1305)</B>
<P>
	No individual should be less deserving of being recognized as a 
full fledged member of Canadian society because of his 
homosexuality. All deserve the same respect, the same 
consideration and the same protection under the law of the land.
<P>
	According to recent polls, most Canadians feel that gays and 
lesbians should enjoy legal protection against discrimination as 
regards employment and services. Canadians support the 
amendment to the Canadian Human Rights Act to include sexual 
orientation as a prohibited ground of discrimination.
<P>
	All recognize that sexual orientation, like sex, race or religion, 
should not have a bearing on the right to employment or services. 
The Canadian Human Rights Act seeks to prevent discrimination at 
the federal level in the areas of employment and provision of goods 
and services. It applies exclusively to federally regulated 
departments, agencies and corporations. The act provides a 
recourse to anyone fired or unfairly treated by an employer, or to 
whom goods or services are refused on the basis of a prohibited 
ground of discrimination.
<P>
	Gays and lesbians must enjoy the same legal protection as all 
Canadians, so that no one in our country is a victim of 
discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation. This amendment 
provides such victims with a quick and inexpensive way to engage 
in a conciliation and settlement process.
<P>
	Eight provinces and territories already prohibit discrimination 
based on sexual orientation in their own human rights legislation. 
They are Quebec which, since 1987 already, has had such an act, as 
well as Ontario, Manitoba, the Yukon, Nova Scotia, New 
Brunswick, British Columbia and Saskatchewan.
<P>
	This amendment aligns the federal act with the provincial ones, 
while also ensuring that it provides the same protection to any 
person who is discriminated against on the basis of sexual
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2548"> 2548 </A></B>
<P>
orientation. The amendment promotes greater fundamental justice 
and equity for all Canadians.
<P>
	Some people have raised various concerns regarding this 
amendment. It is important to address these concerns. First, the 
protection granted to homosexuals does not apply in the case of 
pedophilia. Judicial and administrative tribunals have interpreted 
the expression ``sexual orientation'' as meaning homosexuality, 
heterosexuality and bisexuality. Pedophilia is a specific crime in 
the Criminal Code, regardless of whether it is committed by a 
heterosexual or a homosexual: it has nothing to do with someone's 
sexual orientation.
<P>
	In addition, this amendment does not call into question the 
definition of the family, marriage or spouse, or the fundamental 
role of the family in Canadian society. Neither does this 
amendment lead to the automatic recognition of benefits for same 
sex partners, or open the door to homosexual marriages or the 
adoption of children by homosexual couples.
<P>
	The sole purpose of this amendment is to provide protection for 
gays and lesbians against discrimination with respect to 
employment and the provision of goods and services in areas under 
federal jurisdiction. It must also be pointed out that the Canadian 
Human Rights Act does not apply to religious, cultural or 
educational institutions under provincial regulation. This 
amendment will therefore not affect these institutions. The fears 
raised by this amendment do not, in general, take sufficient account 
of the context and true scope of this amendment.
<P>
	We believe that this amendment is necessary in order to ensure a 
certain basic equity in order to protect all Canadians against types 
of discrimination they encounter in their daily lives.
<P>
<B>(1310)</B>
<P>
	The Canadian Human Rights Act, more than any other kind of 
legislation, reflects the values of a country and of a people. 
Tolerance, equity, and justice are fundamental principles of our 
Canadian identity. Canada is recognized internationally as one of 
the countries in the world with the greatest respect for human 
rights. We cannot accept that people in this country continue to be 
victims of discrimination in the workplace because of their sexual 
orientation. The purpose of this amendment is to correct precisely 
this situation and to ensure greater equity for all Canadians in our 
society.
<P>
	Canadian society recognizes the importance of an individual's 
right to be respected. Each individual is unique and distinct, and 
must be able to count on the same protection under the law. 
Everyone has a sexual orientation, whether it is heterosexual or 
homosexual, and this distinction must not be used to justify 
different protection from that enjoyed by the majority of Canadians 
against discriminatory practices. This amendment makes it 
possible to end discrimination against gays and lesbians in federal 
work places or in federally regulated businesses, such as banks or 
airlines.
<P>
	The exclusion of sexual orientation in Canadian legislation 
offers basic protection against discrimination, such as in the case of 
dismissal, or the refusal to provide services simply because a 
person is gay or lesbian.
<P>
	Although this is only a minor amendment to the act, I would like 
to conclude by saying that this bill nonetheless constitutes an 
essential amendment to ensure equal treatment and opportunities 
for all Canadians. This bill will help build a society in which 
discrimination is not tolerated and in which there is equal 
protection for all individuals. This amendment makes it possible to 
ensure that gays and lesbians receive the same basic protection 
against discrimination enjoyed by all other Canadians. It is a 
question of rights, of justice and of fundamental fairness.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Tom Wappel (Scarborough West, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
because of the great interest in this bill and because of the lengthy 
list of speakers, some of us will not have an opportunity to speak, 
so I am hoping to make a few of my points by asking questions and 
making comments.
<P>
	I listened very carefully to my colleague. I have two comments 
to make and two very simple questions for him.
<P>
	He indicated, and he is absolutely correct, that sexual orientation 
is contained in the human rights codes of numerous provinces. I 
wondered if he was aware that sexual orientation is contained in the 
human rights act of the territory of Yukon and that the sexual 
orientation phrase is defined in the human rights act of the territory 
of Yukon. It is defined as follows: ``Sexual orientation means 
heterosexual, homosexual or bisexual and refers only to consenting 
adults acting within the law''. If he is aware of that, I would ask 
him if he thinks it was incorrect to define the phrase in the Yukon 
human rights code.
<P>
	Second, I hold in my hand the Criminal Code of Canada. It is my 
assertion that nowhere in this book is the word pedophilia used. 
There is no such thing in the Criminal Code of Canada as the crime 
of pedophilia. If a person commits certain sexual acts against a 
child, that is a crime. Pedophilia is no more a crime than thinking 
about planning a murder. There is no crime in planning a murder. 
There is a crime in acting on those thoughts.
<P>
	I wonder if the hon. member would agree with me that the 
so-called crime of pedophilia is not in this book, but that it is the 
acting out of the desires of people which are specifically banned.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Discepola:</B> Mr. Speaker, the fundamental issue is whether it 
is a moral issue or whether it is an issue of  discrimination. I have 
conscientiously looked at all the alternatives. I have a family. I am 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2549"> 2549 </A></B>
<P>
the father of four. I believe this is fundamentally an issue of 
discrimination.
<P>
	As a practising Catholic I do not want to get into the debate of 
whether someone is more religious than another person. No 
religion tolerates discrimination. That is what the issue is. We are 
adding two simple words to the act and if we have differences of 
opinion on that I respect everyone's differences.
<P>
<B>(1315)</B>
<P>
	I am in the fortunate position today to be a member of this 
House. If it was my daughter or my son that was discriminated 
against, what would I want and how would I want my son or 
daughter treated?
<P>
	I have a gay employee who has worked for me for the last 15 
years. I have never had to put him in the back of the shop. Thanks 
to his contribution to my small businesses we have prospered.
<P>
	When I talked to him at great length over it there is one question 
that he asked me that I could never answer and that convinced me. 
He said: ``Why is it wrong for one human being to love another 
human being?'' I have no answer for that and until I have an answer 
then I have to say discrimination is intolerable in our society.
<P>
	That is the direction from which I come at it. I respect others 
who do not share that opinion, but it is for that reason I will be 
voting in favour of bill tonight. I thank the Minister of Justice who 
has put this initiative forward.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Anna Terrana (Vancouver East, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, let 
me first reiterate that the Canadian Human Rights Act only applies 
to the federal government and to federally regulated businesses like 
banks, railways, airlines and telecommunications companies, and 
governs employment and the provision of goods and services in 
each of these sectors, which covers only 10 per cent of the 
Canadian workforce.
<P>
	The rest of the Canadian workforce is covered by the provincial 
and territorial human rights codes. I am also satisfied that the act 
does not apply to religious, cultural or educational institutions; 
they are not under federal jurisdiction.
<P>
	In 1995 royal assent was given to Bill C-41, an act to amend the 
Criminal Code and other acts in consequence thereof. In section 
718.2 of that act, the words sexual orientation were added. The act 
contained many beneficial changes, but what some members of the 
House focused on was the inclusion of the words sexual orientation 
in the list of grounds for discrimination. These two words have 
created a lot of concerns on the part of many people who 
understandably have brought them forward in various ways.
<P>
	This debate is here again with the inclusion of sexual orientation 
in Bill C-33 which is to protect those who  work under the 
jurisdiction of the Canadian Human Rights Act. As we know, this 
inclusion will prohibit discrimination against gays and lesbians. 
This discrimination is already prohibited in seven provinces and 
one territory, and B.C. is one of these provinces.
<P>
	Many Canadians are concerned that the amendment will open 
the door to other demands, such as same sex benefits. I would like 
to comment that nothing earthshaking has happened in the above 
provinces since the legislation was introduced. There was no 
request to include the same sex benefits.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	For me it is a matter of human rights. I believe that everyone in 
the world should be treated equally. I also believe that I must 
protect those who suffer discrimination yet have no voice. My role 
as parliamentarian is to give them a voice. I do not think it is up to 
me to judge people or the way they behave.
<P>
	We are also talking about the family, and I would like to say I 
believe in extended families. Families that include everyone whose 
presence means comfort and compatibility. Those we are 
compatible with are not necessarily those closest to us.
<P>
	The family has changed in recent decades. When I was in Italy, I 
belonged to a large family. I have only one brother, but my 
grandmother, my great-grandmother, my uncles and aunts, my 
cousins and my friends were part of the family. I got along very 
well with many of them.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	My father and my mother were always in the picture. In Canada, 
my family simply includes a son who is now 28. All the rest of my 
family is in Italy and I often find comfort in my friends. Believe 
me, many people in my riding are in the same situation so what is 
the family? A nucleus of people who choose to be together and 
rejoice in each other.
<P>
	If we have concerns about the family, we show little faith in the 
family because the family has always taken care of itself and has 
survived through thick and thin. In fact, there is nothing more 
meaningful or more comforting than a family and its members in 
the manner in which we choose them. Families are resilient. 
Families are as strong as their members are.
<P>
<B>(1320 )</B>
<P>
	Let me add that Roget's International Thesaurus on page 884 
uses the following synonyms for family: kinfolk, race, brood, 
lineage, offspring, community; quite a wide choice of synonyms. Is 
the world not a large family?
<P>
	Let me add that the proposed legislation will not change the 
definition of family, marriage or spouse. It will, however, do 
something extremely important. It will send a message that 
discrimination is unacceptable under all circumstances, a message 
that Canadians have been upholding all along.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2550"> 2550 </A></B>
<P>
	It is a message which we heard loud and clear when in October 
1994 an Angus Reid poll told us that 81 per cent of respondents 
said they would be bothered if a lesbian or a gay colleague 
experienced discrimination in the workplace; 81 per cent also 
indicated their belief that gays and lesbians experience 
discrimination in the workplace; 48 per cent of Canadians said 
they personally knew someone who was gay or lesbian; 36 per 
cent stated that they had a gay or lesbian friend; 12 per cent stated 
that they had a gay or lesbian co-worker; and 12 per cent said that 
they had a family member who was gay or lesbian.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Because of these statistics and my convictions, I believe in this 
bill, which respects the rights of individuals. After all, we are 
talking about human beings, about people who face serious and 
often threatening difficulties and who, at the same time, must 
pretend to be different from what they are because of the 
consequences.
<P>
	Why do we permit this hypocrisy in a country like ours, where 
families are separated because of immigration, life situations or 
other reasons? We should be able to accept and understand 
everyone without discrimination. The rights of all our fellow 
citizens must be protected, and we must understand that, the day 
after this bill is passed, nothing will change. We will, however, be 
able to count on a law that will enable us to put a stop to all 
discrimination and to help those who need help. It is too bad there 
will still be people who will not enjoy the same rights.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	In conclusion, in my opinion all the amendments proposed to the 
legislation were a travesty because this bill addresses the concerns 
of people discriminated against and nothing else. Therefore, I 
support the bill and I have been voting in its favour.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Tom Wappel (Scarborough West, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
repeat, I am rising on questions and comments as I will not have an 
opportunity to speak because of the long list of members who wish 
to address the issue. I want to take the opportunity to make some of 
my points this way.
<P>
	I want to commend the hon. member for her remarks and her 
belief. However, she did say one thing and I wonder if she was 
aware of something. She indicated that the changes to the human 
rights codes of the other provinces did not lead to demands or calls 
for same sex benefits.
<P>
	Is she aware of the speaking notes of Attorney General Marion 
Boyd? The attorney general of the province of Ontario introduced 
Bill 167 in the province of Ontario and it flowed, in my 
submission, from the change to the human rights act of the 
province of Ontario. She said on May 19, 1994: ``I have today 
introduced legislation which will provide same sex couples with 
rights and  obligations equal to those of opposite sex common law 
couples''. What was her justification for so doing? She stated: 
``Our government regards this issue as one of fundamental human 
rights,'' which is the exact same argument that is being put forward 
today.
<P>
	In view of the controversy that spawned in the province of 
Ontario, would the hon. member not allow for the possibility that 
some will use the changes to the human rights laws that we are 
passing today as a justification under the argument of fundamental 
human rights to press their case with the tribunals and with the 
courts to provide same sex couples with rights and obligations 
equal to those of opposite sex common law couples and if not, why 
not?
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Terrana:</B> Mr. Speaker, first, let me thank my colleague for 
taking this issue to heart. It is important that we can express our 
feelings and our opinions in this country. I believe that we should 
all propose what we believe in.
<P>
	Yes, in a way I apologize. In fact, I should have remembered that 
Ontario has gone through this legislation. My own opinion is that it 
may have flowed from the human rights act but not necessarily so.
<P>
<B>(1325)</B>
<P>
	We are not discussing that right now. What we are discussing and 
what we have to concentrate on is the lack of rights for some people 
who work in the federal government or in other companies that are 
under federal jurisdiction. This is what I concentrated on and what I 
am concerned about. Whenever something else comes on board 
then I will have to focus on that and consider it for what it is worth.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ian McClelland (Edmonton Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, this is my second opportunity to put a few words on the 
record with regard to Bill C-33.
<P>
	This bill, as members know, has raised very high emotions in 
many members of Parliament on both sides of the issue. There have 
been some words spoken and actions taken that will reverberate 
long after this bill is forgotten and the House moves on to 
something else, which is the way this place works. Whatever is top 
of mind today is not top of mind tomorrow.
<P>
	The concern that many people in our country have with this bill 
is the way in which the government brought this bill forward, 
carried it through the House, through committee and back into the 
House again. It does not bring credit upon this House or upon our 
country.
<P>
	It does not give the citizens of Canada the benefit of the doubt 
that we could make a reasoned decision, that we could come 
together in harmony, that we could do what is right for all people 
connected to this issue. Those Canadians who are part of the gay 
and lesbian community may feel that this is just a small but 
important step, one which is long overdue and which will  give 
them equality before the law just as everyone else has. Other 
Canadians, most of whom are in the middle, are not all that 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2551"> 2551 </A></B>
<P>
exercised one way or the other. Then on the other side of the scale 
we have those Canadians who feel this is a very dramatic change on 
the social mores of our country and should be considered carefully 
before we go forward.
<P>
	The tragedy of this debate, in the pell-mell rush to get the bill 
through, is that people on both sides feel somewhat trampled, 
particularly people who oppose this bill who are said to be in some 
way discriminatory, or that they are homophobic, or that they are 
somehow unkind and mean-spirited people. If people in our 
country do not have the opportunity to have their voices heard in 
Parliament, why should they then feel that they are part of 
Parliament? Why should they feel that they are represented?
<P>
	We are not cheerleaders. Our job is not to stand and say that 
whatever the government or any group brings forward is just fine. 
Our job is to measure, to temper and to test the laws as they come 
forward.
<P>
	We know in a majority government that at the end of the day our 
country will have a law that exactly represents the will of the 
government even if that government is elected with 43 per cent of 
the popular vote. That is the way our government works and that is 
the way it is. We have to accept that.
<P>
	I know many people from the gay and lesbian community 
honestly feel that to even question the veracity of this bill or the 
honesty by which it has been brought forward is in some way 
deprecating our fellow citizens who are gay or lesbian.
<P>
	I know there has been debate in the House which has tried to 
make the point to link certain unlawful activities with 
homosexuality. However, nothing could be further from the truth. It 
is not right. It is not fair. We have to distinguish and separate what 
is lawful in our country and what is not. It is not made lawful 
because of adding two words to the human rights act to include the 
words ``sexual orientation''.
<P>
<B>(1330)</B>
<P>
	I speak for myself, but there are many in the House who 
understand that the nature of family in the country has changed 
dramatically over the years. We know there are families which are 
composed very differently.
<P>
	In committee the member for Hochelaga-Maisonneuve brought 
forward his definition of family. It is particularly beautiful. His 
definition of family is people who are joined together under the 
common bonds of love, mutual support and mutual protection. That 
description aptly describes the nuclear family. One would hope it 
would be the foundation of the description of the family.
<P>
	Families change as many people in the House know. My family 
is not a nuclear family. I have been divorced twice and married 
three times. It is not something I am proud of. We do not have a 
traditional family, but we do have a family that has love, mutual 
support and mutual protection. Our extended family has that as 
well.
<P>
	Our eldest daughter was adopted. At 21 her adoptive parents 
supported her in finding her birth mother. We got to know one 
another. We were visiting with her adoptive parents and as would 
happen, friends of her parents asked who these people were. Greg 
was stuck for an answer so he said they were special relatives. We 
thought about it and about the relationship we have as a family and 
the strength that Kate's mother Nancy had in supporting her to find 
her birth mother. Nancy said it did not take a lot of strength and 
courage.
<P>
	How can we possibly hurt someone by loving them? How can we 
love someone too much? How could it possibly hurt if another 
family loves a person?
<P>
	No one can tell me anything about the nature of families and 
mutual support and how important it is for us to be flexible and as a 
society to be open and supportive, even if these relationships are 
not ones we feel comfortable about. It is really none of our 
business. On the other side of the coin, marriage and family have a 
longstanding societal and religious significance. That should not be 
taken lightly either. That is the essence of this debate.
<P>
	In my view, it would have been far more difficult for me to come 
to the decision, and it has been a very difficult journey for me, to 
vote against the bill if it had been brought forward honestly and 
dealt with the real issues at hand. The real issues in my view are not 
the issues surrounding discrimination. We are all protected from 
discrimination under the Canadian Charter of Rights and 
Freedoms. We are all protected against discrimination today by 
virtue of the fact that we are human beings.
<P>
<B>(1335 )</B>
<P>
	However, this bill introduces two words, sexual orientation, into 
the statutes of our country. The effect of introducing those two 
words will be to give a foundation to the courts to further continue 
to interpret laws which would essentially support putting same sex 
relationships on the same plane as heterosexual relationships.
<P>
	If that is what we as a country want to do, then let us do it. Let us 
bring forward legislation that states exactly that and debate it on its 
merits. Let us not do it in a Trojan horse fashion saying that this is 
legislation designed to prevent discrimination, that anyone who 
would vote against it would obviously be in favour of 
discrimination and not acknowledging that what is sure to follow 
has not been brought forward honestly into this debate.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2552"> 2552 </A></B>
<P>
	Had that debate come forward, this House may have been able 
to find a way to accommodate both sides. I mentioned in the 
House previously the notion of a registered domestic partnership. 
If this is not the intent of the government, it would have been 
possible for the government to have written the legislation initially 
to accommodate the concerns of people who feel threatened by 
it. It could have limited the scope of the legislation explicitly to 
human rights issues or it could have accepted considered and 
reasoned amendments which would have done so.
<P>
	If these amendments were accepted, it would have allowed many 
more Canadians to support the bill. I believe most Canadians are 
pretty charitable. Most Canadians would have nothing to do with 
discrimination against anyone, including by virtue of someone's 
sexual orientation.
<P>
	A private member's bill was tabled today in the House. Its 
preamble states: ``An act providing for equal treatment for persons 
cohabiting in a relationship similar to a conjugal relationship''. 
There is nothing wrong with that being brought forward. It is 
entirely appropriate that such a bill would be brought forward. 
However, it is evidence of the fact that this debate is not over.
<P>
	The people with whom I have had contact in the gay and lesbian 
community would be the very first to say that it is not over. They 
will press their case, as they have the right to do, as hard as they 
possibly can until the battle is won. I want to put on record that 
from my point of view the people from the gay and lesbian 
community with whom I have had any contact have been 
absolutely forthright and absolutely honest in their intent in what 
they are trying to achieve and why they are trying to achieve it. 
There has been absolutely no suggestion otherwise.
<P>
	As with many members, I find myself greatly discomforted in 
voting against this bill. None of us should in any way want to have 
our hands in anything that would discriminate against people 
because of their sexual orientation or for any reason, although we 
are dealing specifically now with sexual orientation.
<P>
<B>(1340 )</B>
<P>
	At the same time I am charged with the responsibility of 
representing not just my constituents who are concerned about the 
impact of this bill, but all Canadians who are concerned about this 
bill. When I rise this evening to vote against the bill it will not be 
with any sense of satisfaction or joy; it will be with considerable 
sadness and with a heavy heart.
<P>
	I know there will be people who will think that my doing so is a 
repudiation of them as human beings or that in some way I am 
making a value judgment. I am not. I recognize and I accept that 
people are born the way people are born. We are who we are and 
that is the way it is. I celebrate love and companionship. Who am I 
to tell  anybody else how or whom they should love? However, that 
does not allow me to forget my responsibilities to the people who 
sent me here and the obligations I bring to this high office.
<P>
	In a few short hours we will be voting on this bill. There will be 
many people in the months to come who may say that we would 
have been wise to have given more consideration to exactly what 
we are doing. The House gave the same consideration to the $2 
coin as it has to this fundamental question. This is a question which 
is fundamental to many Canadians on both sides of the issue.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Svend J. Robinson (Burnaby-Kingsway, NDP):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I want to thank the hon. member for his comments. I know 
he has personally wrestled with this issue. He spoke earlier this 
week at a reception hosted by EGALE. I want to signal the 
extraordinary contribution which has been made by EGALE, John 
Fisher, the late Les McAfee, and others in this long journey.
<P>
	The member has shared with this House in a very personal way 
the fact that his son, J.R., is gay. One of the important elements of 
this legislation is to ensure that those who apply for jobs within the 
federal jurisdiction are not discriminated against on the basis of 
their sexual orientation. The son of the hon. member for Edmonton 
Southwest could apply for a job in a bank, on a railway, in 
telecommunications or some other job within the federal 
jurisdiction and he could be turned down. The employer could say 
that he does not want him because he is gay and he might hurt his 
business, or maybe the employer would let him work at the back of 
the shop but not at the front.
<P>
	I would plead with the hon. member. Does he not understand? 
Does he not recognize that if this bill does not go through his son, 
his own flesh and blood, would have no recourse in law other than 
that which is pursuant to a court decision which may be in conflict 
with another Alberta court decision? Does he not recognize that we 
need this legislation to at least prohibit that kind of discrimination, 
not just against his son but against all gay and lesbian people in this 
country?
<P>
	<B>Mr. McClelland:</B> Mr. Speaker, before I answer the question of 
the hon. member for Burnaby-Kingsway, I want to acknowledge 
the courage he showed in being the first man to come out here in 
the House of Commons. I also acknowledge the courage of the hon. 
member for Hochelaga-Maisonneuve. It is not an easy thing to 
do. I recognize that.
<P>
<B>(1345)</B>
<P>
	The question my friend posed to me is central to the agony I have 
had to endure in determining how to vote on this issue. If the nub of 
my friend's question was discrimination, if I felt that were the case, 
then nothing could prevent me from voting in favour of this 
legislation.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2553"> 2553 </A></B>
<P>
	Such is not the case. My son, as are all Canadians, is already 
covered by the charter of rights and freedoms. He does have 
recourse. I received a list of companies that have already extended 
benefits to same sex couples. It is as long as my arm.
<P>
	Society is already way past that question, which is not to say 
there is not real foundation to that question. Twenty years ago or 
ten years ago, imagine having the Egale gala on Parliament Hill. 
Not even 20 years ago there were teams of people going through 
the federal government and the armed forces who were called the 
queer police. They were ferreting out people to take them out of 
their jobs. Those people in the gay community, those citizens of 
Canada who are gay-forget the gay community-or lesbian have 
a foundation on which they should feel the necessity of such a law.
<P>
	If it were limited to the notion of the prevention of 
discrimination, even if it were not necessary, even if it were 
redundant, I would support it. It begs the question why would the 
Minister of Justice not accept amendments that would limit the bill 
specifically to what he says it is to make it possible for me and 
many others in the House to support it.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Marlene Catterall (Ottawa West, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
member commented that if certain amendments had been adopted 
this legislation would have been acceptable to him.
<P>
	I refer to one of the amendments he put forward, that the bill be 
amended to define family as meaning a heterosexual couple with 
their natural or adopted children.
<P>
	As I pointed out to the member in a note, does that mean if I were 
a woman with four young children and my husband had the bad 
grace to die on me, I would not be considered a family under 
Canadian law? If I were living with my husband, having raised our 
children and maybe our mother was living with us, sharing our 
meals, bathing in the same bath tub, using the same washing 
machine, looking after each other, that we would not be a family?
<P>
	According to his definition we would not be. I would like him to 
explain why that amendment to the legislation would have made 
sense to him. Is he aware the Canadian Human Rights Act is 
already being interpreted as if discrimination based on sexual 
orientation were in it?
<P>
	Does he not think employers, providers of services, have the 
right to know they cannot discriminate? Right now they do not by 
reading the legislation.
<P>
<B>(1350 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. McClelland:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for 
raising these questions because it gives me a chance to put on the 
record clarification.
<P>
	We exchanged some notes last evening during the vote. The 
amendments which came forward in my name, had I had the 
opportunity to withdraw them I would have. I  think the point was 
very well made. When the amendments went in it was to refer to 
marriage and family. When the amendments were printed it was 
family. I should have caught it but I did not and I apologize.
<P>
	This is one of the reasons for the good faith of the members 
assembled here. They are able to have a look at legislation and say 
that it does not make sense, and it was deservingly defeated.
<P>
	However, there are other members who brought forward 
amendments which would have served the same purpose and they 
were defeated as well.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Robinson:</B> Mr. Speaker, I accept what the hon. member 
said, that some motion went in in his name which did not reflect his 
position.
<P>
	My question to him is a very straightforward question. If that is 
the case, why did he vote for an amendment which excluded single 
parent families? Why did he vote in favour of it?
<P>
	<B>Mr. McClelland:</B> Mr. Speaker, it was in that long silent walk 
home, as I was considering the events of the day, when I thought 
perhaps I blew it that time.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Francis G. LeBlanc (Parliamentary Secretary to 
Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I will be sharing 
my 20 minutes with the hon. member for Burlington.
<P>
	I welcome the decision of the Prime Minister to permit a free 
vote on this legislation. The subject matter of Bill C-33 is a human 
rights issue. It is also a moral issue. As a moral issue it is important 
that members of Parliament be permitted to vote according to their 
conscience.
<P>
	I do not wish to have my support for this legislation 
misconstrued as having been coerced. I realize many of my 
constituents have different views on this question. I know those 
views are deeply held and the product of sincere conviction. I 
respect those views. I want to explain how I have come to my 
position.
<P>
	Those who oppose the bill fear it will have the effect of giving 
social approval to homosexual relationships, to same sex marriages 
and to same sex benefits through the courts, or that it will make it 
possible for crimes such as pedophilia to be protected by human 
rights laws. They argue Bill C-33 grants special rights to gays and 
lesbians.
<P>
	Are these concerns valid? Let us remember what Bill C-33 does. 
Bill C-33 makes a slight amendment to the Canadian Human 
Rights Act. The Canadian Human Rights Act is a federal law which 
prohibits discriminatory practices in the workplace and in access to 
goods and services in activities which are the legislative 
responsibility of the Parliament of Canada. For the purpose of this 
legislation, these activities include the Government of Canada 
itself, banks, airlines, railways and telecommunication companies.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="2554"> 2554 </A></B>
<P>
	The Canadian Human Rights Act is about discrimination related 
to employment and access to goods and services in these sectors 
of our economy. It sets out what is discrimination and the recourse 
and remedies available to individuals when it occurs.
<P>
	Under the current act the prohibited grounds of discrimination 
are race, national or ethnic origin, religion, age, sex, marital status, 
family status, disability or conviction for which a pardon has been 
granted. Bill C-33 adds the words sexual orientation to these 
categories.
<P>
	It is important to emphasize the words are sexual orientation. 
This ought to provide reassurance to Roman Catholics, of which I 
am one. I quote from a recent letter to the Prime Minister by the 
Canadian Conference of Catholic Bishops by the Most Reverend 
Francis J. Spence, Bishop of Kingston.
<P>
<B>(1355)</B>
<P>
	The letter, which I obtained through the courtesy the Most 
Reverend Colin Campbell, Bishop of Antigonish, has been helpful 
to me in considering my position on this legislation. In his letter 
Bishop Spence points to a distinction made by the church which he 
says ``is not often made in the public debate between 
orientation-inclination-and behaviour''.
<P>
	Bill C-33 is entirely about orientation. It has nothing whatsoever 
to do with behaviour. The term is entirely neutral. It applies equally 
to persons who are victims of discrimination because they are 
heterosexual as to those who are victims of discrimination because 
they are homosexual.
<P>
	It has nothing to do with whether a person is sexually active or 
not. The celibate homosexual gets the same protection under Bill 
C-33 as the most promiscuous sexually active heterosexual. What 
counts is whether the individual is the victim of discrimination in 
the workplace or in terms of access to services strictly because of 
his or her sexual orientation. The bill has nothing to say positive or 
negative about the behaviour itself.
<P>
	At the same time, Bill C-33 does not in any way invite or 
encourage an individual to express or practise or flaunt his or her 
sexual orientation or desires in the workplace. It in no way changes 
what are acceptable social norms of behaviour in this regard. If an 
employee or a customer in a federally regulated institution chooses 
to behave in a lewd or sexually aggressive or inappropriate way he 
or she can expect no protection from discipline under Bill C-33. 
They are subject to the same actions related to sexual harassment or 
sexual assault or immoral conduct and so on as exists under present 
laws. However, even in those cases the individual is entitled to due 
process before the law and not to be the object of systematic 
discrimination.
<P>
	Will Bill C-33 lead to the legalization of such crimes as 
pedophilia? The answer is now. Pedophilia is not a sexual 
orientation. It is a crime. It a crime regardless of whether the 
offender is heterosexual or homosexual. It is an offence under the 
Criminal Code which is a totally separate statute in no way affected 
by the bill.
<P>
	Will Bill C-33 end up sanctioning same sex marriages or the 
granting of same sex benefits? No. These are completely separate 
issues that have nothing to do with the Canadian Human Rights 
Act. The Canadian Human Rights Act has to do with discrimination 
in terms of employment and access to goods and services. It has 
nothing to do with marriage. Nor does it apply to same sex benefits.
<P>
	Bill C-33 is not about homosexual unions. It is not about same 
sex benefits. It is not even about sex. It is about human rights. Bill 
C-33 advances the moral proposition that it is a violation of 
fundamental human rights to deny a person access to services or to 
discriminate against someone in terms of employment purely on 
the basis of their sexual orientation.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> I ask the hon. member's 
co-operation and I will certainly see that he has the opportunity to

	<B>Mr. Stan Dromisky (Thunder Bay-Atikokan, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the week of May 5 to 11 is National Forest Week, a time 
when public awareness of Canada's forest resources is encouraged 
by the Canadian provincial forestry associations.
<P>
	Canada has 10 per cent of the world's forests. These forests form 
a vital part of our economy, supporting over 350 communities and 
providing jobs for over 800,000 Canadians. With $50 billion of 
shipments annually Canada is one of the world's largest suppliers 
of forest products. In my riding of Thunder Bay-Atikokan the 
forest and lumber industry is a significant employer.
<P>
	This year's National Forest Week theme is ``Forest Regions: 
Varied Treasures''. This theme reflects the fact that various parts of 
the country support different types of forest ecosystems. In Canada 
we have 10 distinct forest areas, each of which offers its own 
treasures.

Sainte-Perpétue-de-Drummond.
<P>
	Josiane is a brilliant figure skater. She won a gold medal in the

she came first in the short program, novice level, in an international 
invitation competition, the Residential City Cup, which was held in

	<B>Mrs. Sharon Hayes (Port Moody-Coquitlam, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the bill amending the Canadian Human Rights Act to 
include sexual orientation has been shrouded in a deliberate 
campaign of misinformation by the justice minister.
<P>
	The minister is doing this dance of deception in order to deny the 
truth and consequences of Bill C-33. He portrays the bill as the 
simple addition of two words in an act, a simple two clause bill that 
this House should dispose of quickly that will simply address 
discrimination. Not so.
<P>
	The truth is this bill will have profound consequences that will 
impact Canadian family by redefining it, and that undermine the 
fundamental principles of equality.
<P>
	The minister continues to mislead and dodge the truth, while the 
government rams the bill through the House in record time. Under 
false pretences, the government has disabled democracy.

their skills to helping Canada remain strong and united. She 
suggests linking towns of similar sizes to promote understanding

<P>
	A number of statements have been made in the House lauding 
the work of firefighters and the risks they take on behalf of all of 
us. I would like to echo those sentiments.
<P>
	However, the best way we can honour firefighters is for the 
House and the government to take their policy recommendations 
seriously with respect to Operation Respond, a proposal they made 
for dealing with hazardous materials which they would like to see 
set up in Winnipeg as a pilot project. I encourage the government to 
get moving on that. It should also get moving on the proposal with 
respect to a public benefit for firefighters and similar service 
people who lose their lives in the line of duty, and also 
recommendations with respect to the Canada pension plan.

I have had a personal and professional poll prepared in my riding 
of Durham, asking the people what their attitudes were to the 
Canadian Human Rights Act.
<P>
	While there was a clear case of polarization, it was evident that 
the majority was in favour of the changes which they saw as a 
matter of human rights. I hope this will herald a new era of relaxing 
to some degree the discipline in this place in order that members 
can more effectively represent their constituents.
<P>

diligent in ensuring that they fully understand the views of their

Speaker, I want to thank Mr. Ed MacDonald, a forester from 
Vancouver Island, for donating 300 coast cedar seedlings to help 
celebrate National Forest Week. They are available today in the 
opposition lobby.
<P>
	The seedlings remind us that trees clean the air and protect 
watersheds, in addition to sheltering wildlife and providing both 
recreation and jobs for people. Eight hundred and eighty thousand 
people work directly or indirectly in forest industries which 
produced $49 billion in products in 1995, more than half of which 
was in the export industry, making us number one in the world.
<P>
	Even given the limitations of the new softwood lumber 
agreement with the United States, forestry contributes more to the 
balance of trade than agriculture, fishing, mining and energy 
combined. The people of Canada, primarily through their 
provincial governments, have a big say in what happens in our 
forests because most of them are publicly owned.
<P>
	Therefore we must choose wisely regarding land use decisions, 
including native land claims, to protect forestry, the backbone of 
Canada's economy.

<P>
<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="TAXATION">TAXATION</A></H3>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, in the report he tabled this week, the auditor general said 
that Revenue Canada has perhaps totally eliminated Canadian 
income tax on capital gains on goods of enormous value for the 
future. Before the Standing Committee on Public Accounts, he 
confirmed that all capital gains realized on shares of public 
companies could leave the country tax free.
<P>
	My question is for the Minister of Finance, since he is 
responsible for the government's tax policies. Does the Minister of 
Finance agree with the comments of the auditor general to the 
effect that, in addition to the capital gains in family trusts, all 
capital gains on publicly held shares may now be exported without 
Revenue Canada collecting a single cent of tax on them?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, 
we certainly said clearly when we came to office that there were 
weaknesses in the taxation system that needed to be corrected. We 
have supported the actions of the auditor general in this area and 
will continue to do so. This is in fact one reason why we asked the 
Standing Committee on Finance to look at all that, because it is 
vital it be done transparently.
<P>
	That said, the moment we took office, we established specific 
measures to prevent the use of tax havens or foreign companies to 
get around the law.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, to be perfectly clear, in addition to family trusts, all shares 
of public companies may now be transferred out of the country 
without Revenue Canada being able to collect a single cent. The 
minister has not mentioned this.
<P>
	Since Revenue Canada's decision was published on March 21 
and since a tax evasion rush is probably underway, why has the 
minister not suspended the decision of Revenue Canada to put an 
end to this huge risk of billions of dollars being lost abroad?

<HR>

<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, 
I think it is worth reading what we have done to set the record 
straight. At the start, we launched a three-pronged offensive to 
reduce the use of tax havens by Canadian firms and the outflow 
of money, what the Leader of the Opposition is referring to.
<P>
	First, in the 1995 budget, we proposed substantial requirements 
with respect to statements on interests in foreign companies. 
Second, in the 1994 budget, changes were made to the Income Tax 
Act to prevent the transfer of profits realized in Canada to 
companies abroad located in tax havens.
<P>
<B>(1420)</B>
<P>
	Third, the government strengthened exclusionary efforts 
regarding foreign companies and specifically involving 
inter-segment sales by individuals.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I respectfully remind the Minister of Finance and all his 
colleagues that nothing he has just said in any way alters the 
situation criticized by the auditor general.
<P>
	Since finance department officials, as the auditor general 
revealed, acted very quickly one December 23, after a series of 
meetings on December 23, to permit this tax loophole to be used, 
could the Minister of Finance not tell people watching us that his 
officials will get to work and act equally quickly to prevent the 
flight of capital out of Canada at great cost to the Government of 
Canada?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, I 
have just listed the measures we put in place on our arrival in 
office. It is very clear. One of the reasons we put this issue to the 
finance committee was our concern and our keen interest in seeing 
the whole matter examined.
<P>
	Now the Leader of the Opposition is talking about officials. I 
remind him that we are talking about something that happened in 
1991 under the previous government. In most cases, the officials 
who made the decisions are no longer in the same position today.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, we have suspected as much for two and a half years, and 
we kept asking, to no avail, the Minister of Finance to take action. 
Now, the truth has come out.
<P>
	In this morning's issue of the <I>Financial Post</I>, we learned that, 
based on a confidential report prepared by Revenue Canada, no less 
than $60 billion worth of capital secretly left the country in 1991. 
This blatant case of tax evasion was made possible thanks to 
permissive and lax federal legislation.
<P>
	My question is for the Minister of Finance. Will the minister 
confirm these facts? Will he confirm that very rich Canadians 
secretly transferred $60 billion worth of capital outside the country 
without paying tax?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
because the questions tend to repeat themselves, I will switch 
languages.
<P>
	The fact is that we are dealing with a situation on which this 
government began to act immediately on taking office. If there is a 
problem, we basically recognized it. We referred it to the finance 
committee. A series of measures were taken to ensure that taxes 
were paid and that they were paid when due. At the same time, we 
supported the auditor general on this and on everything else.
<P>
	Let us be very clear. The Minister of National Revenue has 
referred this matter to the public accounts committee. We in the 
Department of Finance have referred it to the finance committee. If 
there is a problem here arising out of events which took place in 
1991 under the previous government, then let the facts be made 
clear in front of the finance committee.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, enough is enough. The public must know that the Minister 
of Finance is responsible for tax reform, that we have been asking 
him for two and a half years to carry out such a reform, and that he 
is laughing in our faces.
<P>

take action or will he continue to condone and even help this capital 
outflow?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, 
first, when we came to office, we took action. We eliminated more 
loopholes and flaws than the finance committee recommended. We 
went a lot further than asked by the Bloc Quebecois finance critic.
<P>
<B>(1425)</B>
<P>
	The Minister of National Revenue just hired more auditors, at a 
cost of $50 million. We allocated more money to her department 
precisely to eliminate these loopholes. The question is: Why is the 
Bloc Quebecois finance critic opposed to a public review in that 
sector? Is he afraid of transparency? Is he afraid of discussing these

	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it goes without saying that Canadians are demanding a 
greater say in the political process.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2560"> 2560 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Manning:</B> In this democratic age it is no longer acceptable 
for Canadians to have unelected, unaccountable senators having 
anything to do with the passage of public laws and the spending 
of public money.
<P>
	Alberta has a law on its books for the election of senators and 
Premier Klein wants to hold an election to fill the latest Senate 
vacancy. Will the Prime Minister agree to appoint to the Senate the 
individual elected under the Alberta Senate Selection Act?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, a few years ago we had a vote in this House and in the 
nation regarding an elected Senate. The leader of the third party 
voted against the opportunity to have an elected Senate. Obliged by 
the Canadian Constitution, I will name a senator who I will choose 
and who will represent my party.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the view of Albertans and the Prime Minister on 
representation in the Senate is fundamentally different. Albertans' 
view is that the senators should represent the people of Alberta, not 
the Prime Minister's party.
<P>
	The Prime Minister knows as well as I do that the Senate reform 
proposals contained in the Meech Lake and Charlottetown accords 
were not the triple E Senate proposal that this party represents. The 
Prime Minister knows he can democratize the Senate without a 
constitutional amendment.
<P>
	When Premier Klein holds an election to fill Alberta's vacancy 
in the Senate and hundreds of thousands of Albertans participate in 
that election, as they did the last time, will the Prime Minister 
recognize the right of those people to choose their own 
representative in the Senate of Canada?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, since 1867 we have had a system where senators are 
appointed on the recommendation of the Prime Minister. For 
example, some senators have served this nation very well, such as 
Senator Hastings who was a first quality public servant for many 
years. I also had some very pleasant discussions with a senator by 
the name of Manning who had been appointed by Pierre Trudeau.
<P>
	I think the member was for an elected Senate and now he is 
trying to cover his bad judgment when he voted against 
Charlottetown. When someone destroys something because there is 
an element he does not like, he kills everything. If the member had 
used his judgment, today we would have elected senators. 
However, he did not do that.
<P>
	The same man has also been asking for free votes since the 
beginning of the session and he is now forcing his members to vote 
according to the party line or they are out. At least in this party we 
let some members vote with freedom.
<P>
<B>(1430 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, we are aware of the 19th century concept of the Senate but 
we are talking about the Senate in the 21st century.
<P>
	I also appreciate the tribute to my late father but we ought to 
remember his famous comment on the Senate, that its three 
priorities are alcohol, protocol and Geritol. That is why it ought to 
be reformed.
<P>
	It took Brian Mulroney nine months but at least he eventually 
recognized the democratic will of Albertans and appointed Stan 
Waters to the Senate.
<P>
	The Prime Minister does not need a constitutional amendment to 
do the right thing. Why has the Prime Minister changed his tune on 
Senate elections? Is he prepared to break the promise made by him 
and his party in 1992 to provide an elected Senate?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I fought to have an elected Senate but the leader of the 
third party campaigned across the nation to defeat the 
Charlottetown accord. Now the chickens are coming home to roost. 
Because he did not have the judgment to look at the whole package, 
he decided to kill it and he has to live with the decision.
<P>
	At a time when a lot of the senators are Tories and the House of 
Commons is building legislation to be passed, I will use my 
privilege and exercise my duty to name a senator who will respect 
the will of the House of Commons.

<P>
	Let me reassure the hon. member we intend to deliver on our 
promise in the speech from the throne. What this promise is about 
is sorting out appropriate responsibilities between the federal 
government and provincial governments. It talks about 
determining who can most appropriately do what functions in the 
area of forestry and mining.
<P>
	My department for the past two and half years has been hard at 
work on this and we will continue to work on it.
<P>

pretty clear to me-

[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the minister was quite right to call the Reform Party to 
order, but she could have taken the time to reply to the question, 
and especially to read the throne speech, which clearly says 
``withdraw from its functions''. But yesterday the minister said the 
opposite, a bit like the former Deputy Prime Minister. I quote her 
again:
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	``Let there be no mistake that there are key federal areas where 
we will continue to be involved in both forestry and mining''.

<P>
This contradicts point by point what was said in the throne speech.
<P>
	So that no mistake is made, could the minister and this 
government be clear on this issue? Will she admit that the promise 
made in the throne speech means no more than the red book 
promise with respect to the GST? Will she realize that she has no 
more credibility than Sheila Copps?

hon. member those areas that we continue to be involved with in

of forests on federal crown lands, the First Nations and their lands. 
Forestry is an important aspect of their economic self-sufficiency.

	This afternoon, the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans will 
disclose his new fee schedule for the coast guard. Along with a near 
majority of Canadian stakeholders, the Great Lakes Commission, a 
U.S. organization representing the eight states bordering the Great 
Lakes, sent Raymond Chrétien, the Canadian ambassador in 
Washington, a letter asking the Canadian government to delay the 
implementation of its new fee schedule for coast guard services.
<P>
	Since the unilateral imposition of a coast guard fee schedule 
could have serious repercussions on trade with the U.S., will the 
Prime Minister act on this request by the U.S. and ask his minister 
to delay his decision?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Fred Mifflin (Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, the hon. member knows these fees are not unilateral. 
They were voted on in the House of Commons. They were put 
forward in a study done last year. They were put forward by the 
Marine Advisory Board, which involves members of the industry 
from across Canada. They were studied. There were consultations 
with 850 organizations and individuals right across the country. 
They were tried four different ways.  They were rearranged. The 
were reiterated. They were refined.
<P>
	Everything possible that could be done with these fees to make 
them fair and equitable has been done. After the fees are 
implemented there will be studies to ensure they are fairly done and 
fairly put together with respect to marine services.
<P>
	We are looking at 11 per cent of the overall fees for the coast 
guard marine services and the aids to navigation at less than an 
average of 3 per cent of the overall port charges.

[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Yvan Bernier (Gaspé, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
supplementary question is again for the Prime Minister because the 
Minister of Fisheries and Oceans has just said once again that he 
would first implement the new fee schedule and then conduct a 
review. This makes no sense.
<P>
	I wish to remind the Prime Minister that, according to the 
stakeholders who appeared before the fisheries and oceans 
committee, and according to the Great Lakes Commission, the new 
fee schedule will have serious consequences.
<P>
	Does the Prime Minister realize that, by letting his Minister of 
Fisheries and Oceans blindly go ahead with his new fee schedule, 
he is endangering thousands of jobs as well as the economies of the 
regions along the St. Lawrence and around the Great Lakes?
<P>

Mr. Speaker, before the announcement of the basic fee structure in 
January, there was an IBI study carried out by consultants 
essentially to show the impact on the industry could be absorbed.
<P>
	The results were positive and showed the impact could easily be 
absorbed at the level of $20 million spread in accordance with the 
prorated use of marine services.

question anyway.
<P>
	Max Yalden, the former head of the human rights commission, 
testified before a parliamentary committee in 1994: ``We believe 
that if sexual orientation is included by the courts in the act and 
even if it is more obviously included by Parliament, it would be 
discriminatory on the ground of sexual orientation to give benefits 
of one sort or another to a common law couple and yet deny them to 
a same sex couple''.
<P>
	Why do the Prime Minister and the government insist exactly the 
opposite is true when the commission charged with administering 
the act disagrees with their opinion?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, we are voting on a bill in the House of Commons that will 
ensure there is no discrimination against anybody based on sexual 
orientation. The completion of this human rights act makes Canada 
a country in which people with a different language, different 
colour, different religion and some with different sexual orientation 
can live. It is a society of tolerance that we have in Canada and we 
will be voting for that this afternoon.
<P>

legislate, Parliament will legislate. There will be 
non-discrimination enshrined for the people who happen to be 
homosexual in Canadian society.

coast guard, aids to navigation and marine services cost too much. 
We take people seriously. We looked at the requirement to reduce 
and we are reducing.
<P>
	Last year we reduced $27 million. This year we will be reducing 
$30 million. By the turn of the century we will be saving the 
taxpayer and the Government of Canada $200 million a year, which 
is good news to all taxpayers.

	<B>Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
yesterday and again today members of the Reform Party asked 
question of the government with respect to future plans to grant 
spousal benefits for sexual orientation. We understand that on the 
document passed around MC stands for memorandum to cabinet. 
We understand now that cabinet has discussed this issue.
<P>
	I wonder if the Prime Minister would care to inform Canadians 
precisely what cabinet has decided with respect to future benefits 
for gays and lesbians.
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the only discussion we have had is the bill which is in 
front the House at this moment. That is the only legislation. What 
goes on in cabinet is part of the cabinet. The result of the work of 
cabinet is bills that we introduce in the House of Commons. That is 
it.
<P>
	Right now we have a bill that will be passed and it will be 
progress for Canadian society.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, that is 
completely inconsistent with the document the minister has 
acknowledged has been distributed around, certainly in the Liberal 
backbenches, and which has found its way into the media now.
<P>
	If that is part of the Liberal government's priorities, and it is 
certainly on a list of initiatives, and it is on the document that this 
was a memorandum to cabinet, why in the world is the Prime 
Minister not acknowledging this has been discussed? Why is he not 
coming clean with Canadians and acknowledging this is something 
the government is looking at?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, we have a piece of legislation in front of the House and 
there is a lot of discussion in cabinet and in caucus. In our party we 
consult with caucus members and, contrary to the Reform Party, we 
listen to them.
<P>
	In this case it was a result of the work of the party, as it was voted 
in many party resolutions for more than 15 years, and it will be 
voted on this afternoon. I am very proud of it. In order to achieve 
this I have been able to get this bill passed even by giving freedom 
to members of my party.
<P>
	I heard yesterday on the news that members of the Bloc 
Quebecois were complaining they could not vote  freely on it. 
Since this issue has come before the House, everyday we have read 
silly statements by members of the Reform Party.

	<B>Mr. Robert Bertrand (Pontiac-Gatineau-Labelle, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Secretary of State responsible 
for the Federal Office of Regional Development-Quebec.
<P>
	In recent weeks, the federal government has been criticized 
repeatedly in the press for taking funds out of the national 
infrastructure program budget to finance the space camp in Laval. 
In non equivocal terms, is the federal government contemplating 
dipping directly into the national infrastructure program budget to 
finance the space camp, yes or no?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Martin Cauchon (Secretary of State (Federal Office of 
Regional Development-Quebec, Lib.):</B> The answer is no,Mr. Speaker. The City of Laval did, of course, contemplate the 
possibility of submitting an application for the space camp under 
the infrastructure program. But its application would not have met 
program requirements, since it would have been essentially an 
application for refinancing.
<P>
	However, the City of Laval made changes to the proposed 
multipurpose complex before the infrastructure program's March

	<B>Mr. John Cummins (Delta, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, today a

minister's plan as a cold shower. It sure is. It is a shock to the entire 
industry. The plan will irrevocably change the lives of thousands of 
British Columbians.
<P>
	In the face of mounting opposition why the rush? Why not 
implement those portions of the plan where there is widespread 
support and delay the rest in order to address the broad based 
concerns being expressed in British Columbia?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Fred Mifflin (Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I am not doubting the word of the hon. member, 
although I am very surprised to hear it. Dr. Pearse was in my office 
at eight o'clock this morning. He told me he was very supportive of 
the plan, so I have difficulty with what the member said.
<P>
	The plan is one of choices. There are three choices. The 
fishermen can choose to exit the fishery, they can continue to fish 
with their present investment, or they can increase their investment 
by buying a licence from a fisherman who exits the fishery and 
increase the number of licences. These are choices for fishermen 
that will relieve the pressure on the fish stocks and will result in a 
better economy and a more viable industry.

duties.
<P>
	The facts are as follows: yesterday, a House of Commons 
envelope bearing the mention ``for the member's eyes only'' was 
put in my postal box. It contained the position of the Ligue 
catholique des droits de l'homme on Bill C-33.
<P>
	There was no mention of the source of the documents and no 
covering letter. In other words, the documents were sent 
anonymously.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2567"> 2567 </A></B>
<P>
	It seems to me that such use of the House's postal services is 
not compatible with the rules.
<P>
	Members certainly have the right to send mail to their peers, so 
as to make their ideas known regarding the issues reviewed by the 
House. However, they should use their post-free privilege or, at 
least, identify themselves when they send documents.
<P>
	But to send mail anonymously, through the House's postal 
services, for the benefit of the Ligue catholique des droits de 
l'homme is to lobby for this organization. This clearly violates the 
rules governing the House's postal services, since these services 
are being used for purposes other than those for which they are 
intended.
<P>
	How do we explain the fact that the House staff deemed 
appropriate to put an anonymous envelope in a postal box?
<P>
	I ask the Chair to refer the issue to the Board of internal 
economy, so that it can investigate the matter and shed light on this 
rather serious incident.

my colleagues also told me about it.
<P>
	As the spokesperson for the Board of Internal Economy, I have 
referred the matter to the table officers of the House of Commons

unions. It is not about same sex benefits. It is not even about sex. It 
is about human rights.
<P>
	Bill C-33 advances the moral proposition that it is a violation of 
fundamental human rights to deny a person access to services or to 
discriminate against someone in terms of employment purely on 
the basis of their sexual orientation. Indeed Bill C-33 does not even 
advance that proposition. It merely expresses in federal law what 
already is recognized by the courts and in most provincial human 
rights legislation.
<P>
	The legislation does not confer special rights on gays and 
lesbians any more than including religion as a prohibited ground 
for discrimination confers special rights on Catholics for example. 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2570"> 2570 </A></B>
<P>
It is merely in place to  prevent discrimination on these grounds. If 
discrimination does not take place, then the law need not be 
applied. Unfortunately there is far too much evidence that 
discrimination against gays and lesbians does take place in our 
society.
<P>
	Those who would oppose this bill for whatever purpose need to 
confront the moral question: Is it morally acceptable to 
discriminate against someone because he or she is a homosexual? 
If so, what is the acceptable form and extent of the discrimination? 
Is it putting employees in the back of the shop? Is it refusing 
services to them? Is it by a sign in the window that says no gays 
need apply? These are the questions that need to be asked.
<P>
	Those are the same questions which might in another time and 
another place have been asked where the word ``homosexual'' was 
replaced by the words ``Jew'' or ``black''. If one follows the logic 
of those questions, one leads quickly down the dark road of 
intolerance. These questions will lead us down that road of 
intolerance if we are not prepared to confront them.
<P>
<B>(1525)</B>
<P>
	For example, yesterday a member from Manitoba referred to 
legislation in Canada taking us toward societies like Liberia or 
Zambia with violence and social disorder. He attributed that in 
some way to the provision to prevent discrimination against gays 
and lesbians.
<P>
	In all sincerity I do not believe that Canadians in 1996 want their 
government and their Parliament to go down that road. This is the 
process of reflection which leads me to support this legislation.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Garry Breitkreuz (Yorkton-Melville, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it has been very difficult to get up on this matter today. 
Time allocation has made it such that those members who wish to 
address this are having great difficulty in doing so. I would like to 
make two comments in regard to what the member and other 
members have said today.
<P>
	This morning the Bloc member of Parliament for 
Hochelaga-Maisonneuve gave an example of a church in Quebec 
that refused a group which openly promoted homosexuality the use 
of its facilities. My understanding, at least through the translator, is 
that he felt churches should not be allowed to exercise this choice.
<P>
	What rights do churches have? One of the points we as 
Reformers have been making is precisely that this amendment will 
infringe on the rights of other groups to speak out on ethical moral 
issues. Will they be able to choose whom they associate with? 
There is a moral element to this issue. Will churches be able to 
make these moral judgments after this legislation is passed? The 
fundamental question is: Where do we get our values from?
<P>
	Does the government have an ulterior motive in all of this? The 
questions we have asked have revealed that we are not opposed to 
sexual orientation in the sense that it would prevent discrimination. 
We are opposed to all the other things this opens the door to.
<P>
	Homosexuals are now given as much protection as everyone 
else. We do not want to discriminate. But because none of the 
amendments that we proposed were approved, we have to wonder 
if there is a hidden agenda. Are there ulterior motives?
<P>
	At second reading we approved in principle that we are opposed 
to discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation. I would like all 
members to consider how they are going to vote at third reading 
stage. We really have a choice. In light of the fact that none of the 
amendments were accepted, I hope that all members will seriously 
consider what we are doing when we include this in the Canadian 
Human Rights Act.
<P>
	Many many people in this country are gravely concerned as to 
what this may do to churches, educational institutions or family 
life. If the member has any comments in regard to that I welcome 
them. Those are our basic concerns.
<P>
	<B>Mr. LeBlanc (Cape Breton Highlands-Canso):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
there are good sound legal reasons why each of the amendments 
was not accepted. The reasons differ with each amendment.
<P>
	The problem with the member's question and the line of inquiry 
he is opening up and the attack which has been made on this 
legislation is that the member is not dealing with the legislation. 
The member is dealing with hypotheses, projections of what might 
occur in other legislation if this legislation is passed. He says, quite 
emphatically, that if the Canadian human rights law is changed by 
prohibiting discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation, he is 
not opposed to that. That is what the Canadian human rights law 
that we are amending deals with in this instance.
<P>
<B>(1530)</B>
<P>
	The Criminal Code, the charter of rights and freedoms, all of the 
other laws that are hypothetically raised as spectres that will 
happen if this change is made are totally irrelevant to the 
legislation that we are debating today.
<P>
	If there has to be a change made in the future to some other law 
to deal with concerns such as the one the member has raised, those 
laws will have to be debated in Parliament. If they are debated in 
Parliament then the views of all sides of the House will be raised in 
connection with those laws.
<P>
	However, to raise all these hypothetical scenarios which have 
nothing to do with this law, as the member admits, is again the 
fear-mongering which has been taking place in order to confuse 
Canadians who are  seriously considering the ethical and human 
rights questions which are directly related to this legislation. That 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2571"> 2571 </A></B>
<P>
is a dangerous line of inquiry. The issue is too important to be dealt 
with in this very fuzzy fashion, if I might use that term.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Jackson):</B> The hon. member for 
Yorkton-Melville. I want to remind the hon. member that there is 
another four minutes for questions so if he wants an answer he 
should make sure his question is short.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Garry Breitkreuz (Yorkton-Melville, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the point that we have been trying to make all along in this 
debate is that these people are already protected under the law. We 
do not have to create another category for this.
<P>
	If what the member is saying has any credibility, if this is an 
important issue, why is it being pushed through the House in eight 
or nine days? If all of these repercussions need to be addressed why 
is debate being limited? That flies in the face of what he is saying, 
which is that in a democratic institution all of these things should 
be fully examined to see what the repercussions are and to assure 
people that there is not a hidden agenda. Some documents have 
already been uncovered to show that there are other things that will 
take place. Probably 43 other acts will be amended because of this.
<P>
	If people have concerns in this area why in the world is this bill 
being pushed through without debate? That really contradicts what 
the member is saying in regard to the concerns that people have.
<P>
	<B>Mr. LeBlanc (Cape Breton Highlands-Canso):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the debate on this issue did not start with this legislation a couple of 
weeks ago. It has been going on for years. The same debate has 
gone on in the passage of provincial legislation which was put in 
place going back to the 1970s. It is a debate which has been taking 
place for a long time and is ongoing.
<P>
	The member makes a point about us ramming this through the 
House and about the 43 other laws that will be changed. The bill is 
very simple and straightforward. If there are laws which need to be 
amended they will have to be brought before the House. Then 
members will have an opportunity to debate those changes.
<P>
	However, this is a very simple and straightforward bill which 
amends one particular law in a very precise way.
<P>
	Again, to extrapolate all of these hypothetical scenarios is not 
faithful to the legislative process the House is engaged in.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Paddy Torsney (Burlington, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, this 
debate has stirred many emotions. Many people have said some 
pretty outrageous things throughout it in the Chamber and 
elsewhere.
<P>
<B>(1535 )</B>
<P>
	All members have an obligation to remember that people are 
listening, that we have staff who support us who are affected by our 
words. Canadians have been hurt by some things that have been 
said in the House. Many apocalyptic predictions of what would 
occur if we passed this bill have been presented.
<P>
	I suggest to members that in spite of our inflated views of 
ourselves and our power here, we cannot destroy families. Through 
wars, plagues, famines, through all of history, families have 
survived. It is important to think about what would occur if we do 
not pass this bill.
<P>
	I want to point out what Bill C-33 is not. It does not deal with 
marriage or adoption. It does not apply to religious organizations 
and their teachings. They are not under federal jurisdiction. It does 
not deal with same sex benefits. It does not give heterosexuals the 
right to have sex with minors. It is not about special rights.
<P>
	Human rights are inherent. They are an integral part of human 
beings. Our laws, our legal framework, the way we establish our 
country should reflect this. We recognize as Canadians that it is 
wrong to discriminate against women, that it is wrong to 
discriminate against Catholics. Yet we must also recognize that if 
people are gay or lesbian, problems exist for them in Canada. In the 
provision of goods and services and employment, discrimination is 
taking place.
<P>
	In 1985 an all-party House of Commons committee unanimously 
passed a resolution that this amendment should be made. Eleven 
years later, we are still at this point. It is not in effect for people in 
Canada. I commend the minister for his courage in putting this on 
the table now.
<P>
	Canadians say that discrimination should not occur, that gays 
and lesbians should not be denied promotions, that heterosexuals 
should not be denied jobs, that it is wrong to discriminate. They 
also say they know people who have been discriminated against: 
fathers, brothers, daughters.
<P>
	We know, for instance, that some youths in Canada engage in an 
activity known as the game, an activity that causes them to seek out 
homosexuals and beat them up. Is that okay in Canada? Do 
members agree with that?
<P>
	Police in Canada have hate crime units. In Ottawa in the last two 
years, 387 cases of hate based crime have occurred; 45 of them 
were sexually oriented. We can all stand up and say that it is wrong 
for the 215 assault cases that were race related. It is is even easier 
to say it was wrong for the 210 cases which were based on religion. 
It is very wrong and we do not accept it.
<P>
	It is more challenging somehow for us to stand and be counted 
on the crimes related to hatred against gays and lesbians. In fact, 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2572"> 2572 </A></B>
<P>
many MPs voted for Bill C-41. They stood up for people who were 
beaten up, but somehow  they cannot support this bill. I believe that 
it is through intolerance in employment and other places that we 
communicate as a society that we accept violence against fellow 
citizens.
<P>
	What will we say if we do not pass this bill, if we do not support 
the inclusion of sexual orientation? I would remind all colleagues 
that we all have a gender, we all have a race, we all have a religion, 
we all have a marital status and most importantly, we all have 
sexual orientation. Including sexual orientation in this provision is 
not encouraging a lifestyle. That is as absurd as suggesting that the 
inclusion of religion encourages people to become Greek Orthodox 
or that including gender would encourage men to suddenly want to 
become women.
<P>
	If we do not pass this bill we would be saying that as a nation we 
accept that discrimination on certain grounds is okay. We would be 
saying that certain Canadians, citizens who pay their taxes, raise 
healthy families, go to places of worship, work for charities, are 
somehow not equal to the rest of us who are straight.
<P>
	We would be saying to parents and grandparents that their kids 
are not equal, that their son or daughter does not deserve to be 
judged on skill, education, ability to fly a plane or to handle bank 
transactions. We would be saying that their son or daughter 
deserves to be judged solely on their perceived sexual orientation.
<P>
<B>(1540 )</B>
<P>
	Do not all Canadians, no matter what region they live in, no 
matter which province, no matter how they vote in referendums, 
agree that they share a value of tolerance? Is there not a need to 
stand up and give an important message to Canadians on this front?
<P>
	After listening to this debate I am sure there exists a need. 
People who should know a heck of a lot better. Elected officials 
from the third party, in particular, seem unaware that in seven 
provinces and one territory, over 90 per cent of the Canadian 
population, it is already illegal to send someone to the back of the 
shop and it is already illegal to fire them on the basis of colour, 
religion or sexual orientation.
<P>
	The member for Nanaimo-Cowichan should know better. To 
the member for Lisgar-Marquette, my god, suggesting that we are 
inciting civil war like that in Liberia and Zambia, it is insane. It 
does not make any sense and frankly it is a disservice to the people 
in Liberia and Zambia for what they are going through.
<P>
	After listening to this debate I am positive that amendment is 
necessary and is necessary now. We can waste no more time. It is a 
matter of basic human rights, rights that all of us have the minute 
we are born. All Canadians deserve this law today for their children 
and grandchildren.
<P>
	Tolerance or values are not something of leisure or of 
convenience. We are all called on to stand up for people, to stand 
up for the people no one else seems willing to stand up for. It is a 
challenge I offer all members of this House.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Bryden (Hamilton-Wentworth, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I appreciate the opportunity to make a few remarks here 
and I thank my colleague for her remarks.
<P>
	A few days ago the member for Halifax made this statement with 
respect to the amendments brought by members. She said those 
amendments ``involved fearmongering, intolerant and un-Canadian 
sentiments''.
<P>
	The member for Cape Breton Highlands-Canso again used the 
word fearmongering in connection with the amendments that were 
brought by his colleagues a few days ago and defeated yesterday.
<P>
	I was one of those members who brought an amendment forward 
and I wish my colleagues to know that it was not un-Canadian, it 
was not as a result of fearmongering. I brought the amendment 
forward because I believe that some Canadians are genuinely 
concerned about Bill C-33, not because they are against 
discrimination, but because Bill C-33 is vague and imprecise in its 
application.
<P>
	Canadians do not know what the impact will be. The Minister of 
Justice has assured us the bill is designed to be limited to the 
workplace but there is a genuine concern among many Canadians 
that it may have impact in interpretations that pertain to the 
definition of family and marital status in the context of same sex 
relationships and same sex benefits.
<P>
	The reason for my amendment, and the amendments of several 
other members on both sides, was to try to draw parameters around 
the bill in the precise manner that the Minister of Justice had 
proposed. He had said that the bill should apply to discrimination 
in the workplace. I think 90 per cent of all Canadians would agree 
with him that this is a very good thing.
<P>
	I can assure the House that if I was confident the bill did apply 
only to discrimination in the workplace then I would support it with 
all my heart. I am afraid for some reason, and I do not know why 
there has been a reluctance on the part of the government to do 
what it so easily can do, that is to put in a few phrases which simply 
state that this bill is not to be taken in any context that pertains to 
the redefinition of family, marital status or anything to do with 
same sex relationships. This could have been done. This was in the 
amendments that were put forward and all were defeated in the 
House.
<P>
	I would ask the member for Burlington who spoke very well and 
I would agree with her that we should deplore any form of 
discrimination in the workplace pertaining to sexual orientation.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2573"> 2573 </A></B>
<P>
	Does she not feel that the government could have moved so 
much further forward, could have answered so many of the worries 
of Canadians if only it had defined a little bit more precisely what 
it means by family and to put it in the body of a statute rather 
than to leave it has it is.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Torsney:</B> Mr. Speaker, if we were to ask any person in this 
room to identify who their family is, they would have absolutely no 
problem in describing those people who make up their family.
<P>
<B>(1545 )</B>
<P>
	All of us would have a different definition. All of us would know 
very well what we meant, who those people are. Yet every day I am 
told by people that I do not have a family because I do not have 
children and I do not have a spouse.
<P>
	People want to define traditional family or family, that it is 
heterosexual, with two children or three children. I do not fit that 
description because I do not have a spouse and I do not have 
children.
<P>
	I did not appear on earth all of a sudden. I have a family. I have 
parents. I have brothers and sisters. I have five nieces. I have 
friends. I have a family. I will continue to have those aunts, uncles 
and cousins who make up my family.
<P>
	Should we get into this ridiculous game of trying to make some 
definition that fits everybody? One definition is that it must be 
heterosexual. If I had only my mother and my niece in my family, 
would we somehow not be a family because we were all female?
<P>
	Is it our business who is sleeping in which rooms in a home? 
When it comes to children, yes. When it comes to illegal activity, 
yes. Issues of who are strong economic units, of who support each 
other in other ways, are not for the House to decide.
<P>
	Canadians know what a family is. Everyone in this room could 
define family. I have a family.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to participate in the debate at third reading on Bill C-33, 
whose purpose is to add sexual orientation to the prohibited 
grounds of discrimination listed in the Canadian Human Rights 
Act.
<P>
	I am reiterating the purpose of this bill because some of the 
speeches in this House would suggest a totally different purpose. In 
fact, this bill is aimed at including another reason not to 
discriminate. The Canadian Human Rights Act will now prohibit 
discrimination based on sexual orientation.
<P>
	The truth is that Canada is way behind. That is the truth. What is 
outrageous in all this is that Canada is lagging behind. The rights 
and freedoms charter adopted by Quebec in 1977-when the 
Canadian Human Rights  Act was passed-already prohibited 
discrimination based on sexual orientation. Since then, seven other 
provinces have included similar provisions in their legislation.
<P>
	Were moral and family values in those provinces destroyed? Of 
course not. As the Canadian Human Rights Commission said, it is 
worthwhile and necessary to remind people year after year that 
sexual orientation should be included among the prohibited 
grounds of discrimination.
<P>
	It must be kept in mind that, according to the Universal 
Declaration of Human Rights, all human beings are born equal in 
rights. During an interview on ``Morningside'' on March 19, 1996, 
Max Yalden said this: ``All I am saying is that it must be done''. 
That was before the government made its decision. He added: ``The 
courts have said that it must be done. In some countries to which 
we like to compare ourselves, it has already been done. The 
government now in office-he gave this interview before the bill 
wastabled-and its predecessors promised to do so. What we are 
saying is that the time has come to act''.
<P>
<B>(1550)</B>
<P>
	It is worthwhile to go over the prohibited grounds of 
discrimination listed in the act. There is race. Yet, precisely 
because prejudices are so deeply ingrained, we must help society 
become more tolerant. A good way to help society become more 
tolerant is to pass legislation clearly prohibiting discrimination 
based on race.
<P>
	Then there is national or ethnic origin. I could remind the House 
that French-Canadians have themselves experienced 
discrimination first hand. I could say they are still experiencing it 
but, to help Canadian society become more tolerant, we specified 
in the charter that this is a prohibited ground of discrimination.
<P>
	I now move on to colour, religion, age and sex. Women know 
that the fight is not over, that the real conditions needed to achieve 
equality are not all there. But where would we be if the Canadian 
legislation did not prohibit discrimination based on sex? Yet, as we 
know, it is not because this provision exists that we have all the 
conditions needed to achieve economic equality. We see it in all 
kinds of areas.
<P>
	I continue with marital status. I remember when being divorced 
used to arouse strong prejudices. It has now become a prohibited 
ground of discrimination. It is prohibited to discriminate against 
someone based on marital status, and that is a good thing. Does this 
mean that, in all families, the time when divorced people were 
treated differently is over? No, it is not over.
<P>
	However, we as a society are saying it is prohibited to refuse to 
hire someone because he or she is divorced. The same goes for 
family status, conviction for an offence for which a pardon has 
been granted and, yes, disability, because some people may look 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2574"> 2574 </A></B>
<P>
with contempt at those with disabilities. Does this mean that all 
disabilities will  be overlooked, that those having to live with 
disabilities will enjoy the conditions needed to achieve 
equality? No.
<P>
	The truth is that societies are very slow to learn tolerance and 
that, in some cases, a tolerance that had been taken for granted may 
not be so deeply entrenched.
<P>
	In eight provinces-in Quebec since 1977-sexual orientation is 
listed among the prohibited grounds of discrimination. Again, the 
time has come for Canada to get in step with the provinces, with 
other countries, with the Canadian Human Rights Commission. 
That is the real issue.
<P>
	I was disturbed to see that, until very recently, this government 
had not announced its intention to act on a bona fide promise.
<P>
<B>(1555)</B>
<P>
	I myself heard the Minister of Justice state in this House that the 
government had many priorities and that it was not sure that he 
could act on this commitment before the next election.
<P>
	I wonder why the government rushed in as it did, unannounced, 
with this long awaited and hoped for bill, a bill which only brings 
federal legislation in line with that of the majority of provinces. 
Why did this bill appear all of a sudden, out of the blue, at a time 
when the government was in big trouble because of its own 
turpitude and about to lose face completely? It zoomed through 
second reading, report stage, third reading and time allocation.
<P>
	I figure that the government extricated itself from of a difficult 
situation by turning the tables on us. But I do not want it to get off 
so lightly. I am pleased to speak on this motion. I think that Canada 
is catching up. I am saddened however by statements I have heard 
in this House, because I like to think of Canadian society as a 
tolerant society. But some of the statements made in this House, 
even from members opposite, do not exactly reflect tolerance.
<P>
	I think that our friends on the government side, who do not take 
lightly-and neither do I-the statements made by our Reformer 
friends, should turn their guns on those members of their own party 
who often made much more devastating remarks than the 
Reformers, and that takes some doing. Take for example the hon. 
member for Central Nova, whom I have heard express the view that 
homosexuality was unnatural.
<P>
	It is indeed urgent that this motion be agreed to. It is urgent that 
we pass this motion whose sole purpose is to help society develop 
the tolerance required. I have heard concerns expressed about the 
family. I failed to see the connection between these concerns and 
the bill itself, which explicitly prohibits discrimination.
<P>
	Would the opposite view be to regard as legal discriminating 
against people in the workplace on the grounds that they are gays or 
lesbians? Because it is  important to see in what context these 
provisions will actually and effectively be applied.
<P>
	As I said earlier, never in the 20 years since 1977 that we, in 
Quebec, have been governed by such a provision have I noticed any 
erosion of the family, but I did see it restructure. The fact is that the 
family is changing. I for one think that the family has been 
changing to keep up with economic and social changes for 
centuries. It adjusted to evolving economic and social conditions 
and also-I guess I can fit religion in here-to emerging ideologies 
and behaviours. The family changed as required.
<P>
<B>(1600)</B>
<P>
	The industrial revolution drove many people away from the land 
and into the cities. Large rural families not only reflected a respect 
for religion but a need for a small workforce on the farm. When 
families moved into the cities, their structure underwent significant 
changes.
<P>
	Women started going to work, not because of a sudden urge to 
work in a factory but, on the contrary, because the only work 
available to them was, in most cases, a hard and thankless job that 
slowly killed them.
<P>
	The family structure changed along with economic and social 
conditions. It continues to change. I have a great deal of hope in the 
future, but I know one thing: it is very hard to classify the family 
right now. I went to the trouble of looking at the amendments made 
and I noticed that they overlooked what I think real families are, 
families whose members are responsible and support each other, 
families whose members love children, the sick and the elderly, 
and care for them.
<P>
	Even in the catholic religion-I taught religion a long time 
ago-the marriage is a sacrament involving two people who 
willingly want to get married. The Church is only a witness to that 
union. More than the requirements of the state, what really matters 
in a family is the will of its members to assume a responsibility 
together.
<P>
	It is too soon to put a label on a changing structure. Rather, we 
must look at the needs. As far as I am concerned, the needs of 
children must have priority. When these needs are met, even if it is 
not in a traditional family, it is great for children.
<P>
	If we are to ensure tolerance in our society, Canada must 
urgently send a signal that it is not appropriate to discriminate 
against someone on the basis of his or her sexual orientation. This 
is not the place to analyze the roots of homosexuality or 
lesbianism. However, it is extremely important to understand that it 
is a reality, that we are talking about honest and respectable citizens 
who, like all other members of society, must abide by the same 
moral principles.
<P>
	Sexual orientation is a fact of life. It has always existed and it 
has nothing to do with pedophilia. Nothing at all. Pedophilia is a 
deviation.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2575"> 2575 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1605)</B>
<P>
	Sexual orientation is a fact that, when people become aware of it 
at a certain age, may be disturbing. They may decide, in some 
cases, to acknowledge it, and, in others, not. But it is a fact.
<P>
	So is Canada, or is it not, going to continue to fail to recognize 
the rights of those who are faced with this fact, whatever their age?
<P>
	I would have preferred to see the party in power introduce Bill 
C-33 deliberately and voluntarily as part of its legislative agenda, 
rather than in reaction to a crisis, in order to take the heat off, to 
move a problem to the back burner. But I am nonetheless pleased 
that Canada is finally moving with the times.
<P>
	It remains only to say that all those who are worried should not 
be, because it does not follow that because we are going to add this 
category to the Canadian Human Rights Act that, any more than in 
the case of sex, for example, either mentalities or economic and 
social conditions are going to change immediately. No, it is a signal 
that the country is sending, and it must be an urgent one, it seems to 
me, and it must be clear.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Janko 
Peric</B><B> 
(Cambridge, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the comments of my 
colleague from Mercier. I agree with her that we are all born 
equally as humans. Would the hon. member agree with me that 
there should have one law to protect all humans equally regardless 
of what or who they are?
<P>
	I believe that a great majority of Canadians are against 
discrimination, especially Canadians from my riding of 
Cambridge. They are against discrimination. I am against 
discrimination. I see a human being as a human being. In dividing 
Canadian society into small self-interest groups we are 
discriminating against somebody else.
<P>
	I believe a great majority of Canadians have a right to be 
concerned. What is going to happen to this country? This country 
has been built by the traditional family. I believe that in the future 
Canada will be built even better and stronger with the same values 
without any discrimination.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Lalonde:</B> Mr. Speaker, my answer will deal with two 
things. The first is that, if, since probably after the second world 
war, a growing movement, which began earlier, but a growing 
movement in favour of the explicit recognition in the laws of 
countries that discrimination against certain groups should be 
prohibited, won over governments, it was because this objective, 
this ideal of equality between all men is a difficult objective to 
attain. It is difficult to attain even between two people who love 
each other. So, it is a difficult objective to attain, and it is 
something that must be examined: systemic discrimination does 
exist.
<P>
<B>(1610)</B>
<P>
	There are groups that have been the target of discrimination over 
the years, and the fact that we talked about it, the fact that 
discrimination was prohibited in law helped. I am not saying that 
this completely ended discrimination, but, as I said earlier in my 
speech, I think it is a signal that each society sends. It is a signal of 
tolerance.
<P>
	Sometimes this signal is expressed in a negative way, by saying 
that we must not discriminate. It must be admitted that it is easy, in 
a group, to make fun of someone else, but, as a society, we must tell 
ourselves: ``No, we must not do that''. Essentially, what you are 
seeing is the differences that have been expressed.
<P>
	No, this is not enough. An objective is necessary, but we must 
recognize that there is systemic discrimination, and governments 
cannot allow themselves or the people they govern to discriminate 
against groups that are the target of systemic discrimination.
<P>
	I would add something about fear. This prohibited ground of 
discrimination is to be found in eight provinces; I have not 
calculated the percentage of the Canadian population subject to 
provincial legislation prohibiting such discrimination. Just tell me 
this: Since it entered provincial legislation, have the churches 
collapsed? Of course not. Has it meant the end of discrimination 
within couples? No. But again, it is a signal we are sending, and I 
think that Canada, which, as a country, is lagging behind the 
provinces, must send this signal.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Ms. Roseanne Skoke (Central Nova, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
hon. member raised the issue of religion in her speech. Therefore, I 
would like to address that issue.
<P>
	I draw to the attention of the hon. member that in <I>Hansard</I> on 
April 30 the Minister of Justice stated: ``This bill is fundamentally 
consistent with the most basic teachings of religion''. He went on 
to state that he was a Roman Catholic: ``I developed a deep respect 
for the tenets of the Catholic faith. I suggest this amendment and 
the action it constitutes is completely consistent with those tenets''.
<P>
	It is my position that the Minister of Justice has exceeded his 
authority by speaking on behalf of the church. I would like to ask 
the hon. member, was the Minister of Justice speaking on behalf of 
the church in the province of Quebec?
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Lalonde:</B> Mr. Speaker, I will say to her that I do not think 
so, but there are a number of churches in Canada. Not all churches 
approach these questions the same way. There are churches that 
accept divorce, others, like the Catholic church have a hard time 
coming to  terms with it, even if church members sometimes try to 
make the church change.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2576"> 2576 </A></B>
<P>
	While I was professor of religion, I developed an interest in the 
meaning of words. The word for church in French, ``église'' can 
mean two things: <I>ecclesia</I>, in latin, which means hierarchy, but it 
can also mean the faithful. Over the years, often, the hierarchy has 
codified ethics and the means to getting to heaven. However, 
sometimes people in church, whatever they may have been, have 
tried to move things along, and Catholic church councils and the 
equivalent in other churches have changed that.
<P>
	On this point, I will conclude with something the former premier 
of Quebec, Jacques Parizeau, said about free choice. He said that 
the religion of some must not become the law for others.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Tom Wappel (Scarborough West, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
hon. member for Mercier spoke about how opposed she is to 
discrimination, and how opposed we all are to discrimination.
<P>
	One of the categories the hon. member mentioned in terms of 
discrimination and how bad it is, was age. She specifically 
indicated that there should be no discrimination on the basis of age. 
I hope she agrees with me.
<P>
<B>(1615)</B>
<P>
	I read recently that the province of Quebec was one of the first 
provinces to amend its human rights code to remove permission to 
discriminate on the basis of age, which is euphemistically known 
as the age of retirement.
<P>
	Many provinces permit discrimination on the basis of age. In 
other words, that a person can be fired when they are 65 is 
discrimination on the basis of age. I have not heard many people 
say they are against that, but the province of Quebec eliminated 
that form of discrimination.
<P>
	The new premier of the province of Quebec has decided that for 
economic reasons he may reintroduce age discrimination. Do the 
Bloc Quebecois and the hon. member for Mercier agree with the 
premier of Quebec that there should be discrimination on the basis 
of age?
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Lalonde:</B> Mr. Speaker, I remember the amendment. People 
were stopped from continuing to work when they reached age 65, 
and it was under René Lévesque that this barrier was lifted.
<P>
	Canadian law provides that a distinction on this basis is 
prohibited. You will understand as I do, however, that, in the case 
of employment, practical consideration must be given to the 
situations of young people and of people who are aging.
<P>
	I am sure the situation of young people today, in 1996, is not 
what it was in 1985. The demographic situation,  the economic 
situation and rapidly changing technology make the situation 
difficult today for young people-I have three children. I think the 
government is trying to create a balance in employment terms 
between the right of the young people to have a job and the right of 
the aging population, which includes me, to continue-
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Unfortunately, the member's time has 
expired.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Dianne Brushett (Cumberland-Colchester, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I will be sharing my time with the hon. member for 
London West.
<P>
	There are two primary ways Canadians are protected from 
discrimination at the federal level, the charter of rights and 
freedoms and the Canadian Human Rights Act. Bill C-33 amends 
the human rights act by adding the words sexual orientation as well 
as a preamble to the act.
<P>
	The purpose of this act is to prohibit discrimination in 
employment, housing and the provision of goods and services in 
federally regulated businesses. The act lists grounds or 
characteristics of discrimination that are against the law.
<P>
	For two weeks I have been struggling with this bill. I have 
listened to many debates and I have asked many questions. Since I 
have no legal background, I must trust the judgment of those who 
do.
<P>
	I was quite satisfied last week when the Minister of Justice 
included the preamble which recognizes the importance of family. 
However, I have been advised that a preamble preceding the body 
of legislation carries no weight in a court judgment. Therefore the 
preamble does not provide the level of confidence in the legislation 
I had hoped for.
<P>
	In no way do I endorse discrimination. It is my belief that the 
human dignity and respect of all people goes far beyond the level of 
debate we can bring to the House.
<P>
	I also believe no one has the right to judge the beliefs or lifestyle 
of another. A Canadian is a Canadian regardless of race, religion, 
gender, language or sexual orientation. They should be treated with 
the dignity and respect that all people deserve.
<P>
<B>(1620 )</B>
<P>
	Last Saturday I spoke at an event to promote racial unity held in 
Truro .In my constituency office in a very prominent place over my 
desk hangs an award presented by the local Baha'i community. It 
acknowledges my efforts to promote racial unity and the oneness of 
mankind. I value that plaque as the greatest recognition ever 
bestowed on me.
<P>
	A modern multicultural country like Canada, the best country in 
the world in which to live, has no need for lists or categories that 
prohibit discrimination. It is my belief that Canada needs a new 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2577"> 2577 </A></B>
<P>
human rights act, an act  which states that discrimination will not 
be tolerated in Canada and that every person is equal under the law.
<P>
	Lists are a thing of the past. They take us back to the 1960s and 
1970s. Lists themselves inadvertently create discrimination.
<P>
	Already I have constituents asking me to include more words in 
the list, words such as poverty. Is there anyone who would vote 
against discrimination because a child is poor? I think not. I have 
constituents who would feel more confident about the human rights 
act if we added the words HIV positive to the list as a prohibited 
ground for discrimination.
<P>
	This country has progressed far beyond the need for lists. Lists 
are never ending. As most people assume, a human rights act must 
protect everyone. It must be all inclusive, something that a list or a 
category will never be. Categorizing Canadians and pitting one 
group against another will not protect citizens against 
discrimination but will instead promote divisiveness, anger and 
resentment.
<P>
	We must work toward better legislation that encompasses all 
citizens equally and ensures individuals are judged on their merits 
and not by the colour of their skin or their sexual orientation.
<P>
	My riding of Cumberland-Colchester is a large rural riding in 
northern Nova Scotia. Four Fathers of Confederation were from 
this area; some claim five because an extra one lived there 
sometime. The constituents in this riding have expressed their 
views on virtually every piece of legislation before the House, and 
Bill C-33 is no exception.
<P>
	In their first breath, many constituents tell me there should be no 
discrimination against anyone for any reason. In their second 
breath, they tell me all legislation must protect traditional family 
values. I am the only voice these taxpayers have. There is no paid 
lobby group representing them and very few of them belong to a 
national organization with political influence.
<P>
	I was elected by these people who have reservations that with the 
passage of Bill C-33 their traditional family values will be eroded. 
There is a fear that courts in the future may interpret Bill C-33 
differently from what is intended today.
<P>
	It is naive to believe this legislation will not be tested by the 
courts to define broader implications of the words sexual 
orientation. The fear is that sexual orientation, to be included in the 
act as a prohibited ground of discrimination, will be used by the 
courts to alter the traditional meaning of family.
<P>
	A new human rights act which would clearly protect every 
person from discrimination yet leave no room for broad 
interpretation by the courts would be more appropriate legislation 
at this time.
<P>
	I praise the Prime Minister for his wisdom, for his love of this 
country and for his immense capacity to care about people. He has 
given his team a free vote on this bill. He understands the diverse 
geography of Canada as well as the diversity of its people. Because 
he has great confidence in the future of the country and because of 
his great respect for the dignity of all people, he is deserving of the 
respect I give to him in the House today.
<P>
	In the final hour of this debate, because this legislation is not 
constructed in a manner that serves society without creating 
mistrust and fear, I cannot endorse it.
<P>
<B>(1625)</B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dan McTeague (Ontario, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have a few 
very short questions. I would like to congratulate the hon. member 
from Nova Scotia who just spoke.
<P>
	I think that her comments and the way she came to the 
conclusion that she should not support this bill reflect very well the 
concerns most Canadians have.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The recognition that the bill has only had 10 days to be 
deliberated on, the recognition that there seems to be day in, day 
out new evidence which demonstrates the bill is more than simply 
an honourable question of removing discrimination begs the 
question that the legislation may at some point open the door to 
something which very few members of Parliament would support.
<P>
	Would the hon. member agree with the position taken by the 
Canadian Conference of Catholic Bishops? Its members are 
puzzled by the justice minister's presentation at second reading 
that somehow the Catholic church supports the bill.
<P>
	Could she comment on the statement that they are generally 
concerned that a major redefinition of spouse and marital status 
may result from an otherwise worthy initiative aimed at protecting 
individuals who have historically suffered unjust discrimination?
<P>
	If there is to be such a massive social reconfiguration and change 
in public policy, it should happen only after widespread and 
meaningful consultation.
<P>
	Will the hon. member respond to what the bishops have had to 
say about this matter?
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Brushett:</B> Mr. Speaker, I am here to consider legislation. 
The church has a role in society and we as members of Parliament 
have been elected to serve all people in the country as fairly and 
with as much human dignity as possible. I prefer not to comment 
on the question because it is not part of my decision.
<P>
	My decision was to look at the legislation, to see its value to 
society, to all people. I have a deep sense in my heart. I want to vote 
for the bill because I do not want to see discrimination. At the same 
time, I do not want to be  part of legislation which I feel is not 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2578"> 2578 </A></B>
<P>
progressive, not part of what will take this great country into the 
21st century.
<P>
	I have been before young people in high schools. They are so 
wise, as most young people across the country are. They think this 
legislation is almost obsolete at a time when our country is moving 
forward. We are all people in this great multicultural country with 
race and language differences. This is Canada. Let us speak for all 
people.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Sue Barnes (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
National Revenue, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is with a sense of great 
responsibility that I speak at third reading of Bill C-33, an act to 
amend the Canadian Human Rights Act.
<P>
	The bill amends the act to include sexual orientation among 
prohibited grounds of discrimination. Gay and lesbian Canadians 
will be protected from discrimination in the provision of goods and 
services by the federal government and by federally regulated 
businesses such as banks and airlines. Canadians working in all 
areas of federal jurisdiction will henceforth be protected from 
homophobia in the workplace.
<P>
	Bill C-33 covers all sexual orientations, including 
heterosexuality and bisexuality. However, it is fair to say that 
discrimination in Canada is other than against heterosexuals.
<P>
	I became actively involved in federal politics in the late 1970s 
and this issue has been part of my understanding of the protection 
of minorities throughout my entire political career.
<P>
	In 1977 Quebec led Canadian provinces in being the first to 
prohibit discrimination the basis of sexual orientation. In 1978 the 
Liberal Party of Canada resolved to make the same amendment to 
the Canadian Human Rights Act. In 1979 and every year since the 
Canadian Human Rights Commission has recommended that this 
amendment be passed.
<P>
	In 1985 an all-party committee of the House unanimously 
endorsed the amendment which affirmed the will of Canadians to 
see justice done in this matter. One after the other, provinces were 
amending their own human rights laws to include sexual 
orientation. Now eight provinces and territories provide this 
protection to their citizens.
<P>
<B>(1630 )</B>
<P>
	In 1995 a unanimous Supreme Court of Canada ruled that the 
equality guarantees in the Canadian Charter of Rights and 
Freedoms extend to sexual orientation. Ontario's highest court had 
held in 1992 that the Canadian Human Rights Act was 
unconstitutional because it did not expressly include sexual 
orientation. Since then, the act has been deemed to include those 
words. And so the government is acting now to make the declared 
law explicit.
<P>
	That is the legal and political history of an important period in 
the advancement of human rights in this country. But there is a 
parallel history, a social and deeply personal one for many 
Canadians which has accompanied this legislative progress. It is a 
history of increasing tolerance, founded in understanding, in 
humble recognition of our differences, in simple neighbourliness, 
decency and dignity.
<P>
	As Canadians, we are blessed to live in one of the most tolerant 
and peaceful societies on earth. Who in Canada is not proud of the 
free, open and inclusive society we have built for ourselves? Still 
every day we witness bias, violence and prejudice. We read about it 
in the newspapers and view it on the television. Too many 
Canadians in all walks of life have suffered it firsthand, sometimes 
in subtle ways and other times in ways that are not subtle in the 
least, but coarse, insulting and demeaning.
<P>
	As a parliamentarian I meet many people, many very good 
people so that when I suddenly hear bigoted words being voiced, I 
can only shake my head in sadness and wonder where they come 
from. My own view is that they are born of ignorance and that close 
cousin of ignorance, fear.
<P>
	I find this view confirmed by the studies of Canadian attitudes 
toward gay men and lesbians. In a national Angus Reid poll 
conducted in 1993 fully two-thirds of Canadians supported 
amending the act to include sexual orientation. In 1994, Angus 
Reid examined Canadian public opinion regarding workplace 
discrimination. I was pleased to find evidence there of Canadians' 
profound understanding of the prejudice gay men and lesbians have 
to live with every day.
<P>
	A couple of weeks ago another poll confirmed that 60 per cent of 
Canadians supported the amendment. There has never been a 
published poll showing that a majority of Canadians oppose such 
an amendment.
<P>
	Let me put these numbers on the record because I think they are 
important. Eight out of 10 Canadians believe that gay men and 
lesbians encounter discrimination in the workplace and 4 out of 10 
describe this discrimination as substantial. Typically, Canadians 
see this discrimination take the form of both personal hostility and 
damage to the victim's career. Happily one of two Canadians say 
that if they witnessed workplace discrimination of this kind they 
would speak out on behalf of the victim. In our personal 
relationships, every third Canadian has a gay or lesbian friend, one 
in four of us work with gay people, and one in ten enjoy their love 
and companionship as family members.
<P>
	When we see these numbers we should remember that many gay 
men and lesbians often feel bound to conceal their sexual 
orientation in order to protect themselves from the very real 
possibility of insult and injury.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2579"> 2579 </A></B>
<P>
	In summary, the Angus Reid report states that 57 per cent of 
Canadians have at least one gay or lesbian friend, family member 
or colleague. It concludes that the most supportive attitudes are 
exhibited by those segments of the population who are relatively 
more likely to have a homosexual friend, co-worker or family 
member.
<P>
	In the second reading debate on this bill a member of the Reform 
Party asked whether Bill C-33 would express the wishes of a fully 
informed Canadian public. I submit that the Angus Reid report, 
which the bill's opponents have studiously ignored, answers the 
member's question. The report proves that Canadians are already 
well informed about the discrimination which gay men and 
lesbians experience every day. It is precisely those Canadians, 
those who have the best and most direct information possible, who 
are the most supportive of this amendment.
<P>
	As I said last week in the House, we are speaking here of our 
brothers and sisters, our sons and daughters, our neighbours and 
our friends. Will those members who oppose this bill stand 
between Canadians and the anxious concern they feel for their 
fellow Canadians? Will they discount the tolerance and 
understanding that follow from personal knowledge of the people 
whom this amendment will benefit?
<P>
	I reiterate, nearly all Canadian provinces have already enacted 
such legislation as have Australia, New Zealand, Denmark, France, 
Germany, The Netherlands and South Africa. Can this bill's 
opponents point to the dire consequences that have followed? They 
cannot.
<P>
<B>(1635 )</B>
<P>
	Furthermore, the European community passed formal 
resolutions in 1994 calling for its member states to end 
discrimination based on sexual orientation. The United Nations 
human rights committee, the foremost monitor of human rights in 
the world, supports the inclusion of sexual orientation as a 
prohibited ground. The world has always looked to and respected 
Canada for its leadership on and protection of human rights.
<P>
	The homophobia that has marred societies for centuries is being 
recognized for what it is: a pointless and vicious injustice.
<P>
	In my own province, Ontario, the provincial human rights law 
has contained this protection for over 10 years and the sky has not 
fallen.
<P>
	Some of the bill's opponents advocate stripping the act of the 
characteristics which it presently lists: race, national or ethnic 
origin, gender, colour, religion and so forth. They claim that this 
enumeration creates specially privileged minorities. It is bad logic 
and it is bad law. I also find it extremely disrespectful of the tragic 
historic realities that inspired the creation of human rights 
legislation everywhere. Behind that list, which they disparage, 
there stand millions of human beings who had those characteristics 
and who suffered bitterly for them.
<P>
	To the member of the third party who asks: ``When will the 
additions to the list end?'' I say: ``When will discrimination and 
injustice end?''
<P>
	The courts have already said that the act includes protection for 
sexual orientation. Why not just leave it alone? Because here lies 
our parliamentary responsibility and accountability. Fundamental 
principles of equality must be articulated and clarified. This is not 
simply a matter of jurists knowing the rules. At the level of 
fundamental principles it is a matter of declaring in our own 
statutes, easily accessible to all Canadians, the ethical basis on 
which we found our society.
<P>
	In this debate we have been reminded of the high proportion of 
gay and lesbian youth among the homeless on the streets of our 
large cities. What contributes to this? Arguably the abuse and 
rejection within their own families, the alienation from their peers, 
the heightened rates of suicide and substance abuse. There are 
studies which relate up to one-third of all teen suicide to sexual 
orientation conflict, a shocking and tragic toll.
<P>
	A great fuss has been made about the possibility of the extension 
of same sex benefits flowing from this amendment, but the fact is 
that these benefits are already extended without compulsion of law. 
With little fuss, hundreds of Canadian organizations, large and 
small, have extended same sex benefits to their employees. In my 
riding of London West I can cite the examples of the London Life 
Insurance Company, the University of Western Ontario, the 
London Health Sciences Centre, the Toronto-Dominion Bank, the 
Bank of Nova Scotia, the Royal Bank, the Bank of Montreal, 
Fanshawe College, Canada Trust and the list goes on. Across the 
nation, hospitals, universities, colleges, municipalities, public 
utilities, community and social service organizations, private 
business, newspapers, crown corporations and churches have taken 
the step.
<P>
	The government promised to work to safeguard and advance the 
nation's prosperity and security. Putting an end to the prejudice and 
violence which gay men and lesbians have long suffered is integral 
to that design and it has acted. Any sexual orientation should not be 
grounds for discrimination.
<P>
	There is more at stake than the need to curtail long established 
habits of fear and discrimination against our fellow citizens, 
although that must be our first goal. Make no mistake, a failure to 
pass this amendment will help to entrench intolerance.
<P>
	By repudiating-
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> I am sorry. The member's time has 
expired.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Williams (St. Albert, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I always 
thought that Parliament was here to lead and manage the country 
and demonstrate how we should move forward. However, the tone 
of the member's speech was that this House is following the court 
of  Ontario which thinks it has written into our laws that sexual 
orientation is part of the Canadian Human Rights Act. Then she 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2580"> 2580 </A></B>
<P>
went on to say how it has been done in other countries and how we 
have to follow. That is hardly what I would call leadership.
<P>
	I would like to bring one point out quite clearly. There is another 
court in this country which is the appeal court of the province of 
Alberta. It is the highest court in that province. It is equal in 
jurisdiction to the court in Ontario to which the hon. member 
referred. It is one step below the supreme court of this country. It 
quite clearly said in a well-reasoned 86-page judgment it brought 
down two months ago that it is not the role of the courts to make 
law. There is one line in that long and well reasoned judgement to 
which all courts of the land should take heed. It stated that if the 
judiciary wants to privateer in the parliamentary ceiling it does so 
at its own risk. From there it went on to explain and expound the 
fact that the courts have no right to add and write into the law.
<P>
<B>(1640)</B>
<P>
	I would like to point out to the member who has just spoken that 
if she thinks that she draws the strength of her arguments from the 
fact that a court in Ontario said it should be written into the law, 
may I tell her quite explicitly and categorically that there is another 
court in this land that holds an opposite opinion.
<P>
	I would suggest that the judgment by that court be debated and 
discussed in this House and given the attention that it merits before 
the government thinks it should introduce and pass this law.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Barnes:</B> Mr. Speaker, I want to respond to this question. I 
respect the opinions of other people in this House, but I am a 
lawyer by profession and the Vriend decision in Alberta recently 
added ambiguity at a court of appeal level.
<P>
	The Ontario Court of Appeal in the Haig case did lead this court 
and did change the law. It ostensibly changed this as of 1992. That 
is when the federal human rights commission changed.
<P>
	In May of last year, the Egan and Nesbitt decision in the 
Supreme Court of Canada said that what we are talking about today 
is to be included at the federal level.
<P>
	I am saying to this member, this is why we are here. A person 
should not have to look to the courts. What we are doing here is 
changing the basic nature. We are saying that discrimination in the 
workplace, discrimination in services is wrong.
<P>
	This is a statute, anti-discrimination. It is necessary because 
there are elements in our society, as the third party well knows, that 
would not have us do this. They think that it is okay. It is not okay.
<P>
	I want to finish my speech and I will use this question-
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Is there unanimous consent for the 
member to finish her speech?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> No.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> It is my duty under our standing orders to 
inform the House that the question to be raised tonight at the time 
of adjournment is as follows: the hon. member for 
Mackenzie-Railways.
<P>
	I have received notice from the hon. member for 
Glengarry-Prescott-Russell that he is unable to move his motion 
during private members' hour on Friday.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Since it is not possible to trade places on the order of precedence, 
I ask the Clerk to drop this order to the bottom of the order of 
precedence on the Order Paper.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Private members' hour will thus be cancelled and the House will 
continue with the business before it prior to private member's hour.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Speaker (Lethbridge):</B> Mr. Speaker, on a point of order, the 
member for London West has two paragraphs to complete. 
Someone in our assembly said go, and I think you understood it as 
no.
<P>
	I would like you to ask for unanimous consent for her to 
conclude her speech.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The no did not come from that side of the 
House.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Wappel:</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. I said no. 
The reason I said no was because the same request was made in 
reference to me yesterday. The hon. member for Winnipeg-St. 
James said no. However I withdraw my no, if the rest of the House 
agrees.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Barnes:</B> Mr. Speaker, thank you very much to the members 
in the House.
<P>
	By repudiating discrimination against gay men and lesbians we 
extend a hand to those who have suffered, and acknowledge the 
contributions of others who have risen above prejudice to enrich 
their own lives and those around them.
<P>
	Respectful of all my colleagues in this House, I call on them now 
to look deeply into their hearts with knowledge and understanding 
in their minds when casting their vote on this fundamental human 
rights issue, a bill truly worthy of their support. I thank hon. 
members all over this House for my ability to ask my prayer for 
them.
<P>
<B>(1645 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Harvard:</B> Mr. Speaker, I want to make it clear that when I 
denied unanimous consent yesterday it was on a request to speak on 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2581"> 2581 </A></B>
<P>
a motion twice. It had nothing to do  with extending the timefor a speech. It was only on the request to speak twice on the 
same motion.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, we would not want to foster disunity in the government 
benches so I will proceed.
<P>
	I rise to participate in the closing debate on the government's 
Bill C-33. In preparation for this debate my reading has included 
most of the speeches made by members on both sides of the House. 
I want to commend members for the sincerity and quality of their 
contributions. I particularly want to thank the members for Port 
Moody-Coquitlam and Edmonton Southwest for co-ordinating 
Reform's analysis of the bill and for the amendments that they have 
put forward to address its defects.
<P>
	As debate winds down there is little I or anyone else can add at 
this stage to the discussion of the details of the bill. Therefore, I 
would like to focus on the bigger picture starting with its intent.
<P>
	Discrimination has its roots in prejudice, in the tendency of the 
human heart to prejudge others on the basis of appearances or 
unfair or unreasonable criteria. A prejudice becomes 
discrimination when it expresses itself verbally in particular 
decisions or acts, including hiring and firing and providing or 
withholding services on the basis of prejudgment or unfair or 
unreasonable criteria.
<P>
	I therefore wish to make clear at the outset that Reform supports 
the noble intention of this bill. We fervently desire, as do all 
members, a society free from prejudice and discrimination. Our 
commitment to this intention comes from two sources, from the 
Canadian people whom we endeavour to represent in this Chamber 
and from the principles of our party itself.
<P>
	The foremost among the attributes that Canadians want reflected 
in our political leaders and institutions are integrity, accountability, 
freedom, equality and tolerance of differences. These are 
fundamental to the aspirations of Canadians to be one of the 
world's most democratic, just and pluralistic societies.
<P>
	The principles of the Reform Party are equally clear on this 
subject. Our party affirms the equality of all Canadians in law, the 
fundamental importance of the individual and the right of 
individuals to be different from one another. Our party affirms the 
right of Canadians to be free from discrimination, hate mongering 
and intolerance on any basis.
<P>
	It is because statements by several of our own members this 
week cast doubt on these commitments that I have had to take some 
extraordinary steps to reassure Canadians of our commitment. It is 
not all right for employers to fire an employee simply because an 
intolerant customer complains about their colour or lifestyle. It is 
not all right to justify and explain away discrimination or to imply 
that some Canadians have invited discrimination against 
themselves. These views  are not consistent with the broad values 
of Canadians, with the broad values of Reformers or with the 
principles of the Reform Party, and I want that on record.
<P>
	That being the case, why do the majority of Reformers oppose 
this bill in principle? It is first and foremost because we believe 
that its approach to attacking discrimination is wrong headed and 
ineffective.
<P>
	The basic approach to preventing discrimination incorporated in 
the Canadian Human Rights Act, the act which this bill amends, is 
to define prohibited grounds of discrimination.
<P>
	By section 16 of the Canadian Human Rights Act, what started 
out as categorizations of Canadians simply for the purpose of 
defining prohibited grounds of discrimination have become special 
entitlements for groups of disadvantaged individuals defined 
essentially in terms of their race, ethnic origin, colour, religion, 
age, sex, et cetera, and if this bill were passed, sexual orientation.
<P>
	I define this approach to dealing with discrimination and 
affirmative action as a special status approach. My basic objection 
to it is that it has not worked well and has some very negative 
consequences.
<P>
	For 30 years Liberal governments in particular have taken this 
approach to combating discrimination. However, there is still all 
kinds of discrimination in this country, including systemic 
discrimination practised by the state under statutes like the Indian 
Act. One of the unfortunate side effects of this approach is that it 
requires and fosters this divisive categorization of Canadians to 
which I have referred.
<P>
<B>(1650 )</B>
<P>
	Reformers want to explore. We do not profess to have all the 
answers but we want the justice department, the courts and this 
Parliament to explore whether or not there is a better approach to 
protecting minorities from discrimination and to providing special 
help to disadvantaged Canadians.
<P>
	The approach we want explored is one that would base the 
entitlement to special help and protection not on personal 
characteristics or membership in a special group, but simply on the 
naked fact that those people are Canadians period, entitled to 
equality before the law. This is an equality approach to affirming 
rights and preventing discrimination. Its chief advocate in the 
federal field is the Reform Party of Canada. In my judgment it will 
lead to higher ground and better results than the tired old Liberal 
approach to dealing with discrimination, aboriginal policy, 
multicultural policy and national unity on the basis of special 
status.
<P>
	Hon. members should ask: How do you protect someone from 
discrimination, let us say, in housing and accommodation, on the 
basis of equality rather than special status? This is the question 
Parliament should  have been addressing in reference to this bill 
and has not. I would be pleased to enlarge on our answer to that 
question in questions and comments if someone would like to put 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2582"> 2582 </A></B>
<P>
it. How do you protect someone from discrimination? My time is 
short so I will come back to that in questions and comments.
<P>
	There is a second fundamental reason for having grave 
reservations about this bill and its implications. It is a reason that 
has been expressed by many on both sides of the House and that is 
its potential impact on the traditional family. Reform is committed 
by its founding principles to strengthening and protecting the 
family unit as essential to the well-being of individuals and society.
<P>
	If Reformers and Canadians believed that this bill was a simple 
amendment to the Canadian Human Rights Act with no future 
implications for the family, that is, if we could believe that it 
provides no grounds for the courts or the government to change the 
definition of the family, or to provide state sanction of same sex 
marriages, or the extension of spousal benefits to same sex couples, 
we would still oppose the bill but mainly on the grounds I have 
previously outlined. If however this bill is the first step toward 
these other changes in the status of the family or entitlement to 
benefits, then we and I believe the vast majority of Canadians do 
not want to start down that slippery slope.
<P>
	I am well aware the minister has tried to assure the House that 
this is a stand alone amendment with no future implications for the 
family. However his assurances and arguments have failed to 
convince us that this is the case.
<P>
	Government members defeated every amendment which would 
affirm that the inclusion of sexual orientation in the Canadian 
Human Rights Act would not redefine the terms of marriage, 
family or spouse in any act of Parliament. Government members 
defeated every amendment that would prevent follow up to this bill 
to extend spousal benefits to same sex couples or to include sexual 
orientation as a ground for affirmative action. The government 
opposed these amendments even when they were put forward by 
Liberal members.
<P>
	The justice department's policy agenda dated March 8, which the 
justice minister was questioned on in the House yesterday, listed a 
series of initiatives the department is pursuing. At the top of the list 
was this amendment to the Canadian Human Rights Act, but right 
next to it on the list, despite the minister's assurances that there was 
no connection or progression here, were references to family 
status, same sex couples and dependent benefits.
<P>
	The Liberal member for Mississauga South rightly quotes the 
chairman of the Human Rights Commission, Max Yalden, as 
saying in his March 1996 report that if we give a benefit to a 
heterosexual couple and deny it to a same sex couple that is 
discrimination. This is a statement  by the head of the commission 
that will implement the bill we are discussing today.
<P>
	The Liberal member for Huron-Bruce rightly quoted Justice 
Lamer in the 1993 Mossop case speaking for the majority of the 
Supreme Court of Canada saying that if the Canadian Human 
Rights Act included sexual orientation he might well conclude that 
family status includes homosexual couples. This is from the head 
of the institution that will interpret the bill we are dealing with 
today.
<P>
	Representatives of gay rights lobby groups such as EGALE, as 
pointed out by the member for Medicine Hat, have made it quite 
clear they regard this amendment simply as the first step toward the 
building of a whole new set of rights and privileges for their group 
across the country. There are many members of this House, and I 
would argue a majority of Canadians, who might view this bill 
differently if they honestly believed it was simply a stand alone 
amendment. If they have any grounds for really believing it is the 
first step down the slippery slope that I have described, they cannot 
support it.
<P>
<B>(1655)</B>
<P>
	The bureaucrats who will implement the amendment, the court 
that will interpret it and the interest groups to whom it will give 
standing are all out there greasing the slippery slope and making it 
abundantly clear they intend to send Canada down that slope. When 
the minister and the government oppose and defeat every 
amendment designed to prevent that from happening, the minister 
has given family oriented members of this House a substantive 
reason to vote against the bill.
<P>
	Finally, I am pleased that a number of members, including the 
minister, have seen fit to comment on the inappropriateness of this 
bill from a religious perspective. We in this House are too inhibited 
by the current doctrines of political correctness and the dangers of 
media misinterpretation from speaking frankly on public issues 
from the perspective of our spiritual values and spiritual 
experience.
<P>
	We should remind ourselves that the principle of the separation 
of church and state, which is essentially an American constitutional 
principle but one with which most of us would agree, ought not to 
mean the separation of public people from religious conviction or 
the separation of religious and spiritual values from considerations 
of public policy.
<P>
	I was therefore pleased to hear the justice minister refer openly 
to his Roman Catholic faith and upbringing, to hear him read from 
the catechism of his church entitled ``Life in Christ'' and hear him 
try to link the principle of this bill to the teachings of Christ. The 
Minister of Justice perhaps better than anyone in this House knows 
that any extension of freedom, including freedom from 
discrimination, is subject, as our Constitution says, to such 
reasonable limits 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2583"> 2583 </A></B>
<P>
prescribed by  law as can be demonstrably justified in a free and 
democratic society.
<P>
	The reasonable limit to any freedom, including freedom from 
discrimination, is the point at which that freedom impinges upon 
other freedoms guaranteed by the charter. Those of us who in 
addition to believing in freedom from discrimination also believe 
in freedom of conscience and religion want to be assured that the 
enactment of this bill will not infringe upon the freedom of any 
religious group to express or teach their beliefs the morality or 
immorality of any sexual activity or relationship, heterosexual or 
homosexual. That is the function of religion in society. If there is 
error in religious teaching that should be subject to correction, but 
subject to the great corrective action of freedom of speech.
<P>
	The fact that the minister and the majority of his colleagues 
voted down amendments affirming that including sexual 
orientation will not affect freedom of religion, expression and 
association as guaranteed by the charter of rights and freedoms 
gives members who take these religious freedoms and values 
seriously another substantive reason for voting against the bill.
<P>
	In the final analysis I do not believe that the root cause of 
prejudice in the human heart can be exorcized through legislation, 
caucus rules or admonitions by leaders. That requires a change of 
heart which is beyond the reach of this Parliament.
<P>
	As the justice minister saw fit to conclude his remarks by 
quoting from his church's catechism and the ``Life of Christ'', 
perhaps I could close by quoting from another great authority on 
the life of Christ, the Apostle Paul, a man who first practised and 
then worked against the bitter racial and systemic prejudices of his 
day.
<P>
	He stated the ideal in these terms: In the Kingdom of Christ there 
would be neither Greek nor Hebrew, neither racial distinction nor 
discrimination based on race or religion, neither male nor female, 
neither bond nor free, but all would be one. The Christian ideal is 
not only the complete eradication of prejudice and discrimination 
but the elimination of the very conceptualizations and 
categorizations, the end of categories, upon which prejudice feeds.
<P>
	This of course is an ideal which cannot be fully achieved in this 
world but we can decide whether we press toward it or go in the 
other direction. This bill in my judgment does not press in that 
direction and provides another substantive reason for voting 
against it.
<P>
	I therefore advise members of the House to defeat this bill on the 
grounds that it is based on the special status approach to reducing 
discrimination which does not work well, that it provides 
inadequate support for the family and freedom of religion and does 
not further the vision of genuine equality to which the vast majority 
of Canadians aspire.
<P>

[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Réal Ménard (Hochelaga-Maisonneuve, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I want to thank the Reform leader for taking the time to 
participate in this debate. I think it is very nice of him. I feel like 
asking him two or three questions.
<P>
	My first question is this: Does he believe that homosexuality is 
innate or acquired? Second, if one of his colleagues in this House 
told him he was gay, would the Reform leader allow him to keep 
his seat? Third, would the Reform leader agree to clarify his 
position on the highly discriminatory comments made by the hon. 
member for Macleod, a medical doctor?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Manning:</B> Mr. Speaker, the simple answer to the member's 
second question is yes.
<P>
	The answer to his third question is that the member for Macleod 
was expressing a medical opinion on the state of health connected 
with homosexual activity. Other members of the House who are 
doctors also expressed medical opinions of a different view. That is 
his right to do so.
<P>
	On the member's first question, is it innate? I would say it is 
immaterial to this debate. It is immaterial because the law it not 
concerned with what a person is. It is concerned with what he or 
she does. The essence of the principle of equality is that the law is 
concerned with what people do, not with what people are.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Peter Thalheimer (Timmins-Chapleau, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I wonder if the hon. member could assist me.
<P>
	I am sure he is aware of the Supreme Court of Canada decision in 
Egan and Nesbitt which says unanimously that sexual orientation is 
a prohibited ground of discrimination under the equality provision 
of section 15 of the charter. I am sure he is aware also of the fact 
that the charter does not apply to private companies and federally 
regulated industries and that the Canadian Human Rights Act does 
apply.
<P>
	How can gays and lesbians be protected in the private sector 
workplace under the charter if there is no amendment to the 
Canadian Human Rights Act?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Manning:</B> Mr. Speaker, the charter of rights and freedoms 
protects everyone. However, I think the member is missing my 
point.
<P>
	I am not talking about not having protection under the Canadian 
Human Rights Act. I am disagreeing with the approach that is 
being taken to the provision of protection from discrimination or 
special help for special groups. I am saying that there is a different 
approach than this categorization approach which is used in the 
Canadian Human Rights Act and which is partially mixed up in the 
charter. There is a different approach based strictly on equality.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2584"> 2584 </A></B>
<P>
	I am arguing that at least the House ought to consider that. I 
do not think it ever has.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gordon Kirkby (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Justice and Attorney General of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
have a quote here from the hon. member for Lisgar-Marquette, 
who said: ``If we want to look at what homosexuality and 
permissiveness have done to some countries, let us look at Africa 
and the problems it has run into. Let us look at Liberia right now. 
Do we want that type of system? I do not''. This is implying, of 
course, that homosexuality will lead to civil war.
<P>
	In addition to that, a Reform member from British Columbia at a 
public meeting indicated earlier this week when a series of 
intolerant statements were made, he asked what was the dividing 
line between China and India and named the Fraser River as the 
answer.
<P>
	I wonder if leader of the Reform Party could tell us if he agrees 
with these statements. If not, will he tell these members what to do.
<P>
<B>(1705 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Manning:</B> Mr. Speaker, I have made clear what our position 
is on this issue. The statements to which the member refers are 
partial quotes from newspaper accounts and do not fully represent 
what we think.
<P>
	What I am waiting for the leaders of the government to deal with 
is the problem of prejudice within their own ranks. We have heard 
Liberal member after Liberal member in this House, from the 
Prime Minister on down, proclaim self-righteously how repugnant 
they find prejudice, the prejudging of others, the condemnation of 
whole groups of people because of the words or actions of the few. 
However, we see some of those same members practising in a 
different way exactly the same thing.
<P>
	Why is it that the member for Central Nova can make 
inflammatory statements which, if made by a member of my 
caucus, would be denounced as prejudice and homophobic by the 
very same member who raised this question?
<P>
	The Liberal member for Mississauga South said it best in this 
debate. He said: ``Why is there so much acrimony in this place? 
Why are people in this place, who were my friends and 
colleagues''-he is talking about Liberal friends and 
colleagues-``no longer speaking to me? It is because I have a 
different position. Why have so many people''-and he is talking 
about Liberal friends and colleagues-``demonstrated intolerance 
toward my position?'' He is talking about prejudice, not in the 
Reform caucus but in the Liberal caucus. He is not talking about 
racial prejudice or gender prejudice, he is talking about political 
prejudice, but prejudice nonetheless.
<P>
	Reformers ask the same question. If governments want to stone 
bigots, let the party which is wholly without prejudice cast the first 
stone. If the government is so desperately interested in rooting out 
prejudice of all types, not just the categories defined by political 
correctness, it must begin with the political prejudices in its own 
caucus.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Pat O'Brien (London-Middlesex, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
want to thank the Prime Minister for his decision to hold a free vote 
on this contentious bill. His wisdom and integrity in making this 
correct decision are recognized and appreciated by most 
Canadians.
<P>
	For me Bill C-33 is legislation fraught with uncertainty and 
unacceptable risk. It is hardly a simple, routine and definitive 
amendment to the Canadian Human Rights Act.
<P>
	In good conscience I cannot and will not support this bill. I am 
totally opposed to discrimination against or hatred toward any 
human being and that is why in all good conscience I supported Bill 
C-41. That bill extended to individual gay and lesbian Canadians 
the same protection in law from crimes of hate as that enjoyed by 
all other Canadians.
<P>
	If it was absolutely clear and certain that Bill C-33 was only a 
matter of preventing discrimination I would support it. However, 
for me, as for many other Canadians, various comments from 
judges, other experts and the minister himself, do not bring clarity 
to this debate but rather confusion.
<P>
	The only certainty is uncertainty. Am I certain that Bill C-33 will 
lead to same sex benefits, the legalization of so-called same sex 
marriages and same sex couples adopting wards of the state? No, I 
am not certain, but more to the point, I am not satisfied that this bill 
will not lead to these deleterious changes in our society, changes 
which I as a Canadian and as a member of Parliament can never 
accept or condone.
<P>
	What is very clear is that the Canadian gay and lesbian leaders 
demand that these changes must occur. Well, let them not look to 
me nor to the majority of Canadians for support of such changes.
<P>
<B>(1710 )</B>
<P>
	This is for me a moral issue and a matter of conscience. I respect 
the rights of others who see this issue in a different way. I respect 
their rights. I abhor the fact that respect is not unanimous in this 
House. However, I disagree with the people who take the other 
view.
<P>
	It has been suggested to me that I set aside my own conscience 
and join the majority of members of Parliament in supporting Bill 
C-33. To that I say no, Mr. Speaker, emphatically, no.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2585"> 2585 </A></B>
<P>
	In his famous play, ``A Man For All Seasons'', Robert Bolt has 
Thomas More say words to this effect when faced with a similar 
dilemma: ``I think that when in the performance of his public 
duties, a man ignores his private conscience, he leads his country 
on a short route to chaos''.
<P>
	I reject the invitations to ignore my own conscience. No, I will 
not ignore what I believe in all sincerity to be true. I must and I do 
oppose Bill C-33. In doing so I firmly believe that I support a 
higher good, the traditional heterosexual family.
<P>
	Much has been made of the fact that for many years several 
conventions of the Liberal Party have endorsed an amendment to 
the Canadian Human Rights Act such as that which we debate 
today. Allow me to remind the House of three relevant facts.
<P>
	First, the commitment to amend the Canadian Human Rights Act 
to include sexual orientation was not in the Liberal red book on 
which our party campaigned and on which we were elected in 1993.
<P>
	Second, such a commitment was not in the speech from the 
throne of February 1996 when the government's priorities were 
enunciated for Canadians.
<P>
	Third, the Ontario wing of the Liberal Party of Canada at its 
recent convention in Windsor passed a resolution calling on the 
Government of Canada to promote and protect the traditional 
heterosexual family. In my view and that of many Canadians, 
including Liberals, Bill C-33 is not in the spirit of said resolution.
<P>
	As my constituents know, I made known publicly my intention 
to vote against Bill C-33 early on in this important debate. The 
response from my constituents has been very heavy and 
overwhelmingly in support of my position. In fact, the ratio of 
favourable to unfavourable input from my constituents has been ten 
to one. Any individual or group claiming that Canadians support 
Bill C-33 could not have consulted with the people of London, 
Ontario and the surrounding region.
<P>
	While these people oppose discrimination, as do I, they share my 
serious concerns that this bill could lead to a series of changes in 
our society which they find to be completely negative and 
unacceptable.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Williams (St. Albert, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I noted that 
the member put great emphasis on the fact that he had received a 
great amount of mail in support of his position against the bill. I 
would like to ask him if he feels that type of mail would be 
indicative of all the mail which MPs are receiving from across the 
country and that his colleagues would be receiving at this point in 
time.
<P>
	<B>Mr. O'Brien (London-Middlesex):</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank my 
colleague for his question. The simple answer is yes. I feel that 
very much is the case.
<P>
	In all honesty I have to say that I think the opinions of Canadians 
from coast to coast to coast are simply being either misunderstood 
or misrepresented. I do not believe that if Canadians took a look at 
the possible ramifications of this bill we would get anywhere near 
the level of support that the so-called pollsters are saying is there. I 
simply do not believe that.

	<B>Mr. John Cannis (Scarborough Centre, Lib.)</B> moved:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That, in the opinion of this House, the government should work and consult 
with the provinces to develop legislation which would set guidelines and 
licensing regulations to govern the business of immigration consultants.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	He said: Mr. Speaker, I begin by thanking members on both sides 
of the House who have indicated they would support my motion. I 
greatly appreciate their support. I urge all members of the House to 
consider supporting this well founded initiative.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2588"> 2588 </A></B>
<P>
	Motion No. 29 is the first step in rectifying a problem which 
has existed for well over 20 years not only in Canada but outside 
the country. The problem is the complete lack of regulations 
governing immigration consultancy.
<P>
	I will provide some background to those who may be unfamiliar 
with the immigration consultancy industry. Consultants provide 
assistance to immigrants, sponsor refugees and so on, on a variety 
of immigration matters. The services provided can range from 
simple advice such as how to fill out forms to arranging business 
ventures to meet business immigration requirements, to 
representing individuals before immigration tribunals.
<P>
	Many consultants are former employees of the Department of 
Citizenship and Immigration or translators who worked on the 
Immigration and Refugee Board. There are even some former 
members of Parliament in the industry. A number of these 
consultants hold law degrees from their home country but are not 
licensed to practise in Canada.
<P>
	Not all individuals operating in this industry are without ethics 
or morals. However, there are a number of immigration consultants 
who agree, as do I, that it is time to set up guidelines and licensing 
procedures in this industry.
<P>
	The Organization of Professional Immigration Consultants, 
based in Toronto, represents a number of immigration consultants 
striving to promote an industry which demonstrates a high standard 
of integrity and competence. To this end they have appeared before 
the Standing Committee on Citizenship and Immigration to present 
their case. They stated their members do not represent the problem. 
The problem is with the people acting unscrupulously and illegally. 
These people are the ones who have been injurious to their clients 
and to the reputation of the government and the immigration 
profession at large.
<P>
	I have heard various complaints from constituents and friends 
about immigration consultants. These complaints involve the 
incompetent delivery of services or incomplete non-performance. 
Other complaints involve exuberant fees charged to individuals. 
The worst complaints involve the absolute unrealistic promises 
made by certain consultants. These complaints amount to unethical 
behaviour and constitute outright fraud under the Criminal Code 
and the Immigration Act.
<P>
	All one has to do to see evidence of unethical behaviour on the 
part of certain immigration consultants is read local newspapers. A 
Mississauga woman, posing as a lawyer specializing in 
immigration, defrauded her clients of upwards of $8,600. It was 
later reported she may have victimized up to 65 people who 
responded to her newspaper advertisements. She reportedly took 
down payments to represent individuals but never did any of the 
work as promised.
<P>
	In other cases, a man working as an immigration consultant 
provided numerous clients with falsified letters of employment. 
People seeking to come to Canada receive additional consideration 
if they can prove they have a full time job waiting for them in 
Canada. This immigration consultant falsified documents and 
aided people in making false statements at immigration hearings 
outside the country.
<P>
	This case highlights the increasing problem of unscrupulous 
immigration consultants operating abroad. One of the major 
problems we have today in the immigration industry is these people 
operating abroad and unfortunately causing problems in Canada.
<P>
<B>(1805)</B>
<P>
	When immigration or refugee claimants are counselled to lie and 
to cheat to achieve their goals, the integrity of the whole 
immigration system is being undermined.
<P>
	At a time when public support for immigration process is at an 
all time low, this type of behaviour cannot and should not be 
tolerated. It is time to put in place strict guidelines to govern this 
industry.
<P>
	The ninth report of the Standing Committee on Citizenship and 
Immigration supports the licensing and regulating of this industry, 
as do the law societies of Upper Canada and British Columbia.
<P>
	The Law Society of British Columbia has stated that it is gravely 
concerned about the harm being done to immigration applicants by 
unscrupulous or incompetent consultants. British Columbia's 
attorney general has supported the committee's recommendation: 
``I think it is an idea that is long overdue''.
<P>
	The committee heard testimony that many immigration 
consultants have no test for competency for the practice, no code of 
conduct, no negligence insurance, no disciplinary procedures and 
no compensation funds for defrauded victims.
<P>
	More important, there are no academic or experience 
requirements. Basically anyone can hang out a shingle in this 
industry. The immigration committee heard testimony that an 
immigration lawyer disbarred from the practice one day could 
conceivably set up shop as an immigration consultant the very next 
day. Unbelievable.
<P>
	The number of immigration consultants acting without ethics or 
morals and taking advantage of vulnerable individuals is increasing 
at an alarming rate. I find the action of these consultants especially 
contemptuous. These consultants prey on unsuspecting vulnerable 
individuals who are in genuine need of help. The consultants may 
seem very knowledgeable to the individuals, a so-called Fred if you 
will, who will help them through the door. The promise they make 
sounds too good to be true, and often it is not true.
<P>
	Because of the nature of immigration matters, the stakes can be 
very high. An individual or family could see  this as their only 
hope. They are willing to pay large sums of money, sometimes 
their entire life savings, to achieve this goal. The unscrupulous 
consultants are very willing to take their money. Unfortunately the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2589"> 2589 </A></B>
<P>
majority of these consultants make promises knowing full well 
they cannot deliver.
<P>
	Take the cases reported in Russia. Several consultants were 
charging $5,000 U.S. to assist individuals with their immigration 
matters. They made promises that their applications would be 
successful, knowing very well these individuals had no chance of 
ever being approved.
<P>
	Not only were these consultants misleading honest individuals 
who only wanted to find a better life, they were knowingly 
assisting criminals who saw an opportunity in our country to 
increase their illegal empires. They would arrange their 
applications with all the right answers as well as set them up with 
business ventures in Canada, increasing their likelihood of getting 
a foot in the door.
<P>
	All this action by unethical consultants impacts the ability of the 
Canadian immigration system to operate successfully and properly.
<P>
	The immigration committee put forth many recommendations 
for the industry of immigration consultants. First and foremost 
were the immigration consultants to be licensed and regulated. The 
only thing left to decide is who should be overseeing the licensing 
of this industry.
<P>
	Seeing that the committee concluded it would not be responsible 
or feasible to recommend the federal government set up a body to 
govern these consultants, where does that leave us? Either we 
approach the provinces to act on this or we allow the industry to be 
self-regulated. Unfortunately the provinces have been slow to act 
in this regard to immigration consultants.
<P>
	Ontario has examined this issue in the past but unfortunately has 
declined to act on it. At present the provinces are investigating the 
option of licensing immigration consultants even though many 
believe now is the time to act.
<P>
	I feel with the appropriate pressure and recommendations from 
the federal government and from the industry, the province may 
feel and be inclined to act on this issue immediately.
<P>
	This is what I hope to achieve with this motion, to send a strong 
signal that we must take action today because it is necessary. The 
provinces have achieved jurisdiction over regulating various 
professions and trades to date but have been lax in this specific 
area, unfortunately
<P>
<B>(1810)</B>
<P>
	Failing action by the province, the only option left in this case is 
to have the industry regulate itself. A number of organizations now 
exist in Canada. The Organization  of Professional Immigration 
Consultants is one. It has over 150 volunteer members in Ontario 
and British Columbia. It has also been asking for years for 
guidelines and licensing procedures to be put in place. It sees the 
need, the committee has recognized the need and our constituents 
have recognized the need also.
<P>
	The organization fears the irresponsible actions of these few 
individuals acting improperly have certainly put a damper on the 
industry and its reputation. It would more than welcome 
strengthening rules and regulations being brought to this specific 
industry.
<P>
	The Organization of Professional Immigration Consultants in 
Canada has its own code of ethics and rules and regulations, and 
members must abide by these rules.
<P>
	As stated earlier, this is only a voluntary organization. Members 
join because they want to, not because they are required to. It 
would be irresponsible to think consultants who behave unethically 
would be willing to join this organization.
<P>
	We need to urge the provinces to work with the federal 
government and these organizations to develop guidelines. The 
individuals who are registered with the organization would be able 
to operate within legal boundaries, within specific guidelines.
<P>
	Why not mould the system after provincial law societies or the 
College of Physicians and Surgeons? These are systems in place 
now which work. They have specific rules and guidelines which 
govern their members in accordance with provincial laws. 
Individuals cannot operate in either of these industries without 
being members of the appropriate organization.
<P>
	I was a human resource consultant prior to entering public life. I 
operated a business in Ontario and was required to be licensed by a 
governing body. I had to follow strict guidelines and regulations 
while in operation. In addition, I had to pay an annual fee to make 
sure I operated within the guidelines of the organization and the 
province. My clients had the right to register complaints with the 
appropriate body if they felt they had not been served to the best of 
my ability.
<P>
	Why does this not apply to immigration consultants? I was 
constantly required to update my knowledge with appropriate 
courses available through various government or academic 
institutions. Again, this is not necessary for immigration 
consultants. I do not understand why.
<P>
	Why are there no set fees so that when individuals approach 
these consultants they know up front what the costs will be? I am 
really saying let us make the system transparent.
<P>
	I am only repeating questions which have been continuously 
asked of me by my constituents and friends. I have heard numerous 
tragic stories about individuals  being taken advantage of by these 
consultants, stories of families being torn apart and of thousands of 
dollars lost. Unfortunately by the time these individuals come to 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2590"> 2590 </A></B>
<P>
me it is too late for me to do anything. Sadly I have seen many 
instances in which the advice these individuals were seeking was so 
simple that all they had to do to obtain the information was pick up 
the phone and I am sure officials would have been able to answer 
their questions at no expense.
<P>
	A few suggestions I would make are basically that individuals 
wishing to operate as immigration consultants be require to pay an 
annual fee and register under a governing body. The individual 
should be required to undertake training and/or complete 
appropriate examinations to prove he or she is competent and able 
to carry out the duties of an immigration consultant. Once 
becoming an immigration consultant an individual must answer for 
his or her actions to the governing body. These suggestions seem 
reasonable.
<P>
	I also commend the Standing Committee on Citizenship and 
Immigration for its work on this specific issue. Its 
recommendations were long awaited. All we simply have to do 
now is act on them.
<P>
<B>(1815)</B>
<P>
	I am happy to report that just last week the Minister of 
Citizenship and Immigration released a response to the 
committee's report on immigration consultants. The minister very 
much supported many of the committee's recommendations, in 
particular the one recommending that the federal government work 
with the provinces on this issue.
<P>
	The minister's response stated that the federal government will 
develop a comprehensive strategy to deal with this very serious 
issue. The response suggests that a consultative process be 
undertaken with the province and relevant organizations to explore 
the prospect of a self-regulating immigration consultancy industry.
<P>
	Surely after all of these recommendations the provinces will see 
fit to act and act immediately. If not, we as a federal government 
and as representatives of our constituencies have a responsibility to 
work to bring about some type of regulatory process for this 
industry. Canada's good name and reputation depends on it. The 
integrity of the immigration process also depends on it. We can no 
longer allow this ongoing abuse of our immigration system to 
continue.
<P>
	Yes, our country was built on immigration but with rules and 
policies set for and by this country based on this country's needs 
and commitments, not abused by what some money hungry 
immigration consultants say and do. One of the biggest problems 
we have found is people working abroad as immigration 
consultants who prepare these individuals who want to come to 
Canada. They mislead our officials here and when individuals  
submit their applications it is very difficult for our immigration 
officials not to accept them. We have to address that issue as well.
<P>
	Today I am saying, and I speak on behalf of my constituents in 
Scarborough Centre and most of the people I have spoken with 
agree, that we have to address this issue. Unless we act now the 
situation can and will get worse.
<P>
	I urge all members of the House to support this motion. I believe 
it will help get our immigration system on track where it should be.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Osvaldo Nunez (Bourassa, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased 
to take part in the debate on Motion M-29 presented February 27, 
1996 by the member for Scarborough Centre, which reads as 
follows:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That, in the opinion of this House, the government should work and consult 
with the provinces to develop legislation which would set guidelines and 
licensing regulations to govern the business of immigration consultants.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	I would like to congratulate the hon. member on this initiative, 
which gives us an opportunity to look at a serious problem in the 
field of immigration, the absence of regulations governing the 
business of immigration consultants.
<P>
	I am in agreement with my colleague's general objective. I am 
not, however, in agreement with the wording as it stands, and for 
that reason I will propose an amendment later on.
<P>
	The Standing Committee on Citizenship and Immigration, of 
which I am a vice-chairman, held consultations on this topic and 
tabled a report in this House in December, 1995.
<P>
	Immigration consultants are people who are not members of a 
Bar, but who, for a fee, advise or represent people on immigration 
matters. They are not subject to any criterion of competence in the 
performance of their duties. They have no code of ethics, no 
malpractice insurance, no compensation fund for victims of fraud, 
no complaint mechanism, no disciplinary procedure for unethical 
behaviour or incompetence, and no education or experience 
requirements.
<P>
	It must be pointed out that not all immigration consultants are 
incompetent or unscrupulous. Many of them are reliable, 
trustworthy individuals who serve their clients well. They provide 
valuable assistance to immigrants and refugees. They represent 
people before immigration tribunals, either at inquiries before 
adjudicators or at hearings before the Immigration and Refugee 
Board.
<P>
<B>(1820)</B>
<P>
	I am in favour of this motion's objective. We must recognize that 
there are significant problems related to the practice of immigra-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2591"> 2591 </A></B>
<P>
tion consultants and that some of  them abuse the precarious 
situation in which their clients find themselves.
<P>
	Their immigrant clientele must be protected. A number of 
measures are possible to ensure this. The standing committee, 
moreover, has recommended that these measures be adopted by the 
government. For example: increase the quality and quantity of 
information available to immigrants on the immigration process; 
publicize free services available to immigrants; warn immigrants 
against certain practices; publish a scale of reasonable rates for 
basic services; provide information abroad in the local language; 
advise applicants in their own language that their case will not be 
processed more quickly because they have used the services of a 
consultant; advise immigrants who have used the services of 
consultants known to be unscrupulous to refuse these people access 
to Canadian offices abroad.
<P>
	Until now, the only section in the Immigration Act dealing with 
consultants is section 30, which reads as follows: ``Every person 
with respect to whom an inquiry is to be held shall be informed that 
that person has the right to obtain the services of a barrister, 
solicitor or other counsel and to be represented by counsel at the 
inquiry and shall be given a reasonable opportunity, if that person 
so desires and at his own expense, to obtain counsel''.
<P>
	We wonder whether this section would not make it possible to 
question the validity of a regulation limiting access to counsel of 
one's choice. Under paragraph 114(1)(v) of this legislation, which 
accords the government regulatory power, the majority report of 
the committee proposes giving professional bodies the authority to 
regulate immigration consultants appearing as counsel before 
federal immigration tribunals.
<P>
	I should point out that the establishment of a professional body 
for all of Canada under the legal provisions mentioned is not in 
keeping with provincial jurisdiction over the management of 
professions. This is why we prepared a dissenting report in 1995 
and why today we are submitting an amendment to Motion No. 
M-29.
<P>
	We consider that Quebec has proven itself in the area of 
professional bodies and is capable of determining the relevance of 
establishing an association of immigration consultants. The 
professions are governed in Quebec by the Code des professions 
and by 22 other laws of all sorts. The Quebec professions board has 
for 20 years managed a system that has unanimous approval, that is 
effective, that properly protects the public and that, to its credit, is 
not a financial drain on the government.
<P>
	The members of the Bloc Quebecois put their faith in Quebec 
practices that have proven their mettle. The Government of Quebec 
has already gone some distance to managing the practice of 
immigration consultant. It has established departmental directives 
and service  procedures to guide relations between the government 
and immigration consultants.
<P>
	We recognize, however, that the federal government must first 
inform and sensitize the provinces to ensure that they are aware 
that the present situation may lead to abuse of all sorts of a 
vulnerable clientele. Furthermore, a few unscrupulous consultants 
tarnish the reputation of the many very professional people.
<P>
	Second, once the federal government has itself put in place all 
the measures necessary to better inform immigrants using the 
services of a consultant, it could contemplate with the provinces 
the possibility of their creating professional bodies.
<P>
	The Bloc Quebecois supports the motion in principle. However, 
it considers that the establishment of professional bodies is a 
provincial matter. It is therefore up to them to act if they deem it 
appropriate.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, I move the following amendment:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That the motion be amended by replacing the words ``work and consult with 
the provinces to develop legislation which would set'' with the following:</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>``inform the provinces of the problems related to the services of immigration 
consultants and work with them in their development of''.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>(1825)</B>
<P>
	The final text would read as follows:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That, in the opinion of this House, the government should inform the 
provinces of the problems related to the services of immigration consultants and 
work with them in their development of legislation that would set guidelines 
and licensing regulations to govern the businesses of immigration consultants.</BLOCKQUOTE>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Ms. Val Meredith (Surrey-White Rock-South Langley, 
Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is my pleasure to speak on this motion.
<P>
	I sat on the immigration committee which dealt with 
immigration consultants. It was interesting to hear the testimony 
from various witnesses. We heard from people who used the 
services, who saw the need to have immigration consultants and 
realized the level of commitment that many immigration 
consultants have. We also heard from witnesses who reported 
instances showing that there was abuse, that there were consultants 
who perhaps did not have the necessary skills, that there were 
consultants who were misrepresenting Canadian law and were 
putting people's lives in jeopardy by misrepresenting the situation 
as they found it. We heard of problems which occurred overseas 
and problems which occurred here in Canada.
<P>
	One of the things the committee decided was that there was a 
need for some way to regulate, license and control these 
consultants to make them accountable. The committee also felt the 
department of immigration could do some things. For example, it 
could provide  information in people's own languages. It could 
explain what Canadian law was, what immigration regulations 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2592"> 2592 </A></B>
<P>
were all about, what was required. It could also explain that people 
did not need to hire a consultant.
<P>
	In some countries government officials are not considered to be 
trustworthy and there is a hesitancy by individuals to have 
government representatives deal with their applications. Therefore, 
there is a need for immigration consultants. The committee 
recognized that and recommended that there be some level of 
licensing and some level of control.
<P>
	This motion takes it to the next stage by saying that all 
immigration consultants should be licensed and controlled and that 
there is a need to enter into negotiations with provinces and the 
federal government to come up with some means of regulating and 
licensing these individuals.
<P>
	In my previous life I was a realtor. I know from experience that 
provincial boards can be established through provincial legislation. 
These boards can license and monitor people who provide services 
to the community. These boards can be self-regulating and 
self-financing. The membership fees can cover the costs of these 
organizations. Therefore I do not feel that this motion is being 
unrealistic.
<P>
	Medical doctors through their colleges have that kind of control. 
Lawyers through bar associations have that kind of control. 
Realtors have that kind of control. There is no reason that 
immigration consultants could not have the same kind of 
committee or board structure at the provincial level which would 
allow this kind of management.
<P>
	People have asked: Why do we need to have these controls? Why 
can it not be buyer beware? Why not let the immigrants make the 
decision as to whom they want to hire? It is fine to put the onus on 
the consumer to pick the best choice. There is no question about 
that.
<P>
<B>(1830)</B>
<P>
	However, we need to offer some protection to people who may 
have a language problem or who may have a fear of persons in 
authority. That protection could be offered through a regulatory 
body at a provincial level which would be self-disciplined, 
self-regulated and self-financed. I will explain what this kind of 
board could do.
<P>
	Not only could the board license individuals, but there could be 
some kind of testing of the individual's competence to provide the 
services. It could offer a vehicle for people who complain about the 
services they acquire from consultants. It could be a place an 
individual could go if they felt they were charged too much for a 
service.
<P>
	The board could establish a proper fee or a fee which would be 
reasonable for certain kinds of procedures. The  board could 
provide disciplinary measures for those individuals who overstep 
the guidelines, who overstep the laws of the land and who 
misrepresent the Canadian immigration department. This 
organization could provide the necessary disciplinary action to 
control people who hold themselves out as immigration 
consultants.
<P>
	The board could provide some kind of financial responsibility. It 
could collect fees from people who want to be immigration 
consultants. It could distribute educational material. It could 
distribute changes in legislation to all those who provide the 
service. In other words, it could act as an administrative body to 
ensure that people who are acting in that capacity are all operating 
at the same level, or at least at an acceptable level to the 
organization.
<P>
	The motion is not something which is impossible to reach or 
impossible to establish. I believe there would be a reluctance on the 
part of the provinces to get involved in this kind of thing. 
Unfortunately the licensing of businesses does come under 
provincial jurisdiction. However, if the provinces could understand 
that they would not be required financially to establish these boards 
or regulatory bodies they might be more willing to consider this as 
an option.
<P>
	The committee found that the federal government could only do 
this on its own in a limited way. The federal government is not in a 
position to establish this kind of regulatory body. It can deal only 
with those tribunals over which it has control.
<P>
	I believe the motion is sound and reasonable. I have no problem 
in supporting the hon. member in his effort to deal with this very 
serious problem in Canada.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The amendment proposed by the member 
for Bourassa is in order.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stan Dromisky (Thunder Bay-Atikokan, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it is my pleasure to speak to Motion No. 29, proposed by 
the hon. member for Scarborough Centre. This motion proposes 
that the government work and consult with the provinces to 
develop legislation which would set guidelines and licensing 
regulations to govern the business of immigration consultants.
<P>
<B>(1835)</B>
<P>
	Immigration consultants can play an important role in the 
immigration process. They typically provide advice to those 
immigrants who require specialized advice such as how to invest 
money in Canada, transfer their businesses to their new home, 
sponsor their parents or help bring an orphaned relative to Canada. 
In any of these cases they may want the help of an immigration 
specialist.
<P>
	Many new immigrants turn to consultants because they are 
typically people who have practical experience in the area. They 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2593"> 2593 </A></B>
<P>
may be former civil servants, paralegals or  community activists. 
They may have experience in processing immigration applications 
and advising new immigrants, and sometimes they base their 
qualifications on their own experiences as immigrants.
<P>
	Unfortunately there have been numerous complaints about 
potential criminal practices and unethical behaviour on the part of 
immigration consultants over recent years. Consultants have a 
great impact on the lives of recent immigrants. Immigrants can lose 
money, their businesses and even their resident status because of 
missteps and misstatements of inexperienced or dishonest 
consultants. They can be the victims of unscrupulous individuals 
who make extravagant promises for extravagant fees.
<P>
	These types of problems could in part be alleviated by 
addressing certain deficiencies in the industry. These deficiencies 
include the absence of tests of competency for practice, a code of 
conduct, negligence insurance, a formal complaint mechanism, and 
a disciplinary procedure to deal with incompetent or unscrupulous 
consultants. There are many ways in which the public remains 
unprotected.
<P>
	In spite of the cases of fraud, it would be completely unfair to 
brand all consultants as untrustworthy. Most consultants are ethical 
and provide good services. Nonetheless, because of problems in 
this industry a parliamentary House of Commons subcommittee 
was set up to investigate the issue of immigration consultants.
<P>
	As a member of the Standing Committee on Citizenship and 
Immigration I had the pleasure of being on this subcommittee. This 
subcommittee was established out of concern for the vulnerability 
of immigrants and others. The goals of the subcommittee were to 
examine the problems posed by the complete absence of regulation 
of immigration consultants and to recommend solutions to the 
Government of Canada.
<P>
	A variety of witnesses appeared before the subcommittee, 
including immigration lawyers and their organizations, 
representatives from provincial law societies, representatives from 
non-governmental associations, government and refugee board 
officials and, last but not least, immigration consultants 
themselves.
<P>
	The subcommittee's report clearly recommended licensing was 
an avenue that should be pursued in order to address the problems 
in the immigration consultant industry. However, the report also 
highlighted the need to consult with the closest voices to a potential 
immigrant's ear: church groups, immigrant service organizations 
and refugee advocacy groups.
<P>
	These groups deal with new immigrants on a daily basis and they 
know the nature of the challenges immigrants face. They hold the 
newcomer's best interests at heart, which is why it is important to 
consult with these groups, to listen to their opinions and search for  
new ideas on how to deal with problems facing the immigration 
industry.
<P>
	The problem of completely unregulated immigration consultants 
has existed for over 20 years. Over this time no concrete action has 
been taken at any level of government. Licensing of immigration 
consultants under the current provisions of the Immigration Act 
would certainly help to correct existing problems in this area.
<P>
<B>(1840)</B>
<P>
	I support the intent behind this motion. However, I believe that 
all stakeholders in the system who have not been consulted will 
have the opportunity before we as a government introduce any new 
legislation.
<P>
	Once again, while regulation is an important option to consider, 
consultation is also important. This will allow for other potential 
options to be explored and developed. We cannot close off these 
options. Rest assured the federal government is moving ahead in 
this area.
<P>
	In closing, I would like to congratulate the hon. member for 
Scarborough Centre for his thoughtful motion. He is doing a great 
service to prospective Canadians by bringing this important issue 
to the forefront. I am confident his suggestions will be acted upon 
in due course with dedication and diligence by those concerned.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Finlay (Oxford, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is a pleasure to 
rise and support the motion presented by the member for 
Scarborough Centre which is a votable motion.
<P>
	The main purpose of the motion is to inform the House and 
Canadians that problems exist in the immigration consulting 
industry. Without reading all of them, I think most of us have seen 
the kind of stories which arise regularly in our daily newspapers. It 
is time we did something about them.
<P>
	``Phoney immigration consultants bilk Russians desperate to 
start new life in Canada'', stated in the Ottawa <I>Citizen</I>. The Ottawa 
<I>Sun</I>: ``Negligence, fraud alleged in immigration business''. The 
Law Society of British Columbia: ``Let immigrants choose''. 
``Immigration advisor denies telling client to claim soldiers raped 
her''. ``Immigration specialist admits fraud''.
<P>
	This is a little item from the Toronto <I>Star</I> dated December 6, 
1995 under the heading ``Darts and Laurels''. It gives a laurel 
wreath to the immigration committee for recommending the 
regulation of immigration consultants: ``With no professional 
standards, some consultants end up taking advantage of vulnerable 
refugee applicants and immigrants''. According to the Canadian 
Press news agency, a draft report by the House of Commons 
immigration committee says consultants who charge fees should be 
licensed by a professional body which in turn should  establish 
minimum standards, a code of conduct, continuing education 
<P>

<B><A NAME="2594"> 2594 </A></B>
<P>
programs, a complaints procedure and a compensation fund for 
defrauded victims''.
<P>
	My colleagues who have already spoken to this motion today 
would agree with all those statements. A large number of these 
consultants apparently charge exorbitant fees to assist immigrants 
or potential immigrants to gain access to Canada. Some have no 
training or expertise with the immigration process and tend to 
make claims to new immigrants that they cannot deliver on.
<P>
	Unscrupulous consultants are tarnishing the image of all 
immigration consultants by their actions. They often counsel 
people from outside the country who for one reason or another 
would normally be denied immediately from immigrating. These 
consultants set up stumbling blocks for our own immigration 
officials. They prep their clients on what to say, when to say it and 
how to manipulate the system. This has only added in recent years 
to the increasing lack of confidence by Canadians in our own 
immigration system.
<P>
	It is my feeling that immigration consultants should attain and 
approve a basic level of knowledge and training before they are 
permitted to operate in Canada. Through consultation with the 
provinces, national guidelines could be established to protect new 
Canadians from unscrupulous consultants.
<P>
	I realize, as other members have said, that this is a provincial 
area of responsibility. Provinces deal with the licensing of 
businesses, industries and professional organizations within their 
jurisdiction. Therefore, as the mover of this motion said, we must 
exert some pressure on the provinces in order that they provide the 
kind of security, safety and regulation for our immigrants. 
Apparently there are very few provincial requirements for 
licensing, no bonding prerequisites and no rules and regulations to 
govern these consultants.
<P>
<B>(1845)</B>
<P>
	Many MPs are immigrants themselves. I am one. All of us know 
what it means to be a Canadian. It is really unconscionable that 
some Canadians and others are taking advantage of our potential 
immigrants' desire to move to our country by charging huge fees, 
often misleading them into believing that they will qualify easily 
when there are hurdles to be considered.
<P>
	It does our reputation abroad no good. It does the immigration 
and citizenship department no good with respect to the citizens of 
this country. We have heard quite enough complaints, a good 
number of which may have been generated by just such 
unscrupulous consultants.
<P>
	I hope that the House will support this motion. We would get 
some action with the provinces on this problem. I note that they 
have been slow to act. There has been pressure, but obviously not 
enough.
<P>
	Every province has rules concerning professional organizations 
be they accountants, lawyers, teachers, doctors or paramedics or 
consultants of various kinds. Certainly this is an area that cries out 
for some reasonable legislation.
<P>
	I want to commend the remarks of the member for Bourassa who 
indicated that in the province of Quebec there are some 22 bills that 
govern some of these matters. A professional organization there 
has helped. Since immigration is now a provincial matter, we might 
well take a lesson from our sister province, Quebec.
<P>
	I also want to agree with the member for Surrey-White 
Rock-South Langley who pointed out that immigrants often 
suffer from a language barrier. They may have come from a 
country where authority is a fearful thing. They have concerns 
about their children, their loved ones or the family that they may be 
leaving behind. They need to meet someone who exemplifies the 
qualities for which this country stands, not someone who is out to 
take the shirt off their back and leave them destitute.
<P>
	We need a regulatory body. I agree with my colleague's remarks 
that it must do more than simply licence and collect a fee. It must 
provide some education. It must provide some ongoing 
professional development and training as these bodies normally do.
<P>
	In conclusion, I believe the mover of the motion, and I think all 
others who have spoken in support of it, would accept the 
amendment. I would accept the amendment proposed by the 
member for Bourassa that the motion be amended by replacing the 
words, ``work and consult with the provinces to develop legislation 
that would set'' with:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That, in the opinion of this House, the government should inform the 
provinces of the problems related to the services of immigration consultants and 
work with them in their development of legislation that would set guidelines 
and licensing regulations to govern the businesses of immigration consultants.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> I understand that the member for Oxford 
has basically moved the same amendment as the member for 
Bourassa.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Finlay:</B> I simply indicated my agreement with the 
amendment.

<P>
	<B>Mr. Cannis:</B> Mr. Speaker, first let me say that I agree with the 
amendment. It was part of my motion. I would like to take this 
opportunity to thank you and my colleagues on both sides of the 
House who spoke on the amendment. It is an issue that is very 
important. It has to be addressed now for the various reasons that 
were covered by all the speakers. It is an issue where family 
members wishing to join family members sometimes get abused.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="2595"> 2595 </A></B>
<P>
	I have met immigration consultants who are very ethical people, 
who do an excellent job and provide the right kind of service. 
However, I have heard of many cases where people have been 
abused and tremendous amounts of money have been spent.
<P>
	This is an issue that has to be addressed today. Hopefully with 
the co-operation of the provinces we will be able to develop a 
transparent system, a fair system, a system that serves our country 
the way it should.
