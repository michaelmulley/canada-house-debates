    </p><a name="Para200982"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am sure you will recall, Mr. Speaker, as you were in the chair at the time, that during the vote process the NDP rose to seek consent to have NDP members who were present for the previous vote recorded in support of the Liberal amendment to Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2334521,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2334521&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-24</A>. Unfortunately, the reality is that when the NDP House leader rose for a second time to seek consent, that consent was denied by the House at that time.</div>
    </p><a name="Para200983"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As it was very evident to me, I rose on a point of order and stated that no points of order were to be entertained by the Chair during the vote process and, second, that I wanted to ensure the public viewing the vote process last night did not blame the clerks for the NDP members missing their opportunity to vote. Likewise, I believe that when a party, or an individual member for that matter, seeks to correct the record of a vote after the vote process is completed, it is normal tradition in the House that consent is granted by the members present in the House.</div>
    </p><a name="Para200984"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, I believe that one mistake in the House should not be compounded by a second mistake. Therefore, in the interest of non-partisanship, common courtesy, traditional practice and in fairness to the New Democratic Party, in particular my colleague, the member for <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78825,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78825&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Acadie—Bathurst</A>, I seek the unanimous consent of the House at this time to have the results of the deferred division taken last night on the Liberal amendment to Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2334521,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2334521&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-24</A> corrected to indicate that the NDP did intend to support the Liberal amendment.</div>

It has happened many times to members from all four parties present in the House. From time to time mistakes are made during votes. I have seen the situation where some members during private members' votes because of confusion vote both ways and have it corrected afterward.</div>
    </p><a name="Para200987"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Speaker, I would again ask you to put the motion. I see the official opposition House leader is here. Perhaps he would be willing to consult with his members very quickly and grant permission for them to support this motion to amend the vote results from last night.</div>

    </p><a name="Para200989"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The proposition that he is bringing forward appears, from a substantive point of view, to be a reasonable one in view of the fact that there was either confusion or an error in the course of the taking of the vote on the amendment to Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2334521,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2334521&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-24</A> that was entirely unintentional and inadvertent on the part of the New Democratic Party. I suspect there is a will in the House to see that it is corrected.</div>
    </p><a name="Para200990"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I need to point out, Mr. Speaker, that this is not the first time this has occurred. We saw a similar incident in the spring in relation to a vote on a budget bill; I hasten to add, not on the budget itself, but in relation to the vote on the budget bill. At that time the House, specifically on the part of the government and perhaps the Bloc, but I do not want to characterize its position because I do not know for sure, did not have the will to accommodate the simple correction of what was an obvious inadvertent occurrence that, since that time, I must say, the government has been at some pains to exacerbate.</div>
    </p><a name="Para200991"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The point is that these incidents do, unfortunately, occur. It is obvious to all members of the House that they are inadvertent and there has, at least up until last spring, been the will in the House to immediately recognize the reality of the situation and to cooperate with each other to correct the error and ensure the record accurately reflects what the will of the House would be.</div>
    </p><a name="Para200992"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this instance I think it is obvious what the NDP intended, even though that was not reflected in the detail of what happened last evening. From the opposition's point of view, we are certainly prepared to see that inadvertent situation put right and the accurate reflection of the NDP's position to show through in the proceedings of the House.</div>
    </p><a name="Para200993"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I simply make the point that the same goodwill, the same give and take and the same sense of fair play and accurate reflection should apply in all circumstances.</div>

</div>
    </p><a name="Para201007"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It will come as no surprise to anyone that this recommendation or proposal was not adopted unanimously. It was adopted, however, by a majority of committee members. That is why, having given notice of this proposal, I hasten to put it forward this morning. I do believe that this is a matter of critical importance. So much so that I might suggest a possible connection with the government bill to amend the Criminal Code that was just introduced. This bill introduced by the government this morning could very well be challenged in court some day. It is highly likely that people will need financial assistance to assert their rights then. Initially, that is what the court challenges program was intended for.</div>
    </p><a name="Para201008"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us look at a bit of history. Hon. members might remember that, in the early 1980s, Canada established the Charter of Rights and Freedoms and patriated the Constitution, opening the way to a marvellous societal adventure. The subsequent decades saw the rights proclaimed at that time, rights enshrined in a charter which is the envy of many, be affirmed in our country. That is indeed what happened. </div>
    </p><a name="Para201009"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has often been said that, on paper, the Russian constitution was probably the best in the world. But we have to go further than that and see to what extent people's rights and freedoms are respected on a daily basis. In that respect, Canada is a leader. </div>
    </p><a name="Para201010"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For over two decades now, we have upheld those rights. The Court Challenges Program of Canada has been an important part of asserting our rights and liberties. Our success as a country is due in large part to this program, which has enabled traditionally underprivileged groups and the poor to assert their rights and exercise their citizenship fully. A former Conservative government abolished this program, and the Liberal government reinstated it in 1994. I find it very disturbing that, once again, the Conservative government is targeting the court challenges program and, at the end of September, announced its intention to eliminate it. </div>
    </p><a name="Para201011"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope that a majority of the Canadian people's representatives in this House will choose to maintain this program because it is a social tool of vital importance. Many have said so. To those who indulge in exaggeration, who allege that this program encourages parties to challenge government actions in court, I would say that we must look to the facts. I know that the <i>Calgary Herald</i> published an editorial on July 16, 2006, stating that over 50,000 suits were brought against the government in court. That may be, but not all of these cases went through the Court Challenges Program of Canada.</div>
    </p>
    <p>[<i>English</i>]</p><a name="Para201012"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As we know, charter law is a rather specialized area and most cases against the government would not even involve constitutional issues. The 50,000-plus cases the <i>Calgary Herald</i> editorial was referring to this past July are cases that individuals may bring against the government on whatever grounds, but in terms of charter cases, let us be clear.</div>
    </p><a name="Para201013"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This information can be obtained from the annual report of the court challenges program. Between 1994, when the program was re-established after the Mulroney government cut it, and 2005, the program has funded 375 equality rights court cases and 142 language rights court cases. Of those, 121 of the 375 equality rights cases were to fund interveners, not the original plaintiffs, and 44 of the 142 language rights cases were also to fund interveners.</div>
    </p><A NAME="T1015"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1015"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1020"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1010"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1015">(1015)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para201014"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is the nature of what we are addressing. The cost of the program was slightly over $2 million, which of course we know is, in the grand scheme of things, a sum of money that the government and the country can afford. We will get to that in a few minutes.</div>
    </p><a name="Para201015"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So that people understand the nature of the program, I note that it does not even involve constitutional issues. It involves very specific issues of equality and language rights. It is restricted by contribution agreements between the non-profit organization that was created to manage the program and the Government of Canada. Therefore, it is all spelled out and directed as per the will of the government. </div>
    </p><a name="Para201016"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To say that it is a program that benefits only certain groups and certain people is not accurate. On that front, I would like to give an example. I can give this example because the people involved have given their permission to be quoted. Indeed, some of the cases are now before the court system.</div>

We have just had a very famous case dealt with in this country in that regard and we ought to be very careful about this. This kind of case would indeed probe the legality and the constitutionality of certain sections of that law.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can go on. A number of cases are of great importance to the social fabric of our community. Some involve aboriginal Canadians, for instance the Fort Providence Metis Council, and some involve the Inter-Cultural Association of Greater Victoria. </div>
    </p><a name="Para201031"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a program rooted in our communities. I take great exception to the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78738,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78738&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Prime Minister's</A> response when asked why his government did this to the court challenges program. He said two things, one of which was that he did not like funding “Liberal lawyers”. That is a great mis-characterization and is disingenuous at best, because this program funds our communities, our associations, our non-profit organizations and our individuals, rooted in Canada and their communities, who are fighting to make sure their rights are respected. They choose their lawyers. For the Prime Minister and some of his ministers to respond the way they did is not worthy of the offices they hold. I take great exception to that. </div>
    </p><a name="Para201032"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the second response given by the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78738,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78738&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Prime Minister</A> in his reasoning why the court challenges program was cancelled is frightening. The Prime Minister said something to the effect that his government intends to behave in a constitutional manner. I hope so. All governments and all executives should be expected to behave in a constitutional manner. It goes without saying. For the Prime Minister to think that he has to say his government intends to behave in a constitutional manner is rather outlandish.</div>
    </p><a name="Para201033"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78738,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78738&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Prime Minister</A> said in this House, “We do not intend to adopt unconstitutional legislation”. I have serious problems with that statement. First, not only does the court challenges program address proposed legislation, but it addresses existing legislation as well, legislation that has been on the books since the start of this country, legislation both here in the Parliament of Canada and in the provinces and territories. That is what is involved in the court challenges program. We have seen a number of cases in which we have had to reach back and where, because of laws passed before the advent of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms, some sections of laws were struck down. That is the first difficulty I have with the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78738,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78738&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Prime Minister's</A> response.</div>
    </p><a name="Para201034"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another difficulty I have is that his statement implied that it only applies here for legislation passed by this Parliament and sanctioned by the Queen. That is not so. Some of the rights protected in the Charter of Rights and Freedoms affect provincial legislation as well. Education is a case in point. A number of the linguistic rights cases that have been funded by the court challenges program fall under that category. For the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78738,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78738&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Prime Minister</A> to say we do not need this because the government will only adopt constitutional laws is disingenuous again, because it applies to the entire universe of laws that this Parliament has put in existence plus what is out there in the provinces.</div>
    </p><a name="Para201035"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is another point about the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78738,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78738&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Prime Minister</A> saying that his government does not intend to adopt unconstitutional legislation. Two provinces have said that some of the bills introduced by the government are unconstitutional. There is a slight problem here. The Government of Quebec and I believe the Government of Ontario have said that in terms of legislation dealing with the other place.</div>
    </p><a name="Para201036"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So which is it? Does the government not intend to adopt unconstitutional legislation? That brings me to the fourth and most important difficulty, a scary consequence of what the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78738,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78738&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Prime Minister</A> said. </div>
    </p><a name="Para201037"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are three branches of our government: the executive branch, which is the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78738,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78738&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Prime Minister</A> and his cabinet; the legislative branch, which is us in this House; and there is the judiciary. By the Prime Minister saying that we, the executive, do not intend to adopt unconstitutional legislation, he is actually substituting the executive for both the legislative and the judiciary branches in this country. That is very scary. </div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a legislator I am very concerned that the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78738,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78738&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Prime Minister</A> would have the attitude that he knows best, that his government, his executive, can decide what laws are to be adopted. First of all, that is the prerogative of the legislature. The Prime Minister should know that especially in a minority situation. Then, that the judiciary would not have a say, as a legislator I am concerned. As a citizen I am scared. </div>
    </p><a name="Para201039"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If that is the attitude that is coming from this government, then I understand why it cut, eliminated, and slashed the court challenges program. I think the will of this House should be listened to by this government. Where the country is going now is not very good.</div>
    </p><a name="Para201040"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In effect, we are starting to see here a bit of an advocacy chill. We are seeing a government that is trying to shut down systematically those who would speak in ways that do not please the government. The court challenges program is very much a case in point. It is not the only one. </div>
    </p><a name="Para201041"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have seen what this government has decided in terms of funding for women's groups in this country. The government has actually taken advocacy off from what the groups could do in order to receive money. The groups can no longer advocate. If they do, they are not eligible for subsidies. If that is not an advocacy chill, I do not know what it is.</div>

He has put out a directive that the Wheat Board cannot use its resources to promote itself. If that is not an advocacy chill, what is it?</div>
    </p><a name="Para201043"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canadians are starting to see a pattern here. This government is not even prepared to listen to another point of view. It is still a minority government. I guess that is the reason why polls are indicating that Canadians have no appetite to give this government a majority.

    </p><a name="Para201062"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The present government has benefited from that because in this first year of its administration, which I hope will not be lasting much longer, it has put away $13 billion.

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two and a half million dollars for the court challenges program to be eliminated the way the Conservatives did demonstrates meanspiritedness, and a belief that Canadians should not be able to access public support to have their rights respected.

    </p><a name="Para201069"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The court challenges program is government funding special interest groups to challenge the government on laws that have been prepared. The reason the previous government across the way supported it is because some of the laws it put in place needed a second look by the courts.</div>
    </p><a name="Para201070"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Would the member not agree that if the proper discussion, debate and oversight is done upfront when the laws are presented in the House, when they are debated in the House, debated in committee, and go through the whole process that legislation goes through before it becomes law, that is the time for any changes and improvements to the law so it better reflects what Canadians want? </div>
    </p><a name="Para201071"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Does he not feel that is where the effort and the time should be spent to create the law right in the first place instead of having a court challenges program, funded by government, that does not release how much money is being spent by which groups? It does all that without reporting to the Canadian people. Is that not a more acceptable path to follow than what is presently being done?</div>

    </p><a name="Para201073"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the strict question of whether we should focus on making better laws, of course, the role of this House and of that other place is to make good laws. However, we have three branches of government in this country: the judiciary, the legislative and the executive. The legislative role is, as my colleague says, to make the best laws possible. The judiciary also has a role in interpreting those laws and determining sometimes whether or not we have made mistakes and that has happened. </div>
    </p><a name="Para201074"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is for laws that are before us now. The difficulty with the member's premise is that the court challenges program in effect deals with much more than that. It deals with laws that existed prior to the advent of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms. It deals with provincial legislation, and it deals with provincial and federal inaction. I will give him an example.</div>
    </p><a name="Para201075"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Summerside, P.E.I., the francophone community figured it had a right to a school. The provincial government did not accept that. The francophone community went to court, had some support from the court challenges program, and the Supreme Court of Canada determined indeed that it was right and now it has a school. There were no laws in this case. It was a provincial inaction. The court challenges program has that broad a scope, it does not just deal with current legislation that is before us.</div>
    </p><a name="Para201076"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In terms of current legislation, I tend to agree. Yet, there has to be an authority beyond us that will make a determination and that is why we have three branches in the government. For the rest, it just does not only deal with that. It deals with everything that came before the Charter of Rights and Freedoms and provincial legislation through actions and inactions. The court challenges program is indeed a necessary ingredient which is recognized internationally, by the way, as something that this country should be proud of. We should continue that program.</div>

    </p><a name="Para201083"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a privilege to speak to the House, a House that has long been a symbol of fairness and equality. It is in the House that the laws which protect us have been crafted and the bills that defend each of us have been passed. It is in this chamber that the Charter of Rights and Freedoms emerged and this is where they will stay protected and guarded by the representatives of the people of Canada.</div>
    </p><a name="Para201084"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canadian society has been shaped by the collective values of its citizens who, with thought and conscience, proudly participate in the democratic process by choosing representatives to be their voice, to stand up for the rights and freedoms of all individual citizens and to ensure a society that accords dignity and respect regardless of gender and race. It is our system of Parliament which has served as the foundation of our way of life. It will continue to shape and mould the way we live as we evolve together as a community and a nation.</div>
    </p><a name="Para201085"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canada's system of Parliament stands as a model for countries around the world, striving to achieve equality and justice for our own citizens. We are considered a leader in the promotion and preservation of human rights and freedoms. It is imperative that we ultimately protect this process from those who wish to reject our democratic system, preferring to advance their cause through legal research and court costs paid by Canadian taxpayers.</div>
    </p><a name="Para201086"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government believes in creating legislation that is constitutional and reflects the values of all Canadians. We believe in creating laws that promote diversity and equality. The government believes in the democratic process and that Canadians should be rewarded for practising that right and to experience their hopes and beliefs become reality through laws that are created and passed by those they elect to the House. We believe that public policy should be driven by the will of the people. We believe it will be best expressed through publicly elected officials who sit in debate in the halls of Parliament and commit themselves to standing up for all Canadians.</div>
    </p><a name="Para201087"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Canadian court challenges program is inherently flawed in that it promotes and encourages special interest groups to advance causes that do not reflect the view of the majority of Canadians. It allows special interest groups to use hard-earned Canadian tax dollars to promote a public policy agenda that is not always in line with the majority of Canadian voters. This manipulation of the system is neither transparent nor accountable. The Canadian court challenges program is not required to reveal which groups it chooses to fund or how much money these groups get. In today's political environment this just is not acceptable.</div>
    </p><a name="Para201088"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Government funded protest is an irresponsible use of taxpayer dollars. Government should have the foresight to enact laws that are responsible and fair and that protect and support the interests of minority and disadvantaged groups. Public money should be used in practical ways to directly support the population through social programs that meet the needs of the citizens.</div>
    </p><a name="Para201089"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new Canadian government is committed to ensuring that laws are fair. We are committed to the review and update of those laws, which no longer reflect the values of Canadians. The government is working directly with disadvantaged groups to improve conditions so they may participate fully in society. The government is committed to ensuring that minority groups are guaranteed access to social, economic and cultural rights.</div>
    </p><a name="Para201090"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new Canadian government, through serious action, has proven its advocacy toward the most vulnerable citizens. The ministers of the government work together to identify problems and work in concert to devise solutions for the benefit of minority groups and disadvantaged citizens.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a pattern here, a pattern of a government that says, “Do as I say, not as I do”. It is a meanspirited government. It is a government which is driven by ideology and by political ambition rather than to provide responsible government.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government does not seem to get it. Even on the court challenges program, it seems to think somehow that this is a matter of we have to deal with laws correctly the first time round, that there should be no recourse down the road as circumstances change. Laws always can change, and sometimes people cannot afford to go to the courts to argue their rights under the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. When is this member going to get it?</div>

    </p><a name="Para201114"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of the mountain pine beetle, for example, our government has committed $1 billion over the next 10 years, which is $100 million a year, toward the pine beetle program. In the particular instance that he keys on, of the $11 million so-called cut, that was $11 million that had not been expended, that was from a leftover, defunct, very inadequate Liberal program. We simply took that $11 million off the books and replaced it with $100 million and another $100 million the next year after that and after that, for a total of $1 billion. This kind of responsible way of managing the people's money as though it was something of value is a concept that seems to be lost on most Liberals.</div>
    </p><a name="Para201115"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us take a look at the museums assistance program. When we add the $9.6 million, which was originally in the budget, to the amount in the summer works program for students, which is directed to museums, the total is about $11.7 million. </div>
    </p><a name="Para201116"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As my friend was prone to reciting a particular section, I will recite some figures for him of the actual expenditures from 1995-96 and 1996-97. Against the $9.4 million that had been previously budgeted, actual Liberal expenditures were $8.0 million, $7.9 million, $8.3 million, $7.2 million and $8.5 million. In the year 2000-01, expenditures hit $9.6 million but then in 2001-02, expenditures were $7.7 million, $7.4 million, $8.2 million and $8.1 million. These funds were distributed by the Liberals against a $9.4 million program. Why would they leave a $9.4 million program, plus the $2.4 million for students, intact when in fact only in one year did they actually hit a $9 million expenditure?</div>
    </p><a name="Para201117"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is called accountability and our government is very proud of being accountable to Canadian taxpayers. </div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have been here since 1993 and one of the stupidest things I have heard in my life as a parliamentarian came out of the mouth of the Prime Minister.

    </p><a name="Para201127"></a><p>

    </p><a name="Para201129"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But that is not the substance of the debate. The substance of the debate is that certain rights are denied today. The law is in fact a changing thing. Our view of the law is subject to a certain evolution, for morals change. We no longer define indecency as it was defined in the 19th century. </div>
    </p><a name="Para201130"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Take the death penalty for example. It was partially abolished in Canada in 1977, and definitively in 1982. Ultimately, it can be called cruel and unusual punishment in light of the Canadian Charter. </div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So how can a head of state, in this instance the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78738,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78738&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Prime Minister</A>, say that his government does not intend to table unconstitutional legislation? </div>
    </p><a name="Para201132"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We will be returning to the Conservatives’ record on human rights. However, it is true that when a bill is tabled in this House, it has been evaluated by the Department of Justice.</div>
    </p><a name="Para201133"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nonetheless, that is not what we are talking about. The court challenges program is primarily a means of verifying the scope of rights. Moreover, the fact that a right is not recognized by the Supreme Court in 2006 does not mean it will not be recognized in 2012. I have some examples.</div>
    </p><a name="Para201134"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First, we know that the Conservatives are not fond of homosexuals, not fond of people of the homosexual orientation: they have exercised a policy of institutionalized homophobia. I am not saying that individually they are homophobes.</div>
    </p><A NAME="T1105"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1105"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1110"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1100"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1105">(1105)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para201135"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am not saying that. I will give some examples. </div>
    </p><a name="Para201136"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since 1993, each time they have had the opportunity, the Conservatives, as a group, have voted against the rights of gays and lesbians. That is called institutionalized homophobia. I am not claiming that, as individuals, they are homophobes.</div>
    </p><a name="Para201137"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Imagine if the Bloc Québécois had voted nine times against the rights of aboriginal people. Imagine if the Bloc Québécois had voted nine times against the rights of women. Imagine if the Bloc Québécois had voted nine times against the rights of the cultural communities. Well, on nine occasions all of the Conservatives, with about five exceptions, none of whom unfortunately are current members of this House, voted that way. Those are the facts.</div>
    </p><a name="Para201138"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There was the first bill I tabled, on recognition of common-law spouses, which was supported by Mr. Lucien Bouchard and almost all of my caucus. This was in 1995. I remember that the vote on my bill was held on a Monday morning, and Alfonso Gagliano was the Liberal government whip. That was the only time in my life I voted on a Monday morning, and it was concerning my bill. Now, Sheila Copps was the only Liberal cabinet minister present at the time in this House. She represented the generous, humanist left wing of the Liberal Party. That Monday morning in 1995, however, other hon. members, 55 in all, supported that sole member of the Liberal cabinet present in the House.</div>
    </p><a name="Para201139"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So the Conservatives have voted against the rights of gay men and lesbians nine times. That is not insignificant.</div>
    </p><a name="Para201140"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In 1995, when the motion I had introduced regarding same-sex common-law partners was voted on, Allan Rock amended the Criminal Code to add sexual orientation as a prohibited ground of discrimination in section 718.2.</div>
    </p><a name="Para201141"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This was referred to as a provision relating to violent crimes motivated by hate. In imposing a sentence, the judge may look to a number of provisions under which he may find that there is an aggravating circumstance.</div>
    </p><a name="Para201142"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the second vote on Allan Rock’s bill, all of the Conservatives voted against it.</div>
    </p><a name="Para201143"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The same was true when former minister Anne McLellan introduced a bill dealing with recognition of same-sex common-law partners. Obviously she introduced a bill because she was well aware that the federal government had little hope of winning the foreseeable court challenges. </div>
    </p><a name="Para201144"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Conservatives introduced a motion saying that homosexual unions were not real families.</div>
    </p><a name="Para201145"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They voted against Svend Robinson’s hate crimes bill.</div>
    </p><a name="Para201146"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In committee, they voted against an amendment I proposed relating to access to new reproductive technologies by lesbians.</div>
    </p><a name="Para201147"></a><p>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In 1995, a couple who had lived together for 40 years challenged the provisions of the law relating to the old age pension income supplement that is paid to people who have not reached the age of 60 or 65 years. They had been living together for 40 years, but one of them was not eligible because same-sex common-law couples were not recognized. At that point, the Supreme Court said that sexual orientation had to be added to section 15 of the Canadian Charter as a prohibited ground of discrimination.</div>
    </p><a name="Para201150"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is an example of a case which allows the Supreme Court, whose responsibility it is to bring about progress in the law, to take an updated look at our important legislation and the management of public funds used to assist minority groups in challenging laws. </div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I will say it again, when the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78738,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78738&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Prime Minister</A> rose in this House to say that his government did not intend to introduce unconstitutional legislation, that was one of the stupidest things I have heard in this House. Of course the government does not introduce unconstitutional legislation. It is the courts that bring about progress in the law, in some circumstances.</div>
    </p><a name="Para201152"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have cited the example of minority groups in terms of sex, but could we not say the same thing about minority groups in terms of language?</div>
    </p><a name="Para201153"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once again, what is it about the court challenges program that the government is afraid of?</div>
    </p><a name="Para201154"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is not the first time that this problem has arisen. Remember that this program was established in the 1970s. It is worth recalling that under Brian Mulroney, who was in fact more progressive than conservative, in their next to last year in power, the Conservatives wanted to abolish the court challenges program. In fact, they did not want to abolish it, they abolished it. It was only when the Liberals returned to power, in 1993, that the program was reinstated.</div>
    </p><a name="Para201155"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Obviously, there was great indignation over the elimination of the program. All the human rights activists made their opposition known. This is typical of the current government. It has no sympathy for the most vulnerable people. It is not sensitive to minorities. A government really needs to be low to slash literacy programs. It really needs to be low to attack the status of women. </div>
    </p><a name="Para201156"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would agree if a government were to say that a part of its responsibilities is to periodically evaluate how effective programs are in light of their objectives. We are not against program reviews and evaluations. But this government cut the court challenges program because it thinks that minorities do not need government assistance.</div>
    </p><a name="Para201157"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Do they know how much it can cost to go to court? This is not a gratuitous criticism of lawyers; everyone has a right to earn a living. When a good lawyer wants to challenge some legislation and it goes all the way to the Supreme Court, he has to write statements of argument and must be very well prepared in order to back up his challenge. The legal fees for all this can reach hundreds of thousands of dollars. </div>
    </p><a name="Para201158"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me say parenthetically that two of my fellow citizens, Michael Hendrix and René Leboeuf, were the first to challenge the lack of equality when they were refused a civil marriage. They relied on the court challenges program because section 15 of the 1982 Canadian charter provides for equal treatment. What equal treatment means is not specified in the act. It is the courts that have defined what equal treatment is. </div>
    </p><a name="Para201159"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Does anyone think that we would have made the great legal strides in minority rights without the court challenges? </div>
    </p><a name="Para201160"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is terrible to see what is happening now. It is terrible to see this lack of sensitivity on the government’s part. </div>
    </p><a name="Para201161"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Maybe we need to look into whether the court challenges program is well managed. Maybe it should not be administered by a non-profit agency. We are open to this kind of discussion. But that is not what the government wants to hear. The government says that this program is not needed because it will not introduce any unconstitutional legislation. </div>
    </p><a name="Para201162"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This government is extremely dangerous insofar as human rights are concerned. The Conservatives’ agenda is of deep concern to anyone who is a member of a minority, to anyone who believes deeply in equality, and to anyone who believes that minorities deserve to be helped to defend their rights. </div>
    </p><A NAME="T1115"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1115"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1120"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1110"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1115">(1115)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para201163"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I cannot name one person in their cabinet or even their caucus who is an advocate for minority rights. I believe that two Conservative members may be somewhat more sensitive to the issue. I cannot name them, but the parliamentary secretary to the senator who has not yet been elected has some sensitivity.</div>
    </p><a name="Para201164"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Parliamentary Secretary to the President of the Treasury Board is moving ahead, but has not yet fully matured in similar files. He is giving me a sign, and we will see how he votes when his government introduces a motion to revisit the issue of civil marriage for same sex couples. The member is nodding his head and gesturing. I would like to assume that he is concerned about minority groups, but I am curious to know how he will vote when the time comes. If memory serves, he is not among the short list of Conservative members who supported the bill introduced by the former Liberal justice minister concerning marriage rights. </div>
    </p><a name="Para201165"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a rather sad state of affairs when we begin bargaining with minority rights and when we hear that $1.1 billion has been cut, even though there is a budget surplus of $15 billion. </div>
    </p><a name="Para201166"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I saw the President of the Treasury Board on television, quite happy to be on camera to sign a $15 billion cheque. Meanwhile, our constituency offices had received the list of programs that were cut. Surprisingly, the programs cut were the programs that helped those less fortunate through literacy, housing and status of women.</div>
    </p><a name="Para201167"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Proof that this government in not interested in hearing public debate on human rights is that, in addition to cutting the court challenges program, it also abolished—yes, abolished—the Law Commission of Canada. True, the commission was known to question governments and to recognize, in its opinions, that the current state of rights may not be generous enough towards a certain minority group in our society. Nevertheless, a government that is proud of its minorities is one that gives them the tools they need to assert their rights.</div>
    </p><a name="Para201168"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will close by stating that it is possible to support the court challenges program without necessarily supporting institutional bilingualism in Quebec. I hope that the member for <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78455,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78455&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Ottawa—Vanier</A> will agree, although I doubt it. We all have an interest in helping the francophone community outside Quebec, for example, to become as dynamic as possible. In a minority language situation, one has to constantly fight for access to institutions. The governments did not just wake up one morning and decide to ask what they could do to improve the situation of minorities. It was the court challenges program that made it possible for linguistic minorities to gain access to educational institutions and to manage their own school boards. Just remember the fight that was waged on behalf of the Montfort, a French-language hospital. </div>
    </p><a name="Para201169"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally I would like to say that this government will pay dearly for its insensitivity towards minorities, no matter which ones. The Bloc Québécois, and the other opposition parties, will never condone this lack of sensitivity towards minorities. On behalf of my Bloc Québécois colleagues and all the members of this house, I say shame on this government. One day its representatives will have to explain their gross neglect of minorities. We will never be a party to abolishing the court challenges program, a valuable program that defends human rights. And if this government has any sense of responsibility and honour, it will restore the budget of the court challenges program, which strongly supports human rights.</div>

The fact that we will become sovereign through a democratic process must not be interpreted in any way as an indication that we intend to abandon francophones outside Quebec. That is not the intention of the sovereignist movement, nor of the National Assembly, and I urge my colleague to validate and to verify the documents that we have presented on these issues since 1995. That was done by Mr. Bouchard through our heritage critic at the time, Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay.</div>

Imagine. The Prime Minister was accompanied by a delegation of people from across Canada, including a number of Acadians from New Brunswick and Newfoundland and Labrador. Members should have seen how this announcement was received by francophone minorities outside Quebec. What nerve.</div>
    </p><a name="Para201189"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rights are being taken away from the francophone minority in the rest of Canada. In Romania, the Prime Minister bragged in a speech about the importance of the French fact around the world, while he himself was taking rights away from an important community in Canada and Quebec.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have a question for my hon. colleague. He said that it was shameful for a government to have acted that way toward minorities, and I know that he is good at defending Canada's minorities such as francophone communities. I hope that, in the next election campaign, the Bloc Québécois will decry this government's lack of courage, because this government is afraid to give rights that would allow people to challenge it. So much for democracy. </div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government has addressed the residential school issue. This was a tragedy inflicted on this country.

Although I say I am pleased to rise in this House, I think this is a sad day. The Conservative Party, the government, has decided to cut the court challenges program. By doing so, the minister has said, here in this House, that it was not right to give money to groups so that they can challenge a government that has created the laws. It is not right. If not, then the Supreme Court of Canada should be abolished. If it is not right, the provincial courts should be abolished.</div>
    </p><a name="Para201200"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. member:</b> They will do it.</div>
    </p><a name="Para201201"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Yvon Godin:</b> If it is not right, then we should live with a dictatorial government. Let us not forget that the ministers and members of this government cannot even talk to the press. Is that the kind of Canada we want?</div>
    </p><a name="Para201202"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I can give examples of the contribution that the court challenges program has made to minorities, and the support they have drawn from it. In New Brunswick, an attempt was made to move the food inspectors from Shippagan to Moncton, in the Dieppe and Shediac regions, and the Association francophone des municipalités du Nouveau-Brunswick, thanks to money from the court challenges program of Canada, brought a court challenge and won its case. This decision was then brought before the Supreme Court by the Liberal government of the time, which contested the decision of the Federal Court of New Brunswick. At least the municipalities had some tools at the time to defend the minority communities.</div>
    </p><a name="Para201203"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Did they think that one person, an individual on his own, the Shippagan food inspector on his own, Mr. Gauvin and his colleagues, would have had the money to appeal to the Supreme Court? No.</div>
    </p><a name="Para201204"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That is what the Conservative government wants. It wants to lay down laws, it does not want citizens to defend themselves; it is depriving citizens of the right to bring a court action against the government. It is setting itself up as a saint, it believes it is perfect, it thinks it is establishing good laws which citizens must respect. </div>
    </p><a name="Para201205"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If that were the case, the government should not have to be afraid of investing in court challenges, for it would win in court. However it is shameful to remove the democratic tool that allows citizens to defend themselves in Federal Court, in the Supreme Court of Canada and in the provincial courts. The Conservatives should be ashamed. I do not know how they can sleep at night.</div>
    </p><a name="Para201206"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let us consider the RCMP in New Brunswick, which was not providing service in both languages. Once again, New Brunswick organizations, through the SANB, received money from the court challenges program to go to court, and they won. At the time, the Liberals in power decided to contest this decision up to the Supreme Court. At least the organizations had the money to keep defending themselves.</div>
    </p><a name="Para201207"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If citizens and organizations cannot receive money through the court challenges program, to be fair the government should not have the right to take taxpayers’ money to fight citizens in court. That would be a bit more fair. Yet the government takes in money through taxes—whether citizens like it or not, taxes are deducted from their pay—and uses it to fight an individual in court. At the same time, it says it will not give the community the chance to benefit from this money in order to reach a happy medium, a balance of power. It is undemocratic to deprive citizens of such a tool.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The government machine is too big for the individual. That is what the Conservatives want, an American system where the individual feels all alone in life and has to manage all alone without any help.</div>
    </p><a name="Para201209"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In my opinion, the same is true of the status of women. The reason that women have made it to where they are today is because funding has been granted to create groups so that women are able to show what they can do and are recognized even here in Parliament.</div>
    </p><a name="Para201210"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Equality between men and women must also be recognized. Equality was not achieved as a result of the wishes of a single person who stood up one fine day and said that he or she wanted equality between the sexes so that women would be respected and government would support this. There were battles fought and there are organizations that worked hard to achieve that objective.</div>
    </p><a name="Para201211"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for literacy, we are told that we do not want to spend money on older people, we want to fund young people instead. So we are being told that when we get to be 40 years old we are no longer citizens, we are no longer human beings? What kind of attitude is that, Mr. Speaker? The attitude that the Conservatives are taking today toward these people and these organizations is disgraceful. They are going to realize that there are people working in these organizations and that those people talk to one another. At this moment, those people are protesting and a big wave will be hitting Ottawa, telling them that they are not right and they do not deserve to be leading this country. They have taken things away from us that are fundamental to our country.</div>
    </p><a name="Para201212"></a><p>

I hope that she will talk to him this evening and tell him that what he has done and what the Conservative government has done is not right. </div>
    </p><a name="Para201213"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We know people who worked at the same company until they were 40 or 50 years old and who always worked at the same job. With all the cuts going on in industry today, we have to help the workers and equip them with the skills they need so that they can find new jobs. And yet the Conservatives are telling us that there will be budget cuts for the organizations that do this, cutting the fat, they say.</div>
    </p><a name="Para201214"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So someone will have to go to the library in Bathurst by himself or herself to pick up a book. That person will go home and study independently, with no help from anyone, no teacher, no local organization. The same will be true in Timmins, Ontario, or in Regina, Saskatchewan, or in Edmonton, Alberta. People in Alberta love it when people from our hometowns work on their oil wells. What these cuts mean is that we will not give the people in our hometowns a hand so that they can learn to read and write. These are people who started working when they were very young and never had a chance to go to school. Are we going to let all these people fall by the wayside?</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You know, Mr. Speaker, I did not come to the House of Commons yesterday. How many times have we heard it said in committee that we have to do something for minorities? And then came the question of how much it is going to cost us.</div>
    </p><a name="Para201216"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Standing Committee on Official Languages has never travelled across the country to visit minority communities. Who has objected to that? Always the Conservatives. Do not tell me that it is not true, because it is true.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last year, I was forced to make a proposal to the effect that if the Standing Committee on Official Languages did not travel, none of the committees would travel. If we can send 12 people across the country to see where seals live, we can send the Standing Committee on Official Languages to anglophone and francophone communities to find out what people need.</div>

    </p><a name="Para201220"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Someone has said that no one was asking all the anglophones to learn French and all the francophones to learn English. People were asking the government to offer service in both official languages. It is not hard.</div>
    </p><a name="Para201221"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was sad when Senator Jean-Robert Gauthier had to introduce Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',1426991,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=1426991&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">S-3</A> three times. The bill amended section 41 of part VII to make the obligations therein enforceable rather than declaratory. It applied to federal institutions, and the Bloc Québécois voted against the bill on the grounds that the government had no right to interfere in Quebec's areas of jurisdiction. However, at issue were areas of federal jurisdiction.</div>
    </p><a name="Para201222"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am sorry, but we cannot rely on Quebec alone to defend francophones outside Quebec. Quebec showed in that instance that it had not defended them. This is a federal law that applies to federal institutions.</div>
    </p><a name="Para201223"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In committee I said to the Conservatives that I would have liked them to vote against Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',1426991,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=1426991&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">S-3</A> and then come and say to us that they support francophones. But even though I told them to vote against the bill they voted in favour. Now they think that, since they voted in favour of this bill, they can take away our right to appear in the various courts. That is what they did. They took our tools away from us.</div>
    </p><a name="Para201224"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Take the example of the Montfort Hospital, here in Ottawa. It was not just because someone was sick and bedridden at the hospital that they won that case. It was because organizations got together to fight for it. They used money from the court challenges program. That is when the case was won, thanks to the support and desire to help.</div>
    </p><a name="Para201225"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The government is a big machine and can become a dictatorship. It has the army on its side, the police on its side, it has everyone on its side in order to enforce the law. But in our democracy citizens get a chance to attend court. They are entitled to go to court and obtain judgment. Is the government right or not?</div>
    </p><a name="Para201226"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I will give some other examples. Take the example of electoral boundaries. In my riding this has caused some problems. They wanted to send some of the francophones from <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78825,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78825&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Acadie—Bathurst</A> to Miramichi, where 70% of the constituents are anglophone. Thanks to a court decision, that did not happen. In the history of Canada, that was the first time a boundary was changed by the court. The association of municipalities managed to do that with money from the court challenges program. Without that money, which boat would we have missed, what direction would we have taken?</div>
    </p><a name="Para201227"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Here is another example. This morning at the Standing Committee on Official Languages we tried to pass a motion recommending that the government give back the money to the court challenges program. The only party that voted against this was the Conservative Party.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We have a beautiful country. But we must not deceive ourselves—it is not just about francophones and anglophones; it is about power. That is the problem. It is dangerous to give too much power to a government. It is dangerous not to challenge its decisions, its interpretations or the directions it takes.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To say that Liberal lawyers make a lot of money from that is wrong, completely wrong. How much work has Michel Doucet, a professor at the University of Moncton, done for us? How much responsibility has he taken on to defend francophones and minorities, without charging them anything?</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Today the Conservatives want to do away with that but we are not going to sit here in our seats without speaking out. We are going to fight for this. We will not accept that here in our country we cannot defend ourselves after laws have been passed, laws that are badly interpreted and not respected. </div>
    </p><a name="Para201233"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They are not compelled to misinterpret legislation. If they do not respect it, if they do not do anything, the law and the courts give us the tools to force the government to do something. The fact of having services is just as significant for anglophone minorities in those places where francophones form a majority. It is not asking too much to be able to speak with your doctor in the language of your choice when you are sick. If you are having your appendix removed, it is to be hoped that the doctors will not remove your spleen. We must have access to these services. This morning at the Standing Committee on Official Languages we talked about the importance of ensuring that patients can receive services in the language of their choice in our hospitals. It is not too much to ask. </div>
    </p><a name="Para201234"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As I have said, we are not asking that all anglophones become francophones, nor that all francophones should become anglophones. We are asking that services be provided, that the Official Languages Act of our country be respected, and if it is not respected, we want the tools to go before the courts, before judges appointed by the government. We want to ask for the opinion of the court. That is democracy. What would it be without access to the courts?</div>
    </p><a name="Para201235"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We are sending out soldiers to fight in Afghanistan to promote democracy, and in our own country we are abolishing it. It is a disgrace. In our own country we are cutting funding for the status of women but we are going into Afghanistan because we want Afghan women to have rights. We cut funding in Canada. Is that not hypocrisy?</div>

We went to Romania for the summit of la Francophonie. How could the Prime Minister stand up and say that he supports the Francophonie? At the same time he was cutting all the existing powers that enable minority communities in Canada to live the Francophonie. </div>
    </p><a name="Para201237"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wife of the Prime Minister of Canada took part in a walk in support of people with literacy problems. Two days later, her husband cut off funding for literacy. Where does that leave us? </div>
    </p><a name="Para201238"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The communities are hurting. We are getting phone calls about that. We are meeting people back home. Anyone who has not contacted Conservative MPs yet should know that there are toll-free numbers they can use. They can phone them; those numbers are at their disposal. If people are happy with all that is happening and want an American-style system, let them rejoice because it is on the way, well on the way. Once it is done, they will wonder why.</div>
    </p><a name="Para201239"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know that the Conservatives will insist that they are not like that, that they invested money everywhere. The fact is that they are individualistic.Take what they did with child care. To keep the public quiet, they announced they would be providing a $1,200 benefit. But there is still no child care system. The American style is making its way into Canada. Whatever people say, this is a Bush-league style of work. </div>
    </p><a name="Para201240"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If Canada were problem-free, there would be no need for the Francophonie and official languages department and its minister. Besides, that portfolio was not even given to a person who speaks both official languages. That is adding insult to injury. When the time came to appoint a parliamentary secretary, it took the government three months to appoint one. This shows how important official languages are to this government.</div>
    </p><a name="Para201241"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nevertheless, this is our country, and we have to show one another respect; anglophones and francophones have to show each other respect. We are all human beings. We are just passing through on earth and we should be able to get along. There are countries where people speak five or six languages and they respect one another much more than we do here, in this country. In some countries, the battles are apparently about religion or race; here, they are about language.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is the question of the RCMP. We should look at that. New Brunswick is the only province in Canada that is officially bilingual. The RCMP is a federal agency and provides services in New Brunswick. The federal government denies that it is responsible for bilingualism in New Brunswick. In its view, New Brunswick should see to it. I want the courts to pass judgment in this regard. I hope that this decision is favourable to minorities and states that the federal government is responsible for all its institutions, even when it is loaning out their services.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Take the case of Montfort hospital. Would companies like Bombardier, Chrysler or the Irving family in Bathurst have helped it to survive? No. The answer is no.

When the province of Manitoba was created, francophones and anglophones were essentially equal in numbers, although francophones were the majority at one time. That did not last very long. Anglophones soon surpassed them in numbers and eventually suppressed the rights of the minority for 80 years.

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It makes no sense that the people whose rights have been violated are forced to go to court to fight for their convictions in the hope of changing the interpretation of the law to help an entire community.

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to conclude my response to this question by asking the government to really think about what it has done. The Conservative government includes members from Quebec—francophones. They have a responsibility. Some of them said they knew all about the Conservatives, but decided to join the party so they could moderate things and ensure their fellow party members understand francophones. It is time they started talking to them, because things are going very badly. Things are going badly because they are already cutting programs for minorities. Those francophone members have a responsibility—maybe they think this situation will pass and that everything will work out in three years. This is how it is working, and I suggest the francophone members from Quebec wake up right now because they are not doing their job. I am sorry, but they are not helping us, not at all.

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Speaker, I have two other pages of groups that have voiced their support of maintaining the court challenges program and its funding in all its integrity. These are what the member for <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78914,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78914&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Kootenay—Columbia</A> calls special interest groups that promote issues not supported by Canadians.</div>
    </p><a name="Para201293"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us look at that as well. Let us look at the issue of whether or not the cases which are funded in part by the Canadian court challenges program touch on issues which are of interest to the majority of Canadians. </div>
    </p><a name="Para201294"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let us look at the case of R. v. Prosper in 1994. In this case, the Supreme Court of Canada considered whether an impoverished accused upon arrest had a right to state funded counsel. An intervener in the case argued that depriving poor people of access to counsel would result in inequality in access to justice that would be inconsistent with section 15 of the charter. The court held that where an arrested person requests counsel, the police must desist from attempting to obtain a statement until counsel has been provided. Justice McLachlin, who is now the chief justice of the Supreme Court of Canada, in a concurring judgment noted:</div>

The chief justice of the Supreme Court has said they are not constitutional castaways.</div>
    </p><a name="Para201297"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to go to another case. This will be a case of great interest for those who know that there still exists bias within our society. Most Canadians abhor bias, bias in our legislation and bias in decisions by government officials who have, in many cases, a great deal of discretionary authority and power under various legislation. </div>
    </p><a name="Para201298"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; R v. S, 1997 is an important case about judicial bias. At issue were remarks made by a black Nova Scotia judge in considering the credibility of both a police officer and R.D.S., an African-Canadian youth. The police had charged the youth with a number of criminal offences relating to an altercation between the police officer and the boy. The youth and the police officer each gave a very different account of the events leading up to the charges. </div>
    </p><a name="Para201299"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Judge Sparks weighed the evidence of the two witnesses. She then determined that the youth should be acquitted as the evidence raised “a reasonable doubt as to the youth's guilt”. In her oral reasons, Judge Sparks observed that in some situations, “Police officers do overreact, particularly when they are dealing with non-white groups”. The Crown challenged her remarks as raising a reasonable apprehension of bias. In the view of the Crown, a reasonable person would think she had prejudged the case without giving proper consideration to all of the evidence.</div>
    </p><A NAME="T1215"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1215"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1220"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1210"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1215">(1215)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para201300"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a court challenge on that. The Supreme Court of Canada decided that Judge Sparks had not acted in a biased manner. Moreover, Justices L'Heureux-Dubé and McLachlin, and I remind members of the House and the new minority Conservative government that Beverley McLachlin is now the chief justice, determined that by paying attention to the racial dynamic in the case, Judge Sparks was simply engaging in the process of contextualized judging. As they stated, “It is perfectly acceptable for judges to take into account not only the facts of the case but also the social and psychological context within which the case arises”. They recognize that judges are members of communities, have particular knowledge of such communities and are often guided by this knowledge. Consequently, as a person familiar with the racial dynamic of Halifax, particularly where police are concerned, it was reasonable for Judge Sparks to apply this knowledge. </div>

The government states that there will be no need for the court challenges program because any law passed by the current government, and one has to presume also laws that will be passed to correct mistakes made by the previous government, will all be perfect and there is no need for a court challenges program.</div>
    </p><a name="Para201304"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second statement of fact that is generally accepted now is that more than half of the court challenges that have occurred up to this point against governments have been against provincial governments and not the federal government. </div>
    </p><a name="Para201305"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Based on those statements I ask my colleague if she has any information that explains how the government became perfect. I do not know if there is some divine inspiration or pronouncement from on high that the government is perfect, but I would like her to share that in light of all the groups that she listed that have indicated that they do not see the government as perfect and want the court challenges program to continue.</div>
    </p><a name="Para201306"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even if the federal government is perfect, does the member have any idea of what methodology the government is going to deploy to make sure that provincial governments are also perfect when they pass legislation that affects individual citizens and groups?</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, if I simply take that premise and apply good faith to it, governments can adopt legislation that does adhere to our constitution and to our Charter of Rights and Freedom but we all know that the legislation must be interpreted and applied. At times a legislation that is perfectly constitutional and in fact charter proof, is not applied properly. There is a bias on the part possibly of the agent charged with applying it. An example of that is Baker v. Canada, Minister of Citizenship and Immigration, 1999 2 SCR 817, which reads:</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Supreme Court stated that it was deciding the case in light of the duty of fairness and the principles of natural justice which govern public officials in their everyday dealings with the public. In reviewing the fairness of the decision making process, the court found that the immigration official showed an impermissible bias against single mothers and women with a psychiatric history.

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our government, Canada's new government, has introduced tough new measures. We are bringing in mandatory jail time. We are putting an end to house arrest for serious offenders. We are banning street racing. We are raising the age of sexual consent to 16 from 14.</div>
    </p><a name="Para201316"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Liberals stand opposed to all those measures. The Liberals are soft on crime. They oppose tough measures to crack down on violent offenders. They support house arrest for violent sexual offenders and they oppose raising the age of sexual consent to 16. They oppose all of those things and they are busy blocking those tough on crime measures in the justice committee.</div>
    </p><a name="Para201317"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why is it that the Liberal member did not stand and defend her soft on crime position? Is it because she does not want Canadians to know how soft on crime her party really is? Is it because she does not want her electors to know that our government is moving forward to keep our streets safe through tough measures to clean up crime?</div>

It is important for the laws of this land to be constitutional and that governments treat Canadians with the rights they have guaranteed under our Constitution and in our Charter of Rights and Freedoms.</div>
    </p><a name="Para201327"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sometimes, whether it is intentional or not, those rights are trampled on and Canadians, whether they are wealthy or average, need a vehicle available to them to go before a court, obtain an explanation of the rights they are allowed, if there has been an infringement, and have an announcement by the court at the end of hearing facts.</div>
    </p><a name="Para201328"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We do not have infallible governments. I do not care that this is characterized in a partisan way. It is not a partisan issue. I do not think any government is ever infallible on every aspect in which it engages.</div>
    </p><a name="Para201329"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I go to the guide section of the court challenges program. Right off the bat it states:</div>
    </p><a name="Para201330"></a><p>
      <div>
        <table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
          <tr valign="top">

</div>
    </p><a name="Para201331"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I think that is understood. Individuals or groups can find themselves in situations where governments refuse to respect their constitutional rights and in those situations people may have to take their governments to court. Courts have the power to force the government to bring its laws, its practices and its policies into accord with our charter, but we know that court action is expensive. It is often far more costly for those very individuals or groups whose rights are not being respected or they themselves belong to marginalized groups.</div>
    </p><a name="Para201332"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The role of the court challenges program is to provide the financial support to people who want to use the courts to have those rights respected but lack the funds to do so on their own and, more specifically, it provides financial support to test cases that help to protect and advance the language and equality rights guaranteed under the Canadian Constitution. Aside from funding these cases, the program also funds activities that increase the awareness of the constitutional equality and language rights which fall under the program's mandate.</div>
    </p><a name="Para201333"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are applications. Not just anybody gets it. There is a process of screening. There are funding criteria for the program. Federal laws, policies or practices could be challenged. It has to ensure that it is a test case and not already one that has been decided.</div>
    </p><a name="Para201334"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some examples of equality cases that have been funded were, first, the first nations people when they opposed a section of the Indian Act that prohibited them from voting in band council elections if they lived off reserve; second, same sex couples seeking the same rights to certain benefits and deductions under the Income Tax Act that are accorded opposite sex couples; third, parents of children with disabilities who sought employment insurance for periods when they must be off work to provide care for their children; and fourth, the legality of the current laws that restrict the courts from admitting evidence of prior sexual activity on the part of sexual assault complainants.</div>
    </p><a name="Para201335"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What can the program not fund? It does not fund any case that covers an issue already funded by the program or that is already before the courts. It does not cover challenges to actions taken by provincial governments, complaints under the Canadian Human Rights Act, challenges to provincial laws, policies or practices and public education, community development lobbying or political advocacy. </div>
    </p><a name="Para201336"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We should be very concerned when a government thinks it is appropriate to cut funding. The words I have heard are, “We just don't want to pay people to sue us,” or comments of that nature. </div>
    </p><A NAME="T1235"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1235"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1240"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1230"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1235">(1235)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para201337"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I could understand that if this minority Conservative government took great care with the constitutionality of the pieces of legislation that have been brought here, but I am very concerned, as I think all opposition members are, that this government has shown a lacklustre concern, shall we say, for constitutional issues. If something is challenged down the road and a few people's rights are trampled on in the meantime, that seems to be good enough for the government.</div>
    </p><a name="Para201338"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is not good enough on this side of the House. Somebody has to take responsibility for protecting people's constitutional rights and protecting their rights under the Charter of Rights and Freedoms. It is true that we are getting a large number of pieces of legislation coming forward, but does that equal a deliverable law and order agenda, for instance? Or does one put questionable pieces of legislation before this House and then take away the very funding that some of the marginalized people under those pieces of legislation perhaps would have access to with the court challenges program, in order to question their government when they feel the government has gone over the line?</div>
    </p><a name="Para201339"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These are not new thoughts. This is a program that was established in 1978 to provide access to justice in relation to minority rights. In 1982 Canada received the Charter of Rights and Freedoms and it came into force. In 1985 the program included funding for equality rights cases under section 15 of the charter. We know that in large part the historically disadvantaged groups in our society have been the ones to utilize this program. They are not the only players in the system, but in large part we have those people who are being challenged in many other ways being able to bring their cases for a proper determination before the courts.</div>
    </p><a name="Para201340"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will quote the parliamentary Standing Committee on Human Rights and the Status of Disabled Persons, which said, “This program has made a critical difference in bringing constitutional rights within the reach of francophone parents, aboriginal women and persons with disabilities”.</div>
    </p><a name="Para201341"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The court challenges program guide tells us that the program is happy to support “test cases that help to protect and advance the language and equality rights guaranteed under the Canadian Constitution”. </div>
    </p><a name="Para201342"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We need these funds because this funding is not going to come from any other place. We have to know that the clarification of the linguistic aspects of freedom of expression is an important right where we have official languages in more than one language. We have minority language rights in nearly every province and territory in this great country of ours.</div>
    </p><a name="Para201343"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are not talking about great sums of money here. Far greater than the sums of money involved are the great principles involved. We have been proud of this as a country and when we Liberals were the government we made sure this program continued and was funded. </div>

    </p><a name="Para201351"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They were concerned because they were hearing news reports that the government was considering cancelling the program.

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The president then respectfully asks the Government of Canada “to do the right thing and announce promptly the continued support of the Government of Canada for the Court Challenges Program”. Let us imagine the disappointment of the writers. Let us imagine their surprise.</div>
    </p><a name="Para201375"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On this side of the House, we know that the right thing to do is to put those funds back. We know that we had a $13 billion surplus and we know that this is a question of priorities. There are many, many good programs seeking funding from this House. There are very, very few programs that help those who are less advantaged in our society have access to the courts to make sure their voices and those whom they represent can have a say in obtaining rights that are theirs.</div>
    </p><a name="Para201376"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We did not say, when we gave this country its Charter of Rights and Freedoms, that only wealthy people who could afford lawyers would be able to have access to their rights. We said that this was for one and all. We said that this was for Canadians, that it was something to celebrate. Most of us in this House celebrate the Charter of Rights and Freedoms. Most of us in this House know that legislation has to meet constitutional tests.</div>
    </p><a name="Para201377"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I personally do not understand why this program would have been targeted. I do not want to impugn motives to people on the other side. But the reality is that they have cancelled an important program. The reality is that we have equality issues in this country. The reality is that minority language rights have to be upheld throughout the country. And the reality today is that the Conservative government has limited access to the courts through the cancellation of the funding for this program.</div>
    </p><a name="Para201378"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These are facts, indisputable facts. Why has the government done this? Because it got great advice from Canadians saying they hate the program? No, that is not the reason. This is ideological. The government is either saying it is perfect and has it right all the time, or it is saying to heck with constitutional rights. If somebody wants to spend their own money, not government money, not taxpayers' money, not in our value system as a nation together, then they can do it on their own time and their own penny. What does that say about the thinking of the current government? What does that say about how it values the access and equity issues among the most disadvantaged Canadians?</div>
    </p><a name="Para201379"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I note your signal, Mr. Speaker. I have other letters here. My colleagues and I have lists of organizations that have contacted us. I must put on the record that I have not had one phone call or received one piece of correspondence saying, “Hurrah for the government. It cancelled the program”. Not one. I have not seen that.</div>
    </p><a name="Para201380"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I think that is important. It is not only this area that has been cut off. I see a pattern developing. I see my friends on the other side getting ready to pounce, so I will put it on the record now. I see a pattern developing in which the government is telling Canadians it is protecting law and order in this country just because it is piling up legislation. But as members will know, people are working in this House every day on legislation. Members of the justice committee whom I work with every day are working through legislation. In fact, we just added another weekly meeting to our agenda to be able to work through legislation, and we will make sure that it is constitutional.</div>

That is why I was so curious to hear the member speak for a very lengthy period, yet fail to mention where her party stood on our government's tough new measures to crack down on crime.</div>
    </p><a name="Para201382"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have introduced numerous measures. We are raising the age of sexual consent from 14 to 16. We are bringing in minimum jail time for serious offenders in place of house arrest for those serious criminals.</div>
    </p><a name="Para201383"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The member of Parliament is soft on crime and opposes these measures, but she does not want to say so out loud. She does not want her constituents to know where she stands on those issues.</div>
    </p><a name="Para201384"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The member does not have any view on our plans to toughen up dangerous offenders laws to keep them in jail indefinitely unless they can prove they are safe. She does not have any views on our decision to ban street racing. She does not have any views on any of those things. She will not tell us where she stands on a single one of those new measures.</div>
    </p><a name="Para201385"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She should stand in her place and admit that she is against those tough new measures and that she is against the majority of Canadians who support those measures. She talked about a lot of interest groups that are angry about some of the spending reductions we have made. She did not speak about the victims' groups and the police groups that have stood up very strongly and supported our tough new measures to crack down on crime.</div>
    </p><a name="Para201386"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, I urge her in her response to finally come clean with Canadians and admit that she continues to be soft on crime and that she and her party will continue to oppose our tough new measures all the way through the process.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In relationship to each and every one of the justice legislation that comes before the House, as justice critic for my party, I give a speech in which the position is put not only of myself but of my party. With our votes and consultation, just like every party in the House, we make our decision whether to move a bill through the process of going through the committee stage and coming back into the House. We participate fully on that. </div>
    </p><a name="Para201392"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no doubt my constituents know where I stand on each and every issue because I tell them. I tell them not only here in the House, but I tell them at home and through my communications. Therefore, the member should not worry himself about issues that are not relevant to the debate on court challenges, because I do take care of my own constituents. Not everyone in the House has the ability to think that all their constituents agree each and every time, on each and every issue.

Conservatives make things up like this. I have no factual basis to buy into anything of that nature.</div>
    </p><a name="Para201399"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the reality is there are court costs and this program, in large measure, helped to fund the availability for access to the courts. The most important issue we should address is the fact that funding has been cut, funding that gave marginalized individuals and groups that had real issues to bring before the courts cases involving their language rights and often education rights. </div>
    </p><a name="Para201400"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A lot of these cases have been in my area. Susan Abbey v. Essex County Board of Education was a language rights case. The judicial rights case, R. v. Beaulac in 1999 was groundbreaking case in the development of judicial rights. Public services section 20 of the charter grants the right, without exception or limitation, to communicate with the central office of institutions of the Parliament and Government of Canada and the legislature and government of New Brunswick and the official language of one choice.</div>
    </p><a name="Para201401"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These are cases that were really important in enunciating principles where rights were being trampled and people had to take that right. There is no other way to say it than those access rights are now being taken away. I do not see how any government can defend this situation and how it can take away, summarily, the moneys that go to the heart of upholding our Constitution and our Charter of Rights and Freedoms.</div>

Beaulac in 1992 is another case considered key to women's equality. The Supreme Court of Canada dealt with the constitutional validity of the definition of obscenity in section 163 of the Criminal Code. For the first time, the court articulated contextualized harms-based tests for determining when material should be considered obscene.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now the Conservative government has taken the words “equality” out of the mandate of Status of Women. Therefore, we can participate, but we cannot be equal. Is that what we are saying? Last week, when I was in my university classrooms and on the radio locally, the thing that appalled most people was the fact that equality was taken out of the mandate of Status of Women in the mission statement.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is an issue that the government clearly wanted to slip in under the wire, with very little fanfare and very little notice. We are not prepared to let this issue go under the table. We will not let the government slip it under there without having a full scrutiny debate in the House of Commons and without a vote in the House of Commons.

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The federal government would have us believe that it is eliminating the court challenge program because it is somehow frivolously funding every Tom, Dick and Harry to sue their own government over legislation that it puts in place. Essentially this is the answer we heard in question period when the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78780,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78780&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">President of the Treasury Board</A> was pressed on this issue. We were pressing the minister for the business case. We were pressing him for some reason, some rationale as to why this heavy-handed move was justified. This is a deliberately simplistic and misleading overview of what the court challenge program does. </div>
    </p><a name="Para201410"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The one thing that the member for <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78658,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78658&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">London West</A> has done for us is spell out, not just what the federal court challenge program does, but the things that it does not do. It certainly does not provide funding to anyone who wants to sue the federal government. There are very rigid tests. The bar is set very high as to what type of challenges qualify for any support under the court challenges program.</div>
    </p><a name="Para201411"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is a matter when legislation, by omission or commission, offends the Charter of Rights and Freedoms, or the Constitution of Canada, or it somehow is applied in such a way that a legitimate group of Canadians feel that they are not being treated equally by their own Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. The highest duty of a member of Parliament is to ensure that all Canadians are treated equally.</div>
    </p><a name="Para201412"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am proud to say that this is one country in the world where equality is our main objective, which is not the case everywhere in the world. In Canada we have very meticulously written in to the Charter of Rights and Freedoms the assurance that Canadians can count on being treated equally as far as the application of services, benefits or anything provided by the government. Therefore, it is not a nuisance to the government to have Canadians or organizations test the Charter of Rights and Freedoms by these regular court challenges. It strengthens our rights. Our rights are made more secure by these challenges.</div>
    </p><a name="Para201413"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We should keep in mind that the Canadian Constitution is not a rigid document. It is a living, breathing, evolving document that can benefit from these rare and infrequent tests and challenges.</div>
    </p><a name="Para201414"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We should at least start from the same base level of information as we ask Canadians to concern themselves with this debate. They should go into this with their eyes open. Clearly the government has tried to sneak this through in a flurry of other activity and other cutbacks, hoping no one will notice this relatively small budget line. Let us be fair. This is a very small amount of money on the global scale of things. Let us also ensure that misinformation is not what is guiding us here. We have to challenge comments from the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78780,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78780&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">President of the Treasury Board</A> when he says that all the money just goes to Liberal lawyers anyway.</div>
    </p><a name="Para201415"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My colleague from Windsor pointed out that these challenges are often collaborative efforts by non-profit groups and NGOs. They find lawyers to work pro bono. The court challenge money they get, or the enabling money, is often used to pay for court costs, expert witnesses, research, et cetera.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having laid that foundation, I challenge the veracity of both of the excuses given by the President of the Treasury Board. I think we could then begin to have a proper debate about whether or not we need this assistance in our judicial system. </div>
    </p><a name="Para201417"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me point to one case to illustrate how valuable this program can be. It is my own personal experience. In Winnipeg Centre the Community Unemployed Help Centre deals with people who are having trouble with their employment insurance. On behalf of one client, Kelly Leisuk, the centre launched a Federal Court challenge sponsored by the court challenge program . The centre maintained that the EI act does not treat women equally, that women suffer a gender imbalance with the application of EI as it was evolved by the Liberal government.</div>
    </p><a name="Para201418"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the EI system went from a weekly based system to an hourly based system, women were disproportionately and negatively impacted in that more women worked low wage part time jobs and so women qualified less often for any EI benefits than men did. The empirical evidence was fairly straightforward. Frequent appeals to the federal government bore no satisfaction at all. We made the case to the federal government that the EI program was affecting women negatively, but the government of the day was deaf to this gender imbalance. The only avenue of recourse was to make a charter challenge under section 15, the equality provisions of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms, that the EI act as contemplated by the Liberal government offended the charter.</div>
    </p><a name="Para201419"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where else would a non-profit workers' organization go? Its total budget, and I know because I sat on its board of directors, is $250,000 a year. That funded four staff to advocate on behalf of people having trouble with their employment insurance. Where would an organization like that go to launch a massive Supreme Court challenge if not to the court challenge program?</div>
    </p><a name="Para201420"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When viewed in that light, it is an issue of natural justice, in this case on behalf of Canadian women. They would not have a voice and would not be able to have legal representation in this compelling matter were it not for the court challenges program. It is not unlike legal aid. We do not allow defendants to go into a courtroom unrepresented. They are given legal aid. No one argues if that is fair. It is a natural justice issue. In that same context, from time to time we need to test the veracity of our Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms and thereby strengthen it by these court challenges by legitimate groups within Canada. </div>
    </p><a name="Para201421"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I condemn the government for cutting the court challenges program. I thank my colleague from <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78455,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78455&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Ottawa—Vanier</A> for giving us the opportunity to voice those concerns in the House today. </div>

    </p><a name="Para201445"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until recently, rural Ontario has had the voice of only two members when the policy of antagonizing our largest trading partner was put in place by the old government. Softwood lumber producers and workers are still feeling the repercussions of those disastrous days before.</div>
    </p><a name="Para201446"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am pleased to be joined by many other voices on this side of the House who are not afraid to speak up for Ontario. The time has come to settle. </div>
    </p><a name="Para201447"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have listened very closely to the interventions of members from Ontario who do not represent those areas of the province that have suffered as a result of the softwood lumber dispute. If those members could see the disruption of life in a household of a sole breadwinner where there is no other employment in a remote community, those members might understand why our new Conservative government put such a high premium on resolving the softwood lumber dispute.</div>
    </p><a name="Para201448"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Frankly, I am surprised by members from northern Ontario, such as the member for <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78979,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78979&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Thunder Bay—Rainy River</A>, who decided to play politics with the future livelihood of forestry workers in their ridings.

Marie</A> when he acknowledged the benefits of the Free Trade Agreement which have been brought to the forestry industry, particularly to northern Ontario. Take the next step. I ask those members to think about the workers in their ridings who will benefit from this agreement when we vote on accepting this implementing legislation. </div>
    </p><a name="Para201449"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Considering the volume of trade between Canada and the United States, it is an accomplishment that there are so few trade disputes that do arise from time to time between our countries. Therefore, it was important for our new Conservative government to act and to resolve the softwood lumber dispute.</div>
    </p><a name="Para201450"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I appreciate that those softwood lumber workers who have recently experienced job loss look to our government for leadership. If only an agreement had been reached sooner, maybe those workers would not be in the position of being unemployed today.</div>
    </p><a name="Para201451"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is totally insensitive to the plight of the unemployed softwood lumber workers to suggest that they should wait for a ruling that may or may not come, leaving their fate in the hands of some lawyers who have a vested interest in prolonging a dispute rather than seeing it resolved.</div>
    </p><a name="Para201452"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our new Conservative government exchanged uncertainty for certainty, and certainty is what pays the bills.</div>
    </p><a name="Para201453"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is my privilege to speak today as the member of Parliament for a riding where men still work the forest. I recognize the hardships that have been faced by the workers and their families as a result of the softwood lumber dispute. </div>
    </p><a name="Para201454"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While it may have been politically expedient for the old government and its left-wing supporters to sacrifice the workers and their families as they prolonged a dispute that in the end would have produced only losers, as we say in Renfrew County and in some other parts of Canada, it was time to either fish or cut bait.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Communities that are dependent on the lumber industry do not have the luxury of waiting for a room full of big city lawyers getting rich on endless litigation to finally say, “We have had enough. Let's settle”.</div>
    </p><a name="Para201456"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jobs have been disappearing at an alarming rate in rural Ontario. The need to keep jobs in the lumber industry to maintain our way of life is paramount.</div>
    </p><a name="Para201457"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The softwood lumber industry in my riding is characterized by small operations, many of them family owned, and by people who are not looking for handouts, just fair treatment.</div>
    </p><a name="Para201458"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old government's softwood lumber policy caused significant unemployment in my riding. Worried softwood lumber producers called my office on a regular basis with the hope that the softwood lumber dispute was over. Families with their principal breadwinner unemployed wonder how they are going to survive this coming winter. In rural areas jobs are hard to come by.</div>
    </p><a name="Para201459"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ben Hokum and Son Ltd. in Killaloe; Murray Brothers in Madawaska; McRae Lumber in Whitney; Heideman and Sons in Eganville; D and S Calver Lumber near Pembroke; Gulick Forest Products and Thomas J. Newman Limited in Palmer Rapids; and Bell Lumber in Renfrew are just a few of the businesses in my riding affected directly or indirectly by this softwood lumber dispute.</div>
    </p><a name="Para201460"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is clear this softwood lumber crisis could have been avoided. We all knew the softwood lumber agreement would expire when it did. If the previous government had been paying the slightest attention, it would have known that the American lumber industry was pushing for countervailing duties.</div>
    </p><a name="Para201461"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was some idle talk about building alliances with American consumers and other interested groups to fight the countervailing duty imposed on our industry, but like all the talk on climate change, the old government was all talk and no action.</div>
    </p><a name="Para201462"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Softwood lumber is big business in Ontario, exporting $2 billion worth of goods annually and employing 20,000 people directly, many of whom work in eastern Ontario. The gross regional income of the central and eastern Ontario economy is $5 billion annually in the forestry industry alone. The region employs 133,000 people.</div>
    </p><a name="Para201463"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Ottawa Valley the forest industry supports nearly 4,500 jobs. That translates into 2,055 direct jobs, over 1,000 indirect regional jobs and another 1,295 indirect provincial jobs. Primary wood manufacturing is over 10 times the provincial average. In actual dollars and cents, our forest industry output is $294 million annually. I can identify over 100 forest product companies that make their home in Renfrew County.</div>
    </p><a name="Para201464"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is even more important in this debate over softwood lumber is how it was affecting our trading relationship with the United States. For value added products, the United States market is number one in Ontario. More than half of all forest products in Ontario are exported.</div>
    </p><a name="Para201465"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members will understand why we on this side of the House use the term crisis when we refer to the state of the Canadian softwood lumber industry.</div>
    </p><a name="Para201466"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those products have the largest export market in the United States. Exports from Ontario have increased by more than 100% since 1991.</div>
    </p><a name="Para201467"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The United States' construction industry is worth nearly $700 billion U.S. every year, and it will continue to be the focus of Canadian wood product shipments.</div>
    </p><a name="Para201468"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was imperative that our new government respect the special trading relationship we have had in the past and prioritize the need to resolve this trade dispute.</div>
    </p><a name="Para201469"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I urge all members to set politics aside and pass this legislation as quickly as possible.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hon. member seems to be saying that when we are involved in a court case and we are up against a bigger, wealthier opponent, that we should give in as fast as possible, get the best deal that we can possibly get, and cut and run and get out of there.

    </p><a name="Para201472"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Does the hon. member not see a parallel between her government's position on softwood lumber and her government's position on the court challenges program, where it is abolishing a program that is meant to give financial support to weaker, smaller parties that are standing up to the status quo to have their rights respected?</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even if Canada were ultimately successful in this round of litigation without a negotiated agreement, the U.S. lumber lobby could still launch a new case against imports of Canadian softwood lumber the following day starting a brand new lumber dispute.

    </p><a name="Para201475"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To those who continue to say that Canada was on the verge of a complete legal victory, the implications of continued litigation need to be more clearly understood. Even if Canada were to be ultimately successful in litigation, the U.S. industry could file a petition and request the imposition of new duty orders immediately thereafter. Meanwhile, the stability and predictability would continue to elude our softwood lumber industry.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We know the Conservative government is invoking closure and shutting down debate on this because it is so embarrassed by what has happened in the past week. However, this member has spoken up and I admire her courage. I know that 123 of her colleagues are going to refuse to speak to this because they are embarrassed, and they know that they have botched it and they dropped the ball.</div>
    </p><a name="Para201478"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What happened this week? Twofold. First, we have seen almost 3,000 jobs evaporate because of this agreement. In the first week of its implementation there are job losses in British Columbia, Saskatchewan, Ontario and Quebec. Right across the board it has been a complete disaster.</div>
    </p><a name="Para201479"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, last Friday the Court of International Trade ruled. We get every single penny back. That is its final judgment and the government was trying to stop that judgment from occurring.</div>
    </p><a name="Para201480"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So why are we giving away a billion dollars? Obviously, the member's notes were written before these two events, but I would like to ask this question. In light of the fact that we are now entitled officially, in the final decision of the Court of International Trade, to every single cent back and in light of the disastrous job losses in this past week, is the member willing now to revise her position?

    </p><a name="Para201485"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Simply put, this softwood lumber deal is not a deal at all. It is a complete sell out.</div>
    </p><a name="Para201486"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last Friday, the U.S. Court of International Trade ruled that Canadians are entitled to the return of every single penny of our $5.3 billion that was illegally imposed by the United States and that we have free entry of our product into its markets. We finally have the United States in its own courts, so why is the government wiping away five years of legal victory? Why are we foregoing $1 billion of the total duty owed and agreeing to a new border charge that can be as high as 22.5%?</div>
    </p><a name="Para201487"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This deal reeks either of complete incompetence or of complete inexperience, and I fear it reeks of both. The agreement that the minority Conservative government has rammed down Canadians' throats makes a mockery of free trade and turns over our domestic sovereignty to the United States of America. It also creates a sliding scale export tax that at current price levels is actually higher than the current U.S. duties, 22.5% versus the 8.5% that we were previously paying versus the 0% that we would have been paying after last Friday.</div>
    </p><a name="Para201488"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This agreement also abandons all our legal victories and gives up, as I said, $1 billion to secure the peace. How long are we securing the peace for? For as much or as only two years.</div>
    </p><a name="Para201489"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This agreement also seeds our decisions over domestic resource management to the United States. Now Washington will be calling the shots in our very own forests. It caps the share of the American softwood market at 30% when in fact the previous Liberal government turned down a cap of 34%. This deal is actually worse than the deal we previously declined.</div>
    </p><a name="Para201490"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This agreement also contains anti-surge provisions that cripple the ability of our forest industry to deal with unexpected circumstances such as the rise of the pine beetle infestation in British Columbia. It exposes firms to needless uncertainty by agreeing to a monthly measurement for surge protection when U.S. demand is highly variable on a monthly basis.</div>
    </p><a name="Para201491"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The agreement encourages other sectors to seek political decisions to get protection from Canadian industries, all but guaranteeing more disputes in the future.</div>
    </p><a name="Para201492"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It gets worse. Not only are we giving up more than $1 billion, but we are returning over half this money, $500 million, to the very U.S. lumber industry that we are engaged with, money that it will use down the road to attack Canadian industry.</div>
    </p><a name="Para201493"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even American lawyers think the floor crossing minister was suckered in this deal. The inexperienced, incompetent Conservative government took the terms of the surrender and now Canadians will have to pay the price. They will have to pay the price in lost jobs, lost hope, and devastated world communities. </div>
    </p><a name="Para201494"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This deal was botched by the member for <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78539,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78539&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Vancouver Kingsway</A> and, sadly, it was botched badly. Now our forestry industry, our forestry workers, and our Canadian communities will have to pay the price.</div>
    </p><a name="Para201495"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over 360,000 Canadians are employed in the softwood industry. We have a well-earned international reputation for the quality of our wood and our products. It is not an easy time. They are also facing pressure from a high Canadian dollar, high energy prices, lower housing starts in the United States, and a shrinking demand for global newsprint. </div>
    </p><a name="Para201496"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This deal, I am afraid, will only worsen their plight, and has in fact already directly caused the layoff of thousands of workers in just the past 30 days.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Industry associations warned us that this Conservative deal would cause a disaster. The Ontario Forest Industry Association estimates that it would cause 10% of the industry to lose jobs, and we are well on our way. The Bank of Montreal expects more shutdowns of both pulp and paper and sawmill facilities. The Independent Lumber Remanufacturers Association warns that this deal would all but destroy this sector.</div>
    </p><a name="Para201498"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To add insult to injury, the minority Conservative government has continued to bully our industries into submission. The Prime Minister has backed Canadian softwood industry representatives into a corner and left them with no choice but to cede to this flawed deal.</div>
    </p><a name="Para201499"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a better way, however. We do have a choice. Canadians and this Parliament can say no this botched deal, and that is what we should have done from the start. </div>
    </p><a name="Para201500"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We should see our NAFTA challenge through to the end, as it has last Friday. We should implement an aid package immediately that will invest in improving our industry's competitive position, that will invest in skills of our workforce, and will work to develop new overseas markets for our wood products.</div>
    </p><a name="Para201501"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Liberal Party cannot support this deal in good conscience, not when the Conservative government leaves $1 billion on the table, restricts our future free trade with the United States, and results in thousands of layoffs instantaneously. </div>
    </p><a name="Para201502"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is our duty as the official opposition to stand up for the interests of the Canadian lumber producers, for the 360,000 employees, and for the interests of all Canadians.</div>
    </p><a name="Para201503"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We stand opposed to the minority Conservative government's humiliating surrender and we oppose this weak deal to which it shamefully has capitulated.</div>

We also know that Conservatives are refusing to speak to the softwood lumber agreement because they are so embarrassed by it. </div>
    </p><a name="Para201505"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, there are 123 Conservative sheep that will refuse to speak to it, despite the catastrophic job losses we have seen in the past week in Saskatchewan, British Columbia, Ontario and Quebec. There were nearly 3,000 jobs lost in the first week of this bad deal's implementation.</div>
    </p><a name="Para201506"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We also heard last Friday the Court of International Trade say that we have the right to every single penny back on the money that was illegally taken. We are giving away $1 billion for nothing.</div>
    </p><a name="Para201507"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to ask the member two questions. First, how does he react to the fact that we won in the Court of International Trade and we should get every single penny back? The only thing stopping us is the Conservatives and the Bloc working together to try to ram this bad deal through. </div>
    </p><a name="Para201508"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, given the fact that the Liberals and the trade committee stopped the hearings that were to take place across the country to hear from the public on this bad deal, would he be prepared to bring forward, with his colleagues, an actual proposal for hearings so that the international trade committee could go across the country and hear from the public on this issue?</div>

We are winning in the courts. We have been winning in the courts. The rate at which duty has been applied has been consistently dropping from 27% to 11% to 8%, and now as of last Friday it was going to go to 0%.</div>
    </p><a name="Para201510"></a><p>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, they decide that they want to now get in bed with the Americans and say that maybe they will capitulate to a deal. Of the $5 billion-plus that was our money in the first place, that is owed to the producers of Canada, they will leave $1 billion on the table for the Americans and $500 million of which can be used any which way they want. Then they come to Parliament to see if they can ram this down parliamentarians' throats.</div>
    </p><a name="Para201512"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We all need to stand up and say no, this deal is not good enough for Canada. It is not good enough for the House of Commons and it is definitely not good enough for our industry.</div>

I am quite shocked because I would expect he would want to support his own riding, and mills in his own riding, including Goat Lake Forest Products that has certainly written to the member and asked him to support the softwood lumber deal.

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The legal proceedings launched by Canada and by the industry had not yet begun when we proposed measures such as loan guarantees for the companies. At that point, there were not only the countervailing duties that were being paid; there were anti-dumping and anti-subsidy duties. The industry had a need for that kind of support. </div>
    </p><a name="Para201526"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All the while, the Bloc Québécois strongly recommended and called for loan guarantees to save the forest industry. Those loan guarantees were refused by the Liberals. One of the Liberal ministers became a Conservative and again the loan guarantees were refused. Such loans would have enabled the industry to survive the crisis while the suits to defend those rights, rights upheld by many tribunals, were pending before the courts. </div>
    </p><a name="Para201527"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now, they tell us that they have an agreement. Normally in any economic transaction, in any agreement between two parties, if one party is adversely affected it is not the other party who gains. One does not give 20% of one's assets to the party that has treated one unfairly for years. Who was the winner in this affair? Who won a billion dollars? It was the United States.</div>
    </p><a name="Para201528"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How are we to understand that one party, on the strength of a number of decisions by various tribunals, having to wait perhaps only a few months more until the decisions are implemented, should agree to leave a billion dollars in the hands of our neighbour, who for all practical purposes had been exploiting us for several years? How can you explain such an attitude, unless it was to buy a special friendship with the Bush government? </div>
    </p><a name="Para201529"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As a result, the Prime Minister, his acolytes, his members and ministers, got together and prepared an agreement that means the forest industry will continue to depend, probably for many years, on the whims of the Americans.</div>
    </p><a name="Para201530"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In fact, we know that the Americans can call an end to this agreement whenever they feel like it, even if it is supposed to be guaranteed for seven years. I heard the Liberal member say earlier that, in fact, if the government had done its work properly, if it had guaranteed loans and provided support to the industry and to workers in the forest industry, we could have waited and in the end we would have won at the international court, NAFTA and the rest. It was recognized everywhere that there was no dumping and no subsidies.</div>
    </p><A NAME="T1345"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1345"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1350"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1340"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1345">(1345)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para201531"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now, with the agreement, we are certain that 15% duty will have to be paid and volume will be limited as well. That fact will create two classes within the forestry industry. </div>
    </p><a name="Para201532"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Quebec has agreed to option B. There is sometimes also a degree of latitude in the makeup of binational committees. I hope that Quebec will have its representatives on the binational committee. We will work for this to happen because Quebec is where the most business is done in lumber and forestry under option B.</div>
    </p><a name="Para201533"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Obviously, Quebec is going to have to defend its interests directly, given that it is the leading partner agreeing to option B. When I began to speak, I referred to the Conservative Party member. The Conservative Party today seems to be laying the blame for all the problems in the forestry industry at the doorstep of environmentalists, and directly targeting Richard Desjardins. But it is the Liberals and Conservatives who are responsible for the decline of the forestry industry.</div>
    </p><a name="Para201534"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If the Liberals had had the good fortune to be still in power after the last election, how far would they have gone in an agreement with the United States?</div>
    </p><a name="Para201535"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So it is obvious that we in Quebec were virtually unanimous in not wanting this agreement. The constraints manufactured out of thin air by both the Liberal and Conservative governments, one after the other, have strangled not only the industry but forestry workers as well.</div>
    </p><a name="Para201536"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yesterday there was a vote, and one of the measures proposed by the Bloc Québécois was adopted by this House, a measure relating to a support program for older workers.</div>
    </p><a name="Para201537"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Today we learn that the program will probably be selective and will give preference to softwood lumber workers, the forestry industry and the textile industry. Are these rumours? There is always a kernel of truth in rumours. This program gains something for the forestry industry and the textile industry. But a worker who is 50 or 55 years old is still unemployed, regardless of what industry the worker comes from.</div>
    </p><a name="Para201538"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As the leader of my party recently asked, how can we completely forget about someone who has worked in a particular field for 30 or 35 years, whether it be forestry or the textile industry? We are dismissing these people with a wave of the hand. As well, eligibility for the program will be based on region. This means that we will be creating several classes of older people who are unfortunately facing unemployment and who are unable to find new jobs.</div>
    </p><a name="Para201539"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Overall, no matter whether the government was Liberal or Conservative, we can see that both, one after the other, have completely dropped the ball when it comes to the forestry industry. As we have already said, we will be making a point of supporting this bill, because the survival of the forestry industry and of those workers, and, I hope, the revival of that industry, depend on it.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Despite my respect for the member, I must say that I do not understand the Bloc Québécois' position at all. Seventeen hundred families have been in dire straits for the past week because of this agreement. We all know that this is a botched agreement. Furthermore, it now includes a provision to discourage circumvention by preventing the Government of Quebec from changing its forestry policies without consulting the Bush administration.</div>
    </p><a name="Para201542"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last Friday, the Government of Quebec learned that this provision prevented the government from taking steps to protect the hundreds of families in distress because of this agreement.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;André Boisclair, leader of the Parti Québécois, said very clearly that this is a bad deal. He does not support the agreement; he condemned it.</div>
    </p><a name="Para201544"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not understand the Bloc's position. The Parti Québécois condemned the agreement because it ties Quebec's hands, but the Bloc still seems inclined to support it. I hope that will change.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Who really wins in all of this? As I said earlier, it is the United States government that wins: for all practical purposes, it wins a billion dollars for having forced the forestry companies of Canada and Quebec to go bankrupt, leaving workers unemployed.</div>
    </p><a name="Para201556"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That billion dollars is very easily divided up. Five hundred million is going to certain U.S. companies, to benefit the United States in the same sector. A $450-million fund will be left to the discretion of the Americans. Fortunately Bush does not want and cannot have another term of office, because this would help him get elected. The billion dollars has mainly been used to develop specific friendships with the Bush government. There is $50 million remaining, which could in the end benefit Canadian business because it is for initiatives designed to promote the use of lumber, from Canadian and U.S. firms alike. Fifty million dollars may seem like a lot of money, but if most of it goes back to the United States, nothing will be left for Quebec and for Canada.</div>

I ask all members of the House to support the bill.</div>
    </p><a name="Para201560"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clearly, the softwood lumber agreement is good for industry, good for lumber communities and good for Canada. </div>
    </p><a name="Para201561"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I come from a rural riding myself and I know the hard times that rural residents have been facing. Our lumber communities during this long period of dispute have faced mill closures because of the tariffs and a long, drawn out and never-ending litigation.</div>
    </p><a name="Para201562"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bill would bring prosperity back to the industry and back to our rural communities where the lumber industry is the mainstay. The bill would eliminate the punitive U.S. duties and would end the costly litigation that has gone on for far too long. Under this agreement, the U.S. will immediately dismiss all trade actions against our companies. It takes our lumber producers out of the courts and puts them back where they belong: in communities across this country, expanding their businesses and contributing to Canada's economy. It will provide stability for an industry hit hard by years of trade action.</div>
    </p><a name="Para201563"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the next seven to nine years no border measures will be imposed when lumber prices are above $355 per thousand board feet. When prices drop below this threshold, the agreement gives provinces flexibility to choose the border measures most beneficial to their economic situation.</div>
    </p><a name="Para201564"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I should add that all export charged revenues collected by the Government of Canada through these border measures will stay in Canada. The softwood lumber agreement returns nearly $5 billion, a significant infusion of capital for the lumber industry, and will bring stability to the workers and communities that rely on it.</div>
    </p><a name="Para201565"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have even developed a creative deposit mechanism to ensure that lumber companies receive their money as quickly as possible. Upon filling out and returning the necessary legal and administrative documents, companies will receive their funding within four to eight weeks.</div>
    </p><a name="Para201566"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is an agreement to be proud of. It is a practical and flexible agreement that ends this long-standing dispute on terms that are highly favourable to Canada's lumber industry and forestry workers.</div>

    </p><a name="Para201571"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At times, the challenges facing so many in the developing world can seem beyond comprehension and far too onerous to solve: the spread of aids, the absence of clean water, the lack of a good education and, at the root of it all, extreme poverty. One in five people around the world live on less than $1 a day. What can any of us do?</div>
    </p><a name="Para201572"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We can help. We can stand as one, we can stand together and we can support some significant efforts, efforts like UNICEF's 25 by 2005, Girls' Education campaign; and efforts like the bed net program, where a $10 bed net can help prevent malaria and increase a child's chances of survival by 20%. </div>
    </p><a name="Para201573"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through efforts like the Make Poverty History campaign, we see that lives can be saved, living standards can be improved and real hope can be kindled. By joining Make Poverty History, we unleash the power of one and we become the change that the world has been waiting for.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This morning during my meeting with the Chairman of the Senate of Pakistan I informed him that CIDA will provide additional aid of $40 million to his country for reconstruction activities. These funds will be used to rebuild schools.</div>

    </p><a name="Para201842"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I said that it was practical and flexible, and that it was ending this long standing dispute. Moreover, it directly responds to the civic issues and concerns raised by industry and provinces. For instance, it recognizes provincial market based reforms and preserves provincial authorities to manage their forest resources as they see fit. It also excludes from border measures the Atlantic provinces and the territories and 32 companies, including Quebec border mills that were found by the U.S. department of commerce not to be subsidized.</div>
    </p><a name="Para201843"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It ensures that independent lumber remanufacturers do not have to pay an extra charge on the value added component of their products. It establishes a process for Canada and the U.S., in consultation with the provinces, to determine the steps regions can take to qualify for exemption from the border measures.</div>
    </p><a name="Para201844"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The agreement has the support of two national governments and all of the key lumber producing provinces, as well as an overwhelming majority of industry players. All it needs now is the support of parliamentarians.</div>
    </p><a name="Para201845"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2334521,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2334521&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-24</A> will implement Canada's commitments under this agreement. It gives the provinces the flexibility they need to choose the right border option for their economic situations. The bill also seeks to amend parts of the Export and Import Permits Act to bring into operation the mechanisms we need to meet our commitments under the agreement.</div>
    </p><a name="Para201846"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am happy to be part of a government that has done, in very short order, in less than six months, what no other government could. It has put an end to this dispute and has started to direct our full attention to building a stronger, more competitive Canadian lumber industry. </div>
    </p><a name="Para201847"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is absolutely essential that we bring our lumber towns and this industry back to life by putting this unproductive dispute behind us and getting on with this new deal that will bring prosperity and stability to the softwood lumber industry.</div>
    </p><a name="Para201848"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would ask all members of the House to join me in supporting the bill and putting this dispute behind us once and for all.</div>

    </p><a name="Para201850"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We also know that the Conservatives are invoking closure, shutting down debate in the House because they are ashamed themselves of what has been such a poorly botched negotiation and such an appallingly bad agreement.</div>
    </p><a name="Para201851"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the member knows, since the agreement was forced into place after the companies were bullied last week, we have seen almost 3,000 Canadians lose their jobs in softwood communities in British Columbia, Saskatchewan, Ontario and Quebec. It has been a mess and a catastrophe, as we know.</div>
    </p><a name="Para201852"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We also know from the decision that was made last Friday in the Court of International Trade, the final decision, that Canadians are entitled to every single cent back. We have a badly botched agreement, one that is not commercially viable and we have double taxation of companies taking place right now. There is chaos at the border because of the poor implementation of the deal that should never should have been brought in, in the first place, when we have won at the Court of International Trade. </div>
    </p><a name="Para201853"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Very simply I would ask, why are the Conservatives so intent on bullying through this bad deal when the Court of International Trade has said that we are entitled to every single cent back? Why did they not take the care to at least be responsible in implementing this, so we would not see the chaos that we have seen at the border over the last few days, and the loss of thousands of jobs in the softwood sector in British Columbia, Saskatchewan, Ontario and Quebec? It is a catastrophe and the Conservatives are responsible for it.</div>

The NDP does not get it.</div>
    </p><a name="Para201856"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The NDP members want ongoing litigation. They want to see this kept in the courts into perpetuity. They want to see lawyers getting rich and people losing their jobs, companies shutting down and lumber communities becoming ghost towns. </div>
    </p><a name="Para201857"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We do not want that to happen. We are being extremely responsible. We are going ahead to ensure that this deal is put into play and we want to ensure that those communities are protected.</div>

    </p><a name="Para201867"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would first point out that this amendment was found by the chair of the Standing Committee on Citizenship and Immigration to be in order, and it was discussed and debated by the committee and approved by a majority of members of the committee in that context.</div>
    </p><a name="Para201868"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would like to emphasize that the parliamentary secretary made his arguments before the committee at that time.</div>
    </p><a name="Para201869"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As well, there was a vote at the committee, after hearing the arguments made by the parliamentary secretary and after hearing from other members, upholding the chair's ruling that the amendment was in order. The committee voted to sustain the chair's ruling.</div>
    </p><a name="Para201870"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I appreciate that the committee's actions do not preclude an approach to the Speaker and the House on this issue, but I want it to be clear for the Speaker that these issues were considered by the committee. I know that the Speaker has repeatedly found that in most cases committees know best when dealing with the matters before them, so I thought the fact that this amendment was debated and found in order by the committee is important.</div>
    </p><a name="Para201871"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I submit that the amendment does not go beyond the scope of the bill as passed by the House at second reading. Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2195400,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2195400&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-14</A> and the amendment in question are amendments to section 5 of the Citizenship Act. Section 5 deals with the question of grants of citizenship and sets out the minister's obligation with regard to the granting of citizenship. It also grants discretionary powers to the minister to waive requirements of the act in certain cases. </div>
    </p><a name="Para201872"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2195400,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2195400&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-14</A> amends this section of the act by adding a new section 5.1 that addresses the citizenship of children adopted by Canadians overseas, granting them citizenship upon application at the time of the finalization of adoption. This removes the discriminatory effects of the current law, which requires adopted children to apply for permanent resident status and then meet the residency requirements before subsequently applying for Canadian citizenship, but grants children born to Canadians overseas immediate Canadian citizenship without such an application.</div>
    </p><a name="Para201873"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 5 currently establishes criteria for obtaining Canadian citizenship, as well as noting situations where the minister may exercise discretion.

The amendment proposed by the standing committee to Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2195400,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2195400&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-14</A>, rather than stepping outside the scope of the bill passed at second reading, merely adds a further consideration to the decision making powers of the minister as outlined in sections 5 and 5.1 by allowing an appeal of the minister's decision. I submit that this is in keeping with the principle of the bill as passed at second reading.</div>
    </p><a name="Para201874"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the parliamentary secretary's contention that this amendment provides new powers and a new mandate to the Immigration and Refugee Board beyond what is provided in the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, I would submit that denial of citizenship to an adopted child is a de facto denial of an immigration visa and permanent resident status to that child and, as such, the Immigration and Refugee Board is exactly the body that exercises judgment and rules on such cases. </div>
    </p><a name="Para201875"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The board is the body that understands the issues related to the validity of adoptions of children by Canadians overseas by currently ruling on appeals of the denial of permanent resident status to children adopted overseas. I would maintain that the issues investigated and criteria applied currently to rule on an appeal of permanent resident status to a child adopted by a Canadian overseas will be the same issues and criteria used to rule on an appeal of the denial of citizenship to such a child should Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2195400,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2195400&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-14</A> and the amendment be passed into law by Parliament.</div>
    </p><a name="Para201876"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This does not, therefore, add new powers or a new mandate to the Immigration and Refugee Board beyond those already mandated and exercised. The final result of decisions appealed will change as a result of a decision, given that under Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2195400,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2195400&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-14</A>, should this amendment carry, an adopted child will become a Canadian citizen instead of a permanent resident, but the decision making process of the appeal is essentially the same.</div>
    </p><a name="Para201877"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this respect, no new powers or mandate are conferred by the amendment, and no royal recommendation would be necessary since no new activities are being contemplated or undertaken. No new public funds should be required in these circumstances and therefore I would argue that it does not impinge on the financial initiative of the Crown. </div>
    </p><a name="Para201878"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Speaker, this amendment was presented and its procedural admissibility was approved by the committee.

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is exactly what I have been trying to do. The amendment supports both the scope and spirit of the bill, and I contend it achieves the overriding goal the government has stated that the bill is supposed to achieve.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the contention that this amendment is incomplete, I submit that requirements as to its operation can be delineated in regulations developed to implement the act, and therefore the amendment meets all the tests of completeness.

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is some pretty tough talk, which I think most in the House and most Canadians across this country could get behind. As a matter of fact, my party and I campaigned on roughly the same position, stating that:</div>

</div>
    </p><a name="Para201898"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So here we are in the House to debate legislation which breaks the government's election promise, legislation which settles for a loss instead of a win, and legislation which brings in a politically expedient quick fix at the cost of the future of an industry and a way of life in Canada. </div>
    </p><a name="Para201899"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Need I remind the government that Canada's legal position prior to the introduction of the Conservative government was supported by numerous decisions by international trade tribunals and by the courts in both Canada and the United States, and yet the government has settled for less, and a great deal less.</div>
    </p><a name="Para201900"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Further, I think this complete surrender to the United States government on this file only sets up this government--and more importantly, future governments--for hardship and failure on any number of issues in the future. I guess Washington knows that in future disputes with Canada the new government may not have the will or the stomach to stand up for Canada and fight when it is right to fight.</div>
    </p><a name="Para201901"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This outright abandonment of Canada's position that our softwood industry is not subsidized shreds any notion that the dispute resolution provisions of NAFTA can work. It will only reinforce the will of certain U.S. legislators and bureaucrats that they can flaunt international rules any time they want and anywhere they want on any trade agreement.</div>
    </p><a name="Para201902"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This deal is a bad deal for Canada. The criticisms have been articulated here in the House and across this country. It leaves $1 billion belonging to Canadian companies in the hands of Americans, $500 million of which is at the disposal of the U.S. lumber industry to use to fund legal attacks against us, against Canadians. They will use money from the Canadian softwood industry to attack that very industry.</div>
    </p><a name="Para201903"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This deal creates an export tax that at current price levels is actually higher than current duties and will create an unfair and unprecedented tax regime which will impose crippling export duties on softwood. It limits the government's ability to help the softwood industry, and it undercuts our rules-based trading relationship with the United States. Let me say again that this is a bad deal. If the members opposite say this is the best deal they could get, then I say they were not trying hard enough.</div>
    </p><a name="Para201904"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My mother always said that we can't make a silk purse out of a sow's ear, but I want to give credit to the Standing Committee on International Trade. Committee members took a bad agreement and tried very hard to make it better. Some of the committee's recommendations included: advocating more time to conclude a final agreement that would meet the softwood industry's expectations; making sure to obtain an effective mechanism to resolve any disputes that may arise over the interpretation of that agreement; and upholding Canada's legal victories. I will say that again: upholding Canada's legal victories.</div>
    </p><a name="Para201905"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have won a number of legal cases on this issue. It seems to me that when we have won such a number of cases, legally and morally, it is up to both of us to collect upon and enforce this decision. When we do not, we weaken the very reason we would go into arbitration.</div>
    </p><A NAME="T1525"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1525"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1530"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1520"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1525">(1525)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para201906"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When awards are won and parties do not have to live up to the terms, future decisions are threatened and undermined. In this case, this could have far-reaching effects on various other aspects, not only in this industry but also in many other areas of government.</div>
    </p><a name="Para201907"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With this agreement, we are letting down our workers in the softwood lumber industry. Further, many other industries face similar trade problems. Therefore, through admitting defeat on this issue, we would be letting down many Canadians from coast to coast. Is this truly what the new government intended to do? </div>
    </p><a name="Para201908"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From having served for over 13 years in this House, I know my colleagues from every party are trying, to the very best of their abilities, to do the best jobs they can for Canadians. I truly I believe that. However, to not acknowledge the weakness of not enforcing awards is doing very serious damage. That is why it is so very important that we push the new government to try to get international trade rules upheld, acknowledged, accepted and enforced.</div>
    </p><a name="Para201909"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The committee's recommendations did not stop there. The fact is that the committee's report also advocated a flexible ceiling under option B. It also advocated flexibility for those under option A. The aim was to ensure that the industry was not excessively penalized for sudden and temporary increases in exports to the United States. The Standing Committee on International Trade also recommended that every measure be taken to ensure that Canadian companies, with interest, would have their due share of countervailing and anti-dumping duties within 90 days of the conclusion of this agreement. These are only a few of the strong recommendations that the Standing Committee on International Trade made.</div>
    </p><a name="Para201910"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past election, the Conservative Party talked a lot about how important committees were. Conservatives talked about the fact that if they were elected, they would listen to the committees because they believed that the committees represented all parties, many points of view, and most of all, balance.</div>
    </p><a name="Para201911"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is hard for me to understand, when the committee has come out with such very strong recommendations from an extremely rigorous examination of this issue, that the government essentially chooses to completely ignore that report. I am sorry for that. I, too, believe that balance is important in our decision making. We must be willing to weigh the pros and cons of every situation and we know, as parliamentarians, that our final solutions will not please everyone. They rarely, if ever, do, but we as parliamentarians must strive for that balance. We must hear all points of view and we must not tune them out, as the Conservatives are doing at this point.</div>
    </p><a name="Para201912"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would ask the government to revisit that committee report and re-look at some of the committee's recommendations, which were put forth in good faith. I believe Canadians are looking for a government, no matter which party forms it, to give balance, to listen and, at the end of that process, to make the best possible decision for Canada and all Canadians. People want no less of the government. People are tired of the bickering, and I cannot say that enough. Every time I go into the riding, I hear how people are tired of parliamentarians bickering. They want us to work together for the best solution. </div>
    </p><a name="Para201913"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is an important file. We have worked on it for a long time together, perhaps some would say too long, undoubtedly. However, to sell out is not the proper way to go about this. When there are areas that have been hard fought and have been legally won, we should not abandon those victories.</div>
    </p><a name="Para201914"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is, indeed, a great challenge to try to not only protect this industry but to help ensure it flourishes. The softwood industry is an important part of Canada's economy, particularly in many rural parts of the country. We need to keep this industry strong to help both our national economy and the local economies of the communities where this industry is based.</div>
    </p><a name="Para201915"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The industry offers Canadians good jobs, jobs that we need. We must do everything that we can to support it and the Canadians making their living from it. Please, do not sell us out.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The issue is this it is not a good deal. We are forgoing legal positions that we have won legal restitution, and that is serious for us.</div>
    </p><a name="Para201921"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am sure members have seen the <i>Globe and Mail</i> today. I do not like what it says. It says “The softwood sellout agreement”. It goes on to say that the new government has said it would forgo $1 billion of the total duties owed and agreed to a new border charge as high as 22.5%. The Conservatives are not speaking about this, and that is quite serious. The Canadian people need to know that this is the kind of a deal to which the Conservatives are agreeing.</div>
    </p><a name="Para201922"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hon. member has said that provinces are wanting this or are saying that they may want it. At the moment, there is some truth that.

    </p><a name="Para201923"></a><p>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know the new Conservative government wants to try to do a good job. I know this file was important for the Conservatives to hold up as kind of mantra and say, “Look it, we did this. We solved this”. To solve it incorrectly, to solve it on the backs of an industry, which in a short time will go down because of this deal, is not the right thing. This is why it is so important that we try to get this deal better. </div>

I realize a lot of people had questions for the last member and therefore you could not recognize everyone. It is always a difficult job in this place. However, I wanted to ask the hon. member a question, and I think I can answer it myself, about the number of sawmills she had in her riding. I have 15, and every one of them supports this agreement. I believe the answer to my question would be a big zero.</div>
    </p><a name="Para201931"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we talk about the industry, we should have some knowledge about the industry. Members in this place discuss the bill as if they have some knowledge about the softwood lumber industry. In reality, it is simply political posturing, and I really begin to lose patience with it. As Speaker of the House, you have lots of patience, and we certainly try to follow your example, but it is difficult sometimes.</div>
    </p><a name="Para201932"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There has been a lot of politics and posturing around the bill, but let us take some of those positions that members in this place have brought forward. Let us take the position that we will continue for litigation. We have had 24 years of litigation, and 24 years is a long time with no end in sight. We will litigate, but as long as the Byrd amendment is in place in the United States, we will continue to have litigation. Therefore, it is important to have some clarity and certainty on this issue. Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2334521,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2334521&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-24</A> brings that to the softwood lumber industry.</div>
    </p><a name="Para201933"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I spent a good portion of my life working in the lumber industry as a logger. My family members are still loggers. My grandfather owned the local sawmill. I can assure the House that It is a tough life, but it is a good life as long as we have some certainty that we can sell our product.</div>
    </p><a name="Para201934"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Liberals great failure was not reaching an agreement, which is the reason they are not supporting this. For the life of me, I still do not understand our Atlantic Canadian members who are all say they will not support the agreement. The agreement is the future for the sawmill industry and the softwood lumber industry in Atlantic Canada. The agreement allows us certainty for our exemptions, which have been hard fought for outside this place.</div>
    </p><a name="Para201935"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The previous international trade minister, under the former Liberal government, put Atlantic Canada's exemptions for countervail and for anti-dumping on the bargaining table to try to get an agreement prior to the last election. The Liberals would have given up Atlantic Canada's hard fought for exemptions. The Liberals did not get those exemptions for the industry. Industry got them by proving to our American counterparts that our industry was on the same basis as theirs. Seventy-two per cent of all the land in Nova Scotia is privately owned. Our mills are exempt from countervail because of that. We do not subsidize the industry. It works on a free market basis, the same basis on which the American industry works. </div>
    </p><a name="Para201936"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The great thing about Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2334521,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2334521&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-24</A> is that it allows flexibility, it allows for change and it allows for regional differences. </div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we allow the bill to pass, I fully expect all my NDP colleagues from Atlantic Canada and all my Liberal Party colleagues from Atlantic Canada to support it because it is a good bill for Atlantic Canada and it is a good bill for the rest of Canada. It recognizes regional differences. It recognizes an industry, to be perfectly frank, which was in a state of collapse because of the mismanagement of this file by the Liberal government.</div>
    </p><a name="Para201938"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What does the agreement do? It is good for Canada. It is good for the United States. It eliminates the punitive American duties. It returns more than $4.4 billion to producers. It provides stability for the industry. It spells an end to the costly litigation and the long-running dispute between Canada and the United States.</div>

The return of the $4.4 billion alone will benefit communities, workers, truckers, and the whole sawmill industry from coast to coast in this country.

He more than anyone else worked to bring this agreement to fruition. He went through the tough slogging. As a former industry person he was able to talk on an equal level with his American counterparts. He knew what was required at the bargaining table. He worked for a just end for the softwood lumber industry right across Canada. He did not do that by pitting British Columbia against Nova Scotia. He did not do that by pitting Ontario against Quebec. He did it by bringing in an agreement that has flexibility and recognizes regional differences. Somehow our counterparts in the opposition cannot seem to wrap their heads around that. </div>
    </p><a name="Para201941"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can tell the House what would happen if we did not have this agreement. We would continue with litigation. The American industry is protectionist. No one is questioning that. We know it, and that is not going to change. We had to get the best agreement we could get. We had to get an agreement that would give surety to the industry and move forward from that point. If not, we would be stuck in litigation forever, and companies and sawmills, loggers and individuals, and communities and families would face devastation across this country.</div>
    </p><a name="Para201942"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are 600 communities that depend upon the softwood lumber industry to survive. I can guarantee that many of those communities would not survive this crisis without this agreement. If the NDP do not want to go along with it, fine. If the Liberals do not want to go along with it, fine. But clearer heads will prevail and this agreement will allow those communities and those families to survive.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The termination clause in the agreement is something else that has been misrepresented in this place. With respect to the criticisms regarding the termination clause, let me note that termination clauses are standard features of international trade agreements. The discussion here is as if this is the only agreement with a termination clause. Under international law, without a specific termination clause, agreements may be terminated at any time with 12 months' notice. This has a minimum of 18 months' notice with a year added on to the end of it. That is two and a half years.</div>

I would like, however, to repeat the position of the Bloc Québécois, which supports this agreement but in a context where the Quebec industry had told us that they were on their last legs and that they had to support the agreement because, in the last analysis, they had no choice. </div>
    </p><a name="Para201946"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since 2002, we have had Liberal governments and now a Conservative government who did not support the companies who were dealing with the softwood lumber problem.</div>
    </p><a name="Para201947"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Bloc Québécois, as everyone knows, asked for loan guarantees from the Liberals. During the election campaign, the Conservative Party told us it was going to offer loan guarantees but it did not do that. We called for flexibility in employment insurance to help the workers who were affected by the softwood lumber problem, but there was no flexibility, either from the Liberals or the Conservative Party. We called for support for processing activities in order to provide new opportunities for the Quebec forest sector but no measures were introduced.</div>
    </p><a name="Para201948"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I hope that this House will listen to these remarks. I believe this is a bad agreement but we have no other choice than to sign it, because the industry is on its last legs. However, this Parliament should learn a lesson, including the Liberals whom we kept after for months and months to come to the help of these companies and to support them even in terms of legal costs. To date, the legal costs for companies in the forest industry exceed $350 million. They have received no assistance from the government.</div>
    </p><a name="Para201949"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I believe this should be a lesson for the Liberal Party, the Conservatives, and for all members. If we do not support our companies in this kind of dispute, we will wind up with an agreement like this one, which is unsatisfactory for all the companies and all the workers, but in the end we have no choice but to support it.</div>

As for the rest of Canada, this is a good deal for Quebec. As a matter of fact, there is enough flexibility built into the agreement that it allows for free trade in lumber, the same as we have in Atlantic Canada, for 32 mills in Quebec. Those border mills will all have free trade in lumber. Furthermore, it allows for enough flexibility in the deal that other provinces can adopt Atlantic Canadian and border mill standards throughout Canada and have free trade in softwood lumber.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The great danger, which has been a danger from the very beginning of discussions with the Americans and the very basis for our exemption in Atlantic Canada, in subsidizing the industry is that those subsidies will then be seen as countervailable and we are back into another trade war and another round of talks. That will go on forever. We will never get away from it.</div>
    </p><a name="Para201953"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I understand the concern. It is certainly something we talked about and we were willing to do as a government.

Just recently I was on a tour throughout the western part of my riding, some 900 kilometres on the road. We held open houses and discussions and allowed people to come in and comment. There was no bias on my part. We just simply sat and listened to what people in our communities had to say about the deal.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From across the political spectrum in my region, people who vote all different ways came with absolute disappointment and dismay at the inherent basic flaws communicated in this so-called agreement which, more and more, is a sellout. I wonder if the government has any excuses or reasons for the 3,000 people who just lost their jobs in Quebec and Ontario and the families that they support.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government just seemed so desperate in its need for victory. However, in April , on the very day the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78738,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78738&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Prime Minister</A> so proudly announced the deal, the Americans were filing more lawsuits against us. The government needed a victory so badly that it left $500 million in the hands of the American coalition, which has been hurting our communities for so long, to continue to fight us. Somehow the government has twisted itself into believing that it is a good idea, that it is a good idea to get smashed over the head year in and year out. </div>
    </p><a name="Para201967"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the very end, last Friday the Court of International Trade found again for Canada, which is the final place for this decision to go, and Canadians need to know that. There is nowhere else to go for the coalition. However, the government has taken that victory away, has handed the Americans half a million bucks to beat us up some more later and has signed a deal that offers no certainty whatsoever.</div>
    </p><a name="Para201968"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I know members from the Conservative benches care for their communities, especially those members who have softwood industries in their ridings. I call upon them to stand in their place today and defend the principles of the bill because they need to be accountable. We have heard so much talk about accountability from the Conservative benches but when we come to a deal like this politics trumps common sense. Why would we leave a half a billion dollars behind for an industry that is dedicated to fighting against any notion of free trade?</div>
    </p><a name="Para201969"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The climate for investment in Canada has been destroyed by this deal. Why would an operator who operates on both sides of our borders have any notion of putting money into a mill in Canada when all they need to do is take their money back, place it into a U.S. mill and avoid a self-imposed tariff altogether? I have yet to hear an answer from the government.</div>
    </p><a name="Para201970"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have spoken to the mill managers and the people on the line and they do not get it. They do not understand why the provincial government in Victoria, British Columbia is so keen on raising the export of raw logs thereby raising the export of British Columbian jobs to other places. When I am in my riding I see the trucks drive right past the mills that have shut down and dump the logs in the water, boom them up and send them south.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For heaven's sake, this so-called deal says to a producer, says to a manufacturer, “Do not invest in Canada. It is much smarter to invest in the United States or just about anywhere else, because if you invest in Canada and you value add to any of the wood that Canadians produce, you will be hit with a tariff of up to 24% on your cost of production”. </div>
    </p><a name="Para201972"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish there were someone in the government who could simply answer that basic sense of economic disequilibrium that has been created by the government's one action, the tendency, the nature and the drive for industry to no longer invest in our country at a time when we have lost over 10,000 jobs in this sector. It is not as if we have any more blood to give. We have already given at work and at home. There is no space left in the industry other than its complete collapse. </div>
    </p><a name="Para201973"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The true and deep concern I have in this debate is that for the government to secure some sort of improved relations with our American neighbours, which we all want to see, for that so-called victory it has signed a deal that allows Washington to interfere with provincial regulations on how we cut our own wood. This House of Commons does not have that right constitutionally but somehow we have just cut a deal that allows Washington to comment on our own forestry practices at the provincial level.</div>
    </p><a name="Para201974"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many communities have been through so much, with thousands of jobs lost. I would invite members in this place to take a tour through my community and visit those places that have in excess of 90% unemployment. I wonder if anyone in this place can conceive of that in their hometowns, to go back home next week and find 80%, 85%, 90% of the people willing to work in their communities gone, simply unable to work. Imagine the social devastation, never mind the economics, we know that: schools closing down and hospitals no longer able to operate at a time when industries needed the support.</div>
    </p><a name="Para201975"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Conservatives were with us for a moment when we pleaded for loan guarantees for the industry but the previous government was unable to deliver. The Court of International Trade, the last place for the scoundrels who perpetuated this fraud upon Canadians and Canadian communities were heard, the court sided with Canada. Canada has sent our lawyers down to plead on behalf of the American cause. We are asking the court not to settle this case, to not award the entire $5.4 billion to Canada because we have this incredible deal that gives us foreign change, and which, by the way, perpetuates trade wars into the future.</div>
    </p><a name="Para201976"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not only remarkable that $500 million will end up in the coffers of the U.S. coalition's war chest to fight again, but it sends a disturbing signal to other industries that try to compete with Canada. What we are saying is that the Americans were right. They must have been right because why else would we leave money behind? We must subsidize our industry. </div>
    </p><a name="Para201977"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Conservative members have stood in this place and made the argument that no, there is no softwood subsidy and we are not operating a subsidized system. However, by capitulating to them we are saying that they are right. If the Americans were able to end up with this much of the Canadian industries' money, we must be subsidizing. This opens up the floodgates to other industries that cannot compete.</div>
    </p><a name="Para201978"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I only wish we could have some form of free trade. The lie has finally been put to that concept of free trade in this country. We only need to look at the way the Americans have handled themselves and the way that Canada has now decided to place itself in such an incredible position as to harm Canadian industry and communities by simply admitting, through this deal, that we must have a subsidized industry, and by putting in jeopardy all the other industries in Canada that now must try to compete with the Americans who we know are protectionists. We have seen it. The Conservatives just said so, and it is true. They will subsidize and they will protect. They will try to offer unfair competition to our industries, particularly in an industry like softwood where we know the Americans cannot compete.</div>
    </p><a name="Para201979"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canadian mills are the most efficient in the world. I have those mills in my riding. I have visited those mills and we have talked to the foremen and the people running the shop. They know that they are running the best. All they want is a fair playing field and an opportunity to compete but instead they will be hit with a 24% duty on their wood. We are going to self-impose a duty when we have said that we are not subsidizing and that we are operating a fair game.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The problems with this deal go on and on. A lot of Conservative members would like to ignore the fact that there is an actual cap on the amount of wood that can be produced. However, it is not done by company but by region. We have also assisted some of the larger companies that have the capacity to invest more money against some of the smaller ones because as soon as the cap is reached it hits everybody in that region. It does not hit the individual company that may have flooded a market. It hits everybody. Suddenly the cap goes up. The tipping point on this, the point where the tariffs start to be imposed, the price of a board foot of lumber has been below the trigger point for months. </div>
    </p><a name="Para201981"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is an opportunity for the government to finally stand up and admit some of the absolute flaws in this agreement. We each need to stand up and represent our communities, which is what we were sent here to do. We were sent here to represent the people who work every day or who are trying to get back to work. We need to get the job done and get a better deal because this deal sells our communities and our future down the river.</div>

Not only is it one of the most beautiful areas in Canada but it has some of the hardest working people in those mills and in forestry and, I may say, in many ways in a very environmentally sustainable way because they know the future relies on their jobs in those mills. </div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is sad to see a number of businesses in small towns like Fraser Lake, Burns Lake, et cetera, closing down or reducing the number of employment opportunities which has caused people to go elsewhere.

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have been here for nine and a half years now and I have seen and heard of countless numbers of farm families shutting their farms down and the large corporate companies taking over. I have seen many fishing communities, like the one in Canso, Nova Scotia, literally shut down and thousands of people having to move away from their homes. </div>
    </p><a name="Para201985"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the last week alone 3,000 jobs have been lost in the lumber industry under the watch of Liberal and Conservative governments. It is a pattern. It does not matter which industry it is, farming, fishing or forestry, which I call the three <i>f</i>'s that built this country, they are being decimated by the government.</div>

We have watched mill upon mill get bought up. It almost seems like in the last five years, in this particular plight of industry as more and more tariffs were slapped onto Canadian companies, more and more of those sawmills were either shut down or bought outright. When they are bought, it is not as if business continues as usual. Anybody who has been at the bottom end of a consolidation knows what that means. It means job losses. It means losses to entire communities.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If anyone in the Conservative benches would actually like to stand and debate some of these issues about what is going on in northwestern British Columbia, I would urge them to do so, but the interest seems to have been lost. The air is out of the balloon. </div>
    </p><a name="Para201990"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Conservatives just want this thing to coast through and not actually address the concerns of mill owners I just talked to this past week. They said, “What's the point?” They have been struggling to get their mills up and running and were finally able to do it after some months. Then they looked on the horizon and they saw more dark clouds mounting. The clouds were a self-imposed tariff on their industry. Why? Because George Bush needed a deal and the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78738,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78738&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2"> Prime Minister</A> wanted it so bad he could not wait. </div>
    </p><a name="Para201991"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He could not wait after this many years to look at the decision by the Court of International Trade. The court said, “It's all yours Canada. You were right. These communities were right to survive and thrive on the industry that they had built”. </div>

    </p><a name="Para201993"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As parliamentarians, as people who are elected, we have to go back and look those people in the eye. We cannot have what happened to the Atlantic fishery. All those parliamentarians over the years turned a blind eye to what we knew was happening while the federal government shirked its responsibilities. The cries that came out from those communities that needed a sustainable industry fell on deaf ears. Now, we are watching a repetition of this in the softwood industry. It is an absolute disgrace. </div>
    </p><a name="Para201994"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We try our best to look through the legislation, to read this deal, which I have done, and which I hope and pray that the Conservatives at least have done in their blind support for this thing. I cannot find one scintilla of enthusiasm for investing and reinvigorating our softwood industry.</div>
    </p><a name="Para201995"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Instead, we have a $12 million cut to a beetle fund that would help mitigate what was going on with the pine beetle outbreak in British Columbia. That was the answer: sell them out down the river one day and pull back funding to help communities transition the next. That is hardly supportive of rural Canada. We are going to have to switch governments as soon as possible.</div>

It seemed like he was making an argument for the United States to comply with the court decisions that were made in the softwood lumber dispute. He was making that argument very clearly. </div>
    </p><a name="Para202002"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sadly, it seems he has reversed his position completely now. It seems he was actually calling for us to fall in line with the desires of the American industry, the American government and the American protectionists. It is a very sad turnabout and a very dramatic one. It is a capitulation to those interests that have been working so hard to destroy the Canadian industry and with it Canadian communities and Canadian jobs. </div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is so ironic that the<A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78738,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78738&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2"> Prime Minister</A>'s reversal comes at a time when a just and fair victory for Canada was in sight. It has been said many times that this agreement and this legislation actually snatches defeat from the jaws of victory. That is exactly what is happening here. </div>
    </p><a name="Para202004"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, the victory that Canada was on the verge of has been lost because of this proposal and this legislation. That is why it is a bad deal for Canada, a bad deal for British Columbia, and certainly a bad deal for my home riding of <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78519,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78519&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Burnaby—Douglas</A>. </div>
    </p><a name="Para202005"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ironies continue. It was just last Friday afternoon that another court case was decided in Canada's favour. That case before the U.S. Court of International Trade, CIT, found in Canada's favour. That court said that every last penny of the $5.3 billion of illegally imposed duties on softwood lumber exports over the years had to be returned to Canada. That money was taken from Canadian companies, Canadian communities and Canadian workers. That court said every last cent had to be returned. This was just last Friday where there was yet another victory in the courts.</div>
    </p><a name="Para202006"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indeed, we were running out of court opportunities. We were getting down to the wire on every last one of them. Incredibly, it was Canada's Ambassador to the United States, Michael Wilson, when he was before committee this summer who said the opportunities for court action on this were coming to an end. We were absolutely on the verge of a wholesale victory on this issue in the courts. Unfortunately, that has all been thrown by the wayside by this agreement and this legislation.</div>
    </p><a name="Para202007"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to come back to the speech I had hoped to deliver the first time around and some of the points that I did not have time to talk about. </div>
    </p><a name="Para202008"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If this is such a great deal for Canada and for the Canadian industry, I have to wonder why page after page of this bill is devoted to punitive measures to punish Canadian businesses that do not comply or do not agree with this legislation. If this was such a great deal for Canada and for Canadian businesses and communities, why has such emphasis been placed on punitive measures in the legislation?</div>
    </p><a name="Para202009"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was surprised to hear in this House last month a Conservative member from Atlantic Canada say that the government would have to pursue an amendment to its own legislation because the wording of the maintenance of the Maritime lumber exemption was not strong enough or clear enough, and did not actually use the word “exemption”. </div>
    </p><A NAME="T1615"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1615"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1620"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1610"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1615">(1615)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para202010"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is hard to believe that on a part of this whole controversy where there is absolute agreement in every corner of this House around the need to maintain the Atlantic Canada exemption, that the government could not even get the wording right in this legislation on that aspect of the bill. It could not even get it right when everyone agrees how important that is. It could not get it right when its representatives from Atlantic Canada were so involved to maintain this exemption.</div>
    </p><a name="Para202011"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think that is another example of how bad this bill really is. If there is a point where there is no controversy, where there is a clear agreement and where the language has been accepted for some time, why that language could not even make it into this legislation is beyond me. If the government cannot do it on that front, what is happening on the other clauses that are more controversial and more complicated?</div>
    </p><a name="Para202012"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another important flaw in this legislation is that it does nothing to address the serious issue of the export of raw logs. One observer of the forest industry in British Columbia, and someone who has carefully poured over the agreement and the 82 page appendices to the agreement, notes that this legislation goes out of its way to be specific about what is covered, about what aspects of the softwood lumber industry are covered. In fact, he says it is dizzying in its specificity. He also says:</div>

</div>
    </p><a name="Para202014"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is all very well, but not once in this agreement and in this legislation does the word “log” appear. We know that the export of raw logs is a serious issue facing the industry. It is certainly a serious issue for the industry in British Columbia.</div>
    </p><a name="Para202015"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To fail to close a loophole around the export of raw logs from private lands is a huge failure. It gives raw logs from private lands a competitive edge over logs processed, for instance, in British Columbia.</div>
    </p><a name="Para202016"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This will discourage value added production and jobs in B.C. and will stimulate more raw log exports to the United States where workers will process them. It robs Canada and Canadian workers of opportunities and jobs. Jim Sinclair, the president of the B.C. Federation of Labour, has pointed out that:</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we add those jobs lost to raw log exports, as the president of the B.C.

It is quite hilarious how the Liberals are still so heartbroken. It was the decision of Canadians to toss them out of office. It was not the NDP that ended their reign of power. It was the Canadian people who did that, and they did that rather resoundingly in some cases. They should never forget that Canadians made that decision, not the folks who sit in this corner of the House.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We know that the provisions of the deal mean we are giving $1 billion of that illegally collected money to the United States, $500 million which goes to the association that launched the attack on the Canadian industry.

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is also ironic that we are giving $500 million to the White House to use as it will.

We are already beginning to see some of the results of this play itself out in the thousands and thousands of jobs that are disappearing. Communities are being affected across the country, particularly my region of northern Ontario.</div>
    </p><a name="Para202039"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before I get to that, I want to share this with the folks who are watching. What we are involved with this afternoon is really a process of closure, or ending debate in the House. The government saw that we, as a party, were very concerned about the impact of the agreement on our constituents. It knew we would to speak to it for as long as it took to get all our thoughts on the record and to challenge the government as effectively as we could. This place is all about that. We are here to ask the government to consider amendments to a bill that might improve it and make it better.</div>
    </p><a name="Para202040"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, the government brought in closure. It forced votes in the House on an amendment we brought forward. It forced votes in the House on an amendment the Liberals brought forward. Now we are at a point where there will be no further amendments or opportunities for us, as elected members of the House, to bring forward suggestions that might make the bill, or agreement, better, if that is possible, or to speak on behalf of our constituents in that way.</div>
    </p><a name="Para202041"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are here in this place on Tuesday afternoon, speaking to a bill which the government wants to ram it through. That has been the government's approach to this from the very beginning. The minister was brought across the floor from the Liberals, I suppose because he had some history and some experience with this, to find a way to put together a deal with the Americans, a deal which ignores all the legal decisions made over a number of months and years in our favour. I guess it has been done to curry favour with the Americans. When the governing party was in opposition, there was a sense that the relationship with that country was not as good as it would like it to have been.</div>
    </p><a name="Para202042"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I served for 13 years in the Ontario provincial legislature at Queen's Park. I remember this very same closure procedure being used over and over again. From 1995 to 2003, the Conservative government introduced motion after motion. This changed the landscape of that province. The current government is beside itself now on how it can recover some of the wonderful programs that had been put in place, over a number of years, by varying political stripes. These programs improved the lot of communities, families and people. They were put in place to protect industry and the economy of various regions and to turn the province into an industrial heartland, which was the envy of the rest of the country. The Conservatives turned it into a province that is now struggling from one day to the next to support education, health care and all those programs that we know are necessary if we are meet the challenge of participating in the new global economy.</div>
    </p><a name="Para202043"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I remember Thursday afternoons because I was usually on duty. Some of my colleagues and I would spend a couple of hours in the legislature debating a closure motion. We are not debating a closure motion here, but the process that we are engaged in is in fact a process of closure.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One cannot be anything but disappointed that the members of the Conservative Party are not standing to speak on behalf of their constituents. They know as well as we do the impact this is having on them. </div>
    </p><a name="Para202045"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since a lot of them come from rural and northern Canada, within their constituencies, they must have small communities that are being affected dramatically and negatively by this agreement. They must be affected by the government's unwillingness to support the industry in its legal challenges, challenges that were successful and within a whisker of forcing the issue of making the free trade agreement work. Many of us had some concerns about the free trade agreement when it was first brought in, but we learned to work with it in the interests of our industry and jurisdictions. </div>
    </p><a name="Para202046"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Conservatives have not taken the time in this place to get up and speak to this agreement. They are not taking the time to talk on behalf of their constituents and communities that are being hammered. Even if it does not affect people directly, it sets a precedent. It creates a pattern. It sends a message on how the government will stand up and fight for other interests for a region that is resource based. </div>
    </p><a name="Para202047"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not have to look any further than what is going in western Canada right now with regard to the Canadian Wheat Board. This is a vehicle that farmers themselves decided to put together, fund and run in order to get the best value for their investments, for the work they put in and for the products they produced. The Wheat Board has been a successful vehicle over a number of years now. Literally thousands of farmers, who are behind the Wheat Board and support it, are aghast that the government is being so aggressive in doing away with it. They are surprised.</div>
    </p><a name="Para202048"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I attended a meeting in Saskatoon this summer of some 250 to 300 farmers. It was held across the street from a very secretive closed door meeting, by invitation only, of supporters of the government who saw this as their opportunity to do in a vehicle that they had ideological differences with for quite some time. The farmers I met with said that nobody was speaking for them. Nobody was bringing their voice to this place to challenge the government on doing away with the very vehicle they put in place to protect their interests, investments and products and to be able sell them for highest value in the marketplace.</div>
    </p><a name="Para202049"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am disappointed that Conservatives are not standing up to speak on behalf of the communities involved in forestry. I am disappointed they do not recognize the impact of this on those communities. In my own area of Algoma in northern Ontario, people pick up the newspaper every day to see that another mill has closed down somewhere, whether it is Nairn Centre, Espanola, Dubreuilville, White River. The list goes on and on. That is just northeastern Ontario. </div>
    </p><a name="Para202050"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In northwestern Ontario it is even worse. NDP members met with the leaders of northwestern Ontario a couple of weeks ago when we were in Thunder Bay for our caucus retreat. They shared with us the very devastating reality that confronts them every day. The forestry coalition and leaderships of those communities talked about mill closings. They said that when a mill closed, they would lose population, the value of property would go down and nobody wanted to set up shop. There is instability and no confidence any more in those communities. People do not want to invest in a small business because they do not know what the future will be. It is up in the air.</div>
    </p><a name="Para202051"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hear from people in the communities in my area and in northwestern Ontario. I am surprised Conservative members are not speaking on behalf of their regions, communities or people because they have to be experiencing the same thing. It cannot be just in northern Ontario, northeastern Ontario or northwestern Ontario. I know it is happening in other areas. Members of my caucus, who have spoken on behalf of their constituents and communities, have said that this is already having a devastating effect.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I say never mind looking at the past in terms of this, which is bad enough; let us look for a second at the future. If this agreement continues and the Americans continue to have the kind of control they have and we keep shipping product into the United States at a cost that makes it uncompetitive, how will we ever add value to anything we do? How will we have a future?</div>
    </p><a name="Para202053"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is my concern. That is why I am so disappointed this afternoon that we find ourselves in this process of closure on this important agreement and piece of public business.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the context of this softwood lumber agreement, could the member for Sault Ste.

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I know that many of the communities in northern Ontario are suffering from the impacts of the spin-offs from softwood lumber.

It is the kind of question that I was hoping the Conservatives would ask or maybe make a speech about. Everybody knows that in resource based communities, for every one job in the primary sector, there are three or four jobs in the support or service sector. The member is absolutely right when she says that when one of those jobs goes, those other jobs go as well. People then are left behind. They have no work or they have to leave town and leave their families behind, who then live in poverty.</div>
    </p><a name="Para202058"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We used to have a social safety net in this country. We used to have employment insurance that worked for people. We used to have social welfare that actually worked for people, but the incursion of this very cold right wing wind that has come into Canada and Ontario over the last 10 or 15 years has made it such that the safety net has been rent asunder. It is not there any more. </div>
    </p><a name="Para202059"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only about 15% or 20% of people who have paid into EI all their lives now qualify for EI when it is their turn to collect for a little while when they are in between jobs. EI is not there. As well, in just the last couple of weeks, the government cut literacy programs, which would have been helpful for these workers as they try to shift gears and get into other work.</div>
    </p><a name="Para202060"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for welfare, in 1995 Mike Harris cut welfare by 21.6% for the poorest of our families and our most at risk and marginalized citizens. </div>
    </p><a name="Para202061"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us put all of that together: this terrible agreement, plus the impact when plants close and people lose their jobs, plus the multiplier effect with the fact that we no longer have the social safety net that all of us worked so hard to put in place. Then we begin to understand the devastation and the poverty that now exist and will continue to exist.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to start by talking about a couple of things. One is how tirelessly the member for <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78654,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78654&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Burnaby—New Westminster</A> has worked on this file. One of the things the member has called for is public hearings in which a committee could go out and hear from people from coast to coast to coast. I think it is a grave failing that this has not happened. </div>
    </p><a name="Para202074"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That process would have allowed industry, workers, communities and first nations to talk about the very real impact in their own communities. It would have talked about what it is like to be faced with either already lost jobs or the looming prospect of job loss.</div>
    </p><a name="Para202075"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It would have provided the committee with an opportunity to hear from municipal councils concerned about the fact that many of our smaller communities in British Columbia are heavily reliant on the forestry sector for their municipal tax base. It would have allowed the committee members to hear directly from council members and from citizens of those communities about what it feels like in their own communities to be worried about their municipal infrastructure being at risk because of the fact that their tax base is threatened.</div>
    </p><a name="Para202076"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think it is a great loss for committee members and for the House not to get that on the ground experience from community members.</div>
    </p><a name="Para202077"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I think the other glaring omission in this piece of legislation, and on the current Conservative government's part, is the fact that there are not adequate funds to address the transition currently happening in the forestry sector. Many forestry workers have already lost their jobs. There is a very real need for education and training funds, for pension bridging, for assistance to older workers who may not be able to find employment, and for some recognition that many workers will also need assistance in relocating to other communities. We need an active transition fund in place.</div>
    </p><a name="Para202078"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There used to be a program called industrial adjustment, which worked closely with industry, labour and communities when communities were going through transitions. The federal government cut that very good program a number of years ago. There is now no mechanism to get that kind of community driven process. It is the community driven process that can talk about the problems in the community and identify the very concrete solutions that will make a difference.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other piece that is missing is the whole issue around loan guarantees to industry. We know industry is suffering right now with the lack of certainty in the softwood lumber field. It was incumbent on the past Liberal government and certainly is on the current Conservative government to look for a loan guarantee program that would help industry over this very difficult period. Because no matter what, whether this agreement goes through or not, by the time industry gets cheques in their hands, some of these industry players will already have closed their doors. Then where will the help be for communities suffering from the transition?</div>
    </p><a name="Para202080"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are a couple of other issues I want to touch on in today's debate. I am sure other members have quoted from the article I will mention, but I have a direct link to my own community about this. It says that the softwood deal will spur more raw log exports. It is an article written by Ben Parfitt from the Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives. He says:</div>

</tr>
</table>
</div>
    </p><a name="Para202082"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is a “dizzying” list, he says. He talks specifically about a glaring omission:</div>

      <div>
        <table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
          <tr valign="top">
            <td width="15" align="right"></td>
<td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>Throughout the appendix, however, one searches in vain for the word “logs”. Yet the on-again, off-again dispute with the US has always been about how provincial governments price publicly owned trees, not whether they somehow underwrote the costs of specific manufacturing processes.</small></td>

</table>
</div>
    </p><a name="Para202084"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Later on in the article he talks about a “flash forward”. This is really critical for my riding:</div>
    </p><a name="Para202085"></a><p>
      <div>
        <table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
          <tr valign="top">
            <td width="15" align="right"></td>
<td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>Flash forward. Despite the policy changes, the US insists with the current deal on capping our market access. And Canada and BC--to their lasting discredit--have agreed. Once the caps are exceeded, costly export taxes kick in. Except, that is, on logs. Now look at BC's coast. One company--Western Forest Products--directly controls nearly half the logs on public forestlands. It, along with other coastal companies, already has log export approvals from the province.</small></td>

</div>
    </p><a name="Para202087"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have raised that issue because in my riding raw log exports have been a major, major problem for a number of years. There has been a valiant and diligent group of people called the Youbou Timberless Society, a group that sprung up as a result of the Youbou mill closing four years ago. A great number of the people from the Youbou mill never did find permanent full time employment again, which has had an incredible effect on the community of Youbou and the surrounding area of the Cowichan Valley.</div>
    </p><a name="Para202088"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the chief proponents behind the Youbou Timberless Society is a man by the name of Ken James. These people have been working very hard over a number of years to raise the awareness of the impact of raw log exports on our community and other communities on Vancouver Island and in British Columbia. They decided to count the number of trucks that were leaving the area with logs. They did a tally on Highway 18, between Lake Cowichan and Duncan, and tallied 157 logging trucks in 10 hours.</div>
    </p><a name="Para202089"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Over four days, from 6:30 a.m. until 4:30 p.m., Youbou Timberless Society members counted slightly less than 1,000 trucks in my riding, 1,000 trucks loaded with logs. Not all of them were leaving the riding, but many of them were leaving the riding with logs to be processed somewhere else.</div>
    </p><a name="Para202090"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where is the responsibility to our community to make sure that the resources from our community are processed closer to home, producing jobs so that people can support their families and pay taxes? As we know, people who make a good dollar actually pay taxes and are the ones who fuel our economy. They are the ones who make sure our hospitals and our schools stay open. They are the ones who make sure our roads get paved. It seems reasonable and fair that we actually look for ways to make sure that we process the resources from our proud province and from our grand country of Canada as close to home as possible.</div>
    </p><a name="Para202091"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Later on in that same article, again quoting James, statistics quoted show a corresponding rise in raw log exports from about a half a million cubic metres in the early 1990s to an annual three million cubic metres since the provincial Liberals took power in 2001. That is an outrageous increase in resources leaving our community and our province. That is a direct loss of jobs and of quality of life.</div>
    </p><a name="Para202092"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the other items that is omitted, really, in this softwood lumber agreement is first nations. On August 10, the First Nations Leadership Council wrote a letter about the Canada-United States softwood lumber agreement, stating: </div>
    </p><a name="Para202093"></a><p>
      <div>
        <table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
          <tr valign="top">
            <td width="30" align="right"></td>
<td><small>--the new SLA [softwood lumber agreement] makes only one reference to First Nations in Article XVII anti-circumvention item 2.(f)...payments or other compensation to First Nations for the purposes of addressing or settling claims....</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</div>
    </p><a name="Para202094"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is it. That is the only mention of first nations in the softwood lumber agreement.</div>
    </p><a name="Para202095"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is an important issue in British Columbia, because of course in British Columbia, as many members of this House are well aware, there are extensive treaty negotiations under way. Some of them have been under way for decades and one can only dream that they would actually get settled in our lifetime.</div>
    </p><a name="Para202096"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fact is that there are these treaty negotiations under way and many of them are not nearly close to being settled. The leadership council had asked, given the new relationships and transformative change accord and a number of other unresolved land questions, that there be some consideration in the softwood lumber agreement, and in discussions leading up to it, of the impact on first nations in British Columbia. Of course that was not done. There seems little opportunity at this point in time to do it.</div>
    </p><a name="Para202097"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is one of the things that public hearings would have helped to address. It would have given first nations leadership an opportunity to appear before the standing committee to talk about the impact on their communities.</div>
    </p><a name="Para202098"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I urge this House to reject this flawed agreement. I urge this House to look for creative solutions which would ensure that our communities stay healthy and viable, that we retain the right to process our resources close to home and that we retain the say over our industry.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is so ironic that in this House the Conservative government has berated our leader for cutting and running in Afghanistan, yet at home we see the same Conservative government cutting and running on this issue. I find that to be logically inconsistent and much like the rest of the government's debate on this issue.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This deal declares open season on any Canadian industry that the U.S. wants to target with illegal tariffs. The U.S. knows that it will be rewarded. The Conservatives are as bad as the Liberals were in caving in to American interests. I remember when the Liberals came to power in the early 1990s they said that they were not going to go along with NAFTA. What did the Liberals do as soon as they were elected to power? They went along with it. They definitely went along with it. The Liberals went along with a lot of those types of arrangements which for instance are now driving our energy industry and which are harmful in the long term to our economy.</div>

Nothing but shreds remain of a guarantee of an end to arbitrary U.S. tariffs, yet the takeover of our industries continues apace, from retail to beef, from manufacturing to energy.</div>
    </p><a name="Para202122"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NAFTA prohibits the imposition of an export tax on energy or on basic petrochemicals that exceed those applicable to domestic consumption. That is article 605(b). When coupled with quantitative control prohibitions of GATT article XI, this ban on export taxation effectively and entirely removes government control of energy exports. </div>
    </p><a name="Para202123"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not long ago we had a made in Canada price for energy, Canadian oil and gas companies were the primary people in the industry, and a 25 year reserve of gas was set aside for Canada's future needs. That is no longer the case. </div>
    </p><a name="Para202124"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The impact of the Alliance pipeline on our gas industry was huge. Yes, it brought immediate wealth to Alberta and British Columbia, but it also exported all the liquids that we need for our petrochemical industry in Edmonton, in the heartland of our oil and gas industry, and now we are short of those. We will see plant shutdowns soon. Just like the export of raw logs, when we export raw energy, as the Alliance pipeline does, down to factories in Chicago, we are exporting jobs south of the border. We are taking them out of the Canadian perspective.</div>
    </p><a name="Para202125"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No other country in the world in a time of peace has signed away so completely its energy resources, present and future. Canada, interestingly enough, is the only NAFTA country prevented by the energy exporting provisions in NAFTA. Four years ago the U.S. adopted a national energy policy that emphasized national energy security, self-sufficiency and even support for domestically owned firms. Canada, meanwhile, is required by NAFTA to continue exporting oil and gas to the U.S., even if it experiences shortages.</div>
    </p><a name="Para202126"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The interesting development was the liquefied natural gas terminals in Quebec where the company is talking about security of supply with two forms of energy, but when we look at the company's plan, the natural gas that is flowing to Quebec right now will be diverted to the United States once the LNG terminals are in place. Where is the security in that?</div>
    </p><a name="Para202127"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Mexican energy sector under the agreement does not parallel that between Canada and the U.S. because Mexico protected its energy industry. Mexico's actions are given respect in the United States. To quote from the U.S. national energy task force report, “Mexico will make its own sovereign decisions on the breadth, pace and extent to which it will expand and reform its electricity, oil and gas capacity”.</div>
    </p><a name="Para202128"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Integrating our energy and our economy into that of the U.S. means it is subject to U.S. ownership, decisions, priorities and prices. That is exactly what the softwood lumber deal means to our forest industry. The pattern continues. It was started by the Liberals and is continued by the Conservatives. Let us not wait until our industries and agriculture become completely uncompetitive, until Canadians are left begging for their own energy at 40° below. We need to really look at this deal very carefully. This deal represents a further step down that slippery slope that leads to deep integration of our economies and the loss of Canadian sovereignty, jobs and a secure resource base.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a northerner, I probably live further away from the U.S. border than most people in this chamber. I feel secure in some ways there, but I do not feel secure when I come into this House of Commons and see the people who are representing Canada making decisions for short term benefit and political gain, and forgetting the long term implications to this country and to our sovereignty, which our fathers, grandfathers and great-grandfathers fought to first obtain and then continue to uphold.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;John Diefenbaker would be turning over in his grave right now if he knew what these Conservatives were doing to our country. They are following the Liberal pattern. The Liberals were great at continentalism, always have been. Now all of a sudden we have them all together. I hope Canadians in the next election really realize that we have Tweedledee and Tweedledum when it comes to protecting Canadian sovereignty in this country.</div>

    </p><a name="Para202134"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wanted to ask him about the $1 billion in illegally collected levies that we give up under the provisions of this deal, that we pass on to the Americans for their use. We have already talked earlier this afternoon about the money that goes to the U.S. Coalition for Fair Lumber Imports to pursue its protectionist ways, but the other half of that $1 billion goes directly to the White House.</div>
    </p><a name="Para202135"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ostensibly, it is for educational and charitable causes in timber-reliant communities, initiatives related to low income housing and disaster relief, and education and public interest projects addressing forest management issues, but it has been reported widely, and many of us I think agree, that this is really just a slush fund for electing more republican protectionists to Congress in the United States.</div>
    </p><a name="Para202136"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is rather ironic that Canada would agree to establishing that kind of slush fund for the Bush White House, to elect more members to Congress who believe in the things that they believe in. I wonder if the member for Western Arctic might comment on that.</div>
    </p><a name="Para202137"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also think it is rather ironic, and I have used that word a number of times this afternoon, that in the course of this deal there is half a billion dollars for support to American forestry communities, apparently, but there is absolutely nothing in here for support to Canadian communities that have been so devastated by this agreement and by this attack on our industry.</div>

That is the amount of illegally imposed duties of our softwood exports over the years. Again, we won. </div>
    </p><a name="Para202154"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why would the government sellout Canadian manufacturers and communities, and capitulate to the pressure of the U.S. government and the lumber lobbyists? Why did the government snatch defeat from the jaws of victory?</div>
    </p><a name="Para202155"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fact is that the recent court ruling, which I might add came only last Friday, is rendered a moot point due to this bad softwood lumber agreement. This agreement should go down in the history of Canada as one very shameful moment for the government. We just gave away $1 billion. I guess it is just one more way the government trims the fat. It seems to like to do that. Its rush to appease the U.S. lumber lobbyists has sold out ordinary Canadians, especially those who live and work in forest dependent communities.</div>
    </p><a name="Para202156"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other irony about all of this is that about $500 million of Canadian money will go to the U.S. That is $.5 billion to the Coalition for Fair Lumber Imports. This money will most likely be used to rekindle the coalition, which is failing, and at some point in the future we will have to fight the U.S. again and it will be with our money. </div>
    </p><a name="Para202157"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It will be using our money to fight us. It is a sad irony. What a sellout. Why would anyone agree to this when it is our duty as members of Parliament to stand up for our constituencies and communities, all of whom happen to be Canadian? They are in our ridings. </div>
    </p><a name="Para202158"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me provide a few other reasons why this is a bad deal, besides the fact that it is based on a falsehood that Canadian softwood lumber industries are subsidized. This falsehood was exposed and rejected in every NAFTA and U.S. commercial court ruling that clearly sided with Canadian industry.</div>
    </p><a name="Para202159"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another reason this is a bad deal is that it can be cancelled unilaterally at any time. It does not go on for seven years. It could last only two years or even 18 months and does not provided stability and predictability to the Canadian softwood lumber industry. This deal constrains trade unreasonably by applying punitive tariffs and quotas that hinder the flexibility of the Canadian softwood industry. </div>
    </p><a name="Para202160"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to talk about a small flooring manufacturing company in my riding that is devastated by this agreement. It has told me it is going to be losing over $300,000 a year in revenues because it cannot find a way under this deal as it stands to do business with the U.S. It is going to be shut out. It is a small company and is going to lose out because of this deal.</div>
    </p><A NAME="T1720"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1720"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1725"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1715"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1720">(1720)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para202161"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It will be the dozen or so people who work in small businesses in my community who will probably lose their jobs if this deal goes ahead. Small businesses are very concerned about their future. It is a bad deal because it does not respect small businesses.</div>
    </p><a name="Para202162"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The deal kills the credibility of the NAFTA dispute settlement mechanism. Canada won in the courts but by negotiating away all of those wins we have put the dispute mechanism in jeopardy. We might as well say that we did not need it. We capitulate in a heartbeat.</div>
    </p><a name="Para202163"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It sets a bad precedent, not only for the softwood lumber industry, but also for other industrial sectors in this country. If the government can capitulate to the Americans on softwood, what can it do in other sectors that are governed by NAFTA? Will we see this again in other industries? It is a bad deal.</div>
    </p><a name="Para202164"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The deal does nothing for the thousands of workers who have lost their livelihoods over the past five years. My colleagues and I in the NDP called for loan guarantees from the government so that the industries in our communities could get through this and maintain some of the workers. However, that did not happen. Many of the industries had to lay off workers and many are now gone because of this deal. We also see a further job loss through consolidation caused by the quotas and export taxes. </div>
    </p><a name="Para202165"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have another reason for talking about this agreement. This softwood lumber agreement creates an incentive for exporting raw logs. I live on Vancouver Island and I when I drive up and down the Island highway I see truckload after truckload of raw logs leaving the Island and going to a log dump. We used to have a lot of small mills, mills that were the backbone and the lifeblood of so many small communities. These mills kept those communities going because the logs were tied to the communities. This is not happening any more. This deal does nothing to stop these logs from being exported out of our communities and out of the country. The logs are being processed offshore and in the U.S. Those are family supporting jobs that we have lost in our communities. That is not standing up for our communities.</div>
    </p><a name="Para202166"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This continued export of raw logs has to stop. I have spoken about this in my communities and everywhere I go people agree that this is something that has to end. For that reason alone, I would think that people would not support this deal.</div>
    </p><a name="Para202167"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This deal does not provide effective protection for Atlantic Canada. The softwood lumber agreement has a fundamental and irreversible impact on the ability of Canada to defend itself within NAFTA and the United States commercial court system. The agreement makes everyone substantially more vulnerable, notwithstanding the Atlantic exemption. The renewal of the exemption is not a guarantee against failure in the future. The Atlantic provinces are still vulnerable to subsidy allegations. There will be nothing to stop the U.S. from alleging that Atlantic Canadians are not living up to this deal.</div>
    </p><a name="Para202168"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a bad deal because I know much of the industry was not on side. It was pressured into supporting this deal and a lot of bullying tactics went on. Many industries felt forced into signing on to this deal. A lot of them actually did not sign on, but were pressured anyway. I am really standing up for those people in those industries, for the workers in our communities and for the communities in my riding and across this country that will be devastated by this deal.</div>

    </p><a name="Para202194"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One highlight of his ongoing advocacy includes his private member's bill, Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',1508188,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=1508188&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-313</A>, from the 38th Parliament. That bill would have amended the Criminal Code to raise the age of consent from 14 to 16 years of age. Although that particular legislation was unsuccessful, chiefly due to the previous government's opposition, it helped draw national attention to the age of consent issue and it also crystallized in the minds of many Canadians the need for a new approach in Ottawa toward criminal justice, especially where our children are concerned.</div>
    </p><a name="Para202195"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am proud to report that, unlike the previous government, this Conservative government and this <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78738,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78738&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Prime Minister</A> are committed to comprehensive criminal justice reform, including raising the age of consent between children and adults from 14 to 16 years of age.

    </p><a name="Para202196"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That brings us to the matter under debate here today, legislation which again deals with an issue important to the welfare of children. It involves difficult and emotional matters. It deals with those parts of life we do not necessarily bring up in casual conversations. When we talk about these matters we tend to do so in hushed tones, with long pauses and guarded expressions: Death and divorce.</div>
    </p><a name="Para202197"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These are not parts of life we anticipate in any great measure, only accept for we have no choice. While there is the rare exception, these events are saturated in the most wrenching of human emotions for all those involved. This is particularly true for young children. For it goes without saying that neither the break-up of a parent's marriage or the death of a parent are elements we associate with the carefree innocence of childhood.

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While death is inevitable, the end of a marriage is not, but it is today a distinct possibility. A divorce is not a flippant decision for most people. It represents the lamentable end of earlier promise. Some are mutual and amicable, others are bitter and acrimonious.</div>
    </p><a name="Para202199"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to Statistics Canada, each year approximately 70,000 couples will get a divorce. Furthermore, today almost 40% of marriages will end in divorce by the 30th wedding anniversary. I would like to say that I beat that anniversary.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again the tender of such proceedings can vary, and sometimes custody arrangements will limit the access of one parent to a child. This is not exceptional in itself for it occurs daily in courtrooms throughout the country. The exceptional occurrence, what Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2153838,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2153838&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-252</A> seeks to address, is the conditions or privileges granted to a terminally ill or a critical condition parent. The bill before us today seeks to grant such a parent access to their child in this difficult period.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Adding subsection (11) to section 16, custody orders, of the Divorce Act, the proposed subsection reads:</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to draw attention to the House a key provision drafted in that amendment which has the effect of ensuring that such access is granted provided it is in the best interests of the child involved.</div>
    </p><a name="Para202207"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Proposed subsection (11) is subject to subsection (8), which reads, “In making an order under this section, the court shall take into consideration only the best interests of the child of the marriage as determined by reference to the condition, means, needs and other circumstances of the child”. A child would consequently be shielded from possibly being returned to the custody of a parent who may have, or may again, inflict any harm upon the child. </div>
    </p><a name="Para202208"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe this provision speaks to the fact that the bill seeks to strike a proper balance between parental rights and child protection. Providing a legally entrenched avenue for a dying parent to have access to their child to say a last goodbye with the provision I just mentioned is the decent thing to do.</div>
    </p><a name="Para202209"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I cannot, nor do I wish to, imagine facing the prospect of being prevented from looking into the eyes of one's child the last time before the hour of death. More important, robbing a child of such a moment, that final reassurance everything will be all right, is not something that should be facilitated by the state.</div>
    </p><a name="Para202210"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The English poet Matthew Arnold wrote, “Truth sits upon the lips of dying men”. Most would hold this to be an intrinsic truth. As difficult as it may be to the parent and child, the period before one's expected death represents a final opportunity to impart what a mother or father holds to be true to their child.</div>
    </p><a name="Para202211"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The language of the dying is usually stripped of generalities and devoid of excess of words, especially when spoken from a parent to their child. There is typically an economy of words used, not because of a lack of things to say, but to ensure the impact of those few spoken are magnified to the fullest extent, often simply limited to three. </div>
    </p><a name="Para202212"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The anguish of a child following the death of a parent is inevitable and it is natural. As legislators we have no power or desire to avert that. However, ensuring the welfare of children is not simply limited to sheltering them from harm, but also allowing them the experiences of life.</div>

    </p><a name="Para202214"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In psychology the term “closure” refers to a state of experiencing an emotional conclusion to a difficult life event like the death of a loved one. Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2153838,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2153838&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-252</A> will not bring closure, for as the Canadian journalist Robert Fulford once argued that closure cannot be achieved consciously. One cannot arbitrarily shorten the length of time it takes to soften the edges of grief, and this is especially true for a child. But there is solace and comfort inherent to acts of finality, such as the solemn moments of farewell with a dying loved one which, with the passage of time, contribute to the process of closure.</div>

    </p><a name="Para202217"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bloc Québécois will support this bill. We are not planning to make a habit of it, but when sensible and balanced bills come along, we are always happy to cooperate, especially where private members' bills are concerned. A member can really show the full extent of his or her talent with legislation like that. In my caucus, I have always maintained that debate on private members' bills should not be limited to one hour; instead, two hours a day should be allocated to debating these bills. I think that would be one way to enhance the role of MPs.</div>
    </p><a name="Para202218"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That having been said, Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2153838,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2153838&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-252</A> deals with the Divorce Act. Members might remember that, for a long time, divorce was pretty unusual. There was even a time, long ago, when an application had to be made to the Senate or a private bill had to be introduced for a divorce to be granted. In time, divorce has become much more mainstream. In terms of division of powers, one could of course find it somewhat illogical that Quebec has jurisdiction over separation from bed and board and matters relating to civil law, but not divorce. In fact, every Quebec premier from Daniel Johnson to Jean Lesage, and from René Lévesque to Jean Charest has traditionally called for divorce to fall under the responsibility of the Government of Quebec, through its National Assembly. This way, we would have full and complete, integrated and consistent jurisdiction over family matters, even though divorce is admittedly something that is always painful for someone to go through.</div>
    </p><a name="Para202219"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What the bill introduced by our colleague from <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78882,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78882&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Lethbridge</A> proposes is to amend section 16 of the Divorce Act, which provides for custody orders. Increasingly divorces take place by mutual agreement and the divorce process is not judicialized. There are nevertheless legal and administrative matters that require court intervention. The granting of custody is one of these matters.</div>
    </p><a name="Para202220"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Section 16 of the Divorce Act says that a court of competent jurisdiction—in Quebec, this is the Superior Court—may, on application by either or both spouses or any other person, make an order respecting the custody of or the access to, or the custody and access to, any or all children of the marriage. This is subsection 1 of section 16.</div>
    </p><a name="Para202221"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Subsection 2 also says that the court may, on application by either or both spouses or by any other person, make an interim order respecting the custody of or the access to, or the custody of and access to, any or all of the children of the marriage, pending determination of the application.</div>
    </p><a name="Para202222"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What is also important is that, in our divorce legislation, the issue of the children’s interests has always been extremely central. The wish is for the courts, when deciding on shared custody, access and visitation, to do so in the light of the child’s best interests.</div>
    </p><a name="Para202223"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is extremely important jurisprudence defining what are the child’s interests with respect to his development, emotional stability, growth and education. That is why, contrary to what our fellow citizens think, custody of a child is never automatic. There is always a set of factors that must be assessed by the court. What is central are the child’s best interests.</div>
    </p><a name="Para202224"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A few years ago, this Parliament created a committee to review the whole issue of children. For the Bloc Québécois, it was the member for <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78655,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78655&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Longueuil—Pierre-Boucher</A> who sat on the committee. The committee again specified, confirmed and reconfirmed that the child’s interests, the child’s best interests with respect to his development, emotional stability, growth and education, must be central to the Divorce Act. Among the factors that a court of justice has to evaluate, this one must be paramount.</div>
    </p><A NAME="T1745"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1745"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1750"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1740"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1745">(1745)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para202225"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Subsection 16(10) of the Divorce Act states, and I believe it is worth quoting:</div>
    </p><a name="Para202226"></a><p>
      <div>
        <table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">

            <td width="15" align="right"></td>
<td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>In making an order under this section, the court shall give effect to the principle that a child of the marriage should have as much contact with each spouse as is consistent with the best interests of the child and, for that purpose, shall take into consideration the willingness of the person for whom custody is sought to facilitate such contact.</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</div>
    </p><a name="Para202227"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must therefore not assume that the courts will favour one parent over the other. It is established in our laws and set out in the legislation: we recognize that the child should maintain contact as much as possible with both parents, and that it is the responsibility of the parent who has primary custody to facilitate visiting with the other parent.</div>
    </p><a name="Para202228"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to take this opportunity to congratulate our colleague from <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78882,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78882&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Lethbridge</A> on his new responsibilities, since he was elected chair of the sugar caucus. In fact, he and I both have refineries in our ridings. The sugar industry is extremely important and we see a threat on the horizon. The previous Liberal government wanted to negotiate an agreement with Central American countries to bring in even more sugar duty free. Obviously, that creates a problem in terms of competition, particularly concerning production costs for the large refineries in our regions.

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a much better proposal in its current form and I look forward to it going to the justice committee for further discussion and perhaps improvement there, although I share the concerns of the member for <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78559,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78559&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Hochelaga</A> about the workload of the justice committee. It is extremely significant at the moment and I hope the bill gets the attention that it deserves when it goes to committee. I hope it has that opportunity.</div>
    </p><a name="Para202242"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NDP members had some serious concerns with the original bill. Our concerns stemmed mainly around the fact that it seemed to mandate a visit of a child and a terminally or critically ill parent. The language “to ensure that a spouse who was terminally ill or in critical condition is granted access to a child” was of great concern to us. That language flies in the face of the experience of Canadian jurisprudence and families who have faced the situation of divorce and visitation rights over the last many years. Children were not forced in those circumstances to make those kinds of visits, even in that circumstance.</div>
    </p><a name="Para202243"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I had concerns with the original wording, but there is some improvement now in the amendment. It clearly recognizes the importance of the best interests of the child in consideration of arranging such a visit when there is a terminal illness or a critical condition.</div>
    </p><a name="Para202244"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am not sure the bill, as amended, really changes the practice of our system now. I am sure that critical or terminal illness could be considered a change of circumstance and would amount to a court hearing arguments around a change in visitation rights. I do not think there is a significant change in the practice and would hope that any court confronted with that situation and the serious concerns about someone whose life is coming to an end might consider this an important reason to revisit the issue of visitation rights. I am sure in most instances that would be the case.</div>
    </p><a name="Para202245"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am not sure this significantly changes the current practice, but if it clarifies it and draws attention to the importance of that circumstance, then perhaps there is no harm in doing this. The key in all of this is that whatever decision is made it be made in the child's best interest. This has been the long established practice and importance of these considerations in the system.</div>
    </p><a name="Para202246"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are concerns about defining the age of a child with regard to this legislation. We have seen in the past that courts have absolutely refused to order a child 12 years or older to visit a parent when that child has refused to do so. That is a rough rule of thumb for the court, according to my colleague, the member for <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78397,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78397&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Windsor—Tecumseh</A>, but is something that we need to take into consideration.</div>
    </p><a name="Para202247"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe there has been an established precedent that children should have some say in the requirement to visit a parent and that probably applies in any circumstance, including one where there is terminal or critical illness. To move to a situation of requiring such a visit of a child would be a serious problem. Children over 12 certainly have the maturity to decide if they are willing to visit a parent or not. In further discussion of the bill, we have to ensure that this is one of the things that is a serious consideration.</div>
    </p><a name="Para202248"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is very clear that visitation rights in Canada are rights of the child, not of the parent. The key factor is that the best interests of the child must guide the court in making a determination. When those visitation rights are enforced or ordered, this still needs to be the key consideration. The rights of the child and what is in the best interest of the child in the circumstances need to be taken into account. That has to have a prime place in the considerations here, even in these difficult circumstances. </div>
    </p><A NAME="T1755"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1755"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1800"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1750"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1755">(1755)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para202249"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think it is fair to say that all of us would like to see terminally ill people have the ability to perhaps have a last visit with their child. We can all understand why that might be important to someone. However, I do not think there should be a compulsion on a child, especially an older child, to do that nor do I think the need of a terminally ill person to have that final visit should necessarily trump the best interests of the child in this case.</div>
    </p><a name="Para202250"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, we know, even at the time of terminal or critical illness, that often people can be as manipulative as they have been at other points in their lives. It is not always a completely altruistic moment in our lives. To make an exception in the case of that circumstance around visitation rights would be a serious problem. This is something that still merits the attention of the committee and members as the bill is discussed further at committee.</div>
    </p><a name="Para202251"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is important that the discretion of the court is maintained in these circumstances. This is why I would argue against the use of words like “ensure” or other words that access is granted. This kind of hard and fast language may impede the ability of the court to take into consideration all the factors that may come into play in a circumstance like this. We want to ensure that every possible circumstance and issue is brought to the attention of the court and discussed in the circumstance of the child, the family and the parents.</div>
    </p><a name="Para202252"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is very important that we maintain the discretion of the courts to deal with these circumstances. While we might offer guidance in the Divorce Act around this circumstance, this needs to be worded in a way that maintains the ability of the court to ultimately make the decision based on the best interest of the child, according to the information the court has at hand at the time.</div>
    </p><a name="Para202253"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am happy to have had the chance to speak to the bill as amended. I think a better version of it is now being discussed. Hopefully it will go forward to the committee where it may have a chance to improve it further and send it back to the House. At that time, we can make a further judgment on private member's Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2153838,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2153838&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-252</A>. We can see whether it goes forward and allows a more appropriate way to address the circumstances of visitation rights of a critically or terminally ill person.</div>

    </p><a name="Para202255"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hon. members have well covered the mechanics of what is involved here, but I have some points that I want to make. Whenever I hear of an issue on the floor of the House of Commons that has to do with families and children, I want to be part of it. One of the first bills that I had as a member was to provide income splitting between spouses so that one spouse could stay at home and care for preschool children.</div>
    </p><a name="Para202256"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I started to get involved in family and children issues and in fact, I have penned a number of small books on the subject. One of the books I wrote is called <i>Divorce--The Bold Facts</i>. It deals with a significant issue called parental alienation syndrome. This is one of the problems when there is a family breakdown and there is a custody issue and it is a nasty one or a confrontational split-up. </div>
    </p><a name="Para202257"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the things I learned in doing research for that book was that children who witness abuse of their parents are as affected as if the children themselves had been abused. I also found that children who were used as pawns, as it were, in this parental alienation syndrome were also very much affected by the fact that one parent was pitting the children against another parent. </div>
    </p><a name="Para202258"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through all the research and work that I have done, the truism for me is that both mothers and fathers have an important role to play in the lives of their children, even if the parents hate each other. That is important and that is the principle that this bill has raised.</div>
    </p><a name="Para202259"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having said that, the bill itself, as we know, has now been amended. It was a one clause bill. That clause has been deleted and replaced by another clause. It basically addressed the substantive concerns that people had with regard to the bill and that was that it appeared to be putting a greater reliance on a principle that the spouse had a right that may have impinged on the whole concept of the best interests of the child.</div>
    </p><a name="Para202260"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;About 10 years ago a joint committee of the House of Commons and Senate issued an excellent report called “For the Sake of the Children”. I participated in some of the dialogue. One of the things that came out is that in these custody and access dispute issues the child was the only one in the proceedings that did not have a representative. The mother had a lawyer, the father had a lawyer, but who was taking care of the child? In fact, the child was being used as a pawn. Parental alienation syndrome was part of it. In fact, domestic violence was part of it. It was a number of these issues.</div>
    </p><a name="Para202261"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That report contained some excellent recommendations. I am sorry to say that the Divorce Act still has not been amended to take into account some of the important recommendations that were made by the special joint committee of the House of Commons and Senate in its report, “For the Sake of the Children”.</div>
    </p><a name="Para202262"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The items in the report deal very frontally with the kinds of things that the hon. member for <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78882,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78882&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Lethbridge</A> has raised in his bill.</div>
    </p><a name="Para202263"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bill in its original form was in some difficulty and likely would have not been successful at second reading. I understand that was the reason it was necessary to respond to the points that were raised during the first hour of debate some 30 sitting days ago.</div>
    </p><a name="Para202264"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even with the current wording, and I think the member for <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78519,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78519&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Burnaby—Douglas</A> also has expressed some concern, there are a couple of things that do not quite work. We are at second reading debate on the bill where we debate the fundamental principles of the bill, the intent. We can deal at committee and at report stage with ensuring that the words are correct. I am not going to mince words that this bill does not technically work in the end result for me and so I am not going to support it; I will support it in principle and I will be recommending that my caucus support the bill in principle and that it be sent to the justice committee. </div>
    </p><A NAME="T1800"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1800"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1805"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1755"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1800">(1800)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para202265"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I should also say that I share the concern that others have. The member for <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78559,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78559&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Hochelaga</A> indicated that the justice committee is totally bogged down. It is unfortunate, because it means that good legislation may have some difficulty getting through before there is another election after all the work that parliamentarians have done. It is a possibility. The Minister of Finance will concede it is a possibility, unless he comes up with a darned good budget. </div>
    </p><a name="Para202266"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The problem with minority governments is they have a quirkiness in that the legislative process by and large takes a substantial period of time. If a bill does not get introduced early enough in a minority Parliament, it will likely die on the order paper and that is a shame. Let me be specific for the members' purposes and for the committee that will look at it and I hope it will have a chance. </div>
    </p><a name="Para202267"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The issue that they will be granted access appears to require to be defined, because in saying they shall be granted access, there are no dimensions. Could it be a day? Could it be a week? Who controls the timing of that? The mechanics of how it works is not in the existing legislation. This bill does not define it. We may have to deal with that in committee and I will urge the committee to make a definition about what it means and how it ties in consistently with the whole family of issues related to custody and access orders.</div>
    </p><a name="Para202268"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second item has to do with children. Children are persons 18 years of age and under. We have to ask ourselves whether or not the provisions of the Divorce Act amended by the bill would actually coerce a 12 to 17 year old to actually visit with a parent when a court may not order that and the child may not want to visit that parent. We have age of reason issues as well. There may be a conflict that has to be dealt with. What if a child of the age of reason does not want to visit that parent? This cannot be black and white. It is like most of our laws in that we have to deal with it on a case by case basis. There may have to be some proviso, for example, where possible, in accordance with orders or what are the rights of the child. </div>
    </p><a name="Para202269"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The importance of the bill is that it provides an opportunity to take the first step at making a critical appraisal of the condition of the current Divorce Act and the recommendation of the joint committee that did the report, “For the Sake of the Children”, to open up these issues to dialogue and discussion. </div>
    </p><a name="Para202270"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am supportive of the intent. I am a big fan of private members' business. I have had some success, but I can tell the member and all hon. members, in my view the best outcome of a private member's bill is to have the government adopt it as its own so that it can get fast tracked through the appropriate minister. There is nothing better.</div>
    </p><a name="Para202271"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For instance, there was a private member's item which provided that if there was a situation of domestic abuse, the penalty related to that would be more than common assault because a trust relationship was being violated. In fact, in the Criminal Code today there are stiffer sentences for those who are convicted of spousal abuse. That happened not as a result of the ultimate discussion and debate and going through the whole private members' business process, but because the minister took it upon himself to do it.</div>
    </p><a name="Para202272"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The extension of maternity and paternal leave under EI from six months to a full year was the subject of a private member's bill. I do not even think it had second reading, but it appeared in the very next budget of the minister. The Minister of Finance is here. Maybe there are some opportunities here to do that.</div>

We can see that children are very near and dear to his heart, as they are to mine. </div>
    </p><a name="Para202275"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I heard a previous member say that she has been married for 30 years. My wife and I have been married for 31 years and this year the last two of our eight children were married so we are very well acquainted with marriage.

    </p><a name="Para202276"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am thankful and proud that the member for <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78882,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78882&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2"> Lethbridge</A> saw a flaw in the act and saw an opportunity to correct it. It is to this that I rise today to speak to this private member's bill, Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2153838,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2153838&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-252</A>, an act to amend the Divorce Act which would allow access to the spouse, the divorced parent, who is terminally ill or in critical condition.</div>
    </p><a name="Para202277"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We cannot imagine what that would be like. I was speaking to one of my colleagues just a minute ago and we were talking about past experiences. When my father passed away about 12 years ago I remember my whole family being around him and I remember that precious time we had together. I think my father also enjoyed having his children around him. It is hard to think that in this day and age that access could be denied. I believe that providing divorced parents who are terminally ill or in critical condition access to their child or children is important for several reasons.</div>
    </p><a name="Para202278"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, we ensure that a spouse who is terminally ill or in critical condition has access to a child or children during his or her time of suffering. Let us think about how important it would be for a divorced parent, who is lying in a hospital bed or at home suffering, to have the presence of their child or children. </div>
    </p><a name="Para202279"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, we protect the child or children by considering access if it is in the best interests of the child or children of the marriage. The second part of this is the child. I am glad the member saw fit and, in his wisdom, took it upon himself to ensure that we always remember that it is in the best interests of the children as well.</div>
    </p><a name="Para202280"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, we allow the child or children to be involved in the overall process of dealing with the impending loss of their parent and the grieving that follows. </div>
    </p><a name="Para202281"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, we had opportunity to speak as colleagues just a few minutes ago and one of my colleagues was telling us about how his wife, who is an adopted child, had the opportunity to see her adoptive mother on her deathbed but who does not have that opportunity with her birth mother. Of course this is a different matter and it is something that we may want to introduce in another bill, but it strikes home to the reality of closure. If we offer that closure to the child or the children, it is in the best interest of the child and it is a good thing.</div>
    </p><a name="Para202282"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After listening to all those who have spoken on this matter, I was pleased to hear that we all agree that this is a bill that must move forward. As parliamentarians, we should be considering ways to allow families to continue to function after a breakdown. Again, these are good things. These are things that the people who elect us to this great House expect us to do. </div>
    </p><a name="Para202283"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This amendment should be supported because it demonstrates an understanding toward the strain on the spouses when a divorced parent is terminally ill or in critical condition and the responsibility to involve the child or children in the lives of their parents. Again, that bond that we share with our parents is something that is never broken. </div>
    </p><A NAME="T1815"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1815"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1820"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1810"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1815">(1815)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para202284"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here again we are moving in a direction which is going to ensure that those things continue on for future generations. If Parliament accepts this amendment to the Divorce Act, it will give parents who divorce the legally entrenched avenues necessary to have access to their child or children only if access does not run contrary to the best interests of the child or children involved. </div>
    </p><a name="Para202285"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, this is a good amendment, because we recognize that there are times when it is not in the best interests of children, but when it is, we want to be sure they have access. It will allow the court that considers giving access to the parent the right to determine by reference to the condition, means, needs and other circumstances of the child or children that access is in their best interests. The courts would have the ability through the law to determine what is good and what is right.</div>
    </p><a name="Para202286"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For these reasons I support this amendment, because due consideration has been given to these issues faced by families in these circumstances. This amendment has a balanced approach, one which I support, as it provides parents who are terminally ill or in critical condition access to their children, while also ensuring that such access is granted by the court according to the best interests of the child or children involved. That sums it up.</div>
    </p><a name="Para202287"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We all agree that we need to put through this bill, to go through due process, and we all agree that this bill should be enacted quickly. I am thankful for the opportunity to speak to this private member's bill.</div>

    </p><a name="Para202292"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would like to thank those back in my riding who brought this issue to my attention. As someone mentioned earlier, it was an issue that was brought to my attention. I looked not just at the particular instance, but at the whole issue of access to critically ill or terminally ill parents. I thought it was something worth bringing forward.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The spirit of this amendment is to deal with the children and the right of a child to be able to have one last visit. It is for the children. All other things aside, that was the scope of what I was trying to get at here. It is consistent with a couple of other private members' bills. It is interesting that the member for <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78477,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78477&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Mississauga South</A> said that the best way to get a bill forward is to get the government to pick it up and put it into law. I agree with that. </div>
    </p><a name="Para202295"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That actually happened with one of the first private members' bills I brought through. It dealt with the Criminal Code. I brought forward an amendment so that courts could seize materials used to produce child pornography upon a conviction. It was not in the code. The bill did not actually pass the House, but it is law now. It was picked up by the government of the time and put into law, so I feel pretty good about that.</div>
    </p><a name="Para202296"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, of course, there is the issue of raising the age of sexual consent from 14 to 16.

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hopefully with this intervention tonight it looks like this is going to be supported and we can move it on to committee, but before I do that, earlier today we amended the bill, so I would like to make one more request of the House today.</div>

    </p><a name="Para202313"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The consideration we have before us is a question I put to the minister some weeks ago. I think all Canadians, once given the evidence, will also agree that there needs to be something done. Specifically, what we have before us is hypocrisy, which would be the more cynical term, but at the very least a contradiction of ideas.</div>
    </p><a name="Para202314"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Year in and year out we see governments providing a tax subsidy to an economic sector that is experiencing its greatest boom perhaps of all time. This is the oil and gas sector of northern Alberta, in particular the tar sands and the development around Fort McMurray. This started with the previous Liberal government, but the Conservative government has chosen to keep it.</div>
    </p><a name="Para202315"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a moment in last year's budget when there was a huge surplus. We knew there was some $13 billion extra sitting in the kitty. The government followed this surplus up by cutting another $1 billion of vital programs to Canadians, programs that people have wanted and used for years, programs to museums, programs to help adults learn to read and write and programs to help women finally achieve some status of equality, both in pay and in quality of life conditions. The government chose to cut programs because I guess it did not see them as a priority, or it did not feel they were important. </div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It also chose to cut the EnerGuide program, a program that had received credit for having thousands upon thousands of homes achieve better environmental conditions. All the while these cuts were going on, the government still found enough room in the budget to syphon off $1.5 billion to the oil and gas sector.</div>
    </p><a name="Para202317"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I asked this question some weeks ago, the minister stood up and gave another ministerial response about how important it was to use taxpayer money wisely.</div>
    </p><a name="Para202318"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know the parliamentary secretary will be answering my question. Hopefully he will make an announcement that this ludicrous subsidy is ended. It makes no more sense. There is no incentive needed for companies to go into the oil sector. They are there already. They have massive plans to do more. Yet the government seems committed to shuffling them off some corporate welfare while at the same time not supporting things that we know are important for Canadians.</div>
    </p><a name="Para202319"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is unbalanced because the government has also made its commitment that it will reduce greenhouse gas emissions. In particular, the government has agreed, in full, to the recommendations provided by the Auditor General's office under the Commissioner of the Environment. In those recommendations is the need to attack and aggressively go after the emissions in the tar sands because they will double in the next number of years. It is hypocrisy to suggest it will reduce the pollution while at the same time it subsidizes that pollution.</div>
    </p><a name="Para202320"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the parliamentary secretary's opportunity to come clean on the issue, to allow his government's plans to stand to the light of day and to suggest that this subsidy is simply no longer required. The industry is one of the healthiest industries in the entire country. To continue to push them down toward unsustainable development is unwise. Even the soon to be retiring Premier of Alberta has recognized that this is unwise. It is time for the government to stand up and agree with that statement, pull the subsidy back and put it into the energy projects that we actually need, the ones for which Canadians are looking.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to comment on the $13 billion surplus. This government decided that we were going to pay down the debt because that was the promise we made. It was a good decision. It does not make everybody happy, but it was the right thing to do. We are going to be saving $650 million a year in interest that we would have had to pay, which saves a lot of money for hard-working Canadians.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regarding the oil sands, our government recognizes that the oil sands are important to Canadians and the Canadian economy. This government also recognizes that any development in that area must take into consideration the environmental impacts. Our government is committed to providing real practical long term solutions to cleaning up our air and reducing greenhouse gas emissions.</div>
    </p><a name="Para202324"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This week we will be introducing the clean air act. It will cover all industrial sectors, including the oil industry. These efforts will directly reduce air pollution and greenhouse gases. A national long term regulatory strategy will give industry, the provinces, and the Canadian people, certainty and confidence. </div>
    </p><a name="Para202325"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It will also provide flexibility and the opportunity to achieve real improvements to air quality, improve the health of Canadians, and reduce emissions of greenhouse gases that cause climate change. Our government is working with the provinces and territories, the oil industry, first nations, environmental groups and other interested parties on this issue. Together we will find ways of reducing emissions.</div>
    </p><a name="Para202326"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, this government is working with the Government of Alberta during its public consultation examining the environmental, economic, and social impacts of the oil sands to develop a vision and principles for oil sands development. </div>
    </p><a name="Para202327"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, this government continues to be actively involved in the review of the environmental impact assessments for the oil sands development and the regional initiative dealing with the cumulative environmental assessments.</div>

    </p><a name="Para202329"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What that means for people watching is that any efficiencies made by the sector which are naturally occurring, because industries tend to want to be more efficient with how much pollution they emit, will be counted as having contributed some significant amount to Canada's overall pollution emission. That will not be the case.</div>
    </p><a name="Para202330"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If this sector is doubling, why would the government continue to make a priority of subsidizing the sector to the tune of $1.5 billion? If set aside and put into green energy projects, this would actually work for Canadians and work for our international commitments. We can still meet those commitments if the government resets its priorities. </div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We look forward to the clean air act, but when action was called for, the government decided to introduce a bill that is going to take four or five years to implement with consultation. That is a bit disappointing.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The problem is that there has not yet been an announcement.

    </p><a name="Para202339"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, October 17, one month later, I am again asking the government whether it is prepared to go ahead and implement the program proposed by the Bloc Québécois. It is a program that would help communities diversify their economy, help the industry with concrete measures to regain the productivity it needs to compete, and help workers, especially older workers.</div>
    </p><a name="Para202340"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, we were treated to an alarming display by the Conservative government. We are asking the government to put in place a program for older workers who can no longer find jobs, and again today, the government is responding with a retraining program. </div>
    </p><a name="Para202341"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not know what it will take for the government to understand that when workers reach 56, 57, 58, they do everything they can to find another job. Unfortunately, though, because they do not have the necessary training—often because employers will not hire them, mainly because of their age—if they do not receive help, they slowly sink into misery and poverty and are forced to sell their assets and homes.</div>
    </p><a name="Para202342"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think that people who have worked 25 or 30 years for a company, who have supported a family, deserve to have their government—which accumulated a $13 billion surplus last year—implement a program that would cost no more than $75 million a year to help workers, not only those in the forestry sector but in all industrial sectors as well. </div>
    </p><a name="Para202343"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That was the motion Parliament adopted yesterday. The three opposition parties, which form the majority in Parliament, told the minority government that Canada needs such a program. </div>
    </p><a name="Para202344"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, will the government tell us whether or not it intends to follow through with this program, with the Bloc Québécois' plan to help forestry workers in particular, but also industry and communities? There is a crisis in the forest industry and something must be done about it. The federal government has an important responsibility here, given how it negotiated the softwood lumber agreement with the American government. </div>

Make no mistake, the Government of Canada recognizes the importance of the forest products industry to the Canadian economy. Let me assure the member that Canada's new government is keenly aware and is sensitive to the challenges facing this industry. </div>
    </p><a name="Para202347"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the outset, our government has been committed to the best interests of Canada, our provinces, the industry, forest workers and communities that depend on the forest sector. Resolution of the softwood lumber dispute is just one way the federal government has demonstrated its commitment to workers and the industry. </div>
    </p><a name="Para202348"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The softwood lumber agreement gives our producers stable and predictable access to the United States market. It ends years of costly litigation and repays over $5 billion Canadian in duty deposits to Canadian producers, a significant infusion of capital for the industry that will benefit workers and communities.</div>
    </p><a name="Para202349"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I must admit that I am rather puzzled by the hon. member's question. It was originally asked on September 19, the day after the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78741,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78741&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Minister of International Trade</A> tabled a ways and means motion to implement the agreement in this House on September 18.</div>
    </p><a name="Para202350"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The motion passed its first vote in the House of Commons with the support of the hon. member's party. The agreement has been in force since October 12. Canada's new government delivered a deal supported by two nations, all the lumber producing provinces and a clear majority of the lumber companies. This deal clearly shows that the government, which puts Canadians ahead of partisan politics, will always deliver what is in the best interests of Canada.</div>
    </p><a name="Para202351"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We all waited for the hon. member's party to figure out its position on the softwood lumber agreement. It consulted, strategized, mused and finally concluded what our government already knew: Quebeckers were in favour of the agreement. Lumber producers in Quebec supported the deal. Communities and workers whose livelihoods depended on the critical sector welcomed the agreement as an important step toward protecting jobs and promoting prosperity. All of Canada's key lumber producing provinces, including Quebec, have endorsed it.</div>
    </p><a name="Para202352"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canadians asked this government to come up with a resolution that provided stability for the industry and protected the livelihoods of workers, communities and families, not only in Quebec but across the country. We have done that. We have delivered.</div>
    </p><a name="Para202353"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The resolution of the softwood lumber dispute is not the only way that this government has demonstrated its commitment to the forestry industry. As the hon. member will recall, we announced in budget 2006 a $400 million investment to encourage the long term competitiveness of the forest industry, to address the pine beetle infestation in western Canada, and to assist worker adjustment. </div>
    </p><a name="Para202354"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just today, Canada's new government announced a program to address the needs of older workers who have lost their jobs in communities where the local economy is experiencing ongoing unemployment or industries affected by downsizing and closures, industries like forestry.</div>
    </p><a name="Para202355"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me conclude by stating that the end of the softwood lumber dispute has been a key priority and an accomplishment for our government. We can finally turn the page and direct our full attention to building a stronger and more competitive Canada.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I expect the government to act as responsibly in admitting that the deal is insufficient. An additional aid package is needed.

The only answer provided so far was that of the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78770,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78770&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Minister of Industry</A>. And that minister does not believe in government intervention, not at all; he is prepared to let the forest industry hit a brick wall.</div>

    </p><a name="Para202361"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For five years the previous Liberal government played with the lives of 165,000 Canadians and over 260 communities that depended on the lumber industry when it refused to work out the dispute with the United States. When our government took office, we got it right. If the hon. member opposite wants to point fingers and blame, he should point them in the right direction.</div>
    </p><a name="Para202362"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before this deal was secured, the Quebec lumber companies were prepared to accept a return of 75% of duties collected. Our deal delivers 80% and a certainty of market access. Canada's new government delivered a deal that is good for Canadian workers, their families, and communities that depend on this industry.</div>
    </p><a name="Para202363"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think the lumber industry prefers this agreement to the endless litigation and dithering that the previous government seemed fine with. The softwood lumber deal clearly shows that a government that puts Canadians ahead of partisan politics will always deliver what is in the best interests of Canada.</div>
