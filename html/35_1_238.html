	<B>Hon. André Ouellet (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.): 
</B>Madam Speaker, allow me first of all to apologize to the 
representatives from the Bloc Quebecois and the Reform Party for 
notifying them of this morning's ministerial statement on such 
short notice. This decision was made only late yesterday. The 
United Nations will announce a substantial reduction in its forces 
in the former Yugoslavia, and I thought that a statement should be 
made here in this House before the UN makes its announcement 
today.
<P>
	I should point out that I was under no obligation to make a 
statement in this House, but I thought that, even on such short 
notice, the opposition parties, who have always been involved and 
who have always had the opportunity to express their views on the 
peacekeeping forces deployed in the former Yugoslavia, would 
appreciate this opportunity to participate in a parliamentary debate 
and express for the record their reactions and, I hope, their support 
for the government's decision.
<P>
	Allow me to say that the situation in Bosnia has changed 
considerably in the past few weeks. The UN having concluded that 
it no longer needs all authorized UNPROFOR contingents, it has 
asked some contributing countries to reduce their forces and others 
to withdraw theirs.
<P>
	These cuts and reassignments will affect some 9,000 soldiers. 
UNPROFOR strength will drop from 21,000 to 15,000, while the 
rapid reaction force added to the UN contingent will lose some 
3,000 members.
<P>
	Canadian Forces elements are among those that the UN feels are 
no longer needed in Bosnia. The details of this decision will be 
announced today by the Secretary-General of the United Nations.
<P>
	The Canadian battalion now in Bosnia will therefore not be 
replaced when its current six month mandate expires in November. 
A parliamentary debate was held when this battalion was deployed; 
some members expressed their support for this action while others 
stated that we should withdraw from the former Yugoslavia. The 
return of this battalion that will not be replaced should, I presume, 
satisfy Reform members who told us at the time that we should 
substantially reduce the number of Canadian troops in Bosnia.
<P>
	I should, however, point out that Canada will maintain a 
presence in the region, as Canadian military observers and 
Canadian personnel at the UN force headquarters will remain in 
Zagreb and Sarajevo. Canadian troops now assigned to NATO 
operations in the Adriatic Sea, whose job is to monitor the no-fly 
zone in Bosnia, will not be affected by this reduction either.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	If current efforts to reach a peace agreement are successful the 
region will enter a new phase. Canada will contribute to 
reconstruction efforts in the former Yugoslavia. Once a settlement 
has been reached Canada will be there, if necessary, in the new 
force with our allies to help implement the peace under the 
authority of the United Nations and as part of Canada's continuing 
commitment to Europe.
<P>
	Canada has been in the former Yugoslavia for three and a half 
years, since the beginning of peacekeeping in the region. 
Canadians have served with distinction in land, sea and air 
operations. We will continue to be involved with 13 military 
observers and one ship with a crew of 212 personnel. We will be 
involved in the Sarajevo air bridge with one aircraft and 45 
personnel. We will also have six people in the AWACs aircraft and 
50 people in headquarters.
<P>
	I pay tribute to the courage and integrity of thousands of 
Canadian forces personnel who have served with honour under the 
Canadian and UN flags. I pay special homage to those who have 
paid the supreme sacrifice in the service of peace. I express on 
behalf of all Canadians appreciation to those who will continue to 
participate in the UN efforts to forge a lasting peace in the area.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	I wish to thank this House for allowing us to make this short 
statement, which also gives the opposition parties an opportunity to 
express their views.

<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean H. Leroux (Shefford, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I am 
pleased to participate in this debate on Bosnia this morning on 
behalf of the Bloc Quebecois.
<P>
	I would like to point out however that, as the minister indicated, 
we received a copy of the ministerial statement only half an hour 
ago. I think this is unreasonably short notice.
<P>
<B>(1010)</B>
<P>
	This rather high handed approach speaks volumes about the 
government's lack of respect for even the most fundamental 
parliamentary procedures. It is customary in Parliament for the 
minister to send out a copy of his statement at least one day ahead. 
This is typical of the foreign affairs minister.
<P>
	In 1990, this very minister had the gall to claim that federalism 
acts as a shield to protect individual freedoms. There is cause for 
concern when we hear this kind of falsehood. It was the Liberal 
government that did not hesitate to implement the War Measures 
Act in 1970, using an alleged danger of insurrection in Quebec to 
trample the rights and freedoms of several hundreds of Quebecers.
<P>
	One can rightly be outraged to hear such the remarks from this 
minister, who told the Bélanger-Campeau commission that abuse 
of fundamental rights by the government is more likely in countries 
with a single level of government. This is the same man who made 
outrageous remarks during a recent trip to New York, drawing a 
parallel between the former Yugoslavia and the highly democratic 
process under way in Quebec to achieve sovereignty.
<P>
	What did the minister mean when he said: ``We have not started 
killing another yet, and I hope that what is going on in the former 
Yugoslavia will never happen in Canada''? The Minister of Foreign 
Affairs and the Government of Canada should be ashamed of 
making such insinuations. This kind of irresponsible behaviour on 
the part of the minister says a lot about the No side: intolerance, 
abuse, insults.
<P>
	At any rate, it is with a feeling of having done our duty that we 
learned this morning that the Canadian battalion deployed in 
Bosnia will not be replaced when its mandate ends in November. If 
the work done by our peacekeepers is starting to pay off, it is 
precisely because we steadfastly took our responsibilities as the 
official opposition the whole time.
<P>
	When there was strong pressure to withdraw our troops, 
abandoning the civilian population over there in a state of 
destitution and insecurity, as the Reform Party suggested for 
instance, we, Bloc members, felt that it was our humanitarian duty 
to stay on location.
<P>
	As the Leader of the Opposition said as earlier as in January 
1994, we had to bear in mind that we had to take on, to the best of 
our abilities, our fair share of the tasks  that arise out of our belief 
in the democratic values of peace and justice. Today, we can see the 
concrete result of this. There is every indication that the conflict in 
Bosnia can be resolved through negotiations instead of violence 
and massacres. On behalf of the Bloc Quebecois, I wish to pay 
tribute to the courage and sacrifice of all our military personnel, 
some of whom gave their lives so that peace could prevail.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bob Mills (Red Deer, Ref.):</B> Madam Speaker, I make my 
comments from the national opposition standpoint.
<P>
	After three and a half years of excellent service our peacekeepers 
are finally coming home from Bosnia. That is just great. They 
deserve hearty congratulations for a job well done. During these 
years our peacekeepers have had to operate under the most difficult 
of circumstances but they always fulfilled their duties with 
distinction.
<P>
	All our troops who have served in the former Yugoslavia have 
the thanks of the Canadian people and Parliament. To the families 
of those who were killed in the service of peace, we also pay our 
deepest respects.
<P>
	For over a year now the Reform Party has been asking for this 
day to happen. I refer directly to the statement. I believe there is a 
coded message in that statement. I draw to the attention of the 
minister that the last debate in the House occurred on March 29, 
which was a six-month mandate. That mandate expired at the end 
of September of this year. Somehow we have extended that to 
November without consulting the House.
<P>
<B>(1015)</B>
<P>
	The minister commented that we will be part of a new force. 
There is no detail of what this new force might be. There is no 
suggestion of what the criteria might be under which we would 
participate. There are a lot of questions Canadians are asking. They 
want the questions answered and the criteria established in the 
House.
<P>
	The questions include cost, length of the commitment and 
whether there is peace to keep. Is there a mandate for our troops 
when they go? Most important. they want to know we will be part 
of the decision making, not like with the former Yugoslavia where 
the contact group was one thing and we more or less put up our 
hands and said we would go along with what was decided.
<P>
	We have to look at the UN and the reforms. I know the minister 
is interested in that. We have to look at the mismanagement that 
has occurred and the serious doubts we have about UN missions, 
Somalia, the former Yugoslavia and now Haiti where there appear 
to be serious problems in terms of conducting the mandate. We 
have to establish those criteria.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="15253"> 15253 </A></B>
<P>
	The government has mismanaged the whole affair. I find it 
difficult since we received the statement only 15 minutes ago. 
However the minister has said he is not responsible for that.
<P>
	The debates in the House have brought serious questions 
forward. I do not believe they have been heard. This summer 
during a critical time there was a lack of leadership. The minister 
was unavailable for comment. The Prime Minister was found in a 
canoe somewhere and gave some very general comments which I 
found to be very insulting to me as a parliamentarian and to 
Canadians.
<P>
	The Reform Party thanks our troops. We demand from 
Parliament that it set some criteria before we become the 911 UN 
call number. We must do it in Parliament and not simply in cabinet. 
We want to return the confidence of the people of Canada to 
peacekeeping and to the management and leadership the 
government should be showing.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ouellet:</B> Madam Speaker, I apologize. I forgot to table the 
letter during my original statement. I should like to table the letter 
we received from Kofi Annan, the undersecretary general for 
peacekeeping operations, outlining the decisions of the UN 
addressed to us. It will be of interest to all parliamentarians.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> Does the minister have 
unanimous consent to table the letter?

	<B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, 
pursuant to Standing Order 36 I wish to present a petition 
circulating across Canada. It is signed by a number of Canadians 
from the Oakville, Burlington and Mississauga areas of Ontario.
<P>
	The petitioners draw to the attention of the House that managing 
the family home and caring for preschool children is an honourable 
profession which has not been recognized for its value to our 
society. They also state the Income Tax Act discriminates against 
families that make the choice to provide care in the home to 
preschool children, the disabled, the chronically ill or the aged.
<P>
	The petitioners therefore pray and call on Parliament to pursue 
initiatives to eliminate tax discrimination against families that 
decide to provide care in the home to preschool children, the 
disabled, the chronically ill or aged.

<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="WITNESSPROTECTIONPROGRAMACT">WITNESS PROTECTION PROGRAM ACT</A></H3>
	<B>Hon. Herb Gray (Leader of the Government in the House of 
Commons and Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.)</B> moved that 
Bill C-78, an act to provide for the establishment and operation of a 
program to enable certain persons to receive protection in relation 
to certain inquiries, investigations or prosecutions, be read the 
second time and referred to a committee.
<P>
	He said: Madam Speaker, I am pleased to open debate on Bill 
C-78, the witness protection program act, and to ask for its 
approval on second reading.
<P>
	The bill creates for the first time a statutory foundation for the 
Royal Canadian Mounted Police  source witness protection 
program. I am sure all members realize the importance of witness 
and 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15254"> 15254 </A></B>
<P>
source protection. Governments must be able to help ensure the 
safety and security of persons who assist police and prosecutors in 
their efforts to crack down on crime.
<P>
	Experience shows that witnesses or sources who provide 
evidence or who assist in police investigations at risk of harm to 
themselves or their families are often among the most effective 
tools our justice system has against crime, especially organized 
crime.
<P>
	The intent of the witness protection program act is to ensure our 
federal witness protection program offers the best possible 
protection to potential witnesses and sources.
<P>
<B>(1025)</B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The proposed changes to the act will make the current RCMP 
source witness protection program-which has been in effect since 
1984 as a strictly administrative program-more transparent and 
more efficient, by providing sound statutory and regulatory 
authority.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	In short, we are creating a witness protection program which for 
the first time will have a legislative base. This will have the 
important effect of placing the RCMP source witness protection 
program more in the public domain.
<P>
	I know this was a major concern of my colleague, the member 
for Scarborough West, when he put forward his private member's 
bill on witness protection. His bill provided a useful basis for 
discussion of the issues leading to Bill C-78. I again thank him for 
his efforts.
<P>
	Under the bill there will now be clear accountability for the 
operation of the RCMP source witness protection program. While 
the identities of sources and witnesses will remain secret, the 
selection criteria, the decision making process and the scope and 
the extent of the protection to be provided will be transparent and 
clear. This will help ensure that both applicants who enter the 
program and the RCMP which operates it have a clear 
understanding of their respective rights and obligations as well as 
the extent and scope of the protection to be provided.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	This should also prevent any misunderstanding between the 
RCMP and those it seeks to protect. Overall, the changes to the 
RCMP source witness protection program will meet the needs of 
police departments, as well as those of witnesses and sources 
requiring protection.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The proposed changes will ensure clearly defined admission 
criteria for witnesses, the consistent handling  of cases across the 
country, and the clear setting out of the responsibilities and 
obligations both of the administrators of the program and of the 
individuals entering it. The bill will also ensure a more defined 
management structure within the RCMP for the daily operation of 
the program, thereby increasing accountability.
<P>
	Furthermore the bill will ensure a complaints procedure is in 
place and that the commissioner of the RCMP will submit to the 
solicitor general an annual report on the operation of the program 
which then must be tabled in the House.
<P>
	Provincial and municipal law enforcement agencies will still, as 
they have done in the past, be able to participate in the RCMP 
source witness protection program on a cost recovery basis. 
However the bill is not intended to replace other witness protection 
programs run by provincial police forces and by some municipal 
police forces.
<P>
	In keeping with the government's program of fiscal restraint, the 
changes to the RCMP source witness protection program arising 
out of the bill will be funded out of existing resources.
<P>
	When the government was elected it made a commitment to a 
safe homes, safe streets agenda. Since taking office we have been 
honouring that commitment. We have introduced Bill C-45 to bring 
about an updating of our corrections and parole system. This bill 
has now been passed by the House and is being studied in the other 
place.
<P>
	We have created a system using the Canadian Police Information 
Centre data banks to help screen out sexual abusers as potential 
employees and volunteers working with children. We have 
established also using the CPIC data banks a national flagging 
system to help provincial crown attorneys to make more frequent 
and more effective use of the dangerous offender provisions of the 
Criminal Code as an instrument to protect the public better from 
dangerous high risk offenders.
<P>
<B>(1030)</B>
<P>
	We have introduced comprehensive gun control proposals, 
proposals adopted by the House and under study in the other place. 
We have created a national crime prevention council. We have 
passed amendments to the Young Offenders Act. We have passed 
Bill C-41 to reform the sentencing process. We have passed 
legislation that would prevent extreme intoxication from being 
used as a defence to excuse violence and other serious crimes. We 
have passed legislation that permits a provincial court judge to 
issue a warrant allowing police to obtain body samples from 
suspects for forensic DNA analysis.
<P>
	The witness protection program act is another important 
component in our overall effort to improve the safety and security 
of all Canadians. I urge all hon.  members to support Bill C-78. In 
this respect I thank the hon. Reform Party member for 
Surrey-White Rock-South Langley when she was solicitor 
general critic for having expressed her support of the bill. 
Therefore I look forward 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15255"> 15255 </A></B>
<P>
to and I ask for similar support from all other members of the 
House to ensure speedy passage of Bill C-78.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. François Langlois (Bellechasse, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
am pleased to rise on behalf of the official opposition to discuss 
Bill C-78, which was just tabled by the solicitor general.
<P>
	It is somewhat surprising that, for all intents and purposes, Bill 
C-78 is similar to a bill considered by the House on September 26, 
namely Bill C-206, which introduced by the hon. member for 
Scarborough West and given first reading on February 1.
<P>
	Indeed, a comparison of both bills shows that there is very little 
difference between Bill C-78, which is before us today, and Bill 
C-206, which has already gone through second reading in this 
House.
<P>
	The only changes that I could find, and they are not major, are 
that compensation of witnesses may be better under bill C-78. 
Also-and to my mind this is not an improvement-under this bill, 
the RCMP commissioner will now have to make the necessary 
arrangements with witnesses, or their counsel, to ensure their 
protection. Under Bill C-206, as considered on September 26, the 
solicitor general had the authority to reach agreements with 
witnesses. That, of course, made it easier, under our parliamentary 
system, to ensure control of government activities through 
ministerial accountability.
<P>
	This, I feel, is an issue which the committee will have to look at 
again. In terms of the principles involved, there is not much 
difference between the solicitor general's position and the one 
which I express on behalf of the official opposition. Nevertheless, 
we will have to take another look at this issue and decide who 
should be responsible for the arrangements made. I understand that 
it can be argued that the RCMP commissioner is ultimately 
accountable to the solicitor general who, in turn, is accountable to 
this House, which means that the House will have a say in the 
process. I will come back to this point.
<P>
<B>(1035)</B>
<P>
	Before getting into the heart of the matter, I would like to begin 
by stating that the contribution by the hon. member for 
Scarborough West, not only in introducing Bill C-206 but also in 
taking part in all aspects of the work of Parliament, particularly in 
the justice and legal affairs committee, ought to ensure that he will 
have the opportunity in the very near future of having his point of 
view heard on legal issues within that committee.
<P>
	Now, having made that remark, and having voiced these few 
reservations, I must nevertheless express my pleasure at the care 
the government has taken with this issue of witness protection. I 
believe that the government's wishes will result in a change to 
Canadian law.
<P>
	We must admit that we lagged considerably behind our 
American neighbours, who have had witness protection legislation 
applying to all 50 states of the union for 25 years now. That 
legislation is is well known by the general public, which is thus 
aware of its rights.
<P>
	Here, we do have some legislation in this regard, but it is not as 
well known and is administered by the RCMP in some cases, by the 
OPP or the Sûreté du Québec in others, but always sporadically and 
piecemeal, which does nothing to help the general public 
understand the system.
<P>
	In a law-abiding society, I do not believe that we can settle for a 
piecemeal approach, with decisions depending on the whims of 
whoever is responsible for policing at a specific time. I feel that 
instead we need to have legislation that will apply all across 
Canada and will therefore incorporate in the rules of law those 
principles we wish to be seen in our public law. This will improve 
the situation of witnesses, particularly in criminal cases, and more 
particularly in cases involving serious crimes.
<P>
	It is my opinion that this will put an end to the application, in a 
sometimes sequential manner and without any controls, though it 
was done in good faith, of procedures about which there might be 
witness confusion as to which policies apply to them. From now on 
it will be clear, and attorneys will be able to inform witnesses of the 
protection programs available to them by law. This transparency in 
application of the law cannot help but be beneficial to the 
community at large.
<P>
	As I just pointed out, there should be one set of criteria for 
everyone, and the public should be aware of those criteria.
<P>
	Now, how should witness protection be structured and how 
should it be monitored? Should the courts monitor witness 
protection or should it be left up to the RCMP commissioner or the 
minister?
<P>
	Some will probably argue that monitoring by the courts would 
involve a certain amount of publicity which may not be desirable in 
this case, because often the purpose of the witness protection 
program is to allow the witness, who has put his life on the line 
many times, to hide behind a new identity so that he can start a new 
life.
<P>
	If there is monitoring by the judiciary, every precaution must be 
taken to avoid undue publicity or releasing names, which could be 
disastrous and even do the opposite of what the bill introduced by 
the government is intended to do.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15256"> 15256 </A></B>
<P>
	There could, however, be a form of monitoring by Parliament. 
I have been and still am a member of the Sub-Committee on 
National Security, and I submit that this would probably be the 
ideal venue for reviewing, either from time to time or on an 
ongoing basis, as deemed appropriate by the committee, the entire 
witness protection system and its implementation by the RCMP.
<P>
	The expertise of the Sub-Committee on National 
Security-which I would like to see become a standing committee 
of this House-would ensure that parliamentarians would be able 
to monitor the actions of the police in this respect, both discreetly 
and effectively, I would hope.
<P>
<B>(1040)</B>
<P>
	Those are some of the issues. I hope that in committee we will 
have an opportunity to hear witnesses, and we may be able to 
clarify certain points during clause by clause consideration.
<P>
	In serious cases involving drug trafficking and organized crime, 
for instance, often the very survival of the witnesses is at stake. 
Under our legal system, the crown's case is usually based on the 
testimony of witnesses as opposed to confessions by the accused. 
That is the whole point of protecting witnesses. There are no 
spontaneous confessions. We live in a country that respects its 
citizens. We have reached a level in our civilization where we can 
treat people with respect. We cannot force people to confess. The 
crown often has to introduce circumstantial evidence by calling 
witnesses, and these witnesses must be protected.
<P>
	The crown never knows, during the bail hearing, the preliminary 
hearing or, later, the trial-all of which may or may not be part of 
the process-whether it can count on these witnesses at a given 
time. We have to protect witnesses and we also have to protect the 
evidence that may be collected at some time or other. The very fact 
that courts across the country have a huge backlog of cases means 
that preserving evidence is a serious problem in Canada. Evidence 
collected at a previous stage may often no longer be valid at a 
subsequent stage if the witness has disappeared from this earth. So 
in addition to protecting witnesses, we must also protect the 
evidence.
<P>
	The Crown prosecutors' big concern is whether they can keep 
their witnesses until the time of the trial. They wonder whether the 
witnesses will answer their questions properly, once on the stand. 
Time is often the Crown's greatest enemy in a criminal trial. 
Witnesses' memory is inversely proportional to the length of the 
proceedings. It is perhaps even directly proportional, that is, it fails 
as proceedings go on or the risk of failure increases. It is a bit like 
cigarettes. The risk increases with use.
<P>
	At the moment, there are no ways to deal with this, since 
witnesses' memories often fail in criminal cases. People at home 
can see on TV what happens when witnesses do not want to 
remember anything or when  they cannot remember anything, all 
the pressure that can be brought to bear on people who want to help 
in the cause of justice, but are unable to because of constraints 
imposed on them.
<P>
	So Bill C-78 will remedy this to some extent. It should not be 
considered a magic formula, a miracle solution. I am one of those 
who believe that, in politics, nothing happens magically or gets 
done immediately, we progress by taking one small step at a time in 
the right direction. I consider this bill, Bill C-78, one such step and, 
in using it, we will see what sort of contribution it makes to 
changing criminal law, protecting witnesses and safeguarding 
justice in criminal matters.
<P>
	I also think there are two times, in particular, when witnesses 
need help. Before the trial, naturally. At that point, witnesses' 
material security must be looked after, and they must be given 
effective protection. In some instances, they literally have to be 
hidden for their own protection-I hope it is with their 
approval-so they may give proper testimony, which will give a 
court of law the opportunity to assess the quality of the testimony 
and decide whether the Crown has presented beyond any 
reasonable doubt the necessary evidence. We must not forget that, 
under our system, the burden of proof is on the Crown. And the 
burden is enormous. The slightest failure in this regard inevitably 
leads to the acquittal of the accused.
<P>
<B>(1045)</B>
<P>
	In the case of heinous crimes-I will address drugs and 
organized crime later-the mere disappearance of witnesses can 
raise a reasonable doubt. Often, if witnesses, who may or may not 
show up in court, disappear, the prosecution will simply have to 
rise and tell the court that they have no evidence to offer. This can 
only lead to an acquittal since there is no evidence. We must then 
provide protection for witnesses before the trial.
<P>
	Protecting witnesses before the trial is not enough, however, we 
must also protect them after the trial, after the verdict, whether it is 
a verdict of guilty or not guilty, because there is no guarantee that 
the testimony of a witness protected under the provisions of Bill 
C-78 will be enough to convict someone. The bill must allow 
witness protection authorities to assure witnesses that if they testify 
at the trial, they will be protected whether the accused is found 
guilty or not guilty, because witnesses' safety cannot be 
compromised whatever the verdict.
<P>
	I mentioned it earlier but it always bears repeating: In some 
cases, because of our legislation-I am not questioning our 
Criminal Code in any way-because of the presumption of 
innocence and the resulting reasonable doubt, there may be an 
acquittal even if the witness is protected. We must therefore 
provide for the reintegration of those witnesses who have secured 
convictions or 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15257"> 15257 </A></B>
<P>
who have failed to do so through no fault  of their own because of 
the way the evidence was reviewed.
<P>
	In closing, I wish to express my support for Bill C-78 at second 
reading and to issue a warning against what we too often see in 
some courts of law that are probably trying to proceed too quickly. 
A famous trial recently held in Canada showed us that the 
prosecution is often much too eager to plea-bargain with some 
witnesses to get them to testify against their codefendants, an 
arrangement through which a person pleads guilty to a lesser 
offence or an offence included in a more serious offence in return 
for a lighter sentence and a promise to testify against targeted 
people for whom the prosecution wants stiffer sentences.
<P>
	In some cases, this practice is quite commendable; in other 
cases, it is, in my opinion, quite reprehensible. And I do not think 
that good judgment can be guaranteed by a bill. I call on the 
solicitor general, on provincial attorney generals, who must deal 
with these issues practically every day, to use as much common 
sense as possible when plea-bargaining with witnesses, many of 
whom are corrupt, who will testify against codefendants in return 
for a more lenient sentence. This practice deserves a serious 
examination. It must be the subject of wide criticism and of a broad 
national debate.
<P>
	What do we expect from our judicial system? Our judicial 
system does not make enough room for victims. We, of course, 
give the accused all the benefits provided by our laws, by our 
charter of rights and freedoms. We must, however, give victims in 
criminal cases the importance they deserve. As we heard several 
times in the Standing Committee on Justice and Legal Affairs, 
victims of crime very often feel left out. A crime has been 
committed but the victims are the least of our concerns. It is all 
well and good to be concerned about witness protection. I 
nonetheless think that people who have lost a loved one-be it a 
spouse, a child, a friend or a relative-to murder are entitled to 
some compassion.
<P>
<B>(1050)</B>
<P>
	On these words, I will ask the government to provide protection, 
to provide a much greater compensation for victims.
<P>

<P>
	<B>Mr. Myron Thompson (Wild Rose, Ref.):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
believe I have 40 minutes. If so, I will be sharing my time with the 
member for Fraser Valley West.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> Does the hon. member 
have unanimous consent of the House to share his 40 minutes as 
first speaker?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Thompson:</B> Madam Speaker, at the outset I congratulate the 
member for Scarborough West for initiating this topic through his 
private member's bill. It needed to be done and it brought the 
attention of the  government to the fact there was a shortfall in our 
system regarding the protection of witnesses.
<P>
	It is unfortunate that such members are no longer part of the 
justice committee. He is a member who contributed much, who 
understood much about legislation and who was able to formulate 
this kind of initiative. I am sure he would be able to do more in the 
future. However, since he does not co-operate with his Liberal 
caucus when voting on some bills, he will no longer be serving on 
the justice committee. It is a shame that we have that situation in 
Canada, but unfortunately that is the way it will be with the Liberal 
government. However I am sure the hon. colleague will be 
contributing as much as possible in the future along these lines.
<P>
	We must protect our witnesses if we are to combat crime. I do 
not think anyone would deny that. The colleague from the Bloc 
mentioned the words common sense, which are the two key words. 
We must protect our witnesses and we must do it in a common 
sense manner. We have to take many things into consideration 
when we are doing it.
<P>
	We all know the importance of witnesses when it comes to 
fighting crime. It is much easier when we have good witnesses to 
help put away criminals that need to be put away. We also know it 
is foolish to enter into any kind of special agreement with 
individuals. We only need to look to the latest court case involving 
Mr. Bernardo and Ms. Homolka. Providing for and doing what we 
did for the witness, Karla Homolka, in that case was a criminal act 
in itself. We need to be cautious when doing these kinds of 
activities, which could make it very possible that someone who is 
guilty of an offence would be let off the hook under a protection act 
for witnesses. We need to be careful about that.
<P>
	There are a lot of crazies out there in the world who are in it for 
the dollars. They are willing to eliminate witnesses. We know they 
are out there. We know we have some in the prisons today. I talked 
to one inmate not too long ago in British Columbia who was there 
for eliminating a couple of witnesses; he was a paid hit man. We 
know there are more of them out there. We know that organized 
crime is becoming more and more active with the bombings that 
we see going on throughout Montreal and other parts of the country 
and with the smuggling that is taking place only an hour's drive 
from here, which occurs on a regular basis. When we know that 
kind of organized crime is active then we have to be very careful 
when we bring forward witnesses that may crunch organized crime. 
We certainly must have some kind of protection in place, because 
the criminals would be willing to eliminate the witnesses rather 
quickly to protect the huge industry that exists.
<P>
<B>(1055 )</B>
<P>
	It is unfortunate that we have a government, a solicitor general 
and a minister of justice who sit back and watch  these kinds of 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15258"> 15258 </A></B>
<P>
activities go on and do not seem willing to get involved or do much 
about them. It is a shame when we pick up the paper and read about 
bombings taking place in Canada by terrorists, thugs and organized 
criminals, and we have a government that sits back and the best it 
can come up with is that it is a provincial matter and we should not 
get involved. It is a very poor attitude and a real lack of intestinal 
fortitude when it comes to saying that we will take the bull by the 
horns and make our streets and our communities safer.
<P>
	It is unfortunate the solicitor general alluded in his speech to all 
the wonderful things the Liberal government has done through 
Bills C-45, C-41, C-37 and C-68, to name a few. That just is not so. 
The House knows and all the people across Canada know that a 
number of things were attempted with the particular bills to make 
them better, to put the victim first. We also know that in every 
instance when there was a motion put forward in Bill C-45, which 
was simply geared to making things better for the victims of our 
country, the government turned them down and did not vote for one 
of them, not one.
<P>
	It is silly for the minister to stand in his place to try to convince 
Canadians that he is doing a wonderful job when he turns down 
such things as mandatory restitution and then says that mandatory 
restitution is taken care of in Bill C-41. That is just not so.
<P>
	The government is saying that it is up to a judge: if the judge 
wants to order it then he can do so and then things will take place 
and the restitution will happen. That just is not the case. We know 
that judges today can tell people that they will have to make 
restitution, but it does not mean anything. There is no enforcement. 
We cannot get blood out of a rock.
<P>
	When we suggest that we will take part of the money we will pay 
them when they are in the penitentiary to put to the use of victims it 
is turned down. I guess it makes too much sense. It is something 
Canadians want.
<P>
	Governments in the past 30 years are used to passing all kinds of 
legislation: if the people want it, do not do it, and if the people do 
not want it then make sure we do it. GST and all these other things 
apply to that.
<P>
	It is unfortunate that during his speech the solicitor general 
alluded to the fact that these other bills were contributing to the 
safety of Canadians. He mentioned Bill C-37, the improvements to 
the Young Offenders Act. If Bill C-37 was such a wonderful 
improvement, I wonder if someone on the other side of the House 
could tell me why the Minister of Justice asked the justice 
committee to put on their parachutes and fly around the country. 
They are flying all over Canada and are asking people once again 
what they would like to do with young offenders. They are 
spending lots of money going through a process that is totally 
unnecessary.
<P>
	If we put each member on the justice committee on a street 
corner in any city to talk to the grassroots, the people who are 
closest to these crimes, about what should be done with the Young 
Offenders Act, I am quite certain they would get an answer. For a 
fact thousands and thousands of letters have been received from 
across the country telling the minister and others what to do with 
the Young Offenders Act. We have had petitions galore, with 
millions of signatures suggesting that we get rid of the Young 
Offenders Act or fix it. It has been ignored. Bill C-37 did not 
address that.
<P>
	The government went through the process of getting Bill C-37 
passed and then it turned around and sent the justice committee 
across the country to ask people what to do about young offenders.
<P>
	To stand in the House and say ``we did it, we got Bill C-37, aren't 
we wonderful'' is just a bunch of baloney. I am really tired of 
hearing people in the House saying what a wonderful job the 
government is doing in fighting crime and keeping its red book 
commitment. That is not so. There is so much more the government 
could do but it does not dare.
<P>
<B>(1100 )</B>
<P>
	I will admit that Bill C-78 makes total sense. It is something 
Canadians want. I congratulate the government for at least bringing 
forward one bill that will protect the right individuals, potential 
victims and witnesses rather than criminals.
<P>
	The rights of criminals have always been up front, first and 
foremost. That has been the biggest worry for the government over 
the past 30 years, particularly in the last few years since the charter 
of rights has come into being. It must protect the criminal. There 
seems to be such a terrible amount of emphasis on that. It becomes 
really sickening. With Bill C-78 I say that at last we have 
something concrete and will protect the right people.
<P>
	I should like to put a proposal to the government. When it is 
doing legislation in the future, the first thing to be written down in 
the legislation should be the word victim, the law-abiding people, 
the ones we need to look after. They are the most important people 
and criminals should be put somewhere else. Yes, nobody denies 
that we should look after the basic rights of the criminal. But, for 
crying out loud, we must remember the victims and do what can be 
done in all legislation to protect them.
<P>
	Liberals stand in the House to tell us about the wonderful gun 
legislation. Somebody tell me what kind of balance is 17 pages 
which address the criminal versus 160 pages which go after 
law-abiding people. The document is so thick we cannot carry 
more than three or four. It is so expensive that we cannot order very 
many for our constituents to look at because of the cost. That 
document is full of regulations and all kinds of things law-abiding 
people are expected to do.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15259"> 15259 </A></B>
<P>
	In the meantime there are individuals running around the 
country who are armed better than most military units. I see 
nothing being done about the real problems, but I constantly see 
all kinds of legislation coming forward that is not doing what it 
could for victims and law-abiding people. Instead the government 
concentrates on making certain that things are done right 
according to the charter so that the criminals are forever looked 
after. Canadians are getting tired of it.
<P>
	I will conclude and turn it over to my colleague for Fraser Valley 
West by saying that Bill C-78 is the kind of bill we are most happy 
to support. I thank the government for bringing it forward. Once 
again, I thank my colleague for Scarborough West, the initiator of 
the whole idea. I hope we will see more legislation that says 
victims come first and not the criminals.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Randy White (Fraser Valley West, Ref.):</B> Madam Speaker, 
it is a pleasure to speak on Bill C-78 today. As my colleague for 
Wild Rose said, it is one of the few pieces of legislation we have 
seen in the criminal justice system today from the Liberal 
government which actually directly and successfully address a 
concern we have in our society, the protection of witnesses.
<P>
	The protection of witnesses is actually quite an informal 
program today managed by the RCMP. Certainly there is no 
overriding national program that looks after the interests of the 
victim.
<P>
	Regardless of what the government says, it is necessary to take 
the country back from the criminal element. Time and time again I 
hear that crime is not on the increase. I would denounce that theory 
of the government. We only have to stand in a circle of friends 
anywhere in the country and ask who has been the victim of a 
crime. I am not just talking about serious sexual crimes or the high 
profile crimes we see in Vancouver, Toronto and so on. I am talking 
about major everyday crime: break and enters, stolen vehicles and 
so on.
<P>
<B>(1105)</B>
<P>
	We have to somehow get to the nub of the issue. We have to get 
back to punishment for disobeying laws. That includes actually 
getting the criminal incarcerated.
<P>
	A victims protection act gives confidence to those out there who 
are intimidated by the process. It gives them some confidence of 
protection. I can think of several instances in my community which 
I have been involved with where intimidation was a very large part 
of an exercise of the criminal.
<P>
	I can think of a lady named Joan who was sexually assaulted by a 
pretty hardened individual who had spent more time on the inside 
than on the outside. He has been in and out of parole board 
hearings. Every time he gets out, he commits another crime and 
goes back in.
<P>
	This time good old Karel sexually assaulted Joan with a weapon. 
The weapon was a needle with cocaine in it.  Joan was 63 years old. 
All through the process, through the court hearings and so on when 
I was there with Joan, the individual was intimidating her by way 
of looks and other things that were done. The intimidation was 
there.
<P>
	Not only did it happen in the courtroom but subsequent to his 
incarceration when he was in Vancouver remand waiting for his 
little trip to the regional psychiatric centre, good old Karel started 
to send threatening letters to Joan. It just brought home to me very 
clearly why witnesses need protection. Joan had no one to look 
after her.
<P>
	We finally got the letters stopped. Imagine, he was in Vancouver 
remand for such a horrendous crime and used stamps paid for by 
the taxpayer to threaten the very person he attacked. That is the 
kind of thing which is going on.
<P>
	Hopefully Bill C-78 will do something about those sorts of 
things. There are other people who need protection. Joan was not 
only a witness but was a victim at the same time. There are people 
who see things today and are just plain afraid to take that step 
forward because of the intimidation.
<P>
	Along with my colleague from Wild Rose, I spent some time 
yesterday with the mayor of Cornwall who has some serious 
problems in that community. There are serious criminal activities. 
He is a pretty sure and very responsible individual. I am certain that 
with the intimidation he has been under, the threats and so on, there 
are times that people like him who want to stand up for their 
community and provide public service but are being threatened by 
gangs and organized crime need formal protection.
<P>
	The mayor of Cornwall and other brave individuals who are 
willing to stand up and be counted and people who witness the 
crimes that are going on down there right off the reserves need the 
protection. They need the confidence they will get the protection.
<P>
	The witness protection program will strengthen the existing 
RCMP source witness protection program. Hopefully the process 
will be formalized so that both the witness and the RCMP know 
and understand it. It is a loose program today. People do not 
understand their rights.
<P>
<B>(1110)</B>
<P>
	Victims rights do not discontinue with such things as witness 
protection programs. There are all kinds of other things which also 
need attention as far as victims rights go. There will be a victims 
rights bill in the House of Commons this year. Within that bill there 
are things that have to be addressed.
<P>
	For instance, victims should have the right to give oral and 
written statements at parole board hearings. Today they are at times 
allowed a written statement but in many cases the statements are 
vetted. I have seen victims'  statements in sentencing hearings of 
murder cases. I am not a lawyer but I attend these cases when my 
riding is involved. I was at one where the victim's statement was 
actually vetted which is wrong. The Liberal government has to 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15260"> 15260 </A></B>
<P>
understand that victims should have the right to have oral and 
written statements put forward.
<P>
	There are other things about the criminal justice system that 
have just got to be said. It is about the intimidation of witnesses. I 
am looking here at a document produced by a colleague on the 
government side concerning judicial review decisions of people 
who were sentenced to death. That sentence was revoked and put 
into the current life sentence, which is 25 years, and now under 
section 745 the sentencing decision is being reduced further. That 
is appalling. It is truly appalling to be reducing these sentences.
<P>
	Let me give two examples in which I was involved. Dwight 
Lucas was sentenced to 20 years for a non-capital murder. That was 
reduced to 16 years. An individual from Quebec has had his 
25-year sentence for killing a police officer reduced to 15 years. At 
the time of the killing the individual would have been put to death 
but they said: ``No, we will make it 25 years''. Now, after time has 
gone by, the individual's sentence has been reduced to 15 years. 
That is wrong. These people are out on the streets and ultimately, 
when other crimes are committed, witnesses are going to need 
protection against the very people we are letting out who should not 
have been let out in the first place.
<P>
	The thinking over there is truly convoluted. It does not wash 
with the greater portion of people. The government thinks it is 
right. What is it going to take to convince the Liberal government 
that its laws in the criminal justice system are just too liberal?
<P>
	It will take a removal of the government in the next election. For 
those folk who are listening, it will come down to some very 
specific issues in the next election: the economy, the criminal 
justice system and just how democratic or undemocratic the 
process in the House of Commons actually is.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Thompson:</B> The pensions.
<P>
	<B>Mr. White (Fraser Valley West):</B> The MPs pensions, my 
colleague from Wild Rose said. That will always be an issue. Since 
he has mentioned it, I did wear my piggy tie for those who are still 
involved in the MPs pension plan, just so people would notice. I 
had not thought of that until they raised it.
<P>
<B>(1115)</B>
<P>
	There are times when we have to use a crook to catch a crook and 
we have to use the information they have as witnesses. Yes, 
unfortunately some of those individuals get off from their crimes 
and some of those people have to be under a witness protection act. 
I suppose the end justifies the means in that case. However there 
are a lot more people out there today witnessing crimes who are  
just too intimidated to do anything about it. All I ask is that the 
Liberal government follow through with a thorough witness 
protection act and regulations that are well meaning and protect the 
witness.
<P>
	We do not need rhetoric such as we heard on the Young 
Offenders Act when government members said they had made 
great changes. They did not. We do not need rhetoric like that. We 
need to do Bill C-78 right. We need to protect the good people who 
want to come forward.
<P>
	Members opposite are enjoying this. They say that they do things 
right. If they are doing things so right, why are there so many 
victims? If they are doing things right, why are there so many 
complaints about the Young Offenders Act, which was absolutely 
boggled by the Liberal government? If they are absolutely right 
about what they are doing, why is it that down in Cornwall the 
government does not have the courage of its convictions to go on to 
the reserve and end the crime wave? Why is that? If they are doing 
things right, why is that? That kept them quiet for a moment.
<P>
	What is wrong is the government is very long on rhetoric and 
very short on dealing with the actual problems. It does not have the 
courage to go on to the reservations to deal with the crime rate. 
Meanwhile the people off reserve are suffering from the crime 
wave. Where do they think the drugs are coming from that are in 
the schools in Cornwall? They know where they are coming from. 
Where do they think the guns are coming from?
<P>
	This is not something we dreamed up. We were down there 
listening. The government is not listening. It should get up the 
courage to go on to some of the reservations and deal with 
organized crime. That the government is doing something is 
hogwash. It is doing nothing.
<P>
	I am glad we had this little chat, but it is more than a little chat 
members opposite need. People who are listening to this debate 
will understand that there is a big difference between being long on 
rhetoric and short on action. This will haunt the Liberal Party in the 
next election. The treatment that victims are getting today from 
government legislation is abysmal. That is why there are groups 
like Victims of Violence, CRY and CAVEAT. They are springing up 
all across the country. They know that the legislation the 
government puts through is wrong.
<P>
	I have a few notes about Bill C-45.
<P>
<B>(1120 )</B>
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> I remind the member we 
are discussing Bill C-78.
<P>
	<B>Mr. White (Fraser Valley West):</B> Madam Speaker, I got carried 
away, because none of the bills they have put forward so far are any 
good. I am surprised that Bill C-78 is something I can agree with.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15261"> 15261 </A></B>
<P>
	When we talk about compensation for crimes, the government 
comes up with things like 30 per cent of their income for room 
and board. What the government does not come up with is what 
kind of income they are getting. Government members say it is 
$5.61 a day, but they discount the fact that they get GST rebates, 
old age pension, CPP and the guaranteed income supplement. 
They discount that.
<P>
	There is nothing more that can be said. I would agree with Bill 
C-78, but the Young Offenders Act, Bill C-45, Bill C-41 and all 
these other acts are abysmally poor. We cannot deal with the 
problems in the criminal justice system by dealing with one Bill 
C-78, which is only a small portion of what is needed, and by 
working in a very poor fashion on the other bills. They should not 
take credit for something until they do it 100 per cent right, not 3 
per cent right.
<P>
	What more can we say? The only way to get through their thick 
heads is to replace them, and that we will do in the next election.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Peter Milliken (Parliamentary Secretary to Leader of 
the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I rise to participate in the debate following the remarks of 
the hon. member for Fraser Valley West. I will try to draw the 
debate back to the bill before us, instead of the scatter gun 
treatment we have had all over the place on all the other legislation 
the hon. member says he does not like. When he gets a good bill he 
does not know what to say; he is almost tongue tied. I sympathize 
with him, but I want to address my remarks to Bill C-78, the 
witness protection program act, which is the one we are debating in 
the House of Commons today.
<P>
	The purpose of Bill C-78 is to establish a solid legislative and 
regulatory basis for the RCMP source witness protection program. 
This is necessary to ensure that our national witness protection 
program offers the best protection possible to potential sources and 
witnesses. Given the importance of the program and the fact that 
we are strengthening it and making it more open and accountable, it 
would be useful to provide the House with a brief historical 
overview of the RCMP source witness protection program and 
some background that went into the development of the witness 
protection program act.
<P>
	I am sorry the hon. members find this so amusing. I do not think 
it is.
<P>
	Historically witness protection programs are most closely 
associated with the investigation of organized crime. The term 
organized crime covers a broad range of criminal activity, 
including large scale drug trafficking, murder, serious assault, 
money laundering, extortion and robbery.
<P>
	I wish hon. members would restrain themselves. They seem to 
treat serious legislation as a joke. The hon. member for Fraser 
Valley West in his remarks did not  talk about the bill, and I did not 
find his remarks amusing.
<P>
	The hon. member says that the speech was written for me. I am 
assisting the solicitor general in my capacity as his parliamentary 
secretary today. I am trying to impart information to the House 
concerning the bill so that hon. members perhaps will make more 
enlightened comments later. I wish the hon. member for Fraser 
Valley West had not split his time. He could have made his remarks 
after mine and would have benefited from listening.
<P>
	As often as not, the crimes committed by these organized groups 
go hand in hand with the use of fear and intimidation to ensure the 
silence of potential witnesses and informants.
<P>
<B>(1125 )</B>
<P>
	Using a broad definition of organized crime, it can be said that at 
the present time approximately 50 per cent of RCMP source 
witness protection program cases deal with organized crime. 
However witness protection today has a broader application. The 
disturbing trend in recent years has been the use of fear and 
intimidation by lone criminals. These people are willing to go to 
any lengths to avoid conviction or to extract retribution from 
witnesses. As a result a growing number of people need protection 
as a result of their role in cases that have nothing to do with 
organized crime.
<P>
	To deal with the growing need for witness and source protection, 
and in response to increased enforcement priority placed on 
fighting major national and international drug trafficking 
organizations, the RCMP source witness protection program was 
started in 1984. Although originally intended for the use of the 
RCMP alone, the program now provides protective services to 
provincial and municipal police forces across Canada. While many 
police forces rely entirely on the RCMP for witness protection 
services, some of the larger police departments have formed their 
own witness protection units. These larger police services usually 
come to the RCMP for assistance in cases where federal help is 
needed to facilitate a change of identity for a witness or an 
informant.
<P>
	Most people entering the RCMP source witness protection 
program in the mid-1980s were associated with major drug 
trafficking activities. However, as I mentioned a moment ago, this 
has changed of late. Today a growing proportion of people entering 
the program have been involved in Criminal Code offences such as 
murder and serious assault. Since starting the source witness 
protection program the RCMP has built up an infrastructure of 
experienced members and contacts. RCMP members are available 
in every province and territory to support witness relocations and 
protection, to obtain secure identity changes, and to help obtain the 
necessary provincial documents to authenticate those changes.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15262"> 15262 </A></B>
<P>
	At headquarters in Ottawa RCMP members have developed 
national RCMP witness protection policy procedures and contacts 
to facilitate the changes that must be made within numerous 
federal government data banks when a witness or an informant 
receives a new identity.
<P>
	The annual cost of the RCMP witness protection program is $3.4 
million. As my learned friend, the solicitor general, has already 
pointed out, no additional costs are expected as a result of the 
legislation. The average cost per case is $30,000 and approximately 
60 per cent of cases cost less than $20,000.
<P>
	At any given time there are approximately 80 to 100 people, 
including family members, in the program. The success of the 
RCMP source witness protection program speaks for itself. Of the 
large number of witnesses, informants and their families who have 
been relocated since the program began, none has come to any 
harm. It is difficult to establish precise conviction statistics for 
cases involving protected witnesses. However, based on available 
data, approximately 85 per cent to 90 per cent of cases involving 
witness protection result in convictions, usually because of the 
testimony of the protected person.
<P>
	From my brief remarks I am sure the hon. members can 
appreciate how important the witness source protection program is 
as a law enforcement tool. There is no more devastating evidence 
than the firsthand testimony of a trusted accomplice exposing the 
inner workings of a criminal organization or that of a witness who 
has seen a serious crime take place and can identify the 
perpetrators. Whether a witness or an informant, these individuals 
are invaluable assets of the police and the judicial system.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	That is why it is our responsibility, as legislators, to do 
everything possible to ensure that our national witness protection 
program is as efficient and effective as it can be. It is for this 
purpose that the government is introducing this bill.
<P>
<B>(1130)</B>
<P>
	The proposed legislation was drafted in consultation with all 
major stakeholders and after all issues had been thoroughly 
examined. In my view, it is particularly important to point out that 
police forces across the country were consulted. In 1992, a 
questionnaire was sent out to about 400 municipal and provincial 
police forces in the country.
<P>
	Our goal was to assess how much protection witnesses were 
afforded, determine the types of offences being committed and 
nature of the protection provided, examine the problems facing 
service users and recommend improvements. We also conducted a 
comprehensive review of witness protection programs in  place in 
other countries, particularly the U.S., United Kingdom and 
Australia.
<P>
	Bill C-78 incorporates the results of the analysis performed on 
the data collected and the lessons drawn from this extensive 
research. In short, this bill is the result of many years of research 
and effort and it will ensure that our national witness protection 
program remains modern and effective. Under the provisions of the 
bill, our program will continue to provide safe and effective 
support to witnesses under protection while at the same time 
remaining open and transparent.
<P>
	Witness protection in itself will not check violent crime or 
organized crime. But it is nonetheless a major element of the 
investigative techniques available to law enforcement officials and 
a tool very useful to police in fighting against organized crime and 
major criminal activity in Canada. We must therefore make sure 
that it remains such a tool.
<P>
	The solicitor general has already given the House the broad 
outlines of the bill and proposed changes to the RCMP's 
sources-witness protection program. All hon. members will agree 
that the need for such changes is crystal-clear. It only remains for 
me to associate myself with the closing remarks made by the 
solicitor general and urge all hon. members to ensure the speedy 
passage of Bill C-78.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Ms. Shaughnessy Cohen (Windsor-St. Clair, Lib.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I am pleased to have the opportunity to speak on Bill 
C-78. I sought the opportunity because over the past 15 years I have 
been active as a lawyer in the criminal justice system. As a lawyer I 
have worked with witnesses in court, as a defence counsel, as a 
crown prosecutor for the provincial government of Ontario and as a 
crown prosecutor for the federal government.
<P>
	On other occasions I have worked as counsel for witnesses who 
were involved in witness protection programs. I have had the 
opportunity to see firsthand what happens to a person, particularly 
a member of the public, who becomes a witness and to people in 
the past who became involved in our less formal former witness 
protection program. I have also seen what happens when a witness 
is intimidated or when an accused person or a person involved in 
crime attempts to intimidate a witness.
<P>
	It is now past the time when we should come forward and set out 
some clear legislation, some clear rules and clear guidelines and 
regulations to deal with persons who find themselves in the very 
delicate and very dangerous position of being a witness and being 
subject to duress and penalty from those who would seek to quiet 
them.
<P>
	Criminals have successfully utilized fear and intimidation of 
potential witnesses to avoid prosecution and punishment for their 
criminal acts. Individuals will go to great lengths to avoid convic-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15263"> 15263 </A></B>
<P>
tion or to exact violent retribution from witnesses. We have 
recognized this. We  have worked with this in the system for a long 
time. We now recognize that enforcement agencies need the 
support and the assistance of the public to further their 
investigations and to achieve success in their efforts to bring 
criminals to justice.
<P>
<B>(1135)</B>
<P>
	That support would not be forthcoming in the absence of 
programs designed to ensure the safety of those citizens prepared to 
get involved by providing information or testifying against 
criminals.
<P>
	Witnesses are the ultimate public servants. They are people 
without whom we could not operate our criminal justice system 
and without whom we could not bring criminals to the courts and to 
justice. Witnesses fall into several categories. There are witnesses 
who are paid to be witnesses and who receive salaries for that, 
public servants, police officers, investigators at Revenue Canada or 
at Canada Customs, investigators in various forms of activities that 
could result in criminal prosecutions. These people are accustomed 
to dealing with criminals. They also have a role in life that allows 
them within the system to have the protection of their office and the 
protection of their job.
<P>
	On the other end of the spectrum there are ordinary citizens who 
by coincidence or accident find themselves witnesses to crimes: 
somebody is walking down the street and they see a bank robber 
getting away or they witness a car accident in which one of the 
drivers was criminally negligent or drunk.
<P>
	Some members of the public become witnesses by virtue of their 
status as victims of crime. These witnesses by and large come 
forward and provide a tremendous public service with little 
concern for their own personal safety as a result of their testimony.
<P>
	Witnesses who may have been involved with organized crime or 
other forms of criminal activity and who come forward, as much as 
they may want to come forward, have their lives affected adversely. 
These are people who live under threat, people who live in fear of 
some kind of punishment from those they would seek to accuse or 
witness against.
<P>
	There are also witnesses we seek out, we being the government 
or the agency doing the investigation. These witnesses fall into the 
general loose category of informants, paid informants or sources. It 
is an unfortunate fact of life that sometimes we have to go to 
criminals to bring criminals to justice. Sometimes we have to go to 
people involved in an activity to have their assistance in bringing to 
justice the main perpetrators.
<P>
	The legislation is intended to cover these people and to protect 
them in the event their lives are in danger. The legislation will 
cover agents who participate in investigations as well as 
informants.
<P>
	The witness protection program act defines a witness as a person 
who has given or who has agreed to give information or evidence or 
has agreed to participate in a matter relating to an inquiry or the 
investigation or prosecution of an offence whose security is at risk 
as a result. Also included in the definition are persons who may 
require protection due to their relationship to or association with 
the people previously mentioned.
<P>
	We are talking about people who by accident or on purpose 
become involved in an investigation and who are under duress from 
those who would be investigated as a result. Protection under the 
act can include relocation, accommodation, change of identity, 
counselling, financial support for those people or for any other 
purpose in order to ensure their security and to facilitate their 
re-establishment or their becoming self-sufficient. It covers a wide 
range of services that can be provided.
<P>
<B>(1140)</B>
<P>
	Not everyone involved in the witness protection program will 
live a secret existence in the future. They may simply require 
counselling or assistance to get on with their lives after the trauma 
of having dealt with this.
<P>
	We know from previous speakers that the annual cost of the 
protection program is $3.4 million and that there will be no 
additional costs as a result of the legislation.
<P>
	The legislation clearly defines what is expected of the 
government and what is expected of the witnesses as a result of this 
program. In the past there has been a problem because our program 
has been informal and because the program has been allowed to 
change with particular circumstances.
<P>
	As a result there have been complaints from those who are 
protected and from the RCMP which administers the program that 
people's expectations are not being met and that the RCMP needs 
assistance in defining how far it can go and what it should do to 
protect the witness.
<P>
	The new legislation will ensure a clear defined admission policy 
for witnesses, consistent treatment of cases across the country, a 
clear setting out of responsibilities and obligations of 
administrators of the plan and protectees entering the program, and 
a more defined management structure within the RCMP for the 
daily operation of the program, thereby increasing accountability.
<P>
	This is an important section. I recall dealing with a witness who 
was under protection and who was having difficulty within the 
system making contact with someone to assist her or to give some 
answers on some information she required. Even as a lawyer it was 
a bit of a nightmare trying to get through the maze of 
administration to find someone who could assist her with her 
problem. The 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15264"> 15264 </A></B>
<P>
more clearly defined management structure within the RCMP will 
assist to straighten that out.
<P>
	A complaints procedure will be in place and the commissioner of 
the RCMP will submit to the solicitor general an annual report on 
the operation of the program.
<P>
	During 1994 and 1995 we have provided protective services to 
70 new witnesses, 30 of whom were referred by other agencies. The 
$3.4 million we are spending annually on the program will not 
increase as a result of the change in administration but the money 
will be spent more effectively. It will be spent more clearly on 
guaranteeing the safety of the witnesses.
<P>
	It is important for the public to understand and appreciate that 
the witness protection program operates across the country, but it 
does not operate in a vacuum. In devising the statute and in setting 
out the scheme in the act we have consulted all the provinces and 
territories.
<P>
	When someone applies for the program or when a decision is 
made to admit an applicant to the program, the following factors 
will be taken into consideration: the potential contribution the 
witness or source can make toward a police investigation; the 
nature of the offence under investigation; the nature of the risk to 
the individual; what alternate methods of protection are available; 
the danger to the community if the individual is admitted to the 
program; the potential effects on any family arrangements; the 
likelihood of the individual's being able to adjust; their maturity, 
their ability to make judgments and other personal characteristics; 
the cost of maintaining the individual in the program; and other 
factors the commissioner of the RCMP finds relevant.
<P>
	It is important that there be a clear, defined decision making 
process to admit an individual into the program. In serious cases 
such as those requiring a change of identity or an admission of a 
foreign applicant, the decision to admit an individual will be made 
only by the assistant commissioner in charge of the program. A 
decision to terminate protection must also be made by the assistant 
commissioner.
<P>
	This is only part of the Liberal safe streets, safe neighbourhoods 
program. Obviously we need statutes like this. No matter how 
much serious crime there is, we know there always will be crime 
and there always will be a need to protect people.
<P>
	When we are protecting people we need to be able to say to 
Canadians we are protecting people worthy of protection, that we 
are protecting people when there is a serious risk and that we have a 
clearly defined methodology for doing it. As the economy becomes 
healthier, as we work toward the creation of jobs and the creation of 
prosperous communities, we will find there will be less and less 
violent crime on our streets.
<P>
<B>(1145)</B>
<P>
	Those who would seek to encourage Canadians to believe that 
violent crime is increasing at the present time are being 
disingenuous because we know statistically and from crime reports 
that is not the case.
<P>
	The bill is not a response to the fearmongering that exists in 
certain quarters of society. It is a practical, concrete response to a 
need to clearly define and assist the criminal justice system in 
witness protection. It is a practical, pragmatic response to a 
situation we have been able to identify. It is part of the ongoing 
Liberal government plan for safe streets and safe communities in 
Canada.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Finestone (Secretary of State (Multiculturalism) 
(Status of Women), Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, I extend my gratitude 
to the Solicitor General of Canada for establishing a legislative 
base for the RCMP's source and witness protection program. I also 
assure him of my total support.
<P>
	It is another useful and effective tool for our law enforcement 
officials. It will reduce crime and make Canada a safer place for 
everyone.
<P>
	Our various colleagues in the House have defined the extent and 
content of the bill. I found the interventions of my colleagues very 
interesting. I particularly refer to the previous intervention by my 
colleague from Windsor.
<P>
	As my hon. colleague and the solicitor general have said, in the 
past criminals have successfully used fear and intimidation of 
potential witnesses to avoid prosecution and punishment for their 
crimes. Enforcement agencies need the support and assistance of 
the public to further their investigations to successfully bring 
criminals to justice.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The bill under examination today is aimed at improving the 
RCMP's witness and informant protection program, making it 
more effective and more open. Its intent is to protect those who 
assist our police forces in criminal investigations, particularly 
when organized crime is involved.
<P>
	It is an acknowledged fact that the contribution of informants 
and witnesses is often essential in resolving certain criminal 
investigations. The Quebec Minister of Public Security has, for 
instance, stated only a few days ago that the most effective means 
of curtailing the war between motorcycle gangs in Quebec is to 
recruit informants and witnesses. Those who cooperate with law 
enforcement agencies occasionally place themselves in dangerous 
positions as far as their personal safety is concerned, and we owe it 
to them to provide the best possible protection.
<P>
	In the past, some participants in the old sources and witnesses 
program have complained that they did not get the benefits they 
had been promised. This will not  happen any longer, because the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15265"> 15265 </A></B>
<P>
changes proposed today will ensure the application of clear and 
uniform criteria across the country.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The changes proposed by the witness protection program act will 
help ensure that both the applicants who enter the program and the 
RCMP which operates it have a clear understanding of their rights 
and obligations. The legislative initiative defines a range of 
protective services and benefits that can be provided. It makes the 
program more transparent and more accountable.
<P>
	The process of how one gets into the program has been clearly 
defined.
<P>
<B>(1150 )</B>
<P>
	A decision to admit an applicant to the RCMP SWPP, as it is 
called, will be based on the following factors: the potential 
contribution the witness source can make toward a particular police 
investigation; the nature of the offence under investigation; the 
nature of the risk to the individual; alternative methods of 
protection that are available; danger to the community if the 
individual is admitted to the program; the potential effects on any 
family relationships; the likelihood of the individual being able to 
adjust to the program, that is the maturity of that individual, the 
maturity of their judgment and other personal characteristics, as 
well as the cost of maintaining the individual in the program; and 
any other factor the commissioner of the RCMP may deem 
relevant.
<P>
	Under the witness protection act there will be a clear decision 
making process to admit an individual into the program. In serious 
cases such as those requiring a change of identity or admission of a 
foreign applicant, the decision to admit an individual can only be 
made by the assistant commissioner in charge of the program. A 
decision to terminate protection must also be made by the assistant 
commissioner. In less serious cases the decision to admit an 
individual can be taken at the chief superintendent level. There are 
protections built into the legislation.
<P>
	I am proud to say that more than any previous administration the 
government is committed to reducing violence in our society, 
specifically violence against women and crime motivated by hatred 
or bias against any of the vulnerable groups, particularly those 
which are listed in section 15 of the charter.
<P>
	Violence is not a phenomenon that can be encompassed or dealt 
with in one big bold stroke. It is a complex problem with multiple 
causes and multiple effects. It touches all levels of society and all 
regions of the country. The whole program was worked out with all 
regions of the country, from the Atlantic to the Pacific to the 
Arctic, and that includes Quebec in the portrait. That is why the 
government is taking a comprehensive approach involving several 
federal departments.
<P>
	In the past year a whole series of measures have been tabled by 
ministers, reinforcing our commitment to address the problem of 
violence. As the solicitor general has said, the government has 
instituted many new measures to make our homes and our streets 
safer. Members will recall that in our red book, safe homes and safe 
streets was one of our major undertakings and a commitment which 
we have met with great sincerity and alacrity.
<P>
	I mention a few measures which are extremely important to 
women: measures against criminal harassment, commonly called 
the anti-stalking law; the firearms control legislation; the reform of 
the sentencing process; and the reform of the Young Offenders Act.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	These widely varying initiatives have one common goal: to 
reduce violence and crime in our society. That objective is, 
moreover, set out clearly in the federal gender equality plan 
prepared under the auspices of the commission on the status of 
women, for which I am secretary of state, and tabled early this 
summer. Cabinet has been solidly behind this undertaking.
<P>
	The federal plan also calls for the Canadian government to 
undertake a comparative analysis by gender of all of these 
initiatives. A similar endorsement was given at the fourth 
international congress for women in Beijing. This comparative 
analysis by gender indicates how policies affect men and women 
differently. I must say that I see this as an eminently logical 
undertaking.
<P>
	In some cases, these differences are central to policy and play a 
determining role in its application. In others they have a minor 
impact and are only one of a series of factors that must be taken 
into consideration.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	In the spirit of the federal plan for gender equality we must 
ensure that the specific needs of women who qualify are considered 
in the application of the RCMP sources and witness protection 
program. We have a tendency to think of the world of criminals and 
organized crime as a man's world, but that is not entirely true. 
Unfortunately hundreds of women are in contact with this violent 
world and many are dreaming of getting out of it, just like the men, 
if only they could do so safely.
<P>
<B>(1155 )</B>
<P>
	These women could become vital sources of information for 
police and prosecutors. However they are vulnerable to fear, to 
intimidation and blackmail. They have to think not only about their 
own personal safety but in most cases they also have to be 
concerned with the protection of their children.
<P>
	Women should know that under section 2 of the witness 
protection program act, protection may include relocation for 
themselves and their families, accommodation and change of 
identity, as well 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15266"> 15266 </A></B>
<P>
as  counselling and financial support. The objective of the program 
is to ensure the safety and the security of citizens, women and men, 
who assist police in their efforts to crack down on criminals. We all 
know this is a needed program and a needed access to information.
<P>
	The program will help them to re-establish in a new location and 
will support them until they become self-sufficient if they fulfil the 
criteria I outlined earlier in my remarks.
<P>
	All citizens who contribute to eradicating crime and violence 
from our society deserve our gratitude and support. We know that 
crime is on the decrease. Notwithstanding we will always have 
some individuals in society who will engage in abhorrent 
behaviour. We will always have those who will act outside the law 
in their selfish, personal interests. However initiatives such as this 
one will help to ensure society can be a caring, safe and just.
<P>
	In some cases contributions that witnesses will bring to the court 
on very dangerous criminals call for extraordinary courage. We 
want those citizens who have demonstrated their concern for safety 
and security in the home, in the marketplace and on our streets to 
receive the best possible protection. No other program has been so 
comprehensive or so considerate of the needs of our citizenry. That 
is why I support the solicitor general's initiative.
<P>
	I hope that all my colleagues in the House, particularly those 
who have been expressing their concerns on individual cases, will 
look at this collective undertaking, support it wholeheartedly and 
join in ensuring a speedy passage of Bill C-78.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Geoff Regan (Halifax West, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, I am 
very pleased to speak today on Bill C-78 which is really about 
public safety. This must be very rewarding for my colleague from 
Scarborough West considering his diligence in bringing this vital 
matter to the government's attention. His efforts in this regard are 
certainly commendable.
<P>
	The debate on private member's bill last spring and the previous 
fall showed great evidence of support on both sides of the House 
for the bill and for what he was trying to do. The debate on Bill 
C-206 demonstrated there is really a clear need for a legislated 
protection program for witnesses and sources in criminal cases.
<P>
	It seems that demonstrated there was a clear desire by members 
of Parliament for such a program. One of the reasons for the desire 
and the need for the legislative program is that there have been 
some problems in the past. For example, at times there have been 
misunderstandings between the police and a witness or a source 
about what the agreement was between them, or what the roles of 
each was and what their responsibilities were. It is important that 
the bill clarify some of the  rights, responsibilities and obligations 
on both sides in these matters.
<P>
	In my view the solicitor general is to be commended for 
responding to an obvious need to bring about changes to the decade 
old program. Many people may not realize there is a witness 
protection program within the RCMP that has been active and 
operating for quite a few years. Also many programs are operated 
by municipal and provincial police forces across the country.
<P>
<B>(1200 )</B>
<P>
	The solicitor general is to be commended for responding to the 
obvious need to bring about changes to this decade old program. 
We see his response today in Bill C-78, which is now before us. 
The bill is really another plank in the government's efforts to deal 
with crime.
<P>
	I will give some examples of how we have dealt with crime in 
various ways over the past couple of years. There have been 
amendments to the Young Offenders Act. In fact I am looking 
forward to attending a forum in my area in Dartmouth next 
Thursday, where we will be discussing youth issues and issues 
related to the Young Offenders Act. It is being put on by CBC radio 
and I am looking forward to attending to discuss some of the issues 
arising out of past amendments and concerns of the public about 
the Young Offenders Act.
<P>
	We have also had Bill C-45, which provided for reform of the 
corrections process and issues of conditional release. We all 
recognize that we had very speedy passage of the bill to provide for 
the use of DNA evidence in criminal proceedings.
<P>
	All these things are planks in the efforts of the government to 
deal with crime. We are working steadily to fulfil our goal of 
ensuring that Canadians live in safe homes and safe streets.
<P>
	Upon passage of Bill C-78 Canadians will have a witness 
protection program that will serve them well, because it will 
provide a legislated program that will operate more efficiently, 
more effectively, but will not cost taxpayers more money. I am sure 
that in my riding of Halifax West the taxpayers will be in favour of 
that part of the bill.
<P>
	The whole area of witness protection is particularly important in 
places like Nova Scotia, as it is across the country. However in 
Nova Scotia the area where it will be most often used will be in 
drug enforcement. Our province is a key offloading area for drugs 
coming from South America, the Caribbean, and the eastern coast 
of the United States because of the fact that Nova Scotia is a 
peninsula with so much coastline and many little coves. This 
makes it picturesque and beautiful to visit, and I recommend that 
all members and Canadians who are interested should visit us and 
see our beautiful province. However it also provides an opportunity 
for drug smugglers to offload their product because it is difficult  to 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15267"> 15267 </A></B>
<P>
detect them and difficult for the RCMP or other police forces to 
cover all those inlets and bays.
<P>
	The witness protection program is also used in areas of crime, 
including homicides and prostitution, which are also of great 
concern. If we can help in those investigations and the prosecution 
of cases of that nature with the bill, it is certainly worth pursuing.
<P>
	I checked with one of the local RCMP offices in my riding and I 
was told that the existing witness protection program had been used 
there about 25 times in the past 20 years. Obviously it is not used 
constantly, but it provides a very important tool for police in 
investigation and prosecution for criminal offences.
<P>
	It seems to me that in the future those who must turn to the 
witness protection program, like the approximately 70 Canadians 
who did so last year, will benefit from a number of programs 
provided by the bill. I believe members would agree that all 
Canadians would benefit from the improvements.
<P>
	In many respects we are talking about trying to fight organized 
crime. Yes, there other kinds of crime involved, individual crimes. 
We can readily see how the witness protection program can deal 
with problems of organized crime. With that kind of an organized 
group there is much more need for witness protection.
<P>
	In that sense one of the best ways to fight organized crime is with 
information that sources and witnesses can provide if they do not 
feel they are at risk of being killed, injured or maimed if they give 
evidence or assist the police in some other way. The bill is 
important in all those respects.
<P>
<B>(1205 )</B>
<P>
	Another key element of the bill will be a clearly defined 
admission process and criteria so that not just anybody can qualify 
under the program. It is very clear from the RCMP or other police 
forces that want to make use of the RCMP program what the rules 
are, what the procedures are, and who can be admitted and how. 
This is very important.
<P>
	The RCMP has a responsibility after the bill becomes law to 
thoroughly examine the applicant's suitability for the program in a 
variety of ways. That means not only the potential contribution the 
applicant can make toward an investigation, but the RCMP will 
also look closely at the individual, at the risk involved to that 
individual, what might be the risk of danger or harm coming to 
him, the impact on the person or his or her family, as well as the 
ability of the individual to adjust to the program. I suppose that 
could be a problem in some cases, depending on the kind of 
individual being dealt with. All those factors are obviously 
important in determining who should be admitted to the program.
<P>
	Interestingly the protection of witnesses and sources does not 
just mean relocation, as we assume, and change  of identity. It also 
means counselling or other kinds of support. I turn to the bill itself 
for a moment to read to the House the definition of protection in 
Bill C-78:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>``protection'', in respect of a protectee, may include relocation, 
accommodation and change of identity as well as counselling and financial 
support for those or any other purposes in order to ensure the security of the 
protectee or to facilitate the protectee's re-establishment or becoming 
self-sufficient;</BLOCKQUOTE>
	We see there are a variety of kinds of protection that can be 
provided and are necessary. Under the bill the RCMP is required to 
look at alternate methods of protection.
<P>
	We talk about the kind of counselling support that a witness may 
need or a source may need and we think of prostitution involving 
children, for instance. While there is a basic need for protection in 
the sense of protection from violence of the child, there will 
probably be a need for counselling for a child who has been 
involved in prostitution and the violence and the intimidation 
associated with that activity.
<P>
	We can all recognize how difficult and frightening it has to be for 
people to come forward who have been a witness or a source and 
have been involved in some way in a matter of this sort. It has to be 
terrifying, particularly if they are fearing for their lives and in some 
cases for their family or someone else who may be close to them. 
That is why the definition of witness in Bill C-78 includes those 
who might have evidence or will give evidence in the future, as 
well as those who might be at risk themselves, for instance their 
family.
<P>
	The source witness protection program must, and with Bill C-78 
it will, make it easier for people with information that may help 
investigations to come forward without fear for their own safety 
and the safety of their families. That to me is key. We are not only 
talking about the safety of their families, but by extension if we can 
get them to feel freer about coming forward and being witnesses or 
sources then it is the safety of all our families we are talking about 
here. The success of the program and of our crime fighting efforts 
in general depends on sources and witnesses and the information 
they can provide. Their safety is of paramount importance, which is 
why I am so pleased to support the bill.
<P>
	The bill provides one important item that we do not have at the 
present and is needed. As we can see in the bill of the member for 
Scarborough West and the debate around that bill over the past year 
or so, we need consistency in how each case is dealt with. With the 
bill every case across the country will be dealt with in a consistent 
manner, which is a big improvement.
<P>
	The bill will not replace other witness protection programs that 
exist across the country. I mentioned that provincial forces and 
municipal forces have their own programs. They will continue to 
operate. Those law enforcement agencies will continue to be able 
to  participate in the RCMP source witness protection program, but 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15268"> 15268 </A></B>
<P>
they will now be able to do so with much more accountability and 
transparency in the process.
<P>
<B>(1210 )</B>
<P>
	Another important area in the bill solves some potential 
problems in the present system in the area of accountability and 
transparency, which we need to have more of in this process. The 
bill makes the administration of the program much more 
transparent and accountable. It goes through the commissioner of 
the RCMP to the minister and to the House of Commons. It 
provides for clearer lines of authority within the RCMP structure. 
That makes unquestionably for a more efficient administration.
<P>
	The commissioner is required to make an annual report on the 
operation of the program, a full report indicating what kinds of 
problems they face, what amounts have been paid out, the number 
of witnesses who have been protected in various ways, and so forth. 
He must make that report annually to the solicitor general. The 
solicitor general will then table the annual report before Parliament 
so that members of the House have the opportunity to scrutinize the 
report. Therefore it makes the whole system accountable to the 
House of Commons and through the House of Commons to the 
public.
<P>
	The annual reporting requirement will mean that information 
will be available to members and the public on the cost and the 
number of people involved in the program. It will be much clearer. 
It is very important for both parties to the agreements where a 
witness is being protected that both the witness and the RCMP or 
other police force have a clear understanding of what the 
agreement and what the responsibilities and obligations of both 
parties to the agreement will be.
<P>
	This will provide for transparency and accountability with 
regard to the responsibilities and obligations for both the applicants 
and the RCMP as administrators of the program. These protection 
agreements and the obligations of applicants and administrators to 
fulfil these agreements will provide further transparency and 
accountability to the program.
<P>
	All these factors lead to public safety. All these factors are 
providing a greater feeling of security, a greater sense of safety in 
coming forward for the witness.
<P>
	If persons have heard about other witnesses in the past who 
perhaps did not feel they were treated properly, did not feel that the 
police had lived up to their part of the bargain in protecting a 
person, they will obviously be less likely to come forward. 
However, if we can clarify the rules, if we can have clear 
agreements between the RCMP or another police force and the 
witness that provide for the rights and obligations of both and what 
is going to happen for them, we will not have people saying that 
they did not get treated properly by the police. They  can go to the 
agreement itself and look at what is on paper.
<P>
	It is kind of like good fences making good neighbours. A good 
agreement with clearly specified rules on who is to do what 
provides for a good relationship between the two sides. I think it 
will add to people feeling freer about coming forward to the system 
and providing their information.
<P>
	To review some of the issues we have talked about how in the 
past criminals have successfully used fear and intimidation to scare 
witnesses to keep them away from the police so that they will not 
bring evidence forward. This program is very important, because 
individuals involved in organized crime will go to great lengths to 
try to ensure that a witness or a source will not come forward. As I 
said, it can be a terrifying experience. They can certainly 
sometimes threaten and exact violent retribution from the 
witnesses.
<P>
	Enforcement agencies need the support and assistance of the 
public. We are talking here about the public in more than one way. 
We are talking about the individual who is a witness. In some cases 
when a witness is relocated he or she may require assistance from 
the public in that regard to find a new location. I am not sure 
exactly how that would work, but it may require it in some regard. 
To achieve success in bringing criminals to justice and to further 
investigations, the police do need that kind of information and they 
need people to come forward.
<P>
<B>(1215 )</B>
<P>
	The legislation will cover agents who are involved in 
investigations, not only in the trials but throughout the whole 
process, which is why I was pleased to see the definitions I 
mentioned earlier. Not only is the person who has given evidence in 
the past covered, but so is a person who has agreed to give evidence 
or information in the future. In any case where because of taking 
part in some way in an inquiry, investigation or in the prosecution 
of an offence a person's security may be at risk, the person is 
covered by the legislation.
<P>
	I talked about protection and how it can include relocation, 
accommodation, change of identity, counselling, financial support 
or any other requirement needed to ensure the security of the 
protectees as they are called, or to facilitate re-establishment or 
becoming self-sufficient in a new location with a new identity.
<P>
	Let us think about a witness who has been totally innocent, has 
not been involved in crime at all, but happens to be a witness to a 
serious crime. I am reminded of the movie ``Witness'' in which a 
young boy was a witness to a crime and had to be protected. In a 
case where someone is totally innocent it must be a bewildering 
experience to be called upon to be a protected witness, fearing for 
one's life; having to change identity and home; and being away 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15269"> 15269 </A></B>
<P>
from family and friends. It has to be a very difficult and 
bewildering experience.
<P>
	Interestingly the annual cost will not go up as a result of the 
program and if it goes down that is fine. It is an important program 
and will vary each year depending on how many people are being 
protected. The annual cost is $3.4 million. There are no additional 
costs expected as a result of introducing the legislation. The 
average cost per case is $30,000 but approximately 60 per cent of 
cases cost less than $20,000. If that can bring people who are 
involved in organized crime or other serious crimes to justice then 
it is well worth the money. I am confident that all Canadians, and 
certainly those in my riding of Halifax West, would support that 
and would certainly support the intent of the bill.
<P>
	The changes proposed in the witness protection program act will 
give the RCMP's source witness protection program a solid 
legislative and regulatory basis. This is lacking in the existing 
program. It is important that we provide it and therefore I urge 
members to support this important bill.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Derek Lee (Scarborough-Rouge River, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am very pleased to have a few moments to speak to Bill 
C-78, the source witness protection program bill.
<P>
	There are two or three perspectives I thought I would like to 
touch on. My colleagues have touched on most of the technical 
aspects of the bill and all parties in the House are apparently 
supporting it. Therefore there is nobody really nibbling at the 
corners. I am certainly not going to do that. It is a good bill, as has 
been recognized by colleagues.
<P>
	There are two or three perspectives that should be brought out in 
discussion. I want first to pay some tribute to police officers across 
the country who over the past many years have informally provided 
protection for witnesses. They have done it in many ways, often not 
at taxpayers' expense.
<P>
	This is something that has not been recognized very much in the 
history of law enforcement in Canada and North America. It was 
very real over the past decades when no public moneys were 
formally available to protect witnesses that police officers had to 
use their cars, their garages, their basements, freebies from the 
motel outside town, and all kinds of different devices to make sure 
the witness who was scared to death got a chance to get into the 
courtroom, give the evidence, get out and survive in the face of 
great risks. I pay tribute to all those policemen, many of whom 
were Mounties. This was not confined just to the federal police 
force but also to provincial and municipal forces across the 
country.
<P>
<B>(1220)</B>
<P>
	That history is not written; it is all unwritten. It is anecdotal now 
to the extent that these policemen and former policemen get a 
chance to talk about it. It is an  unwritten part of our Canadian 
criminal justice history. I wanted to note it here and pay tribute to 
the many who made the system work.
<P>
	Starting in 1984 the Royal Canadian Mounted Police began a 
witness protection program that provided some kind of framework 
for witness protection albeit not recognized in statute. That was in 
the face of the growing threat from organized crime which 
developed post-war. Also as was mentioned earlier, there were 
threats from individuals who while they might not have been part 
of an organized crime group apparently were not prepared to stop at 
anything in trying to preclude their conviction.
<P>
	There have been many bad stories in relation to that as part of 
our criminal justice history but there have also been many good 
stories. With the growth and public knowledge of the availability of 
a witness protection program in many parts of the world, there 
began to be some confusion about what a witness might be entitled 
to have: a free bus ride, a free taxi ride, a free room or some 
accommodation, money, protection and a new identity.
<P>
	Over time the field became more and more confused. It was not 
so much on the part of the police, as they were simply doing their 
very best to deliver evidence to the courtroom door for the 
prosecutors. It was more so for the witnesses who from time to 
time and place to place became confused about exactly what the 
protection was composed of.
<P>
	Some witnesses were more accommodating than others; some 
wanted more than others. It became more difficult for the police to 
manage. There might often be cases where when the process was 
over, the evidence had been given hopefully ending in a successful 
prosecution, witnesses felt they did not have the protection they 
thought they were to have. Maybe they made it difficult for the 
police involved. Maybe they went to the local newspaper, the local 
media. It became confusing and embarrassing for some. Something 
had to be done.
<P>
	The first positive signs I saw in the House was the research and 
the bill produced by our colleague, the member for Scarborough 
West. That was quite a credible exercise. A private member's bill 
was passed in the House at second reading and referred to the 
justice committee. At about that point in time the Ministry of the 
Solicitor General indicated it would want to have a bill similar in 
nature. Our colleague essentially acquiesced and the solicitor 
general has presented the bill which apparently has support from all 
sides of the House.
<P>
	The last perspective I want to address very briefly is that the bill 
will help us better manage the safe streets policy the Liberal Party 
has adopted. It will better manage the costs. The program will be 
codified. It will probably show up as a cost item in the estimates 
and the parliamentary authorizations as a specific category rather 
than being buried as it was in part previously.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15270"> 15270 </A></B>
<P>
	The bill will help us better manage what we are doing in the 
safe streets policy. It will result in better prosecutions. The crown 
attorneys will know what the infrastructure will be for their 
witnesses if there has to be a witness protection program 
extension. It will result in better criminal procedure, a better 
understanding both on the part of witnesses and the people who 
manage the witness protection program of what they have to 
deliver.
<P>
<B>(1225)</B>
<P>
	It is a three-way street. We have the public that wants to see the 
benefits of a better managed system. We have the witnesses who 
need to know what they can expect, who will know what they have 
the right to ask for and require in terms of protection. It will assist 
the police better in knowing what the deliverables should be and 
what the deliverables are, both to the crown which is gathering the 
evidence and to the witness.
<P>
	I congratulate both the solicitor general and the hon. member for 
Scarborough West for their contributions in this regard.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Before recognizing the hon. member for 
Scarborough West who has so much history with this issue, would 
the hon. member find it acceptable, as another member came out of 
a meeting to speak, to have the hon. member for Dartmouth speak 
first?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Wappel:</B> Mr. Speaker, it would be my delight to hear what 
the hon. member for Dartmouth has to say.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ron MacDonald (Dartmouth, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank 
my colleague.
<P>
	This is an important bill, particularly for the hon. member from 
Scarborough who so kindly gave up his spot for me to speak. I 
congratulate him on the work he has done in laying the groundwork 
for this type of legislation.
<P>
	Many times in the past the legislative procedure and process of 
the House of Commons have given reason for the public and 
members of this place to be cynical and sceptical about what it is 
the backbench can do, what it is independent members can do with 
respect to setting the legislative agenda. I acknowledge up front the 
work the hon. member for Scarborough West has done in ensuring 
this important piece of legislation was put before the House.
<P>
	It is quite rare for a private member's bill to be debated and 
actually get beyond the pro forma number of required hours once it 
is drawn and actually get passed. The fact that the hon. member for 
Scarborough West got the bill to second reading and caused it to 
come forward is not only a testament to the way Parliament can 
work. It is also a personal testament to how the member sticks to it. 
All members owe him a debt of gratitude.
<P>
	There are very few times when a piece of government legislation 
comes forward which is supported by all sides  of the House. It 
appears the legislation is supported by all sides of the House. 
Perhaps the government and the House leadership on our side will 
take a close look and find, when legislation comes from the 
backbenches of either side of this place, that it is better legislation. 
They might want to free us up a bit more to do that type of job.
<P>
	In the last number of years I have found that my opinions on 
justice, law and order have gone from what would have been 
considered to be a liberal left position to a more realistic, 
responsive position when it deals with some aspects of the criminal 
justice system. That has happened over the seven years I have been 
a member of Parliament because of my interaction with the 
criminal justice system on behalf of my constituents. I have viewed 
it from afar and have watched cases unfold. I have dealt with 
people who have been victims of crime. I have dealt with the law 
enforcement agencies and people in the judiciary.
<P>
<B>(1230 )</B>
<P>
	As we start to understand that, when we deal with the criminal 
justice system, just as we have to be flexible in other areas of 
public policy such as social policy and fiscal matters, we have to be 
extremely flexible and reasonable when we deal with the criminal 
justice system.
<P>
	The system must be responsive to the needs of the community. 
Clearly the area of witness protection is one of those areas where 
there was a responsibility, a requirement by government, to come 
forward and recognize we had to statutize programs that currently 
existed at the federal level with the RCMP.
<P>
	I am concerned that sometimes we direct the limited resources 
we have for law enforcement into areas that simply are not able to 
deal with the problem in as effective a manner as is required. The 
area of witness protection has concerned me for a number of years. 
I will deal with the reasons for that.
<P>
	In my area, which is not that dissimilar from most urban areas 
across Canada, there is a lot of urban crime. There are a lot of 
crimes specifically against children. The hon. member for 
Scarborough West has been on his feet in the House more times 
than any other member dealing with some of these issues.
<P>
	In my riding we have had to suffer through a disproportionate 
number of our young children from 13 years old to 16 years old 
being drawn into prostitution. I claim no moral high ground in 
dealing with these issues, but I am a parent and I represent an area 
where there are many kids who have been plucked from their 
turbulent years in puberty and thrown into a world that can only be 
described as a world of terror. They are plucked out of their 
schools; they are taken from the downtowns, from the shopping 
malls, by people who can only be described as the worst criminals 
in Canadian society. They are pimps that befriend primarily young 
girls, draw them  into a life of crime, of drug addiction and literally 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15271"> 15271 </A></B>
<P>
sexual slavery. At 14, 15 or 16 years old these children have lost 
their youth and have been violated in the worst possible ways.
<P>
	However there has been a problem in the criminal justice system 
in dealing effectively with that situation. There has been a problem 
in the judiciary in applying the strictness of fines and of penalties 
the public demands and that should be applied. There has been a 
problem in the prosecution because it has been extremely difficult 
to offer the level of protection to those young girls, the victims of 
crime, but also the witnesses to crimes that happen to themselves 
and to others in that circumstance.
<P>
	They come forward with the certainty that if they give testimony 
in a court of law against these monsters walking the streets one of 
two things will happen. Either the criminal justice system would 
deal with a conviction in such a light manner that 6 months or 12 
months later the individual is back out on the street doing the same 
thing with young kids again, or there would be threats to the 
personal safety of the individual who came forward as a victim and 
a witness to the crime as well as threats to their families.
<P>
	I relate something that happened about three years ago which 
marked me forever. It was late on a Friday afternoon. There were 
far too many calls to return and I was tired after a week up here. My 
secretary said I had to take a phone call.
<P>
	It was a mother who was more than distraught. She was beaten 
by a system that could not respond to what she saw as her child's 
need, a mother despondent because she did not think she could help 
her child. Her 15-year old daughter had been lured into prostitution 
at the age of 13. At one point the daughter said she had made the 
break and she did not want to do that any more. Two days later a 
van showed up in front of her house with her pimps or the part of 
the international criminal element that deals with street prostitution 
of juveniles. They had their buddies and they parked outside.
<P>
	Within two or three days the daughter told her mother she had to 
go back to Toronto, back on the street. The mother begged her and 
beseeched her not to do it. Her child had been raped, abused, beaten 
and threatened with death. She had seen some of her friends beaten 
close to death by this criminal element, these monsters, these 
pimps. Why would she go back to a life like that? She feared for her 
own personal safety and did not believe the criminal justice system 
could afford her the protection necessary to put those demons 
away.
<P>
<B>(1235)</B>
<P>
	Outside her own personal safety she went back to the street out 
of the fear for the safety of her family and knowing full well that 
she might be a statistic, and maybe she is today. I hope not. She did 
not want her mother to suddenly turn around one morning while 
she was by  herself in her kitchen and be confronted by thugs who 
would beat and perhaps sexually assault her. That is why that child 
went back to the street.
<P>
	About a year later the mother called me and said: ``My daughter 
has called and she cannot stand any more. She has been beaten, 
tortured, sexually assaulted and she is getting out. She is in Niagara 
Falls and I want to bring her home. We have to get her out of there. 
She has broken away from her pimp and I cannot get anybody to 
help''.
<P>
	I thought of my 11-year old daughter and my God, I hope that if I 
am ever in a situation like that somebody would at least do their 
best to take my child out of that danger.
<P>
	It took a lot of phone calls, a lot more than it should have taken, 
before I could get somebody to act. The child was turning 16 on a 
Monday of a long weekend and the law enforcement agency said: 
``We can bring her back but what do we do with her? Where do we 
put her? These people will be back. Is she prepared to testify? If she 
is not, what do we do with her?'' I spent until 11 p.m. that night 
trying to find a safe haven for that victim of crime and potential 
witness against the perpetrators of the crime.
<P>
	The bill begins to address some of the real issues facing law 
enforcement agencies, the judicial system and certainly facing the 
victims of crime and individuals who can come forward and give 
testimony in a court of law, knowing full well that if they do there 
are resources and programs available by statute that will assist in 
their protection and that of their families.
<P>
	Every year we spend a lot of money to put somebody in jail. We 
spend a lot of money when we have to send law enforcement 
agencies and police officers to pursue criminals. We must put 
money into a program that will say to witnesses that if they come 
forward and tell their stories, we will do our very best in a very 
regulated statutory fashion with a program that has financing to 
protect them and their families against intimidation or, God forbid, 
physical violence or even death.
<P>
	In my riding a young lady involved in prostitution broke away 
and wanted to stop. She wanted the people who had stolen her life 
to be dealt with by the criminal justice system. She was to give 
evidence against a gang of criminals operating right across Canada 
and in the northeastern U.S. She was to testify. A strong message to 
all those other victims of that type of crime was sent when she was 
found murdered before the testimony could be given. The 
individual she was to testify against is currently awaiting trial on 
murder charges.
<P>
	I wish that were the only case I could relate. There are more 
cases in which young girls or women who have decided to get out 
of prostitution and turn evidence have had to live a life from one 
hell to another, a life on the run, not knowing when a car stops in 
front of them  whether somebody will put a bullet in their head. 
That is reality street in a town of only 65,000 people. It is 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15272"> 15272 </A></B>
<P>
happening in Toronto, in Scarborough, in western Canada and in 
small town Canada.
<P>
	The bill starts down the right road. It does the right things. It tells 
us there is a program and there will be rules to the program. The 
program will have a dollar allocation. Currently the RCMP deals 
with that in its own programs because it has the budget.
<P>
<B>(1240 )</B>
<P>
	This is the type of legislation the Canadian public wants. It wants 
to give the necessary resources to government agencies and to the 
criminal justice system for it to work. They want the resources to 
be targeted in a way that we alleviate as much as we can the 
criminal element from our streets while at the same time give 
protection and statutized, regularized program protection to those 
willing to come forward and confront elements in our society truly 
from the dark side of humanity.
<P>
	I speak for the victims of crime who are potential witnesses to 
their victimization. I encourage the government and all members to 
continue to work, like the member for Scarborough West has 
worked, to identify to government and Parliament the types of 
programs through which we can come together and ensure the 
limited resources of government can be directed toward law 
enforcement and the criminal justice system. They should be 
directed in a fashion that allows us to attain the goal of safer streets 
and that those willing to participate to help us have safer streets are 
afforded the protection required.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Tom Wappel (Scarborough West, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
knew my decision to yield the floor to my hon. friend from 
Dartmouth would be the correct one. His speech was peppered with 
his usual enthusiasm, a very interesting case study of why we need 
the program. I also thank all the speakers on the bill who mentioned 
my name in a positive light today. It is such a refreshing change and 
I really appreciate it.
<P>
	I will talk about the history of witness protection and how I 
developed an interest in the subject to let Canadians know a bit 
about the need for a legislated witness protection program.
<P>
	About three years ago when I was the official opposition critic 
for the solicitor general a gentleman came into my office. He was 
fearful, nervous, literally looking over his shoulder in 
apprehension. He was also very frustrated. He was a witness and an 
informant to a serious crime. He had in his view co-operated with 
the Royal Canadian Mounted Police in an investigation. In his 
opinion he had been offered certain protection and certain financial 
incentives which would help him to relocate and get away from the 
wrath of those he had reported to the authorities.
<P>
	Unfortunately because nothing was in writing or because there 
was no real mechanism provided, there was a dispute about what 
had been agreed on and how long the protection would be afforded. 
Suffice it to say he felt abandoned. He felt adrift. He felt at the 
mercy of those he had informed on.
<P>
	It was a courageous thing for him to do. These were vicious 
people. He feared for his family, his wife and children, not just for 
himself; perhaps more for his wife and family than for himself.
<P>
	I could see why he was in fear but why was he frustrated? He had 
gone to the RCMP and did not seem to get any redress there. He 
had gone to his local police department and did not get redress 
there. He had gone to the Ontario Provincial Police and did not get 
redress there. He went to his local member of Parliament. His local 
member of Parliament was unable to help, not because his local 
member of Parliament did not want to help but because we were 
now entering into the nether world of witness protection in Canada.
<P>
<B>(1245 )</B>
<P>
	He went to the minister of the day who along with his officials 
begrudgingly admitted there was such a program but they were not 
about to talk about it. They were not about to discuss it. They were 
not about to give details and they certainly were not about to talk 
about his case.
<P>
	In desperation he came to me, the official opposition critic for 
the solicitor general. That piqued my interest in the subject and I 
began to investigate. I found that since 1970 a federal witness 
protection program has been run by the U.S. marshall service in the 
United States. Prosecutors in the United States have said that the 
program was one of the most effective assets they utilized in law 
enforcement.
<P>
	The population of the United States of America probably 
approaches 300 million people now. That U.S. witness protection 
program currently protects approximately 500 witnesses per year, 
which is not a very large number of witnesses considering the size 
of the population.
<P>
	That says it is used in extreme circumstances for extreme cases. 
In a way that is good because there is only so much money. 
Generally speaking it has a fairly good success rate in solving 
crimes except the most dastardly kinds of crimes, the ones where 
people do not think twice about snuffing out a life in order that the 
person not be a witness in a proceeding against them.
<P>
	I am talking about drug related offences. I am talking about 
organized crime. I am talking about gang warfare. The last thing 
those people are worried about is the value of a single human life. It 
is simply a matter of money. Nowadays one can get somebody to 
kill another for virtually a song. What a sad commentary in general 
on society.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15273"> 15273 </A></B>
<P>
	I began to work on a witness protection bill for Canada because 
what I found out about this nether world of witness protection was 
that first, no one would talk about it. Hardly anyone would 
acknowledge that it existed and there was no legislative base for 
it.
<P>
	As a lawyer, this concerned me. How can the law enforcement 
agencies give a person a new passport? How can they give someone 
a new social insurance number? How can they give someone new 
background documents and resumes of work that never existed to 
get the person back into the workforce with no legal basis to do so? 
It worried me that our law enforcement agencies with the best of 
motives to protect witnesses might be doing something contrary to 
the law by issuing these kinds of papers and these kinds of new 
identities without a legislative base.
<P>
	I felt they needed this legislative base. I discussed this with the 
solicitor general of the day. Thousands of people across Canada 
presented petitions to the government of the day asking that a 
national witness protection program be brought forward. In a 
response to one of those petitions, the Hon. Doug Lewis, the 
minister at that time had this to say:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Witness protection is indeed a very important function of law enforcement 
and, equally, a crucial service to witnesses who are at risk of retribution as a 
result of giving testimony in court.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>It is accurate to say that, presently, there is not a national, legislated program 
as exists in the United States, for example. My officials are currently examining 
the state of witness protection in Canada, which necessitates consideration of 
the witness protection requirements of not only the law enforcement 
community, but also the witnesses themselves. Also, integral to this process is a 
review of the efficacy of the legislated program and its application in Canada.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Bearing in mind the complexity of this issue, a thorough review is required 
before a decision can be reached on the best possible witness protection 
program for Canadians.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Rest assured that your views, particularly your request for a legislated 
program, are being given serious consideration and I would like to thank the 
petitioners for expressing their views on this matter.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	That was a very nice response but I was getting the same feeling 
as John Doe who had come into my office of being pushed from 
pillar to post, study after study. Yes, there is no legislative program. 
Yes, it is a good idea. Yes, we need it, but we have to study it.
<P>
<B>(1250)</B>
<P>
	What changed? If I do say so myself, what changed was there 
was an election and with the election the appointment of a new 
solicitor general, the hon. member for Windsor West. Very shortly 
after becoming Solicitor General of Canada, among the various 
other initiatives that he came up with, the solicitor general 
recognized the merit and the need for a legislated witness 
protection program which would be offered nationally.
<P>
	In consultation with his officials, he very kindly sat down with 
me and discussed my bill and the work that I had done up to that 
point. Of course the solicitor general has more resources than an 
ordinary member of Parliament. He did everything that was 
required of him. He talked to the U.S. marshall service, found out 
about the flaws and the pitfalls of the program. He talked to the 
various solicitors general of the provinces to see how the program 
could be most effective in a federal system where we pass the 
criminal laws, but they are enforced by the provinces.
<P>
	He did not drag his feet. After having done the work and keeping 
me informed at all times so that I was convinced that the work was 
proceeding, he brought forward the legislation, Bill C-78.
<P>
	In my judgment the bill is historic from a number of 
perspectives. Not only will it go a long way in protecting witnesses 
and informants in the future but it will help solve crimes.
<P>
	Between 1980 and 1992 there have been 1,455 unsolved murders 
in the country. That is an incredible statistic. Never mind 1,455 
murders, but 1,455 unsolved murders. No doubt there are people 
out there who know who was the perpetrator in many of these 
murders but they fear for their lives or they fear for their families' 
lives. They fear to come forward because they have no way of 
knowing they will be protected. Because of the nether world, the 
shadowy world of witness protection before the bill, people were 
not aware of it. They did not know whom to approach.
<P>
	Did the House know that right now there are approximately 15 
police forces across the country that offer witness protection; the 
RCMP, the OPP, the Metropolitan Toronto Police, some other 
police forces? Each has its own program. They have different rules. 
They have different standards. They have different budgets.
<P>
	What good is it to a person who witnesses a murder, shall we say 
in Sudbury, if the Metropolitan Toronto police has a witness 
protection program? That budget is for the residents of that city. 
What good is it in Calgary if the OPP has a witness protection 
program?
<P>
	The key is that it has to be a national program because our 
criminal law is national. We have a national police force, the Royal 
Canadian Mounted Police, which has a presence in every province 
and territory. It has a witness protection program so it is only 
logical that it administer a national witness protection program and 
the bill provides precisely for that.
<P>
	It provides that those other police forces or any police force can 
contract through the RCMP to provide protection for witnesses in 
investigations that it is conducting. This is good financially as well 
because those police forces can budget for witness protection. They 
can pay the RCMP for the services that the RCMP will be  giving, 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15274"> 15274 </A></B>
<P>
but then they will have the expertise and uniformity that the RCMP 
will offer under the bill.
<P>
	To me that is a very positive thing. I believe we will be able to 
solve crimes when we are able to offer proper legislated witness 
protection to people across Canada.
<P>
<B>(1255 )</B>
<P>
	Goodness knows, there are enough crimes that need solving. 
Hopefully we will get people to come forward and offer their 
evidence in exchange for being protected from those very vile 
people in society who do not care about snuffing out people's lives.
<P>
	The hon. member for Dartmouth used a descriptive term for 
these people. He called them demons. In order for us to exorcise 
our demons from society, our criminal demons, this will be one of 
the excellent tools we can use in that regard.
<P>
	The bill is deceptively short considering what it is going to do. It 
only has 24 relatively short paragraphs. Perhaps we lose sight of 
the fact that sometimes shorter is better. It is deceptively short yet 
not lacking in anything.
<P>
	When I drafted Bill C-206 I spent a lot of time thinking about all 
the different angles. I thought I had them all covered. I was very 
gratified when the House unanimously approved it at second 
reading. However, as is probably most often the case, the 
bureaucrats examined the bill and found certain things that were 
not in it and put them into a recommendation to the solicitor 
general. He, to his credit, accepted those recommendations. Bill 
C-78 is an improvement on my Bill C-206 and covers ground that 
is not covered in my bill.
<P>
	One other thing I want to mention is the use to which the witness 
protection program has been put. For example, in 1986 
approximately $500,000 a year was being spent by the RCMP on 
witness protection in all of Canada. In 1993 that amount has 
ballooned to $3,800,000. This is money well spent because it is 
money used for solving crimes perpetrated in Canada, crimes that 
might otherwise go unsolved. That demonstrates to me the efficacy 
of a national witness protection program and the need for Bill C-78.
<P>
	One thing that was lacking before was openness, light shining on 
the witness protection program, publicity about the witness 
protection program. The program has been ongoing for quite some 
time. I am very pleased to note in clause 16 of Bill C-78 something 
that was not contained in my private member's bill but is very 
important, an annual report.
<P>
	The commissioner of the RCMP, who will be in charge of the 
legislated national witness program, will file a report with the 
minister. That in itself is very important, as the minister will be 
apprised of what is going on with  witness protection, how much it 
is costing, how many witnesses there are and its success rate in 
solving crimes.
<P>
	The minister has gone further because not only will he receive 
the report but the clause provides that the minister shall-not may, 
not think about, but shall-cause a copy of the report to be laid 
before the House of Commons. We in the House of Commons and 
the people of Canada whom we represent will have an opportunity 
on a yearly basis to hear about the witness protection program and 
thereby publicize it, to examine how much is being spent on it, to 
know how many people are being protected by it and to understand 
how many crimes are being solved by the use of the witness 
protection program as a tool of law enforcement.
<P>
	To me this is important because it will publicize the program. It 
will give people an opportunity to come forward and say they saw 
something, know something or heard something and say they will 
come forward if they have protection in the circumstances. It will 
be for the commissioner to decide whether or not in the 
circumstances of the particular case witness protection should be 
afforded. That is as it should be because it is a tool for law 
enforcement to use for the protection of witnesses who will help to 
solve crimes.
<P>
<B>(1300 )</B>
<P>
	All in all, Bill C-78 is an excellent bill. I am delighted to support 
it. I am delighted that it apparently has all-party support. That 
indicates to me that it will receive quick passage through the House 
of Commons so we can get on with the legislated witness 
protection program, get on with publicizing it, get on with solving 
crimes and get on with trying to find the perpetrators of the 1,455 
unsolved murders between 1980 and 1992.
<P>
	There are a couple of areas in the bill on which I would like some 
clarification. Hopefully these will be clarified by the officials in 
their appearance before the committee when the bill is studied at 
committee.
<P>
	I draw specific attention to a lack of a provision to authorize 
emergency steps. For example, if the commissioner believes that 
there is some urgent need to protect someone to get them out of 
harm's way before the technicalities of the bill kick in, it would 
seem that there should be some sort of mechanism specifically 
provided in the bill for that purpose.
<P>
	The bill will help Canadians. It will protect Canadians. It will 
help solve crimes. That is fairly obvious because of the all-party 
support the bill is receiving. Members on all sides of the House of 
all different political persuasions and of all types of views on 
justice issues recognize that witnesses and informants need to be 
protected if we are to help solve and fight crime.
<P>
	It is refreshing to see that there is such unanimity on such an 
issue in the House. Canadians can feel reassured that the House of 
Commons cares about them, cares about their personal safety, cares 
about the fact that  crime exists and must be controlled and 
eradicated, and cares about the fact that witnesses and people who 
come forward to help in the enforcement of the law will be 
protected by society in a legislated way, in an open way, not in 
some quiet and shadowy backroom without possibility of appeal, 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15275"> 15275 </A></B>
<P>
without possibility of redress in the event that there is some 
misunderstanding.
<P>
	By the way, that is another good point. There will be written 
reasons given by the commissioner if people are turned down so 
they are not left out there with their heads spinning, unable to 
comprehend why the system did not protect them.
<P>
	I support the bill. I am very grateful the House supports the bill. I 
am grateful to the minister for bringing it forward. As I began, I am 
grateful for all the kind comments that have been made about me 
by members of the House.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Anna Terrana (Vancouver East, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, first 
I want to thank RCMP officers for the consistently good work they 
do for Canadians. I am satisfied that they will continue to have 
operational control over this program.
<P>
	The protection of witnesses is one of the most useful and 
efficient tools to fight crime. In order to be effective, witness 
protection programs must provide the best possible protection to 
likely sources and witnesses. This is precisely what the Witness 
Protection Program Act seeks to do.
<P>
	The proposed changes to the legislation will allow sources and 
witnesses participating in the program to fully understand the terms 
and conditions under which they will be protected. As well, the 
decisions and the measures taken by the authority responsible for 
the program, namely the RCMP, will be more transparent. This will 
result in a more transparent and efficient operation of the program, 
while also contributing to the government's efforts to implement 
the act and thus stop crime, particularly organized crime.
<P>
<B>(1305)</B>
<P>
	The proposed changes in the Witness Protection Program Act 
will provide sound statutory and regulatory authority to the RCMP 
program by establishing a federally legislated witness protection 
program.
<P>
	The new legislation will provide the following: clearly defined 
eligibility criteria for witnesses; identical treatment all across the 
country; a clear statement on the responsibilities and obligations of 
program officials and participants; a better defined management 
structure within the RCMP regarding the daily operation of the 
programs, so as to strengthen accountability; a complaint 
settlement process as well as the presentation, by the RCMP 
commissioner, of an annual report to the solicitor general on the 
operation of the program.
<P>
	The RCMP source witness protection program was established 
in 1984 to meet the specific needs of that police force regarding the 
protection of sources and witnesses. Other witness protection 
programs are run by a number of provinces and municipalities.
<P>
	Police departments using these programs also rely on the RCMP 
source witness protection program, under a cost recovery system, 
and this will continue to be the case. The RCMP helps other 
protection programs by obtaining I.D. documents delivered by the 
federal government-including passports and social insurance 
cards-when a name change is necessary, or by facilitating the 
relocation of witnesses in another province.
<P>
	During the 1994-95 fiscal year, the RCMP was able, through its 
source witness protection program, to provide protection services 
to 70 new clients. In 30 of these cases, the services were provided 
at the request of other organizations. The RCMP currently allocates 
$3.4 million annually to witness protection activities.
<P>
	The changes made to the RCMP source witness protection 
program will not result in additional spending. The program will 
continue to be financed with current resources.
<P>
	The provinces and territories were consulted and they support 
the proposed changes in the Witness Protection Program Act.
<P>
	When a decision is made to admit an applicant to the RCMP's 
source witness protection program, the following factors will be 
taken into consideration: the potential contribution that the witness 
or source can make toward a particular police investigation, the 
nature of the offence under investigation, the nature of the risk to 
the individual, what alternate methods of protection are available, 
the danger to the community if the individual is admitted to the 
program, the potential effects on any family arrangements, the 
likelihood of the individual being able to adjust, their maturity, 
their ability to make judgments and other personal characteristics, 
the cost of maintaining the individual in the program and other 
factors as the commissioner of the RCMP may find to be relevant.
<P>
	Under the witness protection program act, there will be a clear 
and defined decision making process to admit an individual into the 
program. In serious cases, such as those requiring a change of 
identity or admission of a foreign national, the decision to admit an 
individual will be made only by the assistant commissioner in 
charge of the program. A decision to terminate protection must also 
be made by the assistant commissioner.
<P>
	In less serious cases, the decision to protect an individual may be 
made by the incumbent of a position at the level of chief 
superintendent.
<P>
	Finally, the changes introduced in the witness protection 
program act were drafted following  consultations with the RCMP 
and various police forces across the country who were asked to 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15276"> 15276 </A></B>
<P>
contribute their views. These changes will help make the RCMP's 
source witness protection program more open.
<P>
	I am very pleased that the House has agreed to support this 
important bill, and I hope it will be passed very shortly.

<P>
	<B>Mr. George S. Rideout (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister 
of Natural Resources, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support 
of Bill C-71, an act to amend the Explosives Act. Today I will 
address some of the concerns members opposite have raised during 
the second reading debate and I will emphasize the major points 
government members raised during that debate.
<P>
	Let me begin by thanking members opposite for expressing 
support from their respective parties for Bill C-71 during the 
debate on second reading of the proposed legislation.
<P>
	I note from <I>Hansard</I> that during the debate the hon. member for 
Matapédia-Matane asked what is the use of marking explosives if 
we do not monitor them. My response is that we do. Canada's 
explosives inspectors are doing an excellent job of monitoring 
legally licensed  makers, distributors and users of explosives in the 
country.
<P>
	There are concerns about how terrorists and biker gangs get their 
explosives. Terrorists typically purchase stolen explosives on the 
black market, or they make their own if they have the expertise, as 
was the case in the horrific bombing of the Oklahoma City federal 
building this summer.
<P>
	Sources for stolen explosives include explosives obtained from 
break-ins and thefts from storage magazines on construction sites, 
in mines and quarries. Naturally these incidents fall within the 
jurisdiction of Canada's police agencies. In any case I submit to the 
House that it is not a common occurrence in the country. The mere 
fact that it can happen does not require a maze of restrictive and 
unnecessary regulations from any government, least of all the 
Government of Canada.
<P>
	Furthermore, explosives that are used or intended for use in 
criminal activities are never purchased from legitimate vendors 
licensed under the terms of existing federal explosives legislation. 
That is because legitimate vendors must keep accurate and 
complete transaction records for all explosives they sell. These 
records, coupled with the records of police security checks that are 
required under the terms of the existing Explosives Act, could 
easily provide a clear paper trail of evidence to anyone who used 
legally obtained explosives to commit a crime.
<P>
	Let me return to the issues that are more closely related to the 
proposed legislation before the House. With respect to the length of 
time it has taken to submit the amendment to Parliament, I want to 
make a few points.
<P>
	Officials at Natural Resources Canada have indicated to me that 
shortly before the Montreal convention on the marking of plastic 
explosives was signed in 1991 they joined their colleagues from 
national defence, customs, and transport to prepare a memorandum 
to cabinet regarding the proposed amendments to the Explosives 
Act. As members of the House may recall, there were significant 
changes in the structure of federal government departments in 
mid-1993. Shortly thereafter a federal election was held, resulting 
in even more significant change. Since then the Government of 
Canada has been working hard to put Canada on a positive new 
course for the future, to revitalize employment opportunities for all 
Canadians, to attack major issues such as the deficit and debt and, 
in short, to get Canada moving again. The government is delivering 
the good government that Canadians wanted and deserved. In 
addition we are making excellent progress to reach a number of 
positive public policy objectives.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15277"> 15277 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1315)</B>
<P>
	Hon. members will know we have faced tremendous challenges 
to deliver on our promises to Canadians and  that the Government 
of Canada has worked hard to manage our priorities since 1993 in 
order to succeed. I hardly think this debate is the appropriate forum 
to trot out the list of our accomplishments but if members opposite 
wish me to do so I will be more than happy to.
<P>
	Departmental officials had to review their work to prepare their 
memorandum to cabinet concerning the amendments to the 
Explosives Act we have before us today. Consequently the officials 
made the necessary revisions to meet the demands of a new 
government. The officials have done an excellent job.
<P>
	The 1991 convention signed in Montreal represents an 
international agreement to combine efforts among nations to 
reduce the risk of any further aircraft bombings. Participation in 
this effort is viewed by Canada as an essential element in the 
continuing battle against terrorism.
<P>
	Like all international agreements, the convention on marking of 
plastic explosives is based on trust among signatory nations. 
Canada respects this spirit. Canada is known around the world as a 
leader in encouraging progress to increase the trust among nations 
that leads to progressive international conventions.
<P>
	We have every intention of living up to all of our international 
obligations in the hopes that other countries will follow our 
example. This is not a blind trust; this is the essence of good 
leadership.
<P>
	At present there is no way to detect plastic explosives in airports, 
while conventional explosives materials can be detected by 
equipment at our airports. The act proposes the marking of plastic 
explosives by adding a chemical which would be detected by 
equipment in Canada's international airports and thus ward off the 
threat of terrorism.
<P>
	The amendment would allow Canada to be among the first 
nations to ratify an international convention requested by the 
United Nations and co-ordinated by the international civil aviation 
organization with respect to the marking of plastic explosives.
<P>
	The convention was signed in March 1991 by 40 countries, and 
14 countries have already ratified the convention since April 1992. 
Five of these nations, Norway, Spain, Switzerland, Slovakia and 
the Czech Republic, are producer states where plastic explosives 
are manufactured.
<P>
	Given that Canada is a world leader in vapour detection 
technology, Canadian equipment manufacturers will be able to take 
advantage of international market opportunities for their vapour 
detection technology as more and more countries ratify the 
convention.
<P>
	Plastic explosives have emerged as a weapon of choice among 
terrorist groups for bombing aircraft and other targets such as 
public buildings because this type of  explosive is small, powerful, 
stable, malleable and, most important, difficult to detect.
<P>
	If plastic explosives are marked or tagged with a substance that 
can be detected by equipment at Canadian airports, it is quite likely 
that terrorists would be discouraged from attempting any attacks in 
Canada using plastic explosives.
<P>
	The convention on the marking of plastic explosives requires 
states to ensure the marking of plastic explosives to enhance their 
detectability. The convention also requires controls over the 
import, export, possession and transfer of marked plastic 
explosives and the destruction of most unmarked plastic 
explosives.
<P>
	Let me remind the House about the main features of the 
convention. Only plastic explosives as defined in the convention 
are required to be marked. Existing unmarked commercial stocks 
of plastic explosives are to be destroyed within three years. An 
international explosives technical commission will be created to 
assess technical developments.
<P>
	The cost of Canadian participation in such a commission will be 
low and the convention will come in force after 35 states including 
the 5 producer states have ratified it. Canada is one of the world's 
producer states and by passing the proposed legislation before the 
House today Canada will be among the first countries to ratify the 
important convention.
<P>
	Looking at other departments, the military has agreed it can 
except perhaps in times of emergency observe all of the terms of 
the convention. Priority will be given to the use of unmarked stocks 
of plastic explosives in the military stock of explosives materials. 
As always, tight security of storage facilities will be maintained. In 
addition, tight accounting procedures regarding the use of all 
stocks will also be maintained.
<P>
<B>(1320)</B>
<P>
	Transport Canada, responsible for the operation of detection 
equipment at Canadian airports, has indicated current technology 
can detect the marked plastic explosives.
<P>
	The extra cost of producing detectable plastic explosives is 
expected to be negligible. This is primarily due to the relatively 
low volumes of plastic explosives manufactured in Canada. The 
industry has been working in co-operation with organizations 
involved in the effort to develop substances to mark plastic 
explosives for the purpose of detection. Therefore the industry 
acknowledges the impact of extra costs will not be that serious.
<P>
	In addition, given the low volumes of plastic explosives 
compared with the volumes of conventional industrial explosives, 
the challenge of enforcing the provisions of this proposed amend-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15278"> 15278 </A></B>
<P>
ment and by extension the  international convention will not pose a 
significant problem or cost to the respective regulatory bodies.
<P>
	Canada's position as a leader in the development of vapour 
detection technology will be enhanced as a result of the ratification 
of the international convention. Increased foreign market 
penetration by Canadian equipment manufacturers is virtually a 
certainty. Therefore the proclamation of the amendment has the 
potential to help stimulate job creation and contribute to Canada's 
future economic growth and trade.
<P>
	The amendment to the Explosives Act demonstrates the 
Government of Canada's commitment to good government. We are 
determined to contribute to the health and safety of passengers on 
aircraft. We are committed to working with our international 
partners to do whatever we can to stop the threat of terrorism in our 
skies and around the globe.
<P>
	The amendment to the Explosives Act will send a signal to 
terrorists everywhere that Canada will not be an easy target for 
their deadly campaigns of violence. In the process, Canadian 
manufacturers of vapour detection equipment will be able to take 
advantage of significant marketing opportunities. As a result, the 
proposed amendment to the Explosives Act will contribute to two 
major federal goals: job creation and Canadian economic growth. 
Moreover the passage of the amendment will protect the health and 
safety of all Canadians.
<P>
	I thank members opposite for their support in passing important 
legislation. I urge all members of the House to give speedy passage 
to the amendment.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Roger Pomerleau (Anjou-Rivière-des-Prairies, BQ):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I am delighted to rise today to speak as well on Bill 
C-71, an act to amend the Explosives Act. There is of course 
already an Explosives Act, which this bill will amend, and the aim 
of the earlier legislation was, as a general rule, to ensure public and 
worker safety.
<P>
	This legislation governed the composition, quality and 
characteristics of standard explosives as well as their manufacture, 
import, sale, purchase, possession and storage. It covered 
pyrotechnic devices, that is, the products used for fireworks.
<P>
	The new legislation brought before us today will require the 
incorporation of a detectable additive in plastic explosives to 
enable the governor in council to approve regulations on the 
possession, transfer and destruction of unmarked plastic 
explosives. The aim is to thwart terrorism, as my colleague 
mentioned, and to enable Canada to ratify the Convention on the 
Marking of Plastic Explosives for the Purpose of Detection, 
concluded in Montreal on March 1, 1991.
<P>
	The bill would also prohibit, among other things, the 
manufacture, stockpiling, possession, transfer, transport, import 
and export of unmarked plastic explosives, except  in the instances 
provided by the convention and for military purposes of vital 
importance clearly specified in the legislation.
<P>
	What is the Montreal Convention? I am asking the question for 
the benefit of Canadians watching us. The convention was signed 
in March 1991 at the headquarters of the International Civil 
Aviation Organization by the members of this organization. Its aim 
is to control the proliferation of plastic explosives used in terrorist 
attacks.
<P>
	It covers unmarked plastic explosives, that is, explosives that do 
not contain a substance permitting easy detection and it requires 
signatory countries and producing countries, such as Canada, to 
mark plastic explosives, except those used for research purposes or 
by the police and the military.
<P>
<B>(1325)</B>
<P>
	The bill proposes marking plastic explosives through the 
incorporation of a chemical that could picked up by the detection 
equipment installed at international airports in Canada to 
counteract the threat of terrorism.
<P>
	Generally speaking, Bill C-71 meets the main requirements of 
the Convention. It appears to meet all of the obligations in it. First, 
the bill prohibits the production of unmarked plastic explosives, 
except in the instances provided. Then it announces regulations 
governing the transportation and possession of unmarked plastic 
explosives. Finally, it provides measures for unmarked plastic 
explosives produced or in possession prior to the date the present 
bill comes into effect, as my colleague stated just before me.
<P>
	Clearly, plastic explosives are the preferred weapon of terrorists, 
for the very reason that they are hard to detect. One need only think 
of recent terrorist incidents mentioned previously by my colleagues 
and remembered by many, such as the one involving Pan Am flight 
103 from London, which exploded over Lockerbie, Scotland, a few 
years ago, or UTA flight 772, that crashed in Africa not too long 
ago. More than 440 people were killed in these two incidents. One 
might also think of the Air-India tragedy, another terrorist attack 
where a 747 that had taken off in Canada blew up over the Atlantic, 
south of the Republic of Ireland, killing everyone on board.
<P>
	We must make sure that plastic explosives can be detected in 
airports. That is what this bill is about. Of course, the Bloc 
Quebecois reaffirms its support. Especially since, based on 
information we received, production costs for the manufacturers, 
most of them private enterprises, will increase only marginally as a 
result of this decision.
<P>
	However, we nonetheless have some concerns about this bill. 
First, while the convention was signed on March 1, 1991, no bill 
was introduced until now, nearly five years later. This obviously 
reflects a glaring lack of efficiency on the part of the government in 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15279"> 15279 </A></B>
<P>
an area directly related to public safety. It took less time to set up  a 
unity Canada group. I think this is indicative of a glaring lack of 
efficiency that should be pointed out.
<P>
	Of course, the goal in itself is commendable and we support it 
but how effective will the bill really be? First of all, not all 
countries signed the convention or belong to the International Civil 
Aviation Organization. This means that terrorists will still be able 
to obtain explosives in non member countries where plastic 
explosives will remain unmarked.
<P>
	We put a question to our hon. colleague who said that, as far as 
terrorist groups were concerned, Canada could not say who did or 
did not sell explosives to them. We stress the fact that the federal 
government is not clear, as our colleague just indicated, that 
explosives are obtained in part on the black market. We did not 
need to be told that. We already knew that this was the case. We 
also knew that some of them are home made. But who on the black 
market supplies terrorists? Who are the people operating this black 
market? These questions remain unanswered.
<P>
	In many regards, Canada is like a sieve for contraband goods. I 
am thinking about drugs in particular. It is well known that, in a 
way, Canada is the North American entry point for drugs and 
certainly part of the weapons smuggled on the continent. It is a fact 
that certain groups are currently using this channel and that, in 
many cases, they are more heavily armed than the police and even 
the Canadian armed forces.
<P>
<B>(1330)</B>
<P>
	One wonders what specific measures will be taken in this bill to 
counteract such effects. Canada has problems controlling liquor 
and tobacco smuggling. It is therefore extremely difficult to 
imagine that a bill such as this one, in spite of all its positive 
measures, will effectively prevent the smuggling of explosives.
<P>
	Explosives manufactured for military purposes are totally 
exempt from marking requirements, and we can understand that. 
Obviously, military people do not want to make their arms easy to 
detect; that would make no sense. Nevertheless, there is the 
possibility of leaks.
<P>
	One can also think of the motorcycle gang war currently going in 
the Montreal region, another reason to be cautious in this regard. In 
recent months, there have been numerous victims, mostly gang 
members, but also innocent people.
<P>
	Incidently, I want to thank a group, the Oir Rachaim Tasher 
Yesheva jewish congregation, in Boisbriand, for immediately 
coming to the help of injured persons during one incident. The 
compassion and the support shown by that community deserve to 
be mentioned.
<P>
	As regards the gang war, I also want to stress the work of the 
hon. member for Hochelaga-Maisonneuve who helped start a 
petition in his riding, asking for anti-gang legislation, and who 
organized for the benefit of many Montreal area MPs meetings 
with police officers of the city, including Mr. Sangollo, who is the 
assistant to the chief of police, Mr. Duchesneau. These officers 
gave us an idea of who these motorcycle gangs are and what is 
organized crime.
<P>
	We were clearly told about the need for anti-gang legislation. 
The House should seriously consider such legislation. I am well 
aware that this would not be easy, since we would have to 
specifically define what constitutes a criminal gang.
<P>
	That is not an easy thing to do. We must, of course, take the 
charter of rights and freedoms into account, but I think we must 
eventually find or come as close as possible to finding the exact 
words we need to counter the real damage done by these gangs. 
When I talk about these gangs, I am talking not only about criminal 
bikers but also about the mafia, the Chinese triads, the Japanese 
yakuza and the Russian mafia that is now spreading to all 
industrialized countries and especially to Canada since the collapse 
of the Soviet Union.
<P>
	I think that this bill as it now stands certainly deserves to be 
supported because it is a step in the right direction, but I think it is 
not nearly enough, in the circumstances, to restore the feeling of 
safety that Canadians may have lost or are now losing.
<P>
	I would like to close by repeating a few words that my colleague 
from Matapédia-Matane said in his first speech on this bill, 
because they are words of wisdom. My colleague said this: ``You 
can mark the explosives you make as much as you want, but unless 
you take real measures against violence, organized gangs and 
terrorism, you are simply wasting your time''.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Elwin Hermanson (Kindersley-Lloydminster, Ref.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, it is a pleasure today to rise in the House to address 
third reading debate on Bill C-71, an act to amend the Explosives 
Act.
<P>
	I am happy to inform the House that my party is supporting Bill 
C-71. I will not go on at great length to discuss the bill because of 
that support. It is good to see legislation come forward in the House 
which is required and which we can support because so often 
legislation has been flawed.
<P>
	My one criticism of the business of the House has been that we 
have had to deal with a lot of rather inconsequential legislation. 
While Bill C-71 is important, all members of the House would have 
passed the bill rather quickly. It has not received much obstruction. 
It seems odd that we are spending so much time on these bills of 
little consequence when there are issues like the national debt and 
deficit to deal with. UI reform is needed. Health care reform is 
needed. Those areas are being ignored by the government.
<P>

<B><A NAME="15280"> 15280 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1335)</B>
<P>
	I notice the minister of agriculture is present in the House. 
Certainly there are agriculture issues which need to be brought to 
the front burner. We encourage members on the opposite side of the 
House to bring forward those very pressing issues.
<P>
	Yes, we will give support to the common sense bills brought 
before the House like Bill C-71, but let us see a little more 
substance. Let us see a little more meat to deal with.
<P>
	The bill to amend the Explosives Act will allow Canada to 
formally participate in an international convention on the marking 
of plastic explosives for the purpose of detection, a very 
worthwhile cause. The purpose of the convention is to make sure 
that as many plastic explosives in the world as possible are able to 
be detected by legal authorities mostly in airports to stop terrorism.
<P>
	We all use airports, except perhaps the members from Ottawa 
who I am sure stay home all the time. We recognize the importance 
of safety and the importance of being able to detect explosives so 
that our air traffic continues to be safe. It is an anti-terrorism bill. 
Therefore I can give my hearty endorsement to the piece of 
legislation.
<P>
	After the Air India tragedy and the PanAm bombing over 
Lockerbie, Scotland, in the late 1980s, the United Nations passed 
two separate resolutions both in 1989. One was passed by the 
security council and the other by the general assembly. These 
resolutions urged the International Civil Aviation Organization, 
another U, body to intensify its work on an international regime for 
the marking of plastic explosives for the purpose of detection.
<P>
	Out of those resolutions was born the convention I have already 
mentioned. It was put forward in Montreal in 1991 and was signed 
by 100 nations. Although Canada signed as well it did not have the 
legal authority to ratify it. The bill will grant Canada the ability to 
formally ratify the convention, another reason to endorse the 
legislation.
<P>
	For the last four years research has been ongoing to consult with 
the industry and develop an appropriate chemical marker. It has 
been developed in labs in New Jersey. Now is the time to move 
forward.
<P>
	Unfortunately the convention will not take effect until 35 nations 
become signatories, 5 of them producer nations. Five nations which 
produce plastic explosives need to sign this agreement. I 
understand that five producer countries have signed, among them 
Slovakia, Switzerland, Norway, the Czech Republic and Spain. 
Canada will be the sixth producer country to sign. This still means 
that only 13 countries including Canada will have legally ratified 
the convention. That is a long way  from the 35 that are needed to 
actually put the wishes of the convention into reality.
<P>
	I agree that the ordinary terrorist without international 
connections will be harder pressed to obtain material that will 
escape detection devices. Therefore the convention is a positive 
thing.
<P>
	Interestingly the United States has signed the convention but as 
yet has not introduced legislation to ratify it. We talked with the 
explosives industry organization in Washington, the Institute of the 
Makers of Explosives. It endorses the convention and said that the 
Federal Aviation Administration, the lead agency in America 
dealing with the issue, may introduce legislation soon to ratify it 
but nothing has been done to date.
<P>
	We have not had an incident for a long time like the Lockerbie 
incident or the Air India disaster. The urgency unfortunately has 
died down somewhat and the issue has probably taken a lower 
priority. I hope it will not take another tragedy to bring the issue to 
the world stage once more.
<P>
	For whatever reasons the convention is not in force right now 
and therefore it really is not relevant right now. Probably until the 
United States recognizes it, no significant countries will join in 
ratifying the law.
<P>
	The amendment to our own act will continue to be irrelevant 
until we do something on a political level to bring the United States 
into the game. Until that happens nothing will ever get done and 
airline passengers all over the world will be at greater risk from the 
plastic explosives going undetected in aeroplanes.
<P>
	A couple of weeks ago the member for Fraser Valley East called 
on the Minister of Natural Resources to urge her American 
counterparts to do something about it, to urge them to go ahead and 
ratify the convention so that other nations would come on board. 
My colleague has since received a letter from the minister saying 
that the Americans are already working on legislation implying 
that there is no need to address the problem.
<P>
<B>(1340 )</B>
<P>
	We would reply that the Americans have been working on it for 
years with no action. The minister needs to express her concerns 
directly on a political level to her American counterpart and we are 
calling on her again today to do that. We want the minister to call 
her American counterpart and bring him up to speed on the issue. 
We urge the United States to move on the issue and formally 
approve the convention so that we can keep terrorism where it 
belongs. Of course it does not belong at all.
<P>
	The minister also promised in her letter to participate in an 
American study that will examine the cost and benefits of marking 
conventional explosives that are being used in the biker bombings 
in Montreal to see whether it would be cost effective to identify all  
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15281"> 15281 </A></B>
<P>
explosives and not just plastic explosives. We are pleased to hear 
that Canada will take part in this study and we look forward to the 
results.
<P>
	In conclusion, I reiterate that I support Bill C-71. My colleagues 
support Bill C-71. It will not set the world on its head but it is a step 
in the right direction and is worthy of our support. It is certainly a 
shame that the government is not moving ahead with a Canadian 
agenda but instead is keeping to housekeeping legislation like this 
which we could have moved through even more rapidly than it is 
going through the House.
<P>
	I appreciate the opportunity to speak to the legislation and look 
forward to its speedy passage.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Roseanne Skoke (Central Nova, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
Explosives Act is an act of public and worker safety which 
regulates the composition, quality and character of explosives in 
addition to their manufacture, importation, sale, purchase, 
possession and storage. It also controls the use of fireworks.
<P>
	The amendment is necessary to require the incorporation of a 
detectable additive in plastic explosives coupled with a provision 
to enable the governor in council to make regulations to control 
unmarked plastic explosives. This will hinder terrorism and will 
enable Canada to ratify the ICAO convention on the marking of 
plastic explosives for the purpose of detection.
<P>
	The principal provisions of the bill are worth noting. The 
principles are: to require the marking of most plastic explosives for 
the purpose of detection; to prohibit the manufacture, storage, 
possession, transfer of possession, transportation, import and 
export of unmarked plastic explosives, except as may be permitted 
by the terms of the convention or required by overriding military 
necessity; and to empower the governor in council to make 
regulations governing the possession, transfer and disposal of any 
unmarked plastic explosives.
<P>
	The passage of the legislation will vault Canada ahead of the 
U.S. as the only producer state in the Americas to have ratified the 
convention.
<P>
	Many questions have been asked with respect to the Explosives 
Act. Some of those questions are technical; others relate to policy 
and still others are legal questions. I intend to address those 
questions today.
<P>
	One technical question asked is: Will the addition of a detection 
agent be effective in combating terrorism in disguise? The answer 
is yes. The proposed detection agents are of such character they can 
be detected by bomb detection equipment of current technology 
and use in Canada. This would render marked plastic explosives an 
undesirable choice for assembling bombs. A second benefit from 
tagging plastic explosives is that detection of illegal stockpiles will 
be simplified.
<P>
	Another technical question often asked is: Will the presence of 
the detection agent compromise the performance or safety of 
plastic explosives? The answer is no. Only one type of plastic 
explosive, a military version known as C-4, is manufactured in 
small quantities in Canada. The safety and performance 
characteristics of the marked version have been verified by the 
manufacturer, the military and the Canadian Explosives Research 
Laboratory.
<P>
	Another technical question asked is: Will there be a problem in 
using the existing stocks of unmarked plastic explosives? The 
answer is no. Small existing stocks of unmarked plastic explosives 
in Canada coupled with ample grace periods of three years for the 
public and fifteen years for the military police to use up or destroy 
these stocks were judged to be satisfactory during consultations 
with all concerned parties.
<P>
<B>(1345 )</B>
<P>
	Another technical question often asked is whether explosives 
technology is advancing so rapidly that this initiative will soon be 
rendered obsolete. The answer is no. Explosives technology is 
stable at this time. In North America, plastic explosives are 
implicated in very few bombs targeted at aircraft. Prohibitions 
against the import, export and transfer of unmarked plastic 
explosives will discourage terrorists from using Canada as a 
location to plant bombs on aircraft.
<P>
	Many policy questions have been raised as well. One question 
often asked is who may manufacture, possess and use plastic 
explosives in Canada and how will the legislation affect their 
activities. Plastic explosives in the form of military demolition 
charges are manufactured in small quantities on an as required 
basis by Les produits chimiques Expro in Valleyfield, Quebec. This 
manufacturer is authorized by its factory licence, which is issued 
pursuant to the Explosives Act and regulations. Sale and 
distribution of this product is limited to the military, as well as 
police explosives disposal units.
<P>
	Commercial plastic explosives in sheet form are legally 
imported from the U.S. by companies engaged in hardening metal 
surfaces and explosives welding. The sole Canadian manufacturer 
does not expect any problems. Importers of commercial plastic 
explosives in sheet form, however, may experience difficulties in 
locating suppliers of marked product.
<P>
	Another policy question often asked is whether these new 
restrictions will affect competitiveness. The answer is no. It is 
estimated that the cost associated with incorporating the additive 
will increase selling prices by no more than 1.25 per cent. It is quite 
possible that the Canadian manufacturer could realize a 
competitive advantage in international markets by being fast off 
the mark in offering marked products.
<P>
	Another policy question often asked is if this initiative is 
connected in any way to the new proposed gun control legislation. 
The answer is no. This initiative is the result of an agreement 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15282"> 15282 </A></B>
<P>
signed in March 1991 and has no  connection whatsoever to the gun 
control legislation recently tabled.
<P>
	Often legal questions are asked with respect to the act. One 
question often asked is why the act is to come into force by order in 
council. It is specifically provided that the act will come into force 
on a day to be set by the order of the governor in council to ensure 
that the grace periods provided for in the convention will be 
respected. This will enable us to make the date of coming into force 
of the act coincide with that of the coming into force of the 
convention.
<P>
	Another legal question often asked is when the convention will 
come into force. It is impossible to predict when the convention 
will come into force. Section 3 of article 13 of the convention 
provides that the convention will come into force on the 60th day 
following the date of deposit of the 35th instrument of ratification 
by a state, provided that at least five states have declared they are 
producer states. Should 35 instruments of ratification be deposited 
before the deposit of their instruments by five producer states, the 
convention will come into force on the 60th day following the date 
of deposit of the instrument of ratification of the fifth producer 
state.
<P>
	Another legal question often asked is what happens to the 
definition of detection agent if the technical annex is amended. 
This is not a problem. The word convention is defined to refer to 
the convention as amended from time to time. This means that the 
definition of detection agent is ambulatory. It will follow any 
amendment in the technical annex to the convention.
<P>
	Finally a further legal question often asked is what happens to 
the definition of plastic explosives if the convention is amended. 
Amendments to the definition of plastic explosives in the 
convention would not be automatically reflected in the Explosives 
Act because we repeated the definition instead of referring to it. We 
would have to amend the definition in the Explosives Act in order 
to have it follow an amendment to that found in the convention. 
However, from a practical point of view this should not be a 
problem. The definition of plastic explosives is standard. 
Furthermore it is unlikely that the convention itself will be 
amended. The only amendments contemplated are to the technical 
annex.
<P>
<B>(1350)</B>
<P>
	In addition to the technical questions, the policy questions, and 
the legal questions, we have what we refer to as miscellaneous 
questions. It is often asked why it took nearly five years from the 
March 1991 signing of the convention to table the bill. Initial MOU 
development, which began shortly after the signing of the 
convention, involved considerable consultation with DND, Canada 
Customs, and Transport Canada. Additional time was lost in 1993 
when there was a change in government prior to the tabling and 
approval of the memorandum to cabinet.  It required a second 
consultation and resubmission of the MC.
<P>
	In conclusion I support the Explosives Act. As a member of the 
natural resources committee I recommend Bill C-71, the 
Explosives Act, at report stage to this honourable House.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Alex Shepherd (Durham, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am very 
pleased to enter the debate on Bill C-71, an act to amend the 
Explosives Act.
<P>
	When I read over the act I notice some very specific benefits for 
Canada, specifically in the area of vapour detection. Our 
government is very interested in promoting scientific and 
technological devices to expand our knowledge base and to 
increase employment. It is very interesting that Canada is a world 
leader in this type of technology.
<P>
	I am very pleased to speak in favour of the bill. I note this is a 
UN convention. It basically restores our commitment to the United 
Nations and to other countries to detect plastic explosives and 
prevent their exportation throughout the world.
<P>
	There have been a few classic examples of plastic explosives 
being used by terrorists both in and out of Canada. Many of us can 
remember the Air India disaster and numerous other cases where 
terrorists have used plastic explosives and the death and 
dismemberment of many innocent people has resulted. The bill 
basically addresses that issue with the objective of detecting and 
stamping out the use of plastic explosives for that very purpose.
<P>
	It is necessary that the bill be brought into place to recognize our 
commitment to the United Nations and to recognize the need to 
deal with terrorist activities. I note that Canada is also a producer of 
plastic explosives, but the main consumer of them in Canada is our 
own military. I understand the Canadian military has 
approximately a 10-year supply of plastic explosives. I am very 
happy to see that we have made a provision in the act for a 15-year 
moratorium to allow the inventory of unmarked plastic explosives 
to be brought down while the new replacements have this detection 
device included.
<P>
	I can remember being in Heathrow International Airport where 
they use canines and detection devices to control the exportation of 
firearms and dangerous substances. We have developed a whole 
technology to do that. The world does that very well. However we 
must always be on guard for the development of new types 
technology. Plastic explosives and small component devices can be 
exported very easily.
<P>
<B>(1355 )</B>
<P>
	In conclusion I support Bill C-71 and the effect it will have in the 
industrial sector in creating jobs for Canadians.

<P>
	The protection of families, family life and family values must be

Canadians whose helicopter crashed yesterday heading home from 
Kumtor gold mine in Russia, where they were struggling to bring a

	Throughout history the lure of gold has prompted prospectors to 
face incredible hardships, often only with a packhorse, a pick, a 
shovel, or a gold pan. The helicopter serves as the modern 
prospector's packhorse, so all of us in the mining industry can 
readily sympathize when an accident involves these vehicles.
<P>
	Gold has its own way of calling us, so precious and fundamental 
in value. Despite the very real hardships involved, the search for 
gold will continue to beckon Canadian prospectors and mine 
developers to snowy mountain tops around the world. Meanwhile, 
our prayers and good wishes go out to all 15 people on board, as

	<B>Mr. John Solomon (Regina-Lumsden, NDP):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
today's Auditor General of Canada report reaffirms what New 
Democrats have been telling Canadians for years, that the high real 
interest rate policy is the major reason for our massive debt, not 
social program spending.
<P>
	High real interest rates hurt the economy, drive up debt and kill 
jobs. If the federal debt of $546 billion is a mortgage, Canadians 
are becoming tenants in their own homes, because 46 per cent of 
the debt is held by foreigners.
<P>
	Canada's net foreign indebtedness is by far the highest among 
major industrialized countries. Even Italy has a foreign debt of less 
than 12 per cent.
<P>
	New Democrats have called the Liberal government's high 
interest rate policy a disaster and the auditor general agrees. High 
interest rates have created nearly one-third of our debt. More debt 
should be held by the Bank of Canada. Social program spending 
has not contributed significantly to Canada's debt.
<P>
	In view of this evidence, will the Liberals now create a fair 
economic policy for Canadians, rather than one for foreign 
investors?

	Ensuring timely and cost effective mail delivery to all Canadians 
is no small challenge. Doing so in the midst of a revolution in 
communications and at a profit is the challenge that Canada Post 
faces.
<P>
	For a time, closing rural post offices was seen as a way for 
Canada Post to meet this challenge, but this avenue was closed with 
the decision by the Minister of Public Works and Government 
Services to impose a moratorium on the closure of small rural post 
offices. That decision has proven to be enlightened. It has 
refocused the energies of Canada Post and allowed the corporation 
to discover that its more than 19,000 outlets are not liabilities but 
important assets. Now it is time to broaden the range of services 
which Canada Post provides, especially to rural Canadians.

	<B>Mr. Maurice Godin (Châteauguay, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, every 
day, owing to Canada's enormous debt, a federalist legacy, we see 
the extent to which interest rates and monetary policy are 
determined by the central bank of our neighbours to the south and 
by international financial markets.
<P>
	On May 16, 1994, even Canada's finance minister acknowledged 
this dependence on financial markets, and I quote: ``Canada's debt, 
especially its foreign debt, undermines the sovereignty of this 
country. Our sovereignty suffers when we have to keep our interest 
rates high-even if our rate of inflation is among the lowest in the 
world-in order to attract foreign investment''.
<P>
	Because of Canada's dependence on foreign investment, it is 
clear that if the finance minister ignores his obligations as the 
manager of this debt by refusing to negotiate a new economic 
partnership with Quebec, national and foreign markets will call 
him in to order.

business and employee representatives, yesterday denounced 
federal encroachment, in the form of Bill C-96, in the area of 
manpower training. This public organization is asking the 
government to stop setting up new parallel structures and to refrain 
from further intrusion into Quebec jurisdiction.
<P>
	I ask the Prime Minister if he acknowledges that, with Bill C-96, 
Ottawa is acquiring the means to meddle further in manpower 
training and will therefore increase overlap and waste to the 
detriment of the unemployed and Quebec's jurisdiction?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Human Resources 
Development and Minister of Western Economic

Opposition has not taken the time to read the bill. There are no new 
powers given to the human resources department, as he may well 
recall.
<P>
	The human resources department is an amalgamation of four 
other departments to provide a more effective delivery of services 
across Canada. The powers under article 6 were also contained 
within the existing departments. Over the past year they have 
allowed us to have almost 50,000 different contracts and 
agreements with a wide variety of groups, including the province of 
Quebec and the Government of Quebec in order to better assist 
Quebec workers to get back to work and to help with training. We 
have done that in a very co-operative way.
<P>
	I hope the hon. Leader of the Opposition will not go off on 
another wild goose chase but will look at the legislation and see 
there are no new powers. We are simply trying to make a more 
efficient delivery of what the government wants to do which is help 
people get back to work.

the Société québécoise de développement de la main-d'oeuvre is a 
non partisan organization, which brings together all stakeholders in 
Quebec, which knows how to read bills, and which saw in this one a 
dangerous encroachment upon Quebec's jurisdiction.
<P>
	I would ask the Prime Minister whether he acknowledges that, 
with this bill, his government is going against the very broad 
consensus in Quebec in favour of repatriating financial 
responsibility for manpower training?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the Minister of Human Resources Development said it 
clearly a few seconds ago. He said that the bill before Parliament at 
this moment is aimed at amalgamating government agencies that 
were under different departments, and the powers delegated to the 
minister at this moment are exactly the same as those in previous 
legislation.
<P>
	At this point, with all the provinces, including Quebec, we are 
trying to make administrative arrangements to reduce duplication. 
The minister, in fact, signed a number of agreements with the 
Government of Quebec over this past summer.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the government cannot minimize what is going on. It is an 
unprecedented assault on all legislative fronts, which is aimed 
specifically at giving the federal government the means to meddle 
once and for all throughout an area of Quebec jurisdiction, messing 
things up further than they already are at the moment.

	Does the Prime Minister consider the position taken by his 
federalist ally a mere caprice as well and will he also sweep him 
away with a wave of his hand?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, this is quite a pleasant about face. Yesterday, I was being 
criticized for forcing all businessmen to be on my side. There are 
some who do not agree with us. That is what democracy is all 
about.
<P>
<B>(1420)</B>
<P>
	I am not asking everyone to be on our side. At the moment, we 
are trying to give the Minister of Human Resources Development 
the legislative means to ensure programs are better co-ordinated. 
At present, we are trying with the provinces, including Quebec, to 
find ways to decentralize and administer them so that Canadians 
may benefit directly from them.
<P>
	I do not think our plan is to build a bigger public service in 
Ottawa. We proved that recently by cutting 45,000 public service 
positions in the federal government. If we were here to build 
empires, we would not be laying off 15 per cent of the workforce.
<P>
	If we can deliver services to people better than we do at the 
moment, we are always ready to look at the options, but our 
objective is to ensure that regions in Canada with more 
unemployed receive essentially the same benefits as regions that 
are well off.
<P>
	Our job, as the Government of Canada, is to ensure that well off 
regions and prosperous citizens are able to help those, across 
Canada, in the Maritimes as in Quebec, who are, unfortunately, in 
the difficult situation of being out of work at the moment.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the Minister of Human Resources Development.
<P>
	Yesterday, the Société québécoise de developpement de la 
main-d'oeuvre strongly denounced Bill C-96, saying: Quebec 
alone will hold the responsibility for manpower adjustment and 
trade training policies on its territory and will therefore repatriate 
the budgets allocated by the federal government for these programs 
in Quebec.
<P>
	Will the minister agree that the federal government's plans 
confer upon it the possibility of entering directly into an agreement 
with any individual or organization of its choice, thereby turning its 
back on the consensus of the partners making up the SQDM and 
their priorities and on the unemployed of Quebec?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Human Resources 
Development and Minister of Western Economic 
Diversification, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the hon. member for Mercier 
knows better than that because she has been  carefully following 
many of the developments and initiatives we have taken.
<P>
	Under the existing legislative authority which would simply be 
ratified in the new bill we have an agreement with the Government 
of Quebec to provide assistance to older workers who have been 
displaced from their jobs.
<P>
	We buy annuities. Last year we helped close to 2,000 workers in 
Quebec. It simply gives us the authority to purchase those annuities 
to help those older workers retain some income when they cannot 
get a job.
<P>
	It seems the hon. member for Mercier is telling the federal 
government that we cannot work with the Government of Quebec, 
we cannot help older workers, we cannot buy annuities and we 
cannot help people who are displaced from their jobs. It is an 
advocacy of a do nothing approach to helping people who do not 
have jobs.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, after a 
careful and most thorough examination, we find no previous 
legislation which gave legal and constitutional power to the 
government to sign agreements directly with individuals and 
organizations. This is what we are denouncing.
<P>
	Does the minister acknowledge that all he has to offer Quebecers 
is an agreement which Daniel Johnson himself labelled, as did the 
present Minister of Labour, a bargain basement agreement and 
refused to sign because it did not correspond in the least to the 
consensus in Quebec.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Human Resources 
Development and Minister of Western Economic 
Diversification, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the hon. member has made a 
very gross error in factual information. She said that somehow we 
are acquiring new powers. The legislation simply confirms existing 
mandates under the jurisdiction of Parliament on things like the 
Unemployment Insurance Act and the Department of Labour Act.
<P>
	As a result, last year under existing authorities which will simply 
be confirmed by the new act, we signed close to 10,000 contracts 
with not for profit organizations. We signed 9,300 contracts with 
private firms. We had 2,800 contracts with public sector 
organizations and municipalities. We even have a number of 
contracts with the Government of Quebec which we have signed. 
For example, when the Hyundai plant in Bromont was going down 
we worked closely with the Government of Quebec to collaborate 
and help displaced workers.
<P>
<B>(1425)</B>
<P>
	We are already doing those things under existing authority. We 
are simply trying to have administrative simplification and

	<B>Mr. Bob Mills (Red Deer, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, after years of 
peacekeeping under very difficult circumstances our ground troops 
are finally coming home from Bosnia. Our troops have done the 
very best job possible and all Canadians are extremely proud of 
them.
<P>
	While the government blasted the Reform Party for suggesting a 
withdrawal, when the UN told it the same thing last night it 
immediately fell into line. Now that our troops are coming home 
will the Prime Minister guarantee that before Canada commits to 
any future missions Parliament will be allowed to establish a clear 
set of criteria for all future military commitments?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, Canadian soldiers in the former Yugoslavia for the last 
three years have performed an excellent duty. That is recognized by 
everybody.
<P>
	The United Nations decided the battalion in Visoko is not needed 
any more because it is within an area completely controlled by the 
Bosnian government. We will repatriate its members with pleasure 
and thank them for a job extremely well done.
<P>
	We were there because the UN asked us to be there. Now the UN 
says they do not need to be there any more, and so we will bring the 
troops back to Canada.
<P>
	For the first time ever we have had debate on this in the House of 
Commons. I have seen the Reform Party change its position two or 
three times since the beginning. For our part we have always been 
behind the UN and behind the Canadian soldiers who are 
considered the best there.
<P>
	Now the mission is over. We are happy. The troops will be back 
in Canada with the satisfaction of having accomplished an 
excellent job in Visoko. We are all proud of them in Canada.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bob Mills (Red Deer, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the mandate in 
Bosnia disappeared months ago. We have been calling for the 
withdrawal for months now. Canadians are demanding to know 
before they commit to these sorts of missions what they will cost.
<P>
	They want to know how long we will be there. They want to 
know whether we can deliver the mandate being given to us. They 
want to know whether we will be part of the decision making 
process or whether we will simply be followers.
<P>
	Can the Prime Minister tell Canadians the government has 
learned a lesson from this mission and that it will promise to let 
Parliament be involved and have a free vote on developing criteria 
for peacekeeping?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the mandate we accepted in February after a debate in the 
House of Commons was until the end of this month.
<P>
	We respected the mandate. The UN now says it does not need the 
Canadian troops because it wants to reduce the number. We are 
happy because if we bring them back to Canada they will be better 
off.
<P>
	Canada is always available when people are in very difficult 
circumstances, when there is misery and when people have been 
killed to protect families, children and so on. We have always been 
there. We will do it again and there will be a debate in the House of 
Commons.
<P>
	The peacekeeping mission was created by the Canadian 
government. The peacekeepers who are so well known in the world 
were created by Prime Minister Lester B. Pearson, my predecessor 
as leader of the Liberal Party. It was done at the time of the war of 
Great Britain and France against Egypt. He had the guts for the 
good of the peace of the world to say to the British and the French 
that war had to stop.
<P>
	It is in the tradition of Lester B. Pearson that we are making our 
decision in relation to the UN.
<P>
<B>(1430 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bob Mills (Red Deer, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I think this is 
typical of how the government reacts to issues. It is in the past. It 
lives in the past. It gives us a history lesson. What we really need to 
do is look to the future. The 21st century is coming. It is going to be 
different. The old line politics will not work any more.
<P>
	The government is trying to claim victory on the backs of a 
decision made by the UN. It is about time that it admitted that we 
need these criteria, that people are demanding these criteria, and 
that people are really interested in this.
<P>
	I wonder if the Prime Minister is going to be just like the last 
government: do things in secret and then try to somehow 
rubberstamp them by bringing them here after the decision is made.
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I believe I can see how desperate they are.
<P>
	The member talks about the past. Yes, the past was last week, 
when the Minister of Foreign Affairs made a very important speech 
at the United Nations recommending the modernization of the 
United Nations. What the hon. member should do to complete his 
education is read the speech of the minister.

	<B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, my question is directed to the Minister of Human 
Resources Development.
<P>
	Clearly the minister is about to make the same mistake with Bill 
C-96 as the Minister of Industry in the case of Bill C-88 on 
interprovincial trade, by unilaterally assuming powers that negate 
the responsibilities of the provinces. I may recall that after scoffing 
at the objections of the official opposition, the Minister of Industry 
had to acknowledge his mistake and back down.
<P>
	If the minister does not intend to go over the heads of the 
provinces, why does he use clause 6 and clause 20 of the bill to 
acquire the means to do so, it is there in black and white?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Human Resources 
Development and Minister of Western Economic 
Diversification, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, we have in fact done quite the 
opposite.
<P>
	As I have said in the House before, when the minister of 
employment was given her new task I immediately wrote and 
suggested that we sit down and negotiate the whole question of the 
labour market issues in Quebec with a view to taking a look at 75 
per cent of the programming we do in that province and developing 
a different set of authorities, joint planning, and transferring certain 
responsibilities. The answer from the minister of employment was 
no; she did not even want to talk about it.
<P>
	I tried again. I wrote back to her and said let us do a joint study 
between the SQDM, the Government of Quebec, and my 
government on duplication and overlap. I made the offer, saying 
that we would jointly pay for it. Again the minister of employment 
refused to answer.
<P>
	My point is that I cannot force the minister of employment in 
Quebec to co-operate with me. I would like to have that 
co-operation. I want to sit down and work out how we can get a 
better delineation of responsibilities. I would urge the hon. member 
to go back and talk to the minister of employment in Quebec and 
ask her when she is ready to co-operate. As soon as she says yes, I 
will be there.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, apparently the minister would like to be Canada's minister 
of education. Would the minister agree he is taking the means to 
circumvent the provincial governments because he wants to 
establish a national strategy for intervening in manpower issues, 
which may be acceptable to other provinces but flagrantly  
contradicts the general consensus expressed many times on this 
matter in Quebec?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Human Resources 
Development and Minister of Western Economic 
Diversification, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is quite the contrary again. 
The member should know, because he has been in the House now 
for two years, that in fact what we have arranged is a very good, 
co-operative arrangement in the area of student assistance. We 
have the Canada student loans program. Quebec has its own 
program.
<P>
	When we reformed our program this summer and brought in 
programs to provide specific grants for disabled students and 
students with high income needs that would enable them to go 
school earlier, we transferred that money directly to the province of 
Quebec so it could offer the same programs to its own students. 
Now that is the notion of flexible federalism: not a takeover, but a 
way of working in co-operation.

<P>
<B>(1435 )</B>
<P>
	Every day we have seen another leadership crisis in the 
Department of National Defence. The minister and the CDS are 
publicly at war. These are Liberal problems, and the government 
uses the inquiry to justify inaction. The Canadian Armed Forces are 
demoralized, dispirited, and cannot wait until June 1996 for the 
government to act.
<P>

at the Department of National Defence?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Fred Mifflin (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
National Defence and Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr.

assure you it is aided and abetted by the irrelevant questions that 
are put forward by the members of the third party.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Hart (Okanagan-Similkameen-Merritt, Ref.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, the Minister of National Defence has mishandled de 
Chastelain, Kenward, Vernon, Labbé, and it goes on and on and on 
every single day.
<P>
	My question is directed to the Prime Minister. The Liberal 
government has done nothing to correct the leadership problems at 
DND. The Prime Minister's confidence in his Minister of National 
Defence and the Chief of Defence Staff is misplaced. Will the 
Prime Minister solve the leadership problem and demand the 
resignation of the Chief of Defence Staff and his Minister of

much so that it was even criticized by hard core federalists in

I will rephrase it to say I think hon. member has strayed 
substantially from the line of logic and reason.
<P>
	I would simply quote to him clause 6 of the bill. It is in black and 
white. It reads: ``The powers, duties and functions of the minister 
extend and include matters over which Parliament has 
jurisdiction''. That is the existing act. There is no difference. 
Nothing has changed. Nothing is altered. Nothing is amended. 
Everything is the same. We simply are able to work out the kinds of 
agreements and arrangements with provinces that the department 
of labour, the department of employment and immigration, the 
department of welfare, parts of the department that used to be in 
citizenship have all done over the past 30, 40, 50 years. Nothing 
has changed. We are working on the legislative base that exists. We 
are simply  consolidating the powers because the department has 
been consolidated.

	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is really 
too bad that the Minister of Human Resources Development should 
stoop to name-calling, the logic of the weak, the logic of those who 
have nothing to say. He would be better off answering the question. 
We would rather have answers than arrogance. Quebecers would 
appreciate that.
<P>
	I will direct my question to the Prime Minister, and maybe then I 
will get an answer. Would the Prime Minister agree that the bill 
introduced by his Minister of Human Resources Development is a 
perfect illustration of the federalism by administrative agreement 
he is proposing to Quebecers, in other words: first step, Ottawa 
assumes all powers over a given jurisdiction; second step, it asks 
the provinces to come and beg to have these powers back, and 
third, I am sorry to add, he calls them names when they do?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the minister just explained very clearly something that is 
quite straightforward. A number of departments were amalgamated 
to put all human resources together. The powers given to the 
minister are the same as they were in each department separately.
<P>
	The bill clearly says that no new powers have been given to the 
minister. What we are trying to do is use certain decisions and 
administrative agreements, which will necessary vary from 
province to province because some are more interested than others, 
as a way to make adjustments appropriate to the needs and wishes 
of each province.
<P>
	This is federalism at its most flexible, and there is no-
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chrétien (Saint-Maurice):</B> Especially since they keep 
saying we are empire building. Again, I want to say that we have 
just cut 45,000 jobs within the federal government. That is not 
because we want more power and more bureaucrats. The minister 
eliminated 5,000 jobs in his own department to make his operations 
even more effective and less costly for the people of this country. 
We are accused of empire building, when we are being extremely

should be identified beyond  the two-year rolling targets that have

will finally be controlled?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional 
Development-Quebec, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, in fact the IMF in its 
report was quite complimentary of the actions the government has 
taken. Indeed, the report of the Auditor General of Canada was 
equally complimentary of the actions we have taken, both in terms 
of deficit reduction and in terms of the publication of information.
<P>
	I have made it very clear that the process that was employed by 
the previous government, which was to simply set a series of long 
term targets, most of which occurred after an election and were 
never attained, was not a process we were going to follow, that in 
fact the series of rolling two-year targets was far more beneficial. 
In fact, it is as a result of that that this government has consistently 
hit every single target it has set.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Williams (St. Albert, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the IMF 
wants to know when the debt is going to be under control. The 
Auditor General of Canada wants to know when it is going to be 
under control. Canadians want to know when it is going to be under 
control.

rolling targets, when the deficit will be eliminated.

arises when a government very clearly not only hits its targets but 
in fact brings forth balanced legislation, a balanced program to do 
what it set out to do.

the federal debt approaching $600 billion, he feels that Parliament 
and the Canadian public need  more information, particularly 
regarding the size of the debt and the choices taxpayers will have to 
make.
<P>
	Will the Prime Minister admit that, by waiting for the

choices to be made, as requested by the auditor general?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister

Development-Quebec, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, the auditor general 
fully agrees with us that, before this debate can take place-and we 
are all in favour of this debate-there should at least be statistical 
data and figures available. He made this quite clear. Last year's 
figures are not ready yet. As soon as they are and as soon as we get 
an invitation from the committee, we will gladly go before the 
committee.
<P>
	Having said that, I would like to mention what the auditor 
general asked us to do. He asked us to produce an annual financial 
statement, and we did. He asked us to provide the public with more 
information on our tax expenditures, and we did. He asked us to 
produce an annual economic update; we did so for our first two

<P>
	My question is for the Minister of Finance. Will the Minister of

United States, often clearing Canadian customs without a Canadian 
Wheat Board export permit. On Tuesday, three American trucks 
hauling barley from Canada were seized by customs as they tried to 
enter the United States. Previously, these same trucks with the 
same product were allowed to enter the United States.
<P>
	Is it legal or is it illegal? Are exports permitted or are they 
refused? Will the minister tell confused farmers why some trucks 
are seized and others are not?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Ralph E. Goodale (Minister of Agriculture and 
Agri-Food, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the law on this point is very clear 
with respect to export of wheat and barley from Canada. Obviously, 
the appropriate paperwork and authorization from the Canadian 
Wheat Board are required. When that paperwork is not provided, 
then the export is contrary to the regulations. Those regulations are 
enforced in due course as the law requires. I trust the Reform Party 
is not advocating violations of the law.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Elwin Hermanson (Kindersley-Lloydminster, Ref.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, actually the law is not always enforced. In fact, 
farmers do not know what the law is because there is no standard.
<P>
	The minister in charge of Canadian customs, the Minister of 
National Revenue, has received notice that today trucks carrying 
farmer owned wheat and barley will pull in at Canada customs at 
the Peace Gardens in Manitoba. I would like to know if the minister 
has given orders to customs officials to seize the trucks or if he has 
given orders to let those trucks pass through into the United States?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Ralph E. Goodale (Minister of Agriculture and 
Agri-Food, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the officials of the Government of 
Canada, whether they work for my  department or Revenue Canada 
or any other department of the Government of Canada, need no 
instructions to do their job. They know what their job is and they 
will exercise their responsibilities.

question is for the Prime Minister. On Monday, the Minister of 
Intergovernmental Affairs and the Prime Minister both said that 
Quebec was receiving more than its share of federal moneys for 
science and technology. However, the secret document prepared for 
Operation Unity clearly shows that, in 1993, Quebec only received 
17.1 per cent of the federal moneys spent on research and 
development.
<P>
	Given the figures provided by Industry Canada, will the Prime

Quebec was getting its fair share, and that in fact our province was 
treated unfairly as regards the establishment of federal research 
centres?

the Indian Act does not empower individual band members.
<P>
	When will the minister introduce a mandate for other 
government departments such as Revenue Canada and the auditor

	<B>Hon. Ron Irwin (Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern

<P>
	On Frog Lake there is an issue between those who want to have

the chief's health-he is a good chief-has deteriorated

	<B>Hon. Audrey McLaughlin (Yukon, NDP):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the Minister of Finance.
<P>
	The government continues to indicate that social and health 
programs are the major cause of debt and deficit but as the minister 
knows and has said in the House, it is tax loopholes and the high 
interest rate policy.
<P>
	Today's auditor general report reaffirms that Canada's level of 
foreign indebtedness is the highest among major industrial nations 
and that this foreign indebtedness is threatened by control of 
monetary policy.
<P>
	I ask the minister if he would consider two measures to start 
taking control of our monetary policy. One is whether he would 
reinstate reserve requirements for the chartered banks with the 
Bank of Canada which would allow the bank to assume more of 
Canadian debt, and whether he would reduce the 20 per cent 
foreign investment option with RRSPs which would encourage 
Canadians to invest in Canada.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional 
Development-Quebec, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the hon. member has 
properly identified a problem the government in its deficit 
reduction program has identified and is seeking to address, the very 
high level of foreign indebtedness which exists primarily in the 
private sector and in a number of provincial government 
borrowings.
<P>
	I do not believe, however, the solutions brought forth by the 
member really suit. We must increase the percentage of Canada's 
savings.
<P>
	As far as the reserve requirements of the banks, if we are to 
create jobs we want to make sure our banks are competitive with 
other banks.
<P>
	As far as the 20 per cent rule, we have looked at it. As members 
know, there have been recommendations that the 20 per cent rule 
be increased. Those are not recommendations I would be inclined 
to accede to at this time.

<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="EMPLOYMENTEQUITYACT">EMPLOYMENT EQUITY ACT</A></H3>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Human Resources 
Development and Minister of Western Economic 
Diversification, Lib.)</B> moved that Bill C-64, an act respecting 
employment equity, be read the third time and passed.
<P>
	He said: Mr. Speaker, as the House leader said a few minutes 
ago, this is a very important legislative initiative by the 
government.
<P>
	In introducing it on third reading, I take the opportunity to thank 
several colleagues in the House. As members will recall, we 
introduced the bill with something of a legislative experiment. 
Rather than going to the normal first and second readings, we 
introduced it after the first reading so that a legislative committee 
would have the full opportunity to actually shape the bill. In this 
way it would not simply be a matter of responding to a series of 
government propositions but would actually take a major role in 
defining and designing the elements it felt would be most 
important.
<P>
	I thank the members of the committee on human rights and 
disabled people for their enormous amount of work, the number of 
hearings and the amount of time they have given. That applies to 
members on all sides of the House.
<P>
	I also give my appreciation to the Secretary of State for Youth 
and Training and to my parliamentary secretary who have both 
worked very diligently in making sure the bill was again effectively 
presented to the House. At report stage we were able to get, as I see 
from <I>Hansard</I>, a very effective debate and response.
<P>
<B>(1510 )</B>
<P>
	A good sign of the way that worked is when the opposition party 
presented amendments which improved the bill and we were 
prepared to accept those amendments and work with them so the 
bill would be a better piece of work. I compliment those members 
who have worked so hard on this legislation.
<P>
	Bill C-64 has one fundamental purpose, to remove the systemic 
barriers that prevent people from going to work. We can put it all 
together in one sentence but since I have 30 minutes I will take 
more to elaborate.
<P>
	What we really mean is that over the years practices, attitudes 
and conventional habits have built up in a wide variety of 
workplaces which have prevented people from using their God 
given talents and abilities not because of their merit but because of 
some label attached to them.
<P>
	I am not referring to outright bigotry or discrimination but the 
kind of informal practices and rules that develop  over the years, 
over generations, that simply build up a series of handicaps, 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15297"> 15297 </A></B>
<P>
barriers and obstacles which prevents people in the workplace to 
get their full rights to participate.
<P>
	Numbers of women, aboriginal people, disabled people and 
visible minorities have been denied equal open access to fully 
develop and explore their potentials in the workplace.
<P>
	Ten years ago I had the privilege of establishing the Abella royal 
commission, headed by Judge Rosalie Abella from the court of 
Ontario, to look into this large question of systemic discrimination 
in the workplace. Justice Abella tabled a very historic report. 
Unfortunately by the time the report was tabled the people of 
Canada had decided in their own good wisdom to send me and a 
number of my colleagues on an extended sabbatical on the other 
side of the House. Therefore I was not in a position to fully 
implement those recommendations. It was up to the previous 
government to implement the recommendations of the Abella 
commission.
<P>
	It brought in the Employment Equity Act which passed in 1986. 
It required employers in the federal jurisdiction that employ over 
100 people to implement employment equity and to report on their 
progress.
<P>
	If we look at the original Employment Equity Act, while it was 
full of wonderful language and high sounding objectives and 
phrases, it lacked some very major components. It was a form of 
legislated volunteerism. There was no enforcement. It was simply a 
good wish list of things people were allowed to do.
<P>
	Therefore when it came time when we wanted employers to take 
positive steps to improve the access and openness of the workplace 
and they refused, there was nothing to be done. As a result there 
have been over the years a number of incidents in which 
employment discrimination has continued to prevail.
<P>
	The other major flaw in the 1986 legislation is it did not apply to 
government. It was the classic case of do what we say, not do what 
we do.
<P>
	It was in recognition of those two major flaws of the original bill 
that in the red book we put forward to the electorate in 1993 we 
committed ourselves to making major changes in the Employment 
Equity Act.
<P>
	The legislation before us today on final reading is designed to 
meet those two major omissions. It is to fulfil the commitment we 
gave to the Canadian people in 1993 when they gave us a mandate 
to implement it. It is to give the Employment Equity Act some 
authority to carry out measures to reduce discrimination and to 
make it applicable to the federal government in its own workplace.
<P>
	The bill increases the authority of the Canadian Human Rights 
Commission to conduct an audit of public and private sector 
employees to ensure they are in compliance with the principle of 
employment equity.
<P>
<B>(1515 )</B>
<P>
	It also provides that the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal, when 
needed, can in effect transform itself into an employment equity 
tribunal to guarantee that the legislation respects the rights of all 
Canadians regardless of whether they are employees or employers. 
There is a right of appeal.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	This bill will have a positive impact on Quebec. More than 150 
employers and approximately 350,000 employees will be affected 
by this initiative.
<P>
	Those Quebecers will be entitled to a stronger system, with the 
human rights commission and a tribunal if necessary to ensure that 
employment equity is being implemented.
<P>
	As well, application of employment equity measures within the 
public service will be fairer. It will give women, the disabled and 
other designated groups equity in employment, training or 
promotion. I feel that this represents a proper response to the 
demands of Quebec women and the needs of the disabled, 
aboriginal people and visible minorities.
<P>
	It is my belief that the bill demonstrates the commitment of the 
federal government to take progressive measures for Canadians 
and for Quebecers.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Despite some of the comments concerning the bill, it is not about 
quotas. Let me make that very clear. That language was used in 
debate yesterday. It is not about quotas. In fact the legislation 
specifically prohibits quotas. Anybody who attempts to insert the 
notion that we are following in some cases the example of the 
legislation the Americans introduced 20 or 30 years ago is not 
being fair or straightforward when the word quotas is used since the 
act specifically prohibits them.
<P>
	Neither is the bill about reducing qualifications to allow more 
non-qualified people to enter the workforce. It is a bill about 
lowering barriers, not lowering standards. That is the basic purpose 
of the bill.
<P>
	We are attempting with this legislation to make sure the 
Canadian workplace fully reflects the richness and diversity of our 
population, that all individuals will have an equal chance of being 
considered for a job, a promotion or a chance to improve their 
specific place and status in the workplace.
<P>
	The bill is not about replacing the merit principle with 
something else, far from it. I make the case it strengthens the merit 
principle by making sure in no uncertain terms that everybody who 
has merit will not be overlooked.  Over the years people with 
enormous qualification, with enormous merit, with enormous sense 
of ambition and motivation never had the chance to fulfil that 
potential because in the workplace have been obstacles, barriers, 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15298"> 15298 </A></B>
<P>
filters and screens that oftentimes have been built up without 
people noticing they were there.
<P>
	Sometimes qualifications were based on size. Sometimes 
qualifications were based on saying that women for example could 
not do certain physical tasks even though it had never been proven. 
Yet in the last few years in police forces, the armed forces and fire 
prevention forces women and men have been shown to be equally 
capable of carrying out the entire multitude of tasks required in 
those dangerous occupations.
<P>
<B>(1520 )</B>
<P>
	Equity in the workplace means a better workplace. Study after 
study show that those companies that introduce equity as a 
fundamental principle in human resource planning become better 
companies; more productive, more competitive, more efficient, 
more effective.
<P>
	I listened with some interest and read in <I>Hansard</I> some of the 
comments from members of the Reform Party about the 
legislation. I suppose if I were to summarize, and I do it with great 
hesitation because I do not want to put words in the mouth of the 
hon. member, but it basically says, let the market decide. Let it 
choose who it wants to use and what is best for it.
<P>
	Some progress has been made. Some companies have moved 
forward and I give them full credit. However I say to members of 
the Reform Party that more is needed. Where we are now is not 
enough. I want to quote to members a couple of interesting 
comments. There are times when they may be tempted not to take 
my word as gospel, but let me try on them the United Nations 
report on development.
<P>
	It says, and I quote from this year's report: ``The free workings 
of economic and political processes are unlikely to deliver equality 
of opportunity''. The market can do some things wonderfully well. 
It can make products, deliver services, make a profit, generate 
growth and jobs. However it is not very good when it comes to 
ensuring there is full equality of opportunity for everybody. That is 
why we have government: to provide a balance and make sure there 
are some rules, make sure that everybody is treated fairly.
<P>
	The happy consequence of being a Canadian is that we have 
always found a nice balance between the public service 
consideration and the market consideration, that we find a way of 
working the two in tandem. I believe the legislation in Bill C-64 is 
a good example of that.
<P>
	To make the point further, I want to quote from the Business 
Council of British Columbia, which is made up of senior business 
representatives from throughout the province: ``Employers alone 
cannot achieve  employment equity. Employers want to be part of 
the solution in partnership with government, unions, employee 
representatives, educational institutions and designated group 
organizations''. When speaking, they used a very important word, 
partnership, a partnership to achieve equality. If I had to put a label 
on this bill I would say that is what it is about; partnership to 
achieve equality in the workplace.
<P>
	The reality faced by many women, members of visible minority 
groups, aboriginal peoples, those with disabilities is not the reality 
of the average white male when it comes to employment and 
earnings. We have been a privileged group for generations. As a 
result, other members of society have fallen behind.
<P>
	Fifty-one per cent of women are employed in sales, clerical work 
and service positions as compared to 20 per cent of males. Women 
earn only two-thirds of what men earn, even holding education as a 
constant.
<P>
	Everyone in the House, I am sure, was cheered by the recent 
United Nations development index which put Canada number one 
in the world on matters of literacy, training and education, 
investment in people and quality of life. But when gender is 
factored into the equation we fall to number nine. It simply shows 
that something is wrong. This bill is designed to correct that.
<P>
	I heard comments in the debate yesterday about visible 
minorities and that maybe they should not be included. Again, the 
facts counter that because the visible minority group, which on 
average has a higher education than the average Canadian, makes 
close to $10,000 less. The correlation in that should tell us 
something. The workplace is not being fair, open and accessible.
<P>
<B>(1525)</B>
<P>
	We hear every day the eloquent words of the Minister of Indian 
Affairs and Northern Development of the plight of First Nations 
people whose levels of unemployment are sometimes 40 per cent, 
50 per cent or 60 per cent and whose average income is less than 
$10,000, which is one-fourth of what the average Canadian makes.
<P>
	An article in today's <I>Globe and Mail</I> is headlined: ``Canadian 
business chided for ignoring native market''. Ms. Pamela Sloan is a 
principal in the Toronto consulting firm of Hill Sloan, which just 
published a report on corporate aboriginal relations. The article 
states that the public and private sectors have made successful 
attempts but it is not enough. She says to the business community: 
``You should introduce measures of equity because it makes good 
business sense to do it''.
<P>
	It was interesting to hear as we have gone through this debate 
how broadly recognized that fundamental fact is. Canadians have 
come to understand, whether they are in the public or private 
sectors, the need to address the systemic exclusion of individuals 
on the basis of gender, race or physical condition from the 
opportunities to  grow, contribute and develop. They understand 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15299"> 15299 </A></B>
<P>
that this bill is an attempt to create a more level playing field for all 
Canadians.
<P>
	I want to cite one statement which was made in the House. In a 
sense this gentleman is an officer of Parliament. We have entrusted 
to him the responsibility of overseeing human rights issues across 
Canada. That individual is Mr. Max Yalden. When challenged by 
certain members that this bill somehow is reverse discrimination 
and works against the interest of males, Mr. Yalden said that ``far 
from falling behind, able-bodied males appear to be getting more 
than their proportionate share of hiring. Such data hardly convey a 
convincing portrait of reverse discrimination''.
<P>
	This bill does not take away from some people to give to others, 
it simply opens it up for all. It ensures that there is fair and 
equitable treatment.
<P>
	We should discard the mythology. It is time to get rid of further 
divisions by somehow putting over here the plight of a male versus 
the plight of everybody else. We are all engaged in the enormous 
task of ensuring employment for all Canadians. The workplace is 
going through a transformation unlike any it has gone through in 
the history of human kind. With new technology, global 
competition and varieties of change, it is tough out there. The only 
way to succeed is to make the workplace and the job market 
equally accessible to everyone so all those talents will be put to 
work. One group should not be put on the sidelines and treated 
differently.
<P>
	When people ask: How do we succeed as a country? How do we 
meet the challenge of a new workplace and avoid the phobia and 
fear which the Jeremy Rifkins are talking about? This is one of the 
answers. I sincerely believe that in today's age the key ingredient 
which really makes this country tick is its human resources. I may 
be biased because my department is named human resources, but I 
feel privileged to be given that responsibility. I see it as such an 
important element in making this country work. That means 
everybody has to work-not 50 per cent of the population, not 75 
per cent, but everybody has to be given the chance to liberate their 
talent, to free up their creative potential, to give full open choice 
for them to make the kind of contribution they can make in the 
workplace.
<P>
<B>(1530)</B>
<P>
	I will digress for a second, if I might. A few days ago I was asked 
a question by the member from Regina about the statistics that 
were tabled last week by StatsCanada on the falling income of 
Canadian families. It is worth repeating. It pointed out that 
increasingly the falling income is a product of the increasing lack 
of participation of women in the workplace, single mothers in the 
workplace. In fact over the last several years that participation rate 
has dropped by almost 15 per cent. That is one of the most 
significant causes of the falling  income of the Canadian family, in 
particular families headed by women.
<P>
	We as a government are trying to turn around and devote our 
efforts to changing the basic structures to prevent that kind of 
decline. We are looking at a serious initiative on child care, trying 
to work with provinces and aboriginal groups. We are rewriting our 
employment legislation to make it more available for women 
coming back into the workplace to get the tools they need. We are 
looking at how we can better support young people to get back into 
the workplace.
<P>
	That is the kind of response to our evolution, which is not to 
throw up our hands in despair, not to retreat into the den wardens of 
the past and try to hang on to the shibboleths of 30 or 40 years ago, 
but to try to say we can do it, we can make a difference, we can take 
initiatives and we can pass a law like Bill C-64. That is what we are 
all about.
<P>
	There is an impression being left in this debate that somehow 
this is working against the interests of the private sector and that 
private enterprise is going rise up in revolt if this bill passes.
<P>
	If we look at statements made before the committee that my hon. 
friend from Winnipeg North very ably chaired, look at the 
organizations that have supported this bill. The Canadian 
Manufacturers' Association, the Canadian Bankers' Association, 
the Canadian Chamber of Commerce told the committee that they 
were convinced that employment equity is actually value added. 
These companies told the committee that they had discovered that 
diversity pays a major dividend. It does not cost them money, it 
makes them money. It gives them improved access to a greater 
number of highly qualified personnel to choose from. That is what 
employment equity is about.
<P>
	Why do we go off running after rabbit tracks and trying to create 
smokescreens and trying to create a sense that somehow there is 
this widespread apprehension? It is even interesting to point out 
that when we look at the debate that was generated in Ontario 
during the campaign about the impact of employment equity, most 
of the employers in Ontario said they want the bill. Don't get 
trapped by some ideology. Don't get trapped into imported 
arguments that are taken from some fundamentalist group in the 
southern United States thinks employment equity is next to the 
devil. Our business groups are saying-
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ian McClelland (Edmonton Southwest, Ref.):</B> Why make 
it a law then?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Axworthy (Winnipeg South Centre):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is a 
little upsetting that the hon. member from wherever who arrived in 
the House about two minutes ago did not hear the first part of the 
speech where we pointed out why business said they need the law 
in order to make sure that everybody gets treated fairly.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15300"> 15300 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1535 )</B>
<P>
	I have heard from the hon. gentleman opposite, so let me give 
him a list of other companies from his own region that are 
endorsing it: Canadian National Railway, the Bank of Montreal, 
Sun Life, the Royal Bank of Canada, B.C. Hydro. And listen to 
this: Alberta Government Telephones is endorsing it. I do not know 
how far he wants to stretch the case, but by extension I suppose we 
could say that Ralph Klein is in favour of this, or at least his crown 
corporation is.
<P>
	To make the point more directly, in a Compas poll that was done 
of Ontario companies when the debate was going on, only 8 per 
cent of Ontario companies said they would stop their programs if 
the employment equity law was repealed, and 68 per cent, more 
than two-thirds, said that they would continue with an employment 
equity program once it was established and they had learned the 
value of it.
<P>
	There is a value in fairness. Canadians understand it, businesses 
understand it. The only people who do not seem to understand it are 
certain members opposite, who are still probably reading whatever 
strange imported foreign-based literature they derive their ideas 
from. Might I suggest that perhaps if they could look at the 
Canadian case, look at the practicality of how it has worked, look at 
the value it has, then we might get more light and less heat from the 
members opposite.
<P>
	I am going to speak for a moment to the members of the Reform 
Party.
<P>
	<B>Mr. McCormick:</B> There are three here now.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Axworthy (Winnipeg South Centre):</B> Three important 
members of the Reform Party.
<P>
	I think it is very important that the members of the Reform Party 
understand there are things that government can do and must do 
well. When they said in their minority report-
<P>
	<B>Mr. McClelland:</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. I 
assume that it is not customary to refer to the absence or the 
non-absence of members.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> I did not hear anything about the absence or 
non-absence. The Minister of Human Resources Development.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Axworthy (Winnipeg South Centre):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
ready to address myself to the vast hordes of Reform members who 
are on the opposite benches. It is simply a function of education. 
There are times when I fall back into old habits of trying to say 
``let's learn together in this House''.
<P>
	When they put out in their minority report their opposition based 
on a false premise, one has to take issue with it. One wonders, as 
we found today in question period, whether some members of the 
House actually read the legislation we present. We heard today 
from members of the Bloc that they had not read the bill on  HRD. 
We tabled it four months ago and they got around to raising 
questions four months later, which has something to do with a 
certain date at the end of October, I suppose.
<P>
	Clearly Reform members have not read clause 6 of this bill, 
which I will read. It says ``The obligation to implement 
employment equity does not require an employer to hire or 
promote unqualified persons''. With respect to the public sector, it 
requires that hiring or promotion be based on selection according to 
merit. In the report there are many references to merit being done 
away with and quotas being imposed, yet the legislation says the 
opposite.
<P>
	Clause 33, which I know is way down the bill and takes at least 
five minutes to get to, reads: ``The commission may not give a 
direction and no tribunal may make an order where that direction or 
order would impose a quota on an employer''. Is that pretty clear, 
that no commission or tribunal can make any order imposing a 
quota?
<P>
	Again, why does the Reform Party, in its members' speeches, its 
minority reports, in its public language, say that quotas are being 
imposed? Do they have a secret bill we do not know about? Have 
they written something we do not know about, which they are 
going to pop unsuspectingly on the Canadian public? It could be, 
but it has nothing to do with Bill C-64. It is important we 
understand that.
<P>
<B>(1540 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. White (Fraser Valley West):</B> Tell them about the RCMP, 
Lloyd.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Axworthy (Winnipeg South Centre):</B> He is the one who 
calls the RCMP all the time, not me.
<P>
	How much clearer can we be? When we ensure that all deserving 
people have more chance, more opportunity to apply for a job, get 
training, get a promotion, does that not mean a better achievement 
of the merit principle?
<P>
	When we ask companies to examine their own assumptions 
about the tangible and intangible qualities it takes to do a job, when 
we examine what it is we want from our workers, how we can 
improve their skills, how we can ensure that there are not false 
barriers based upon old habits and old wisdoms impeding the 
development of that human resource in the workplace, does that not 
also improve the achievement of merit?
<P>
	The employment equity bill is about making merit work. It is 
real and demonstrable in a practical way in the workplace. It is 
about opening doors that have been closed for far too long and for 
far too many people. That is why I believe Canadians support this 
legislation. They know that our society will work better if 
everybody has a chance to work.
<P>
	I would like to quote from a letter I received from a young 
woman who works in the construction industry.  She has been 
having trouble keeping her job because only 2.4 per cent of 
construction workers are women. I should say by way of informa-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15301"> 15301 </A></B>
<P>
tion that we have established a special program in my department 
called Women in Trades and Technology, where we have put 
together a council of employers across Canada to specifically 
promote internships and apprenticeships for women in the trades 
and technology areas, where only two per cent or three per cent are 
represented.
<P>
	This woman did not write to complain or to ask for special 
privileges. There was no special pleading. She simply wrote to urge 
me and members of this House to put an end to discrimination in 
her industry and other industries. She ended her letter by calling on 
all members of Parliament to pass Bill C-64. She said ``When you 
review Bill C-64, think of my five-year-old niece, who wants to 
grow up to be a builder, just like me''.
<P>
	I invite all members of this House, on both sides of the House, to 
join in the spirit this young woman represented. She has asked us to 
be builders, to build something better, something more open, 
something fairer, so that all Canadians, men and women, those with 
certain disabilities, those with certain colours of skin, those with 
certain handicaps that they have faced over time, can all contribute 
to the building of this country. That is what we are all about.
<P>
	I believe this legislation, Bill C-64, gives us a tool to be a good 
builder, all of us. I hope all members will support this bill.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Christiane Gagnon (Québec, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to participate in the debate, at third reading, on Bill C-64, 
an act respecting employment equity.
<P>
	As we have said many times before, the Bloc Quebecois supports 
the principle of employment equity. It also recognizes the 
importance of this legislation, which must absolutely be effective.
<P>
	Let us look at the events which lead to this bill. In 1970, in the 
wake of the Royal commission on the status of women, the federal 
government set up its first affirmative action programs. However, it 
was not until 1984, following the report of the Commission on 
equality in employment, better known as the Abella commission, 
that the foundations for the current equity policies were laid. The 
Abella report emphasized the need for special measures to ensure 
equal opportunities for all, regardless of one's gender, race, ethnic 
origin or handicap.
<P>
	The current employment equity legislation, which was passed in 
1986, applies to employers and crown corporations governed by 
federal regulations and employing at least 100 people. The act 
requires that employers improve job opportunities for designated 
groups, namely women, aboriginal peoples, persons with 
disabilities and members of visible minorities.
<P>
<B>(1545)</B>
<P>
	The act also requires that employers eliminate rules and 
procedures which adversely affect members of these groups, and 
that employers take concrete action to increase the representation 
of these groups within their organization. The current provisions 
also provide for the development of a plan stating the objectives to 
be reached during a given year, or in subsequent years, as well as a 
timetable.
<P>
	Moreover, employers must file an annual report to the 
Department of Human Resources Development providing all the 
information relating to the implementation of the act within their 
organization. That essentially sums up the current legislation on 
employment equity.
<P>
	Bill C-64, which is now at third reading, completely replaces 
that act. The main amendments are as follows. The act will also 
apply to the federal public service. The elements that must be 
included in business plans will be better defined. The Canadian 
Human Rights Commission is now responsible for determining 
employers' compliance with some of the provisions. It has the 
power to investigate. An employment equity tribunal is also 
provided for.
<P>
	The bill as it stands today by the government is an improved 
version. During the first debate on this bill 10 months ago, I 
denounced some of its flaws. I am happy to note that the witnesses 
who appeared before the standing committee succeeded in 
convincing some members to improve the bill.
<P>
	Nor should we forget the amendments proposed by my colleague 
from Hochelaga-Maisonneuve, some of which were accepted. 
Unfortunately, there were two with which the committee disagreed 
and to which I will get back in a moment.
<P>
	Contrary to what my Reform colleagues claim, I think that a law 
on employment equity is both desirable and necessary. Let us listen 
to what Glenda Simms, President of the former Canadian Advisory 
Council on the Status of Women, said when she appeared before 
the standing committee last February: ``We have been defending 
since 1975 the idea that the Employment Equity Act is a way to 
achieve equality for women in the work place. Over the past 
decade, the extent to which women, as a group, are facing serious 
and systemic inequalities on the labour market, particularly in 
terms of compensation, working conditions and job access, is 
explained at length in many reports both within government and 
outside. Women are not evaluated on the basis of personal merit, 
but rather their race, their sex and whether or not they are 
disabled''.
<P>
	Consequently, women are overrepresented in lower paying 
positions. Approximately 60 per cent of all women to whom job 
equity applies have clerical jobs and they are severely underrepre-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15302"> 15302 </A></B>
<P>
sented in management  positions. White male without disabilities 
still hold 78 per cent of management job in the public service.
<P>
	About the impact of systemic discrimination against women, 
Ms. Simms said the following: ``The cost of discrimination should 
not be underestimated. Ample proof has been given of the 
correlation between sex and poverty in Canada. Many studies 
conducted by the government confirm that women are poorer than 
men and that, among poor women, those who have disabilities, are 
immigrants or belong to visible minority groups, as well as native 
women, are the poorest''.
<P>
	It is not true to say, as my hon. colleague from 
Edmonton-Southwest and others suggested the day before last, that 
``it is reverse discrimination, that is means that one can get a job, 
be promoted or hired on the basis of physical characteristics 
instead of merit''.
<P>
	This reflects-please excuse my bluntness-a sexist and macho 
view of the situation.
<P>
	It is a refusal to face reality, the everyday reality of thousands of 
Canadians and Quebecers, both women and men. I refer of course 
to those groups addressed by the bill: women, the disabled, visible 
minorities and aboriginal people.
<P>
	This is the reality referred to by Ms. Simms and many other 
witnesses who came to represent their less privileged fellow 
workers.
<P>
<B>(1550)</B>
<P>
	A few figures clearly illustrate their demands. Statistics Canada 
indicates that in 1993 women working full time earned 72 per cent 
of what men earned. This is even the way it is at the present time in 
the federal public service, where women are earning 72 per cent of 
what men are earning. I trust that rectification of this situation 
within the federal public service will not be long in coming.
<P>
	The average income of immigrant women workers, however, 
was 54 per cent of what immigrant males were earning, and close 
to 80 per cent of disabled women had an annual income of less than 
$10 000. This is an alarming situation, therefore, and the way we 
must adjust our aim is to pass a law such as this. We are also aware 
that 75 per cent of the ten lowest paying jobs in Canada are 
occupied by women. According to the Council on the Status of 
Women, the proportion of women in the lowest paying jobs has 
increased four times more than their proportion in the best paying 
jobs. The explanation offered by the council is the division of work 
along gender lines, leading to an undervaluation of women's paid 
work, which naturally leads to salary inequities.
<P>
	The women who organized the great march on Quebec City last 
spring were reminding us that this state of affairs, this inequality of 
earnings between men and women, compromises the economic 
security of women both now and when they retire. As for the other 
designated groups, we know from the figures of the  Department of 
Human Resources Development itself that they are characterized 
by a serious underrepresentation of aboriginal and disabled persons 
and a concentration of members of these groups in the less well 
paying jobs. The situation is apparently particularly acute for 
aboriginal people, whether female or male. This is why we need 
employment equity legislation.
<P>
	Not content to denigrate the very foundations of employment 
equity legislation, our friends in the Reform Party blithely deny the 
harsh reality experienced by our fellow Canadians in the 
designated groups. Two days ago, my colleague for Edmonton 
Southwest said: ``The foundation is that somehow or other 
Canadians are a mean, regressive, racist, discriminating people. 
Canadians are nothing of the sort. We are not that. No such 
discrimination exists in the workplace''. So they deny the problem.
<P>
	``The workplace, particularly outside the federal government, is 
progressive. Industry leads. It is a totally unnecessary law''. This is 
ostrich politics. We have to ask ourselves why a certain segment of 
the population refuses to acknowledge that their fellow citizens are 
victims of discrimination every day.
<P>
	We have to ask ourselves if it is not because these people do not 
suffer the systemic discrimination repeatedly confirmed by studies 
in this area. As a general rule, white men do fairly well compared 
to other groups. So, contrary to what some people think, we as a 
society need a law promoting employment equity.
<P>
	As I mentioned earlier, the existing legislation was lacking and 
needed improvement-hence the bill before us. In Quebec, women 
have a promise from government that a proactive bill on pay equity 
will be tabled soon. Under that bill, business will have to create a 
balanced mechanism for evaluating jobs, in order to identify those 
who are relatively underpaid. Business will then have a period of 
time to adjust salaries.
<P>
	The following sentence in a document produced by the 
committee for the bread and roses march made it quite clear: 
``Whereas discrimination is not the exception but the rule and 
affects all female workers, the adoption of pro-active legislation is 
necessary''. Reform members, if we go by their speeches, have no 
understanding of the situation in Quebec or of the kind of society 
we want to become. If they want to try their luck in Quebec, they 
will have to adjust their thinking to the situation in Quebec and 
consider the social values we want in our society.
<P>
<B>(1555)</B>
<P>
	Of course this was about wage equity, while the bill before the 
House is about employment equity. In fact, the two are closely 
related. In both cases, the purpose is to close the gap between men 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15303"> 15303 </A></B>
<P>
and women, between white people and members of visible 
minorities, between  persons with a disability and those who have 
none. It is about social justice and government policies that will 
help to deal with the problem.
<P>
	As I said at the beginning of my speech, the Bloc Quebecois 
proposed two amendments which unfortunately were not accepted 
by the committee and which in our opinion would have improved 
the bill.
<P>
	The first amendment concerns clause 14 of the bill and deals 
with the preparation of the employment equity plan. We would 
have preferred to see the plan prepared jointly by the employer and 
the employees. As the bill stands, the employer only has an 
obligation to consult with the representatives of the employees 
which, we feel, falls far short of being satisfactory.
<P>
	Spokespersons for the National Association of Women and the 
Law also pointed out that opportunities for employees, their 
representatives and members of designated groups to participate in 
the development and implementation of employment equity plans 
were few and far between. We deplore their absence from this 
process.
<P>
	We also suggested that the employment equity plan be posted in 
public areas in the workplace, for the purpose of informing 
employees.
<P>
	Finally, we believe that it would certainly be in keeping with the 
intent of the legislation for the tribunal, consisting of three persons, 
to have at least one representative for workers and designated 
groups. I think it is essential that one of these persons should be 
designated to sit on the tribunal. The National Association of 
Women and the Law expressed its surprise that the bill did not 
contain a measure to that effect.
<P>
	The association also recommended that both compliance officers 
and members of tribunals should be specialized in employment 
equity and represent designated groups.
<P>
	This would be, to use a familiar phrase, putting your money 
where your mouth is.
<P>
	The stakes are high, for women and for all designated groups. 
Ms. Simms, president of the now defunct Advisory Council on the 
Status of Women expressed it very well in her presentation when 
she said in concluding that the council encouraged the government 
to follow the recommendation to ensure that employment equity 
succeeded in giving women the opportunity, free of prejudice and 
sexism, to prove themselves on the labour market and, at the same 
time, to show that they have a right to dignity, respect and equity in 
our society. This is just as true for the other designated groups. 
What is good for women, is also good for aboriginal peoples, 
persons with disabilities and members of visible minorities. We 
must have this awareness.
<P>
	I therefore invite the members of this House to support all 
measures of social justice that help reduce the gap between the 
most disadvantaged and the most affluent. It is unfortunate that we 
are still debating the passing of such legislation when, in my 
opinion, our energies would be better focused on implementing 
corrective measures to ensure that the target groups achieve 
equality one day and that discrimination becomes a thing of the 
past.
<P>
	It should be our hope that everyone will have access to well paid 
work, that no one has to face discrimination and that working 
conditions are adjusted for certain people to enable them to grow in 
the workplace. We should also aim for equality of opportunity and 
employment equity.
<P>
	In closing, I would like to ask the government how it will 
enforce such a law, which is praiseworthy of itself? Having 
participated in the Beijing conference, I know the government has 
announced that a strategy will be established to evaluate, according 
to the sexes, all policies to be made, department by department.
<P>
<B>(1600)</B>
<P>
	Therefore, with the new social program reform, which has not 
yet been announced but will probably be announced after the 
referendum, I would like to know whether the impact of such a 
strategy, of such a social program reform act, has been assessed and 
how this strategy will affect people. It seems to me this is only 
natural. We all know that, with the upcoming social program 
reform act, women, people with disabilities, members of visible 
minorities will be the ones who will have to pay for all the cuts to 
be made in the public service. So the bill is praiseworthy, but will 
the government's efforts be equal to this legislation?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ian McClelland (Edmonton Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I have listened attentively to the dissertations by my hon. 
colleagues opposite.
<P>
	At the outset, I want to make it very clear on behalf of my party 
that we do not ascribe any negative motive to the Liberals for 
bringing this legislation forward. As a matter of fact, we think they 
probably in their heart of hearts think they are doing the right thing. 
We just think it is stupid, unnecessary and counterproductive.
<P>
	We do not ascribe any motive that would be negative to them 
other than the fact that in their heart of hearts they wished they 
lived in a perfect world but we do not. We cannot make a perfect 
world through legislation. It might be possible to advance the 
world to perfection through education, but there are some things in 
life which just plain cannot be satisfied through legislation and this 
is one of them.
<P>
	Regrettably, the underlying foundation of employment equity or 
affirmative action in our country presupposes that Canadians in 
some way or another are now, have been and will be a systemically 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15304"> 15304 </A></B>
<P>
meanspirited lot of people  who discriminate against others. That is 
not true. It is not the case.
<P>
	Earlier this afternoon the hon. minister opposite made reference 
to members of the business community being in favour of 
employment equity and that those who came to the committee said 
so. When people are invited to make a submission before a 
committee on something like employment equity, what are they 
supposed to do? Are they supposed to say that they do not believe 
in the notion of employment equity and that they would just as soon 
discriminate against people? That is just not the case.
<P>
	Our country's business community is very progressive. It is way 
ahead of the government. As a matter of fact, the average business 
has never seen a visitor from the employment equity police for the 
legislation that is now in place. Most Canadians, including most 
Canadian businesses, do what they do out of enlightened 
self-interest. As I mentioned the other day, there is nothing wrong 
with enlightened self-interest; it gets the job done.
<P>
	In my few minutes today I would like to try to rebut some of the 
arguments made in favour of affirmative action or employment 
equity and also to give a sense of what this legislation might mean 
as it gets its iron grip on Canadian society.
<P>
	The most significant provision of Bill C-64 results in the 
legislated mandate of affirmative action for the federal public 
service, including the RCMP, the military, public security agencies, 
federally chartered businesses and any business of 100 or more 
employees that does business with the federal government. That is 
quite a collection of people. Imagine the number of equity police 
that will be required to police that to make sure it is working.
<P>
	The nature of this proposed legislation is intrusive into the 
marketplace. Under the proposed legislation an employer is 
obliged to submit an employment equity compliance audit by an 
officer acting on behalf of the human rights commission.
<P>
<B>(1605 )</B>
<P>
	Based on the results of such an audit, the Canadian Human 
Rights Commission may direct that an employer comply with the 
provisions of the Employment Equity Act. Failure to comply with 
such a directive renders an employer subject to a fine at the 
initiative of the minister responsible for the administration of the 
Employment Equity Act of up to $50,000. The responsible minister 
has not yet been determined but we assume it will be the minister 
of human resources.
<P>
	It is important to note though that the term employment equity 
will be heard from the Liberal side and the Bloc, but you will hear 
members from this side using the term affirmative action. Liberals 
are slow to use the term affirmative action because that term is not  
particularly well regarded even by those who were purported to 
have been helped by affirmative action 30 or 40 years ago primarily 
in the United States.
<P>
	In the last election in Ontario, the notion of affirmative action 
was roundly discarded when the New Democrats were thrown out 
of office by the Conservatives. They said in large part in their 
election mandate that they were going to get rid of the employment 
equity law.
<P>
	That really causes one to wonder why the Liberal government 
opposite would introduce this legislation at this time. Giving credit 
where credit is due, the Liberals believe in their heart of hearts that 
what they are doing is the right thing, that they will go ahead 
regardless. Dam the torpedoes because the torpedoes surely will be 
in the water at the next election when they are trying to explain why 
they introduced reverse discrimination and codified it throughout 
the land.
<P>
	Through this legislation the Liberals will have planted the seeds 
of resentment that will burn in the bellies of the thousands and 
thousands of people who will be denied opportunity that is rightly 
theirs. They will be denied that opportunity because there is a quota 
for others determined by race, by gender. People will look at that 
and ask: Is this a free country? Is this what is meant in article 15 of 
the charter of rights and freedoms where it explicitly states that all 
Canadians are equal regardless of race, creed or gender? Of course 
the next paragraph says, except for designated groups, which then 
allows legislation of this type to come forward.
<P>
	The foundation for the notion of affirmative action versus 
employment equity was really made about 10 years ago by Judge 
Rosalie Abella. The royal commission recommended employment 
equity legislation rather than affirmative action legislation because 
affirmative action and the term affirmative action had been so 
widely discarded because it just plain does not work.
<P>
	It is important to keep this in mind. You can dress this baby up 
any way you want but it does not matter what kind of cook you are, 
you cannot make mutton taste like lamb. If it is not lamb, it is never 
going to be lamb. You cannot dress it up in any way. It is a tough 
old bird that is not going to fly.
<P>
	There is a suggestion from this side of the House that 
employment equity or affirmative action legislation really does 
involve social engineering and forced acceleration of the effects of 
demographic change. I am going to present an interesting set of 
statistics.
<P>
	Canada's demographics are changing rapidly. The make-up and 
composition of this House is not representative of the changing 
demographics of our country today. If we look around us in the 
House, the vast majority of people representing constituencies of 
the Liberals, of the Bloc and of the Reform Party are white,  
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15305"> 15305 </A></B>
<P>
middle-age males. That is not our fault; it is changing. It is 
changing slowly, but it is changing.
<P>
<B>(1610)</B>
<P>
	According to the 1991 census, 9 per cent of Canadians aged 15 or 
over, or 1.9 million people were visible minorities. Of the 9 per 
cent or the 1.9 million people who were visible minorities in 
Canada, only 15 per cent were born in Canada. Very few of the 
visible minorities that live in Canada today were born in Canada. 
Thirty-five per cent of the visible minorities in our country have 
arrived since 1983. Sixty-seven per cent of all visible minorities in 
Canada have arrived since 1972.
<P>
	In a relatively short period of time in the 130 years or so that 
Canada has been a nation, the changing demographics of our 
country in visible minorities has only really been apparent in the 
last 30 years. To suggest that there is systemic discrimination in our 
country is wrong. We have not had the chance to have systemic 
discrimination.
<P>
	The demographic composition of employees at all levels in a 
country which is 128 years old cannot be radically changed as a 
result of demographic social change over 30 years, and most 
significantly within the last 12 years. These changes will occur, but 
it will take at least one or two generations, if allowed to occur 
without legislative compulsion. As I said before, if we look at the 
demographics of the House of Commons, we will see that is the 
case.
<P>
	Attempting a statistical matching for equity purposes, that is, <I>x</I> 
per cent of a particular race means that <I>x</I> per cent of that race must 
be in an occupation for there to be equity, involves the 
unreasonable assumption that the extent of association to Canada 
and the extent of Canadian work experience are irrelevant to 
workforce entitlement or promotion considerations. Does it not 
make sense if people have been in Canada and have participated in 
the labour force that their participation rate and their advancement 
rate would be higher based on the amount of time they have been 
here or their familiarity with Canada?
<P>
	That does not mention the fact that all of the government 
agencies covered by this bill and many private contractors are 
covered by unions in which people have problems moving up and 
out and being hired or fired based on the unions. It has nothing to 
do with management, it has to do with the union. It has to do with 
whether a person is in the door first.
<P>
	Let us talk about goals and targets. Let us ask ourselves: Are 
goals targets and are they quotas by another name? Exception was 
taken to the fact that members on this side of the House referred to 
goals as being quotas. Under the Employment Equity Act an 
employer is not required to hire or promote unqualified persons. It 
says that right in the legislation and I acknowledge that. Employers 
are not required to hire or  promote unqualified persons or to create 
new positions in the workforce. The Canadian Human Rights 
Commission cannot impose a quota on an employer where a quota 
is defined as a requirement to hire or promote a fixed or arbitrary 
number of persons during a given period.
<P>
	However, the other shoe is about to drop. In circumstances where 
under-representation of designated groups has been identified, the 
employer is required to prepare a plan in which short term 
numerical goals for hiring and promotion of designated groups are 
established plus longer term goals for increasing the 
representation.
<P>
<B>(1615)</B>
<P>
	What a minute. Just a second. Hold it. Did I not just say the act 
says they cannot have quotas? Wait a minute, it does say they can 
establish numerical goals. But what is a numerical goal if not a 
quota?
<P>
	If in the opinion of the human rights commission investigator an 
employer has not made reasonable efforts the employer can be 
fined $50,000. It sounds like a quota to me. If it looks like a quota, 
sounds like a quota, acts like a quota and the results of it are like a 
quota, the chances are it is a quota. It does not matter whether we 
call it employment equity; it is still affirmative action. It does not 
matter if we call it a goal or a numerical target. If it restricts the 
number and the access by number, it is a quota. That is all it can 
possibly be.
<P>
	Just in case there is a possibility someone thinks that quotas are 
not already in force in the Government of Canada hiring practices, 
just try getting hired by the RCMP, as a constituent in Edmonton 
tried. Barry Ceminchuk who lives in Edmonton called me and said: 
``Please talk about my problem. I wanted to get a job with the 
RCMP. They will not even take my application''. The RCMP will 
not even take it and he has done some digging.
<P>
	This is information from the employment equity guide from the 
Department of Justice. Is that not amazing, there is an employment 
equity guide from the Department of Justice.
<P>
	For those of you out there in television land, when the census 
comes next time and you are wondering why they are asking what 
race you are, all of a sudden the light will come on. The reason 
people want to know your race is so they can check out 
demographically whether or not the companies in the local areas 
are hiring enough people of the various races located in that 
geographic area. That is why that question is there.
<P>
	This is from the Department of Justice, and we do not have 
quotas here folks, but we do have employment equity targets. In the 
spring of 1991 Treasury Board introduced a new target setting 
strategy as a means for achieving the equitable representation and 
distribution of designated group members in the department. The 
new  strategy is flow based, which means that it focuses on an 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15306"> 15306 </A></B>
<P>
equitable share of recruitment and promotions of designated 
groups.
<P>
	It goes on to list the groups and then states what its non-quota 
quota goals are for women. For scientific and professional: 
recruitment, 43.8 per cent; promotions, 43.6 per cent. For 
administrative and foreign service: 39.9 per cent for recruitment 
and 66 per cent for promotions. If you happen to be a woman in the 
Department of Justice in an administrative or support position, you 
have it made, but you had better not be male because women are 
going to get 93 per cent of the promotions.
<P>
	We hear clapping from the opposite side. It has nothing to do 
with whether they are the best qualified but they are going to get it 
because of their gender. That is absolutely wrong.
<P>
	My daughter is a totally capable person in her own right. She just 
goes up and down a wall every time somebody thinks that she has 
got somewhere or she has a job because she is a woman, because of 
employment equity or affirmative action. She is an electrical 
engineer and works in a male dominated field. My daughter 
achieved what she achieved because she is a damn good electrical 
engineer. It has nothing to do with the fact that she is a woman. It 
has to do with the fact that she is a damn good engineer. She just 
goes crazy when those feminists say she is a victim. She is not a 
victim.
<P>
<B>(1620 )</B>
<P>
	In any event let us keep talking. Let us talk about qualified 
versus best qualified. The legislation says in clause 6 that an 
employer cannot be required to hire or promote unqualified 
persons. However, the other shoe drops. At the same time, an 
employer is not free to hire the best qualified as a matter of course. 
The concept of best qualified does not reflect systemic prejudices. 
Subjectivity in hiring is largely eliminated under this legislation. 
Attitudes cannot be legislated.
<P>
	I am getting a fair amount of static from my friends opposite. 
They are most uncomfortable because they will soon be standing to 
justify this draconian legislation.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Clancy:</B> I am just as comfortable as I can be. You have no 
idea how comfortable I am.
<P>
	<B>Mr. McClelland:</B> They are going to try to make this turkey look 
like a chicken and they are going to have one heck of a time doing 
it. I wish them well. When they take this boat in the next election, 
there are going to be torpedoes coming at them from every 
direction.
<P>
	Part of me is saying that I cannot wait to see this legislation get 
off the ground because the government is going to have to live with 
it. It is like the dog that chases a car: What does he do with it when 
he catches it? My friends opposite are going to catch this car at the 
next election.
<P>
	Let us talk about statistics and the employment equity legislation 
and the supposition that it is grounded on unreliable statistics. 
Much of this requires self-identification. The affirmative action 
police will go into a place of business and pass out a form to be 
filled out. People will be required to self-identify. Anybody who is 
going to try to get a job with the government now has to identify 
their race or whether they are part of a minority group. It is all part 
of the legislation.
<P>
	The employment equity police are going to require people to 
identify themselves. I do not know if the House of Commons is 
trying it because it is such a progressive place or whether it is test 
legislation. At the time this was done there were 1,700 employees 
in the House of Commons. The response rate was 23 per cent and 
only 50 of those respondents identified themselves as belonging to 
a designated group.
<P>
	People do not like to self-identify. As a matter of fact that was 
indicated in the Department of Justice paper I referred to a little 
earlier. It talked about the effectiveness of self-identification.
<P>
	Let me quote from the Department of Justice employment equity 
guide: ``The effectiveness of the self-identification process is 
questionable. Treasury Board is currently reviewing the process to 
improve it. There will always be a certain number of people who 
choose not to identify themselves as members of a target group for 
various reasons. One of the strongest reasons is the concern about 
being labelled a token employee and not seen as someone hired for 
their qualifications or because they have earned the position''. This 
is from the Department of Justice.
<P>
	Whoever drafted this legislation over in the Department of 
Justice must have been popping Tums all day. It must have been a 
long, hard day at work.
<P>
	Interestingly, there was a 30 per cent increase in Canadians 
reporting a disability between the 1986 census and the 1991 census. 
We have to ask why in a five year period there would be a 30 per 
cent increase in the number of people reporting themselves as 
having a disability. Why has this identification occurred, 
particularly in view of the incentive to falsify self-identification 
surveys? I know that might sound kind of meanspirited but there is 
the potential for people to self-identify themselves one way or 
another in some of these surveys in order to gain an advantage in 
promotion or hiring.
<P>
<B>(1625)</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bevilacqua:</B> Come on.
<P>
	<B>Mr. McClelland:</B> Now that might happen. Just imagine. There 
are people out there who might just say: ``Gosh, how am I going to 
go about getting myself a job here? I know I have the same 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15307"> 15307 </A></B>
<P>
qualifications as the vast majority of other people that are applying. 
How am I going to get  a job? I know what I might have to do. I 
might have to self-identify myself into one of these groups''.
<P>
	This brings to mind an anomaly in the whole notion of visible 
minorities and disadvantaged groups. Based on statistics obtained 
from Statistics Canada we know that Japanese Canadians have 
among the highest incomes and the highest education levels of all 
Canadians, yet they would qualify under this legislation as a 
disadvantaged group. Figure that out. Does that make any sense?
<P>
	There is deafening silence opposite. Give them a minute to think 
about it. We have a demographic group in our country that has the 
highest single average education, the highest single average 
income, but members of that group qualify as disadvantaged 
because of the colour of their skin.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bevilacqua:</B> What is the story with visible minorities?
<P>
	<B>Ms. Clancy:</B> Tell us about visible minorities.
<P>
	<B>Mr. McClelland:</B> Hold it, let us go back one more. Let us talk 
about the Portuguese Canadians. Interestingly, Portuguese 
Canadians do not rank at the same income level as Japanese 
Canadians, but guess what? They are not visible minorities because 
their skin is not a different colour. They are curse of curses, shame 
of shames, white. Therefore, they do not qualify under the statute. 
Does that make any sense whatsoever? That is the fallacy of 
creating legislation in a free and democratic society based on race, 
colour, creed or gender. There is no place for it.
<P>
	What we should be doing in our society is making sure the 
human rights commission works so that when people are 
discriminated against for any reason, regardless of their sexual 
orientation, regardless of their colour, regardless of their gender, 
they have a place to go.
<P>
	Let us talk about useless legislation in our country. Right here in 
the precincts of Parliament Hill there is 10 years and $100 million 
of reconstruction going on. A woman was working on the 
construction site but she was fired because she was a woman and 
one of the men did not want to be working with her. She went to the 
human rights commission and was turned around and sent to the 
provincial human rights commission.
<P>
	If we want to do something, we should get our act together and 
get a human rights commission with teeth. We should get some 
semblance of uniformity between human rights laws federally, 
provincially, municipally and human rights legislation in the 
workplace.
<P>
	We could be doing something worthwhile. If somebody is 
discriminated against in this country, what do they do? They are 
absolutely lost. They go to these commissions and get in line. 
There is a line-up that takes six months to a year to get through. 
That is where we should be putting our effort. We could be 
educating people about why it is wrong to discriminate for any 
reason. We do not have to legislate this sort of thing.
<P>
	Then we have to make sure that people who are discriminated 
against for any reason have redress. They presently have no 
redress. It is not criminal. People can discriminate against anybody 
they want to; it is not a criminal offence. What one has to do is go 
through hoops in order to get some kind of satisfaction. We should 
be making that easy instead of doing this. It is ridiculous.
<P>
<B>(1630 )</B>
<P>
	Since the human rights commission is the agency charged with 
the responsibility of enforcing this, how much money is going to 
the commission to enable it to do the job? What is being done to 
enable Mr. Yalden and the Canadian Human Rights Commission to 
do the job? Make a complaint to the Canadian Human Rights 
Commission today and see how long it takes to get satisfaction. 
Dump this responsibility on it and how long is it going to take to 
get from point A to point B?
<P>
	Let us think about it. Think about the last bit of employment 
equity legislation that came through the House and see what has 
been done anywhere in the country to ensure that it has been done. 
Absolutely nothing has been done. What happens when persons 
who feel they have been discriminated against go to the human 
rights commission? They grow barnacles. Nothing happens there. 
Therefore, what do we do? We bring in more legislation to do 
nothing. The Liberals are just giving lip service so that they can 
further consolidate their position by saying: ``We looked after all of 
these target groups. We are their great benefactors''. The Liberals 
are not their great benefactors.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bevilacqua:</B> You are.
<P>
	<B>Mr. McClelland:</B> Members opposite say, pejoratively I suspect, 
that I am. Mr. Speaker, I take that as a compliment because damned 
right I am. I will address these things honestly and through the 
front door. I will not do it sliding in the back door.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Clancy:</B> I have never come in the back door in my life.
<P>
	<B>Mr. McClelland:</B> Members opposite are heckling me. I am 
having trouble not laughing because some of their heckles are 
fairly funny. People listening to their televisions cannot hear what 
they are saying so I will have to try to ignore them.
<P>
	I am going to finish my dissertation with a challenge to the 
Liberals opposite. They control everything in this House. They 
have a majority. If they do not want something to happen it is not 
going to happen. As a matter of fact it is not really the Liberals, it is 
the cabinet. It may not even be the cabinet, it might be the Prime 
Minister's office. It might not even be the Prime Minister's office, 
it might be one or two people trying to figure out how they can keep 
him elected.
<P>
	However, whoever it is that pulls the strings over there, I offer 
those people a challenge: extend  employment equity legislation to 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15308"> 15308 </A></B>
<P>
the House of Commons. Why is the House of Commons excluded 
from this legislation?
<P>
	<B>Ms. Clancy:</B> It works for me.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bevilacqua:</B> Are you in favour?
<P>
	<B>Mr. McClelland:</B> The member opposite says to extend this. I 
offer them a challenge: extend employment equity legislation to 
the House of Commons.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> It is my duty, pursuant to 
Standing Order 38, to inform the House that the questions to be 
raised tonight at the time of adjournment are as follows: the hon. 
member for Lévis-government subsidies; the hon. member for 
Halifax West-foreign affairs.
<P>
	We shall now proceed to the next stage of debate, which will 
allow the hon. members a maximum of 20 minutes to speak, 
subject to a 10 minute period for questions and comments.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Rey D. Pagtakhan (Winnipeg North, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
wish I had the time to debate my colleague point by point. It may 
not be allowed, but I will do it at committee where the member sits.
<P>
	As the member of Parliament for Winnipeg North, I rise today to 
bring the sentiments of my constituents to the House during third 
reading debate of Bill C-64. Bill C-64, an act respecting 
employment equity, reflects the soul of our nation. It reflects our 
shared value of equality. It reflects our humility to recognize the 
presence of inequities. It reflects our ingenuity as a people to craft 
solutions to problems.
<P>
	Systemic discrimination remains an endemic problem, a national 
malady, a barrier to equality in employment. In the 1960s 
discrimination in employment was seen as a human relations 
problem, the result of malice and intentional bias. Thus human 
rights legislation was enacted, but proved ineffective in addressing 
the overall problem. That is what the Reform Party would like us to 
do, retreat from our progress.
<P>
<B>(1635)</B>
<P>
	Pilot affirmative action programs on a voluntary basis were 
tested in the 1980s but they failed to achieve the desired results. 
Women, aboriginal peoples, visible minorities and persons with 
disabilities continued to be disadvantaged, experiencing higher 
than average unemployment rates and, if employed, were often 
concentrated in low paying occupations and were not represented 
in upper management.
<P>
	It soon became apparent to the national leadership of the day that 
discrimination resulted not only from intentional bias, but also 
from outdated hiring practices and systems. In other words, a 
seemingly unprejudicial  employment policy had an adverse 
impact on job opportunities for certain individuals and groups 
because of their race, gender, colour and disability. The phrase 
systemic discrimination refers to this type of unintentional barrier 
to equality.
<P>
	The persistence of this problem stirred the national 
consciousness at a time when a new era was dawning in Canada. In 
1982 the Canadian Constitution was repatriated and the Canadian 
Charter of Rights and Freedoms was born.
<P>
	Section 15, paragraph 1 of the charter speaks of the equality of 
Canadians before and under the law, in benefits and in protection. 
What a powerful national statement on equality, one in which we 
can all take pride.
<P>
	No doubt conscious of the presence of unintentional bias in the 
workplace and no doubt aware of the need to eradicate it, the 
framers of the charter saw to it that any future Canadian 
government would not be handicapped in drafting programs to treat 
this societal ailment.
<P>
	Hence, the addition of paragraph 2 to section 15. This additional 
paragraph gives government the authority to design programs 
aimed at creating an equal and level playing field for those 
disadvantaged in society. It gives Parliament the authority to enact 
laws aimed at achieving equality, not preference, not superiority, in 
employment for the disadvantaged groups, laws that will withstand 
constitutional scrutiny.
<P>
	These two paragraphs in one section of the charter reflect 
Canadian ingenuity, reflect our genuine pursuit of equality and 
reflect our national foresight in social legislation. This section 
allows Canada to acknowledge, respect and accommodate the 
differences among her people.
<P>
	Equality in the workplace does not and cannot be allowed to 
mean only identical treatment for all. Equality includes improving 
the condition of disadvantaged people or groups, which sometimes 
requires treating them differently to ensure equality. Thus there is 
maternity leave for women, to cite one example, but not for men.
<P>
	Seizing on this national foresight now entrenched in the charter 
of rights and freedoms and wanting to redress systemic 
discrimination, the Liberal government of the day soon struck the 
Royal Commission on Equality in Employment. Chaired by Justice 
Rosalie Abella, the commission issued its landmark report, 
Equality in Employment, in 1984. It confirmed that discriminatory 
practices, intentional or not, yielded the same outcome: low rank, 
low pay or no job at all.
<P>
	It confirmed that certain systems and practices unwittingly may 
have adverse effects on certain groups in our society. Therefore it 
prescribed a system based approach to remedy the situation. This 
ultimately led to the enactment of the current Employment Equity 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15309"> 15309 </A></B>
<P>
Act in  1986. This law has helped advance equity in employment, 
but not far enough.
<P>
	The current federal government knew this before it took office in 
October 1993. It therefore sought and was given the mandate by the 
Canadian people to extend coverage of the act to the federal public 
sector and to include practical enforcement mechanisms. The 
government wanted to fulfil this mandate in a fashion that will 
further advance equality in the workplace without adding an 
onerous burden on employers and businesses.
<P>
<B>(1640)</B>
<P>
	Bill C-64, tabled in the House last December 12 and amended in 
committee and at report stage fulfils our national agenda. I was 
privileged earlier this year to chair the Standing Committee on 
Human Rights and the Status of Disabled Persons which conducted 
a full review of employment equity and obtained input from 
Canadians from coast to coast.
<P>
	We heard from 52 associations and individuals and received 18 
written submissions. The views of employers, labour 
organizations, designated group organizations and many interested 
Canadians were fairly represented in the evidence before the 
committee.
<P>
	I am honoured to share with my colleagues in the House, my 
constituents and other fellow Canadians some of what we heard 
from witnesses.
<P>
	Says the Congress of the Assembly of First Nations Chief 
Mercredi: ``Although a lot of times Canada is presented as a nation 
that believes in equality of opportunity, when you really undress 
the country there is no equality there for aboriginal people''.
<P>
	Says the Congress of Aboriginal Peoples: ``We point out the high 
participation rate in the workforce of our people to stress that 
aboriginal people want to work but the structure of the Canadian 
economy seems to leave them on the outside looking in''.
<P>
	From the National Association of Women and the Law: ``A 
rather bleak picture of the employment and economic situation of 
women is evident at a glance. In general, women occupy most of 
the short term jobs and are clustered in low paying services and 
administrative support work positions''.
<P>
	Says the Canadian Ethnocultural Council, a coalition of some 37 
national ethnic groups around the country: ``The reality now is the 
visible minority population labour force is under utilized. That 
speaks to the economy of Canada and to the future of our country''.
<P>
	From the Canadian Paraplegic Association: ``Clearly for people 
with disabilities there are still numerous barriers to 
employment-until more attention is paid to education, training 
and skill development for persons with disabilities, reasonable 
representation in the Canadian work force will continue to be an 
illusion''.
<P>
	Clearly in this body of evidence, only a sample of many, we can 
see the plight of disadvantaged groups.
<P>
	From the Canadian Labour Congress: ``By ensuring the diversity 
of the Canadian population is reflected in all employment areas 
under federal jurisdiction, the Government of Canada is creating an 
enriched work environment''.
<P>
	Says the Canadian Security Establishment: ``I am pleased to 
advise that the establishment feels it can comply with the 
requirements of the bill without special consideration''.
<P>
	Says the RCMP: ``Under the recruiting process, what we would 
do is hire the best and highest rated persons from all groups'' in 
compliance still with the Employment Equity Act.
<P>
	Says the CRTC: ``If the ultimate goal was to sensitize people so 
they would do these intelligent things instinctively-then we are 
definitely going in that direction''.
<P>
	From the Canadian Bankers Association: ``Canada's banks, and I 
speak most particularly for the six major banks, have been 
committed to employment equity objectives since the current act 
was passed in 1986. We think employment equity not only has had 
a positive impact on the way our organizations manage their work 
forces but also it has proven good for business.
<P>
	Let me quote from Mr. Alan Borovoy of the Canadian Civil 
Liberties Association: ``The idea then in setting numerical goals is 
not to play catch up. You do not have to ask to get to the same 
balance as the rest of the community. You set the goals in order to 
pressure the employers not to discriminate. That is the objective of 
the setting of the goals. You choose a numerical target that would 
accord with how many the employer would get if he recruited 
vigorously, set fair job standards, and at the end of the day did not 
discriminate improperly''. That is from the Canadian Civil 
Liberties Association leadership.
<P>
<B>(1645)</B>
<P>
	The chair of the Canadian Human Rights Commission, Max 
Yalden, stated:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>-let me make it clear that employment equity is not about quotas. A quota is 
an arbitrary number of positions in the workforce that must be filled regardless 
of whether qualified candidates exist for the jobs.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	I hope these testimonials will convince even the doubting 
Thomases from across the floor that the disadvantaged groups, 
their advocates and civil libertarians of renown are not the only 
supporters of Bill C-64. Employers from all sectors equally praise 
the bill. They recognize that equity in employment enhances 
productivity and business and inspires initiative and creativity.
<P>
	The Minister of Human Resources Development has already 
refuted the myth the Reform Party wanted to  propagate about 
qualifications, merit and quotas. Those issues have been dealt with 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15310"> 15310 </A></B>
<P>
by the bill. For the sake of time I refer the hon. member opposite to 
the bill to see for himself his arguments are flawed.
<P>
	During debate he told us he would object to census taking 
because it would ask for the individual's race. I am not afraid and I 
am not ashamed of my race. I am not ashamed of my heritage.
<P>
	If he is really concerned that Canadians from the Portuguese 
community are now not covered under the act, that is true. If they 
are determined disadvantaged, then they will be given programs by 
the government. That is one beauty of having this type of census, so 
that we can get the facts and figures we need to formulate good, 
sensitive legislation which will answer the needs of Canadians.
<P>
	I repeat the bill is not about redressing the past mistakes of 
history. It is about not wanting the past mistakes of history to be 
repeated on our present and future generations.
<P>
	I heard earlier in the debate about wanting to hire the best 
qualified. I believe the Reform Party would be surprised at one of 
the witnesses from the Manitoba Telephone System, Ms. Katawne, 
director:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>I would suggest that those people who believe it is a highly scientific art to 
determine who the best qualified person is are dreaming. They are in la-la land. 
That is not what happens on a selection committee.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	We need an employment equity act.
<P>
	In addition to making several clause by clause amendments to 
the bill, our committee issued a separate narrative report entitled 
``Employment Equity: A Commitment to Merit''. I suggest that 
members who object to the bill give it careful study. I hope at that 
time they will have a change of mind and a change of heart. The 
report reflects the committee's confidence that Canada's new 
employment equity law will ensure the pre-eminence of merit and 
the elimination of systemic discrimination in employment 
practices.
<P>
	What we have in the bill is a win-win situation for employers and 
employees alike. The report and the bill reflect the uniqueness of 
Canada as a leader among nations, committed to excellence in 
human endeavour and profoundly committed to social justice in 
general and to employment equity in particular.
<P>
	Chairing the national hearings on Bill C-64 was a very 
meaningful experience for yours truly. It reconfirmed for me why I 
am so proud to be a Canadian.
<P>
<B>(1650 )</B>
<P>
	Let me close with something I will always carry with me from 
my time as chair of the committee that studied this bill. It is a letter 
from the Filipino Technical Professional Association of Manitoba, 
an ethnic community to which I proudly belong.
<P>
	The association stated that its members were proud of the efforts 
of the Canadian government to show the world that we as a society 
care about our citizens' human rights and shared the pride that the 
United Nations recognized Canada as the number one country in 
the world in which to live.
<P>
	It emphasized there are already a lot of skilled immigrants and 
new citizens in Canada unable to get a job in their respective fields 
of training and experience because their professional credentials 
and training are not systematically given recognition. There is not 
even an orderly process for accreditation. Employers in a lot of 
cases insist on Canadian experience which also closes a lot of doors 
for employment. To the members of the association this amounts to 
no less than systemic discrimination.
<P>
	I can certainly agree with its view that it is very distressing and 
undignified for a person to be systematically prohibited from 
practising his or her chosen career which he or she spent a lot of 
years mastering.
<P>
	It recognizes, as I do, that employment equity may be one way of 
dealing with this problem, but again this will not work if systemic 
barriers are not dealt with.
<P>
	Working together we can carry on this country's proud tradition 
of championing equality, creating opportunity and building a better 
country for us all. Employment equity is Canada's commitment to 
merit to social justice, a framework for awareness, a search for 
inclusion, a win-win for all. Canada has a duty to oblige.
<P>
	I am proud to be part of a government that has taken the 
leadership. I therefore urge all hon. members from across the floor 
in the Chamber to join together and vote in favour of Bill C-64.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Myron Thompson (Wild Rose, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have 
been listening very intently to the speeches regarding Bill C-64. I 
am also finding myself agreeing not with the bill but with a lot of 
statements, particularly from the last speaker on the need to work 
on equality. Equality is essential. We want that. Everybody in 
Canada wants that.
<P>
	I find it a little discouraging, however, when we come to talking 
about wanting equality. We want all to be Canadians. We want 
equality. That is what everybody wants.
<P>
	Now we come to the time when we will have to ask the questions 
that may differentiate between equality and non-equality. That goes 
back to something talked about during the election. It was talked 
about by a lot of people who did not like hyphenated Canadians. 
They thought how great it would be if we could only come to the 
day when we can be Canadians and we do not have to be 
French-Canadian, Japanese-Canadian, aboriginal-Canadian, 
Colorado-Canadian, Irish-Canadian or whatever. They would 
really like 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15311"> 15311 </A></B>
<P>
to see that disappear.  That message was loud and clear. Every 
member in the House has heard that.
<P>
	I think people would agree that is what we would like to see. All 
of a sudden we see a piece of legislation coming out prior to a 
census asking ``what is your race?'' I have already talked to a lot of 
people who are concerned about that. They wonder what will 
happen if they write Canadian. These people could write 
hyphenated Canadian because they are not the same as me.
<P>
<B>(1655)</B>
<P>
	People in my riding of a different ethic background are asking 
what they are supposed to write. A good friend of mine, a sheet 
metalist, asked: ``Am I supposed to write African-Canadian 
because I am black?'' He refuses to do that because he was born a 
Canadian. He said he will write Canadian and so will his kids. I 
admire that kind of attitude. There is a perfect example of an 
individual who would like to work toward being considered equal. 
Government legislation is requiring him to declare otherwise.
<P>
	My colleague said the legislation is stupid. That is why it is 
stupid. It is forcing a lot of people to declare they are not Canadian 
because of a hyphen. They do not want to do that.
<P>
	A lot of business people have told me they have practised this 
kind of legislation all their lives. The last thing they want to be is 
discriminatory against anyone. Everybody in the House can go to 
their ridings and talk to entrepreneurs of all kinds who have 
practised this kind of thing.
<P>
	Of the 30 years I have been in Canada, 20 were spent in a 
supervisory position in which I had to hire people. On a number of 
occasions we made certain we did not mistreat anyone on the basis 
of gender, race, et cetera.
<P>
	I recall several teachers who came from all walks of life I was 
involved in hiring who were excellent. It was long enough ago that 
we did not think about colour. We did not think about anything but 
their qualifications and their ability to perform. Now we are to 
force those same businesses that have those hiring practices to take 
into consideration colour, race and gender.
<P>
	Here we go again. There are a lot of entrepreneurs out there who 
are up to their eyebrows in taxes and are having one heck of a time 
making ends meet. The biggest reason is government got into 
everything imaginable and interfered constantly with all the 
different regulations. Businesses have been made to become tax 
collectors through GST and other forms of taxes, which causes 
business to add costs and hire people to do the work for the 
government. Now we are to present them with more legislation.
<P>
	I think all entrepreneurs all across the country of all races are 
just about fed up. They are liable to say to my  friends across the 
way: ``You blew it. What we do not need is more government 
involvement. We are grown individuals. We are intelligent. We are 
Canadian. We will manage our own affairs, thank you. Stay out, 
butt out, and get out of our lives''.
<P>
	No, for 30 years I seen that the government knows better. The 
government knows what is good for Canadians, so it has to make 
sure it gets in there, gets involved and starts forcing things to 
happen that have probably been happening all along. If they have 
not been happening we have a mechanism to make certain that 
people are punished when they do break the law by being 
discriminatory. We have that. It is called the Canadian Human 
Rights Commission. No, the government knows better.
<P>
<B>(1700 )</B>
<P>
	This has been the practice for how long? Remember the metric 
system? Not many people wanted it, but the government gave it to 
them whether they wanted it or not. Remember the language law? 
A whole pile of people did not want it, but the government gave it 
to them whether they wanted it or not.
<P>
	Let us go back to just recently. Consider the GST. It could not 
have been more obvious. People did not want it, but we have it.
<P>
	<B>Mr. McClelland:</B> But the Liberals want it now.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Thompson:</B> The Liberals want it now, that is right.
<P>
	We get promises about those kinds of things. The government 
tells the whole world, all the Canadians, that they know best. They 
are going to get in there and tell you how to run your business, what 
you have to do, who you have to hire and how you have to do it.
<P>
	Who do we think we are? I thought we came here to govern, not 
to rule.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Clancy:</B> They didn't come here to govern. We came here to 
govern.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Thompson:</B> That is right, Mr. Speaker. We came here to 
govern; they came here to rule. This legislation is a perfect 
example of it.
<P>
	I think it is a shame. I think it is a shame when they do not even 
recognize that 70 per cent of the mothers who are working have 
declared that if they did not have to work they would rather be 
home with their children. Why do we not do something to make 
that possible? It may be a shock to our members across the way, a 
shock to the member for Halifax, that there are a lot of working 
mothers who would really like to be home with their children. Let 
us make it possible. Let us cut some taxes. Let us see what we can 
do to help them out. But no, no, no; let's bring in things like this, 
because the poor dumb Canadian businessmen don't know what 
they are doing.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15312"> 15312 </A></B>
<P>
	I looked at another thing that was handed to me. We are up to six 
now in my riding. I would like to  congratulate this government; it 
has made it happen. There are six individuals, including my 
22-year-old son, who have gone south of the border because down 
there they can work and up here they cannot. These six individuals 
are young males, and one is my son, who I would like very much to 
remain in Canada and be a Canadian. He has to go south because he 
has wanted to be a cop since he was six years old, and you do not 
have a hope in the devil of being a cop in this country because 
governments are ruling like they are today. So I thank the Liberals 
very much. They have confirmed that my son will not be Canadian 
because he cannot even get a job as a fireman, as a cop, as an EMP, 
nothing, none of those things, because he does not fit: he is white 
and male.
<P>
	There are five others in my riding who have received their green 
cards and have notified me that they will be gone. Congratulations 
to the Liberals. They have chased some out. I do not suppose that is 
discriminatory, though. That is probably just good government. If 
that is good government, they can have it. I am sick of that.
<P>
	I think they will find during the next election, if the Liberals 
want to keep pursuing these kinds of ventures, if they want to keep 
telling businessmen and women that they do not really know what 
is right, that only we in Parliament know what is right, they will be 
in for a rude awakening. I am certain I am going to stay healthy 
enough to stick around and watch it. I will laugh and laugh, just as 
they laugh today when we make the kinds of comments we do in 
regard to the kind of legislation they bring down, legislation that 
causes racism, that causes discrimination; it cures nothing. Wake 
up and smell the coffee.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Mary Clancy (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Citizenship and Immigration, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have just one 
minor question.
<P>
	As was noted by my hon. colleague, the member for Winnipeg 
North, one of the groups that supports this legislation and has 
called for this legislation and indeed has worked very closely with 
this government, the Department of Human Resources 
Development, the minister, the parliamentary secretary and others, 
a group with which I worked very closely on the area of 
employment equity when I was in opposition, is the Canadian 
Bankers Association.
<P>
<B>(1705 )</B>
<P>
	When I list radical groups that are out there fighting for social 
policy and holding down the left wing in this country, the Canadian 
Bankers Association is not one that automatically leaps to mind. 
However, I want to congratulate the Canadian Bankers Association 
for its far-sightedness. It has had in place for a number of years, 
certainly as long as I have been a member of the House of 
Commons, employment equity groups. It has met with 
representatives from the various banks in this country. It has 
worked within its own organizations for the  promotion of women, 
minorities, the disabled, and so on, and has done a fairly good job.
<P>
	Now I would not want my friends in the banks in Canada to think 
that I am saying they are absolutely perfect, because they have a 
long way to go. There are a number of things I could suggest to 
them in areas of employment equity where they could make their 
record better. But they have certainly been very much in the 
forefront.
<P>
	I do not question the member's 70 per cent of working mothers. 
What I do question is the interpretation of the statistics. I have 
many friends with children of varying ages, and there is no 
question that for women the ability to juggle domestic and 
professional duties is fairly severe. The superwoman syndrome is 
very hard to deal with. When you have small children it is 
particularly difficult to spend a lot of time away from them. 
However, it is more difficult not to provide them with the 
necessities of life, like food, shelter, and other things.
<P>
	If the hon. member is suggesting that we tell all mothers of small 
children to stay home and that we therefore will increase the 
national debt by paying a salary to mothers who stay at home, I find 
that very interesting. Along with his explanation of why a group 
like the Canadian Bankers Association supports employment 
equity, I would like to know whether the Reform Party is 
advocating that we pay a salary out of Canadian taxpayers' dollars 
to mothers to stay at home to raise their children. I would also ask 
him how much he thinks that salary should be.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Thompson:</B> Mr. Speaker, I am not sure how to answer that 
speech. I will start with the bankers.
<P>
	Hurrah for the bankers. If they think this legislation and the 
practice of affirmative action is good, then let them do it. Nobody 
cares. If that is what they want to do, they should be entitled to. 
That is democracy.
<P>
	What I do not think should happen is that somebody be forced 
into doing something that may not be the right thing to do in terms 
of the business, whatever that might be. I think we have to trust the 
judgment of employers to make certain that they do not 
discriminate. If they wish to have a hiring practice that resembles 
employment equity or affirmative action or whatever, that is 
democracy. Let it be their choice. There is nothing wrong with that.
<P>
	I do not believe that mothers with children who choose to stay at 
home want to be paid. I do not think that is their request, any more 
than they like to pay day care and babysitters. However, I do 
believe that if this government were listening to some of the tax 
proposals and tax incentives, there are things it could do that would 
make it possible. The government talks about spending more 
money by letting mothers stay at home. I do not understand. Let 
them work and you are going to spend money paying day care. Do 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15313"> 15313 </A></B>
<P>
not pay for day care. Save  that money so mothers can stay home 
with their children and give tax breaks to the providers of the home.
<P>
<B>(1710)</B>
<P>
	Maybe they have a problem understanding arithmetic, but it 
makes sense to me. It used to be that married couples with one of 
them staying home were able to do so, but now they are not able to 
do so because they are treated the same way as married couples 
who are both working.
<P>
	We can do a lot in that area. I suppose that is another topic. But 
no, mothers do not expect to be paid. If we are going to give extra 
money to other women who can work, if we are going to pay others 
to look after their children so they can work, then if we want to be 
equal I guess we will have to do the same thing for the mom who 
decides to stay home.
<P>
	At any rate, there are not many things she said that made any 
sense to me. That is understandable, considering the source.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ron MacDonald (Dartmouth, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I do not 
know whether I am unlucky or lucky. Each time an issue dealing 
with things such as employment equity, discrimination, or fairness 
in hiring comes up, I always speak after the member for Wild Rose. 
What it means is that I normally do not have to worry about going 
back to a speech that somebody else wrote for me. He usually 
incites me to find things inside that are germane to my very being, 
that are at the core of what I am and the reason I got into politics.
<P>
	Some of the nonsense I hear espoused by that particular member 
does a great disservice, not only to the constituents he represents 
but to the party he belongs to and the Parliament he sits in. This 
member consistently and constantly gets up and shows that it is 
okay to speak in the Parliament of Canada-and I do not deny him 
the right or the privilege to do so-and pretend that things are other 
than what they are.
<P>
	I listened to this member say ``What about the white male?'' He 
told everyone who was listening tonight that his 23-year-old 
mailman son, I think he said, had to go south of the border, had to 
get a green card. I am sorry for that. I hope that my son will be able 
to get employment in this country when he is ready to enter the 
labour market. But I want to give him a wake-up call. There are 
many sons of people in my constituency whose colour is not the 
same as mine or the member for Wild Rose, whose native language 
is not the same as mine or the member for Wild Rose, whose 
fathers cannot get employment in this country, not because the jobs 
do not exist but solely because of the colour of their skin, the 
language they speak, or their cultural heritage. That is the reality in 
this country.
<P>
	If the member for Wild Rose wants to be shown, I will issue him 
an invitation to come down and I will walk him through the back 
streets of Preston, Nova Scotia, and he  can meet the people who 
for generations have fought to be included. They have not asked to 
be given special treatment, they have not asked to be singled out. 
They have asked to be treated like his white male 23-year-old son 
to participate to the fullness of their ability in the labour market. 
That is what this is all about.
<P>
	For the hon. member to deny this tells me that this individual and 
the fact that he can get up and speak the way he does in the House is 
more a testament to the tolerance of the democratic institution 
called Parliament than it is to the point of view he espouses.
<P>
	The member opposite and the Reform Party get up and use this 
high office called Parliament-what John Turner used to refer to as 
the highest court in the land, and it is-to put forward points of 
view they know are dishonest, points of view that say there is no 
need in this country for the federal government, the lead 
government in this country, the highest court in the land, to put out 
in policies and programs what it believes are standards that should 
be followed in its own bailiwick, with its own employees in the 
areas it regulates, in federally regulated industries.
<P>
<B>(1715 )</B>
<P>
	To listen to the member and those of his ilk over there one would 
believe that everything is rosy, that the status quo is something not 
just to be maintained but to be heralded. This is the way we have 
done it. This is the way it should be.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Thompson:</B> That is why you are doing it.
<P>
	<B>Mr. MacDonald:</B> Mr. Speaker, it is not that many generations 
ago that blacks in Nova Scotia were not allowed to walk into 
theatres and sit with whites. It was not 100 years ago. It was in the 
early 1960s when that came to an end.
<P>
	The member should look at history to find out when native 
Canadians, the first people in this land, were finally recognized as 
people and given the right to vote. That is within my generation and 
my lifetime.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Thompson:</B> Mr. Speaker, a point of order. We are talking 
about employment equity. I have never once indicated in my life 
that there should be any form of racism. I am glad racism does not 
exist.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> That is not a point of order.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Order. Clearly-
<P>
	<B>Mr. Thompson:</B> I'm not going to take that crap.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> Language, language.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Thompson:</B> I never called anybody a racist at any time.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> This is the House of 
vigorous debate. There are strongly held views on all issues. This 
one is bringing out some equally strong views. I say respectfully to 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15314"> 15314 </A></B>
<P>
the hon. member for Wild  Rose that he was engaging in debate and 
did not have a point of order.
<P>
	While I am on my feet, I would appeal to members on both sides 
of the House. On issues such as this which are critical and sensitive 
we should be respectful of the institution and one another.
<P>
	<B>Mr. MacDonald:</B> Mr. Speaker, I want the record to show that 
this hon. member has not alluded to anybody in the House and 
indicated that he or she was racist or bigoted. I am not trying to 
impugn the motives of members of the House. I want the record to 
show that the reality is in Canadian society today. Although we 
have come a mighty long way, there is still a mighty long way to 
go.
<P>
	It is well within the responsibility of good government to 
continue to push that agenda item, the envelope as it were, to 
ensure the standards that Canadians want in the private work place 
and in the government work place are continuously upgraded and 
pushed forward.
<P>
	I merely want to tell anybody in the House who does not know or 
does not understand that inequality has been a fact of life since 
European settlers first came to Canada. That is the reality.
<P>
	It does not mean that society in and of itself is racist. It does 
mean that sometimes the majority in society have to understand 
that there may be built in barriers to participation by minority 
groups. It has to be understood that those barriers may be systemic 
and that even people from those groups, if we open the door to full 
participation, may not feel that the door is open.
<P>
	What this bill seeks to do is not to recast the dye. It seeks to build 
on the original legislation that was passed in the House to include 
more industry in the private sector and the federally regulated area. 
That is all it does.
<P>
	It says to employers that there may be an imbalance in the labour 
market. We do not want them to set quotas or numbers because I do 
not approve of that. Minimums become maximums in this game. It 
seeks to establish that there is a problem and that industry can solve 
the problem themselves. That is all it seeks to do.
<P>
	If members come to my area or the area of the member for 
Halifax in our part of Nova Scotia, there are real barriers to 
participation to a whole variety of groups. A company should not 
say it wants a black with a university education, and it does not 
matter what the grades are, any more than it should walk in and say 
that it does not want a black with a university education.
<P>
<B>(1720)</B>
<P>
	It means that we should look at the labour market in the area we 
are in. If it is obvious there are visible or invisible barriers to 
participation in that labour market, that we seek as a conscious 
policy effort to remove those barriers. That is it. There are no 
quotas. There is nothing nefarious in this legislation. It simply 
states that the  federal government believes that wherever 
inequality exists, it has to consciously work to remove that 
inequality. That is all that it says. In areas of a federally regulated 
workplace that is what it says.
<P>
	I am not one of those individuals who believes there should be 
quotas because inherently it is wrong. Many times individuals are 
hired or are put on a board because of a quota system, either an 
official or unofficial quota. They could be the best qualified 
persons for the job, but their co-workers will not see them as a 
qualified individuals. They will see them as individuals that was 
put there simply because the number had to be filled for that 
particular race, gender or whatever.
<P>
	We seek to break those borders down. This legislation goes in 
that direction. It states as a public policy that employers should 
work toward making sure, wherever possible, that their labour 
component is reflective, as best as it can be, of the mix in the labour 
market. In areas of large populations of blacks, indigenous blacks 
in Canada, the federal public service has to work toward making 
sure that they apply for those jobs and, if qualified, that they are 
hired.
<P>
	Most of all, it should be seen that if they do apply for the job that 
they will be considered. The reality is that in many non-traditional 
roles for females in the public service, women do not apply any 
more because in the past they have been turned down so often.
<P>
	If the employer is a crown corporation or a federal department 
and has a policy of encouraging the greater participation in the 
labour market of women, for instance, it sends a signal out that, 
yes, if the woman is qualified she can apply and should have every 
reason to believe that she will be judged based on her qualifications 
and will not be excluded based on her gender.
<P>
	It is the same when dealing with blacks and it is the same when 
dealing with native Canadians. Go to some of the ridings where 
there are high numbers of natives in the population. Do the 
numbers in the population respond to the participation in the 
federal workplace? In some cases, yes, but in some cases they do 
not. This bill seeks to recognize that in areas like that where these 
factors are a reality, that a plan be put together to encourage 
individuals in minority communities to participate. That is it. It 
does not do any more than that.
<P>
	It does not say we have to hire three white people who have 
Gaelic ancestry. It does not say that we have to hire 15 women. It 
says: ``We want you to be conscious in the way that you run your 
operation that you should try to encourage participation from 
minority groups who traditionally might have been excluded''. It is 
nothing more than that.
<P>
	I am going to conclude my remarks because I know the member 
from Halifax is waiting to speak. I want to encourage this House to 
tone down the rhetoric a bit. I know I have been pretty upset today. 
I watch what I say  in this place because I have a great deal of 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15315"> 15315 </A></B>
<P>
respect for the chair that I occupy. I may have certain strong 
opinions but I try to temper them when I stand in this place.
<P>
	I have a great deal of difficulty after seven years here to look 
across in this place and hear people put things on the record that 
may incite, maybe not by design, but may add to a lack of 
understanding and a lack of conciliation among all Canadians and 
may take away from the desire of Canadians to be fair and 
reasonable.
<P>
	The hon. member opposite who spoke before me indicated that 
this law means that we are going to see colour, that we are going to 
have to look for colour, we are going to have to look for language, 
we are going to have to look for gender and that in the past that was 
not the case. Unfortunately he might have been right. In the past 
nobody saw colour when he hired because he did not hire people of 
colour. Nobody saw gender when he hired because in many cases 
he did not hire women. Nobody saw linguistic groups because in 
the past he did not hire linguistic groups.
<P>
	I look forward to the day when we do not have to worry about 
those factors. The reality is the problems are caused by the fact that 
those factors have been overlooked in the past. The only way we 
can rectify it is by public policy. This bill goes in that direction and 
I support it fully.
<P>
<B>(1725)</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Gouk (Kootenay West-Revelstoke, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I listened with interest to the last speaker and it sounds as 
if he has a valid concern. However, it seems to me that the 
legislation he is addressing is discriminatory and the government is 
trying to resolve that with a concept called employment equity.
<P>
	I could be corrected on this, but I believe it was last year when 
we had recognition of women's day in the House, a women Liberal 
MP suggested that the House had a long way to go because over 51 
per cent of the voters in the country are women but only 18 per cent 
of MPs are women. Where lies the problem? Women have the vote. 
Women have the intelligence to vote.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Clancy:</B> Could I answer this?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gouk:</B> People have the right to run as candidates. A number 
of women ran for election and were not elected. I ran against two 
women in my riding. People have the choice to make that selection. 
Women have the vote the same as men and they make a choice.
<P>
	The air traffic control system started talking about affirmative 
action because there were not enough women air traffic controllers. 
At the time I happened to work with a very competent female air 
traffic controller who was asked to participate in the affirmative 
action program to get more women into the air traffic control 
system. She agreed that she would take part in a program to attract 
more women to apply and to learn about the  system. But nobody in 
the system, male or female, was prepared to alter the practices so 
that a woman who was less qualified than a male candidate would 
be chosen.
<P>
	Would the hon. member see a system where for the sake of 
balancing quotas, and there is no other way to put it, that the system 
has to take someone other than best qualified candidate because 
there is an imbalance in the precious quota system?
<P>
	<B>Mr. MacDonald:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the member for his 
question. I believe it is a legitimate one.
<P>
	I want to make two distinctions right off the bat. This bill is not 
about quotas. I do not support a quota system. It is not the right way 
to go. What I do support is a legislative framework that tells 
employers in the federal section, crown corporations and federal 
government departments that there is a reality out there. There are 
many members who are still in denial about the reality of barriers 
to participation in the labour market. They are real.
<P>
	This direction in legislation I hope would never say someone has 
to be hired who is not qualified for the job. That is not what it is 
about. It sets in process a conscious mechanism so that a business, 
department or crown corporation can make sure that if there are no 
natives employed but they are 22 per cent of the population, that 
there must be some barriers to participation somewhere. If the 
barrier is simply that no native has been hired, then by setting 
targets for the participation of native employees sends out a signal.
<P>
	But no, I do not agree. I would not support a bill that tells an 
employer to hire someone who is not qualified for the position. The 
member knows as well as I do, if you are dealing with an entry 
level or mid-level position, many times the minimum qualification 
for the job does not mean the applicant has to be a rocket scientist 
but may require a grade 12 education, someone able to lift a box, 
punch a typewriter or a keyboard, or operate a furnace. I do not 
know.
<P>
	This bill does not compel anybody to hire an individual based on 
gender or colour.
<P>
<B>(1730 )</B>
<P>
	It compels the corporate sector within the federally regulated 
area and the federal government to ensure that where those 
inequities are identifiable they have conscious programs to try to 
encourage the participation of qualified minority candidates.
<P>
	It does not do anything other than that and if the member thinks 
it does I feel sorry for him. I would ask for him to reread the 
legislation because I think he is off in a direction not consistent 
with the goals of the bill.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ian McClelland (Edmonton Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I believe that when the member opposite says he does not 
believe in quotas he is quite sincere. It does not matter how it is 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15316"> 15316 </A></B>
<P>
dressed up. If there is a numerical  target that is a quota. It does not 
matter how it is dressed up, it is a quota.
<P>
	I ask the member opposite to respond to two brief questions. In 
his comments earlier the hon. member said it was wrong that a 
woman should not be able to get a job because she was a woman. Is 
it also wrong that a man should not get a job because he is a man?
<P>
	The Department of Justice in its employment equity guidebook 
uses an employment equity target with a table that specifies the 
following. It will recruit 2.2 per cent of aboriginal peoples with 
promotions at 1.1 per cent; 2 per cent of persons with disabilities 
with promotions at 2.8 per cent; 4.4 per cent of visible minorities 
with promotions at 2.7 per cent of the total staff. If these are not 
quotas, what are they?
<P>
	<B>Mr. MacDonald:</B> Mr. Speaker, I do not know what the members 
opposite do not get. This is a very simple piece of legislation. There 
is a history to this legislation. It is an amendment to an existing act. 
I cannot recall anybody contacting my office in the last seven years 
and complaining that the federal government through the existing 
employment equity legislation was excluding anybody qualified 
from participating. I have not had that and I have a lot of public 
servants in my area.
<P>
	There are many people who do not get a job and run out and say 
there was a black hired and they must have been hired because they 
were black. There are plenty of minorities, black, linguistic, there 
are many women who in the past have not been hired not because 
they were not qualified but simply because of who they were, 
because they were females, because they were black, because they 
were immigrants or because they spoke a different language as a 
mother tongue. That is the reality.
<P>
	This is not about quotas. I do not support a quota system. 
However, I will not as a federal legislator shirk my responsibility to 
pilot policy for the public sector which we are responsible for to 
indicate that it appears there is a discrepancy in the hiring patterns 
and policies of many government departments.
<P>
	Either one subscribes to the the fact that people of colour or 
women are unable to attain certain standards, which is why they are 
not hired, or one can encourage the setting of targets whereby the 
organization or the private sector company will examine whether 
its employees are reflective of the mix of the labour market it can 
draw from, and where it is not reflective to encourage that 
employer to set forth a plan to get participation by the labour 
market as close to the mix of the labour market by qualified 
candidates.
<P>
	I do not agree with quotas but I do agree that we will get nowhere 
by going into denial and pretending there is equity in the 
workplace. There is not. This bill will help to establish that it is a 
priority for Canadians and for the government. I am proud to say I 
am a part of the  government that has taken the initiative to put this 
back on the public agenda.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Due to a ministerial 
statement and responses earlier, Government Orders will conclude 
at 5.46 p.m., at which time we will proceed to private members' 
hour.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, when I look across the House it is interesting. I see more 
ties that bind us than divide us even on such a sensitive issue as 
employment equity, which we oppose.
<P>
<B>(1735 )</B>
<P>
	The hon. member gave some very eloquent points on issues 
where we have a lot of commonality. We in this party deplore and 
oppose with every strand of our bodies discrimination against 
anybody. We would fight to a person against anybody who was 
committing these offences on our soil.
<P>
	Therefore I find it amazing that the government wishes to put 
forth employment equity which by its very nature is discriminatory 
and against our charter of laws and freedoms.
<P>
	The original ideals of employment equity, affirmative action of 
fairness, equity and a level playing are what we in this party are 
fighting for. That was the original intent. Unfortunately what has 
happened with employment equity is it is being distorted. It has 
been plasticized and distorted so it does not resemble its original.
<P>
	Tragically employment equity now holds up that people will be 
advanced on jobs or acquire jobs on characteristics designed by the 
government to advance people. The characteristics have nothing to 
do with ability and merit but have everything to do with 
characteristics that have nothing to do with the important aspects of 
getting a job, merit and ability.
<P>
	This in effect is discriminatory by its very nature because it is 
promoting people on non-objective criteria and it is also very 
harmful to the economy. It is also very insulting to the individual 
getting a job for characteristics that have nothing to do with their 
education, their ability or their merit. I do not think that was ever 
taken into consideration by the government.
<P>
	I do not think the government has put itself into the shoes of 
those individuals getting jobs like that. Furthermore it causes 
divisions and discrimination within the workplace. That is not fair 
and it is not good for the soul of the country.
<P>
	The logic of the new employment equity law is clearly a flagrant 
abuse of the charter of human rights and freedoms. If one looks at 
the charter one can argue quite persuasively that employment 
equity is discrimination and should be thrown out on that ground 
alone. In other areas of the world where employment equity has 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15317"> 15317 </A></B>
<P>
been put forth such as California and in the province of Ontario, it 
has been thrown out. Why has it been thrown  it? It does not work, 
it is discriminatory and it causes incredible social divisions within 
the populations it is supposed to help.
<P>
	That is not what we want in Canada. We want a country in which 
everybody is treated equally, in which people advance on merit and 
in which people can look at each other face to face as equals with 
mutual respect and admiration.
<P>
	We do not want Canada to uphold policies that are divisive and 
which pit groups of people against each other. That has gone on for 
far too long. I challenge people in the government to go into the 
streets and ask people in the workforce about this. Tragically that is 
what has happened. We should not have that in such a beautiful 
country as ours, a country that has historically done an admirable 
job of merging so many ethnic groups in a peaceful environment. 
That is something all Canadians need to be proud of because very 
few countries enjoy that.
<P>
	Employment equity also seeks to promote quotas. No matter 
what members of the government say on the other side, 
employment equity means quotas. It means numbers. Any 
employer will say that is what they are obligated to do.
<P>
	The unfortunate thing that employment equity brings forth is the 
whole aspect of work for equal value. It is an artificial designation 
that tries to have the government determine what kind of work 
should be paid for equally with another disparate work. What kind 
of work is supposedly of equal value in an economy? The only 
legitimate place to decide what work should be paid for and its 
value is in a free market economy. That cannot be designated by 
government power. It must be decided in a free market economy. 
Anything less is extremely destructive.
<P>
<B>(1740)</B>
<P>
	Governments must argue for laws which are anti-discriminatory. 
The debate which took place a few moments ago involved my 
colleague and a member of the government. What struck me as 
very interesting was that they were both arguing the same point. 
They both want laws which are anti-discriminatory and feel the 
government's role is to ensure those laws are on the books and that 
they are applied.
<P>
	The second role of government is to apply equal opportunity. It 
is imperative, particularly for those most dispossessed in our 
society, to have equal opportunity. That is one of the failings we 
see. Many people who are in the lower socioeconomic strata do not 
have that opportunity. It is important we create that opportunity so 
they can become the best they can become. That is the legitimate 
role of government. We in this party would strive very strongly for 
that and we would help government members to put forth strong 
plans and  strong legislation to create the greatest opportunities for 
people.
<P>
	The other aspect is to create fairness. It does not matter whether 
a person is black, brown, polka dotted, aboriginal, male, female, 
Jewish, Christian, Muslim or Hindu. What matters is that the laws 
and the opportunities to get jobs are applied equally.
<P>
	The hon. member brought up the point of people applying for a 
job and being discriminated against. We completely agree. We are 
arm in arm with enforcing those laws so that when a person applies 
for a job they are treated on their ability and their merit.
<P>
	The other role of government is to create skills. Tragically we 
saw that money was pulled away from post-secondary education 
very recently. We understand very clearly the situation all 
governments across the country are in with fiscal problems. There 
is a way around that. We can cut from the federal budget but give 
the provinces the ability to raise the moneys themselves for 
education. We cannot build a strong economy and provide 
individuals with the skills necessary for them to get jobs in the 21st 
century if we cannot make educational opportunities available to 
them.
<P>
	The single most important determining factor in getting a job is 
post-secondary education. It is important for us to support the 
post-secondary educational facilities so they understand what the 
needs of the economy will be in the future. We must provide them 
the ability to communicate those economic needs to the students, 
particularly when they are in high school, so they can plan for the 
future.
<P>
	I hope we do not pursue employment equity. It has been a failure 
in other parts of the world. It is discriminatory. It is a tragic 
example of Orwellian social engineering, a type of social 
engineering we do not need.
<P>
	We are very sensitive to the needs of the disadvantaged. The hon. 
member mentioned the plight of the aboriginals. I have worked 
with many aboriginals under the most tragic and harrowing 
circumstances. It breaks my heart to see what they have to endure. 
It is very important for us to understand that historically we have 
created an institutionalized welfare state in which the souls of these 
people have been broken. It is important for us to address their 
needs in a sensitive fashion and to provide them the skills and 
opportunities to enable them to take off the yolk of poverty and 
discrimination which they have endured for so long.
<P>
	However, it is not the job of government to push people into jobs 
based on their characteristics. I hope the government will take this 
to heart. I hope the minister of aboriginal affairs will engage in 
activities which will help these people help themselves. I hope we 
can create a country that is free of prejudice and full of opportunity, 
that makes sure that Canadians are treated equally and  we can look 
<P>

<B><A NAME="15318"> 15318 </A></B>
<P>
at each other face to face as equals in an environment of peace and 
harmony.
<P>
	I know we in this party would like to stand together with all 
members in this House to ensure that legislation is effected to 
enable all Canadians to live in that environment.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> It being 5.46 p.m., the House 
will now proceed to the consideration of Private Members' 
Business as listed on today's Order Paper.

	The House resumed from September 27 consideration of the 
motion.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Susan Whelan (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
National Revenue, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is a pleasure to speak 
today on Motion No. M-382 introduced by the hon. member for 
Mississauga South.
<P>
	The issue of the underground economy is of concern to me and 
should be of concern to all Canadians. Most Canadians have been 
faced with an offer to pay cash for a lower price. When someone 
offers a lower price for cash and does not provide an invoice, at 
least two things happen: one, the consumer has no protection or 
recourse against poor workmanship; and two, governments lose 
revenue.
<P>
	The greater the activity in the underground economy, the less 
revenue there is available to governments. Underground economic 
activity creates unfair competition for honest businesses. Jobs are 
lost and honest taxpayers are forced to pay more than their fair 
share of taxes.
<P>
	I have spoken with the people of my constituency about the 
underground economy. Those who follow the law and pay their 
share of taxes do not like having to pay higher taxes because others 
are trying to cheat the system. Entrepreneurs who are trying to 
make an honest living say they do not like being at a competitive 
disadvantage to businesses and tradespeople who ask for cash 
payments to avoid paying taxes.
<P>
	My constituents worry over how lost revenue is affecting the 
government's ability to maintain the social and economic programs 
so important to our well-being. When we accept the terms of a cash 
deal, what we end up doing is condoning a crime and promoting tax 
evasion.
<P>
	As consumers, Canadians have to say no to offers of work for 
cash. It is in their interest to do so. First, work performed under the 
table means consumers are at risk if the work is poorly performed 
or the result is not of the quality expected. Second, as I said, it 
means taxes higher  than they should be. Third, it means essential 
social services we all benefit from are being put at risk.
<P>
	Businesses must recognize that in the end conducting business in 
the underground economy will do more harm than good. Honest 
businesses are put at a competitive disadvantage because they 
cannot offer a customer the same deal as that offered by someone 
who will do the work but not collect the taxes. Furthermore the 
reputation of an entire business sector can be damaged by just a 
handful of under the table entrepreneurs whose work is of poor 
quality.
<P>
	I hear stories in my riding of Essex-Windsor about businesses 
that operate out of basements or backyard garages and only work 
for cash getting their referrals for jobs by word of mouth. These 
businesses usually give two quotes: a quote for doing work for cash 
and a second higher quote which includes the proper taxes. Many 
individuals and businesses engage in these illegal transactions as a 
way to avoid paying taxes. They think all they are doing is cheating 
the tax department but as I said a moment ago, their actions make 
victims of us all.
<P>
	The negative effects of activity in the underground economy 
show up in the form of reduced essential savings and services, 
taxes higher than they would otherwise be, unfair competition and 
a reduced standard of living for the honest taxpayer. Governments 
cannot afford to allow this practice to go unchallenged. People 
have to know that there is fairness in the tax system, that honest 
businesses have a level playing field and that people who try to 
cheat the system will be dealt with appropriately.
<P>
	The government has introduced measures for addressing the 
underground economy to ensure there is fairness in the way in 
which the tax system is being administered. The Minister of 
National Revenue's action plan calls on Revenue Canada:
<P>
	First, to encourage voluntary compliance by making clear why 
compliance is important and explaining the consequences.
<P>
	Second, to work closely with the provinces by setting up 
exchanges of information to better target and improve enforcement 
actions.
<P>
	Third, to strengthen the department's program to identify 
non-filers and non-registrants.
<P>
<B>(1750 )</B>
<P>
	Fourth, to establish special audit teams to focus on areas of high 
non-compliance: construction, home renovations, jewellery, 
hospitality, car repairs, and other service sectors.
<P>
	Fifth, to work closely with other federal departments, key 
industry groups and professional organizations.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15319"> 15319 </A></B>
<P>
	Last, to explore ways including legislative changes to improve 
reporting, to enhance the effectiveness of penalties and to improve 
audit and investigation techniques.
<P>
	The results of the action taken to date are significant. As of last 
March 31 over $860 million, over three-quarters of a billion 
dollars, in additional taxes have been assessed as a result of the 
government's underground economy initiative. I should point out 
that the underground economy initiative is only one part of 
Revenue Canada's overall enforcement efforts, efforts which 
generated $3.7 billion in additional taxes assessed in the 1994-95 
fiscal year.
<P>
	The government has also established close working relationships 
with a large number of associations whose members know often 
from firsthand experience how the underground economy can hurt 
Canadian business. Revenue Canada has consulted with more than 
240 groups, such as the Certified General Accountants Association, 
the Canadian Institute of Chartered Accountants, the Canadian 
Home Builders Association and the Direct Sellers Association.
<P>
	These groups have described how revenues and jobs are being 
lost. They know how businesses face unfair competition from those 
who do not play by the rules. Consumers lose out when they get 
goods and services through the underground economy since they 
forfeit any guarantees of quality backed by reputable firms. With 
their assistance, Revenue Canada is refining its strategies 
identifying areas of non-compliance and exploring measures for 
improving compliance.
<P>
	In my riding the department has been in touch with the Home 
Builders Association and is getting information that might be 
useful in identifying non-compliance.
<P>
	Revenue Canada also has close ties with the provinces. 
Co-operation arrangements are in place with all the provinces. 
Revenue Canada has moved beyond the simple exchange of 
information and the department is doing joint audits with the 
provinces. It is sharing audit strategies, training materials and 
expertise. The provinces have supplied Revenue Canada with 
databases containing such information as PST registrants, liquor 
licences, building permits and vehicle registration information as 
well as the names and addresses of new and used car dealers.
<P>
	There is also federal and provincial co-operation in terms of 
ensuring that taxpayers have information to help them voluntarily 
comply with the law as well as information on the consequences 
associated with non-compliance.
<P>
	For example, Revenue Canada has carried out community visits 
with representatives of provincial tax administrations. During these 
visits, businesses are given information on the underground 
economy and information and assistance to help them comply with 
the  tax laws. Departmental officials also ensure that businesses are 
properly registered for tax purposes and when necessary, encourage 
businesses to comply with the law where they are not.
<P>
	Across the country more than 40 community visits have been 
conducted involving more than 10,000 businesses. The department 
has increased and targeted its audits to focus on areas of high 
non-compliance and strengthened its ability to identify non-filers 
and non-registrants.
<P>
	In 1994-95 an additional $245 million was assessed through the 
non-filer program and an equal amount through the non-registrant 
program. Nearly 11,000 audits were completed in the high risk 
sectors which resulted in a further $90 million in taxes being 
assessed.
<P>
	Revenue Canada has increased its publicity of convictions for 
tax evasion. During 1994-95 there were more than 170 convictions 
for evasion of income tax and GST. There has been a doubling in 
the number of voluntary disclosures as a result and the department 
now receives about 19,000 referrals a year from Canadians who are 
tired of their neighbours and friends not paying their fair share of 
taxes.
<P>
	Revenue Canada's preferred approach is to encourage voluntary 
compliance. It works. Ninety-five per cent of all revenues are 
collected without the need for enforcement action. A great deal has 
been accomplished since the Minister of National Revenue 
launched his action plan for addressing the underground economy 
in November 1993.
<P>
	While the government has introduced concrete measures for 
addressing the underground economy, it is not exclusively the 
government's responsibility. All Canadians must do their part, 
individuals and businesses alike.
<P>
	Canadians need to talk about the negative consequences of the 
underground economy. They must resist the temptation and simply 
say no. I urge members of the House to carry this message back to 
their constituents. I urge members of the House to work diligently 
with their constituents to come up with the answers.
<P>
	I would like to thank the member for Mississauga South for 
putting forward the motion allowing us to debate an issue of 
extreme importance to all Canadians. The motion has forced 
members on both sides of the House to talk about a serious 
problem. I am hopeful it will eventually result in those now in the 
underground economy returning to the legitimate economy. I am 
confident that we are making the right progress in dealing with the 
problem.

<B>(1755)</B>
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Rose-Marie Ur (Lambton-Middlesex, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am pleased to have this opportunity to make a few 
comments on Motion No. 382 sponsored by the member for 
Mississauga South.
<P>
	Let me say from the outset that I have spoken with a number of 
people who run businesses in my riding of Lambton-Middlesex 
about the underground economy. Those who respect the law and 
pay their taxes do not appreciate having to pay higher taxes simply 
because others are trying to cheat the system.
<P>
	Entrepreneurs and small business people who are trying very 
hard to make a living do not like being at a competitive 
disadvantage of businesses and tradespeople who ask for cash 
payment to avoid paying taxes. My constituents also worry over 
how lost revenue is affecting the government's ability to maintain 
Canada's social and economic programs which are so important to 
our well-being.
<P>
	The issue that is the focus of this motion is of major importance 
to all Canadians right across the country. The greater the activity in 
the underground economy, the less revenue there is available to 
government. Underground economic activity creates unfair 
competition for honest businesses. Jobs are lost and honest 
taxpayers are forced to pay more than their fair share of taxes.
<P>
	There has been a great deal written about the size, extent, nature 
and causes of the underground economy. As members are probably 
aware, estimates on the size of the underground economy vary 
widely depending upon the methodology used, anywhere from 2.5 
per cent to 3 per cent of GDP to over 20 per cent, or from $20 
billion to $140 billion a year. Regardless of its size, there is no 
disputing the fact that the underground economy exists and its 
corrosive efforts are exacting a huge toll on Canadian society.
<P>
	Why then do people make the decision to go underground? There 
are many reasons. However, I would submit that none of these 
reasons is legitimate. There is the myth that everyone is doing it, so 
I may as well. There is the perception of the GST as an unfair tax 
which enables someone to rationalize their behaviour as 
acceptable. Others perceive the tax system as too complex and 
cumbersome to even bother with it. Then there are those who feel 
that it is easy to get away with it, so why not take the chance?
<P>
	We have to also acknowledge a widespread disrespect for 
government and politicians and the accompanying perception that 
government is wasting the money it takes in from Canadians and 
that they are getting poor value for their tax dollars.
<P>
	While none of these reasons can justify not paying one's fair 
share of taxes, the fact remains that an unfortunate snowballing 
effect is created once the decision is made to go underground. 
There is the fear  that once one has gone underground, it is too 
difficult to come out.
<P>
	There is the perception that if people have gone underground 
long enough, they might not be able to come out even if they 
wanted to because there would be no possibility to pay the taxes, let 
alone the interest and penalties, simply because there would be no 
paper trail made up of bills, invoices and so on. Faced with this set 
of circumstances, those who would like to reform their bad habits 
perceive it cannot be done. They are somehow stuck.
<P>
	One of the most attractive aspects of Motion No. 382 is the 
provision for a limited amnesty on interest and penalties otherwise 
payable when a taxpayer voluntarily declares income previously 
undeclared. The inducement to go straight would allow the 
previously delinquent taxpayers to voluntarily come forward 
without penalty for a limited time and start paying his or her fair 
share of taxes once again.
<P>
	Another component of the motion is a proposed tax credit to 
taxpayers on home improvements and renovations. This would 
provide an inducement to create an essential paper trail and to serve 
as one of the primary vehicles for a country wide information 
campaign.
<P>
	The motion before the House demonstrates a desire on the part of 
the member for Mississauga South to get Canadians talking about 
the negative consequences of the underground economy and to 
hopefully find ways to encourage as many people as possible to 
return to the legitimate economy.
<P>
	There must be a public campaign which emphasizes that tax 
evasion is a crime and that it is certainly not a victimless crime as is 
often argued. All Canadians are victims, because tax evasion leads 
to job loss, increase in the deficit, honest taxpayers carrying more 
of the burden, and legitimate businesses operating in an 
environment of unfair competition, sometimes leading to their 
bankruptcy.
<P>
<B>(1800)</B>
<P>
	I believe the co-existence of the amnesty program and the tax 
credit for home renovations with more traditional public awareness 
campaigns would serve to educate Canadians on the facts of the 
seriousness of the existence of the underground economy and how 
they can help to eliminate it. I also believe there will be a change in 
the attitude of Canadians toward paying their fair share of taxes if 
they can be convinced that government is upholding its 
responsibility in enforcing the law in a tough but fair fashion.
<P>
	To his credit, the Minister of National Revenue, through a series 
of thoughtful initiatives over the past year and a half, has been 
successful in recovering over $800 million in unpaid taxes. But the 
department has done more than just collect unpaid taxes. Through 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15321"> 15321 </A></B>
<P>
consultation with over 240 groups and associations, the  
department has learned how to refine its strategies, identify areas 
of non-compliance, and explore measures for improving 
compliance. For example, the government's recent budget 
announcement of a measure to address the problem of the 
underground economy in the construction industry is a direct result 
of its consultation efforts.
<P>
	The department has increased its publicity of convictions for tax 
evasion. As a result, there has been a doubling of the number of 
voluntary disclosures. The department now receives about 19,000 
referrals a year from Canadians who are tired of some of their 
neighbours and friends not paying their fair share of taxes.
<P>
	The motion before the House demonstrates a desire on the part of 
members to get Canadians talking about the negative consequences 
of the underground economy and hopefully find ways of 
encouraging as many people as possible to return to the legitimate 
workplace within the mainstream economy.
<P>
	I would like to take this opportunity to fully endorse the motion 
brought forward by the member for Mississauga South and I would 
encourage all members of the House to do likewise.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I appreciate the opportunity to speak on this private 
member's bill by the member for Mississauga South. I hope his 
constituents will appreciate the hard work he has put into this. I 
know of his deep concern. Members of Parliament have all heard 
this concern from our constituents. Perhaps there is no concern that 
hits as close to the heart of every citizen in the country as what is 
taking place in the underground economy. I applaud the hon. 
member for trying to address the problem.
<P>
	The underground economy is costing the Canadian economy 
upwards of $90 billion every year. The underground economy is a 
clear response from the taxpayers that they are angry and fearful. 
They are angry because they see more and more of their pay 
cheques being eroded and they receive less and less money to 
provide for their needs. It is becoming increasingly difficult to 
survive in this country. Perhaps the single most important reason 
for this is because of our tax structure. I will look at the reasons a 
little later.
<P>
	The high taxes have also damaged our ability to compete 
internationally. For a country such as ours, which relies on our 
export potential to maintain our standard of living, there is perhaps 
no other factor within our economy that is so damaging to the 
ability for us to do that. We worked so hard to get agreements on 
the NAFTA and the free trade agreement, but we have 
unfortunately hamstrung the ability of businesses in the country to 
compete internationally. The single most important reason we 
cannot do it is because of the tax structure. We have seen many 
business go under. When I go back to my home in Toronto, I see 
many businesses  that have been passed down from generation to 
generation that have gone bankrupt. The reason is partly because of 
the tax structure.
<P>
<B>(1805 )</B>
<P>
	We see many businesses that flock south. People hold up the free 
trade agreement as a reason that is so, our inability to compete. The 
real reason most companies have actually fled south is because of 
the high tax structure, which strangles the ability of Canadian 
companies to compete internationally. We have one of the highest 
tax structures in the world.
<P>
	Yesterday we saw that the IMF has actually downgraded our 
ability to get money from the IMF. The reason is because our 
ability to get our debt and deficit down is not good enough. The 
high taxes that we have are the result of the high debt and deficit 
that we have in this country, nothing else. It has been a 
consequence of course of the high spending that Canadians have 
endured for years and years, overspending by successive 
governments. This has combined with an extremely complex tax 
structure and high administration costs to create the terrible tax 
structure we have today. The result of that has been the 
underground economy, which is costing us $90 billion or more a 
year. That is why the hon. member for Mississauga South has put 
forth these endeavours.
<P>
	I will just talk for a moment on what I agree with and what I 
disagree with. Part C of the hon. member's bill, which would 
provide a tax credit for individuals who wish to hire other 
individuals in their homes to do work, is a very good one. It will 
provide transparency in a system that is currently opaque. A good 
member from my community in Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca, Mrs. 
Shirley Wilde, put forth a similar idea. We have presented this to 
the Minister of National Revenue. I look forward to a response 
from him in the near future. I hope this is something we can work 
together on in this House.
<P>
	I disagree with part A of his bill, the information campaign, for 
the simple reason that it will entail costs and expenses for the 
government and in fact will add to the tax burden of Canadians.
<P>
	I would suggest that the government look at new ways to get our 
spending under control, to get the deficit down to zero, and to 
attack the true ogre in this equation, which is the debt. We 
presented our zero in three deficit reduction plan, which I hope the 
government will look at, because there are very sensitive but very 
concrete ways in which we can get our spending down so that it 
will not hurt the people in our country, in particular those who are 
most dispossessed, which is something we share a common interest 
in.
<P>
	Second, we have to get the GST down and simplify it. When we 
go out to the business community, no other single complaint so irks 
them as the GST, a system that is unfathomable, entirely complex, 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15322"> 15322 </A></B>
<P>
and whose  administration costs chew up over one-third of the 
moneys that are generated.
<P>
	Third, we have to decrease taxes overall. Back in 1992 the 
government of the day did decrease taxes. Interestingly enough, it 
found that its revenues increased. What did it do? It began taxing 
wildly. This wild taxing spree, instead of increasing government 
revenues, actually decreased them. There is a lesson in there for 
any government: decrease the taxes and the public will become 
more honest in their representations and will spend more. In fact, 
there will be a stimulation to the economy.
<P>
	Fourth, I would ask the government and the Minister of Finance 
and Minister of National Revenue to look at the flat tax that has 
been proposed by our party. The flat tax will provide equanimity to 
all Canadians.
<P>
	One of the things that make Canadians extremely furious is they 
feel that the more they work the less they have to take home; the 
harder they work, the more they give to the government. Little 
erodes the soil of the Canadian economy or any economy more 
than if a worker feels that if they work harder they are going to take 
home less. We have to institute the incentive factor back into the 
soul of the Canadian economy. Right now it is dead. Canadian 
workers wonder why they should work harder when they are giving 
more and more tax money to the government and less and less 
money is left for them to spend.
<P>
<B>(1810 )</B>
<P>
	I would ask that we provide the Canadian people with increased 
earning power, with an increased ability to keep more money at 
home. The only we way can decrease the extent of the underground 
economy is to get spending by the Canadian government under 
control. Canadians are fed up with the overspending. We must do 
this not only for the future of the people in this House and our 
families but for future generations.
<P>
	I appreciate the hon. member's introduction of this private 
member's bill. I hope we can look at part C of that bill to discover 
new ways to increase transparency in the economy we have now so 
we can decrease the extent of the present underground economy so 
there will be more money in the public coffers and fairness and 
greater equanimity among the tax structures we have.
<P>
	We are working on this together. I hope we can come together to 
develop a tax structure that is fairer to all Canadians, a tax structure 
that provides the government with the ability to get its spending 
under control while providing more money for Canadians to spend.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Shaughnessy Cohen (Windsor-St. Clair, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I want to first congratulate the member for Mississauga 
South on Motion No. 382, which addresses the ongoing problem of 
the underground economy. The motion demonstrates his interest in 
the problem. It encourages debate on something that really has  
bedevilled the government in our attack on both the deficit and our 
desire to pursue and maintain our social programs, because the 
collection of revenues is impeded.
<P>
	I hope this debate allows Canadians to focus as well on the 
problem and to reflect on the difficulties created by the 
underground economy. In my constituency of Windsor-St. Clair I 
hear regularly from constituents who understand the problem and 
who resent their neighbours who operate within the underground 
economy.
<P>
	Cash business transactions, cheap smuggled beverage alcohol, 
under the table employment, and other practices of this type 
shortchange all of us. When we do this we do not remit taxes. The 
taxes themselves would help to maintain our health plans, our 
roads, our universities, our social programs. When we do this we 
help to create unfair competition for honest businesses who do 
remit taxes. When our neighbours do it, they help ratchet up our 
own tax bills.
<P>
	This motion calls on the government to consider establishing 
initiatives to address the underground economy that exists in 
Canada today. A great deal has been written about this 
phenomenon: its size, the social and economic costs, the reasons 
people abandon the legitimate economy in favour of under the table 
transactions, and suggestions for dealing with the problem.
<P>
	The issue is of concern to me and it should be of concern to all 
Canadians because the underground economy has significant 
implications for all of us. The greater the activity in the 
underground economy, as I said earlier, the less revenue available 
to governments. The creation of unfair competition for honest 
businesses has driven some small new businesses, marginal 
businesses, out of operation. This results in lost jobs and in us 
paying more taxes.
<P>
	I agree with the hon. member for Mississauga South that 
Canadians must act on the problem of the underground economy. I 
say all Canadians because the responsibility for dealing with the 
issue does not rest entirely on the shoulders of the government. We 
all have a responsibility and a role to play. Public confidence in 
Canada's tax system depends on all of us paying our fair share and 
having the confidence that our neighbours are doing so as well.
<P>
	Individuals and businesses involved in underground economic 
activity are not playing by the rules. Governments cannot afford to 
allow the practice to go unchallenged. People have to know there is 
fairness in the tax system. They have to know that honest 
businesses have a level playing field and that people who try to 
cheat are going to be dealt with appropriately.
<P>
	Public confidence depends on effective government measures as 
well. It is for this reason that our government has introduced 
measures to address the  underground economy and other forms of 
non-compliance. Revenue Canada has put in place a compliance 
strategy that supports self-assessment and voluntary compliance 
through assistance, education, services, and responsible enforce-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15323"> 15323 </A></B>
<P>
ment. It seeks to ensure that revenues legitimately owed to the 
government are collected. The strategy is comprehensive, covering 
the entire portfolio of Revenue Canada and all dimensions of 
revenue administration. It is also dynamic because it is sensitive to 
modern business practices and the changing forces at play in both 
the national and local economies.
<P>
<B>(1815)</B>
<P>
	It is a targeted program which makes use of modern 
technologies, compliance research and a cross-matching of 
information from Revenue Canada's extensive databases, other 
federal departments and provincial revenue administrations.
<P>
	The department's approach also recognizes there are many 
different kinds of taxpayers, individuals, corporations, salaried 
employees and others.
<P>
	The department has launched special projects as well to address 
areas of systemic concern, as in the case with its underground 
economy initiative announced by the minister of revenue in 
November of 1993. The department has established special audit 
teams to focus on construction, home renovation, jewellery, 
hospitality, auto sales, repairs and other service sectors which are 
areas of high non-compliance. Under this initiative we have put 
agreements into place with all of the provinces to co-ordinate 
actions and to ensure progress.
<P>
	The government's underground economy initiative also involves 
working closely with business, unions, industry and professional 
groups to identify ways to further strengthen Revenue Canada's 
enforcement efforts and to encourage voluntary compliance. 
During the last year departmental officials consulted extensively 
with more than 240 groups. They know that tax evasion cheats 
honest workers out of steady, secure employment and compromises 
the ability of governments to provide service. They want to help.
<P>
	Specifically I will address that part of the motion which suggests 
some relief or limited forgiveness on interest and other penalties 
which would be payable when a taxpayer voluntarily declares 
previously undeclared income. This section of the motion calls for 
an amnesty. The suggestion is an interesting one in terms of how it 
might facilitate the return of individuals and businesses from the 
underground economy to the legitimate economy. In no way, 
however, should it be possible for taxpayers to get away with not 
paying the taxes they owe. There is merit to the thrust behind the 
suggestion but I think there are some problems with it as it is 
framed here.
<P>
	Opportunities already exist for Canadians who may have 
deficiencies in their tax reporting to come forward  and get a clean 
bill of health from Revenue Canada. The preferred approach to 
non-compliance is voluntary disclosure. The department has a 
voluntary disclosure policy which I as a lawyer in my previous life 
was able to use to assist clients who had been following business 
and personal tax practices which did not comply with the law.
<P>
	This policy allows individuals, partnerships, corporations, trusts, 
non-profit organizations, charitable and other organizations to 
come forward to correct deficiencies in their reporting to the 
department. When a disclosure is made voluntarily before the 
department has started its audit or other enforcement action, then 
no penalties or other sanctions such as prosecution for tax evasion 
will be imposed. The taxpayer will have to pay the amount of taxes 
or duty owing plus interest. This is a fair policy. It is a form of 
amnesty which has been available for some time.
<P>
	I do not agree, however, that interest should be set aside. The 
interest owed reflects the true value of the money. It also 
recognizes the fact that those who have not paid their taxes on time 
have had the use of these funds, which essentially they were 
holding in trust for the government.
<P>
	Revenue Canada under its voluntary disclosure policy takes a 
responsible approach to collections. Arrangements can be worked 
out so that the taxes owing to the government are paid in a manner 
which does not cause undue hardship for the taxpayers. This aspect 
is particularly important to those individuals or businesses 
operating in the underground economy for some time that feel they 
would face onerous penalties if they were to come clean and 
operate honestly.
<P>
	A person can make a voluntary disclosure by contacting a 
Revenue Canada office directly or by having someone do it on their 
behalf, such as an accountant, a lawyer or a friend who wants to 
assist. A disclosure will be considered voluntary so long as it is 
made before Revenue Canada has basically started its audit or any 
other enforcement action.
<P>
<B>(1820)</B>
<P>
	As a result of co-operative agreements Revenue Canada has with 
the provinces, we are working toward developing a co-ordinated 
voluntary disclosure policy with all of the provinces. It is our view 
that a consistent policy among the federal and provincial 
governments with respect to disclosure will make it easier for 
taxpayers who have decided to rejoin the legitimate economy.
<P>
	I believe we need to be careful about tax amnesties. When tried 
in the past, more extensive tax amnesties than what are available 
under the voluntary disclosure program, they have had only limited 
effect. They may actually create more non-compliance. This 
happens because people believe that once an amnesty is in place 
others will follow and so they can wait and delay co-operation. The 
result is less compliance, not more.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15324"> 15324 </A></B>
<P>
	People also believe that when there is an amnesty policy in 
place that will forgive interest it becomes their right to avoid 
paying interest on taxes.
<P>
	A great deal has been accomplished since the Minister of 
National Revenue introduced his action plan for addressing the 
underground economy. The initiative has resulted in more than 
$860 million in additional taxes assessed. Revenue Canada's 
ability to identify non-filers and non-registrants has been 
strengthened. The department has put co-operation agreements in 
place with all of the provinces and is working in partnership with 
private sector groups.
<P>
	It is clear Canadians are concerned about the underground 
economy and that Canadians are willing to work together to find 
solutions. I thank the member again for this motion. I congratulate 
him on it because it demonstrates a desire on his part and on the 
part of his constituents to get Canadians talking about the negative 
consequences of the underground economy and to find ways of 
encouraging as many people as possible to return to the legitimate 
economy.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gurbax Singh Malhi (Bramalea-Gore-Malton, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I will make a few comments in support of Motion No. 
382, sponsored by the member for Mississauga South.
<P>
	We as as government are asking people to make significant 
sacrifices in the name of deficit reduction. I believe most 
Canadians understand the seriousness of the situation and are 
prepared to make these sacrifices.
<P>
	While they may grumble about taxation, Canadians in general 
are quite prepared to contribute a fair portion of their income in 
return for the services they want. They have made it very clear the 
services they want include medical care, solid infrastructure and 
transportation systems, safe communities and income security for 
all Canadians.
<P>
	However, I also believe they are fed up with seeing their hard 
earned money wasted over the years in ways they never counted on. 
They want us to spend their money the same way they spend it, 
carefully, thoughtfully, with due consideration of what it took to 
earn the money in the first place. That expectation is fair because 
after all it is their money.
<P>
	The public is watching us very closely. When it hears of lavish 
spending or wasted funds at any level of government, federal, 
provincial or municipal, its confidence in all governments is 
eroded.
<P>
	We as a government recognized this right from the start and have 
taken many steps to ensure that taxpayers get their money's worth. 
This is extremely important and I urge all members to keep up their 
vigilance in this area.
<P>
	When people see government as a black hole, sucking their 
money in and giving nothing back, they tend to wonder why they 
should pay tax on that kitchen renovation or that load of gravel.
<P>
<B>(1825 )</B>
<P>
	For many individuals and businesses participating in the 
underground economy it has become a convenient way not only to 
avoid paying taxes but to take some small action against what they 
see as governments they do not trust placing unfair burdens on 
them.
<P>
	They may feel their financial situation justifies their actions. It 
may be several years since their last pay raise or even their last 
regular pay cheque. They may have lost their previous job because 
of government cutbacks or downsizing. They may feel the tax 
system is too complex or unfair.
<P>
	Whatever the reason, it is of paramount importance they come to 
understand the damage they are doing to the economy of the 
country and ultimately to themselves. Estimates on the size of the 
underground economy vary widely depending on the methodology 
used from $20 billion to $140 billion a year.
<P>
	Even if one were to assume the lower figure is more correct, that 
is still $20 billion not available to governments to provide 
necessary services for their taxpayers.
<P>
	Underground economic activity creates unfair competition for 
honest businesses, jobs are lost and honest taxpayers are forced to 
pay more than their fair share of taxes, and once again they feel 
cheated. It is a vicious cycle and people must understand the 
underground economy makes victims of us all.
<P>
	We in the House as well as all Canadians must consider the real 
cost of underground economic activity. This cost is huge. It shows 
up in reduced essential services, taxes that are higher than they 
would otherwise be, unfair competition and a reduced standard of 
living for the honest taxpayer.
<P>
	How does the underground economy affect the legitimate 
business person trying to be competitive? Right from the start 
honest business people are at a competitive disadvantage because 
they cannot offer a customer the same deal offered by someone 
who will do the work but not collect the taxes. The end result is that 
the legitimate business person faces unfair competition and jobs 
are lost.
<P>
	The consumer who takes the lower price and pays cash must 
understand that he or she is cheating the system and becoming 
party to the evasion of taxes. They must come to understand they 
are benefiting from the full range of government services but that 
by engaging in the underground economy they are no longer paying 
their fair share. They are taking part in a transaction that  
<P>

<B><A NAME="15325"> 15325 </A></B>
<P>
jeopardizes our health, education and other essential economic and 
social services.
<P>
	The motion before the House suggests the government educate 
the public and encourage its participation in addressing the 
problem. I support the suggestion wholeheartedly. Canadians need 
to know the facts about the seriousness of the underground 
economy and what can be done to reduce it.
<P>
	The government has recognized this essential truth and has made 
education a fundamental element of its action plan to address the 
underground economy.
<P>
	During the past year officials of Revenue Canada have been 
actively consulting with individuals and associations across 
Canada.
<P>
	With the Canadian Institute of Chartered Accountants, for 
example, the department established a working committee to 
investigate the causes of the underground economy, examine audit 
techniques and identify training that would assist in tracking down 
unreported or under reported income and identify opportunities for 
reducing the cost and administrative burden of compliance for 
businesses and individuals.
<P>
	These groups are taking the message of the risks of dealing in the 
underground economy back to their membership. The message is 
simple: Every citizen and every business has a role to play in 
eliminating the underground economy. Individuals can start by 
refusing to deal with businesses and tradespeople who ask for cash 
payments. Businesses can do their part by turning down demands 
to do work off the books.
<P>
<B>(1830)</B>
<P>
	The increased publicity given this problem by the minister of 
National Revenue is having an effect. The number of voluntary 
disclosures where people come forward to voluntarily correct their 
tax affairs has doubled in the past year. The member's suggestion 
that a limited amnesty on interest and penalties be offered to 
taxpayers who voluntarily declare income previously undeclared is 
a good one and will result in even more honest Canadians coming 
forward.
<P>
	I am confident that we are making progress in dealing with the 
underground economy and other forms of tax evasion. I applaud the 
member for Mississauga South for his efforts to stimulate 
discussion on the issue. I urge members of the House to carry the 
message back to their constituents.
<P>
	We in government have recognized that we must take positive 
action to restore respect, trust and confidence in government and 
we are doing our part. I urge members to talk to their constituents 
about the underground economy, its seriousness and how it can be 
reduced. I urge Canadians to do their part to discourage this 
harmful activity.
<P>

[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	A motion to adjourn the House under Standing Order 38 deemed 
to have been moved.
<P>
<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="GOVERNMENTSUBSIDIES">GOVERNMENT SUBSIDIES</A></H4>
	<B>Mr. Antoine Dubé (Lévis, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I wish to go back 
to an answer I deem unsatisfactory which the Minister of Human 
Resources Development gave to a two-part question on 
unemployment insurance and training I put to him during question 
period on September 28.
<P>
	In his reply, the Minister of Human Resources Development 
made a comment which I would describe as somewhat improper in 
that he responded, not accepting my position with respect to 
training, that:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>-there is something the matter with the hon. member. I have a letter he wrote 
me asking for my support in a youth project sponsored by the federal 
government in his riding. I am very pleased to say I would certainly like to give 
him the assurance of supporting that project if he can give me the assurance of 
supporting the no vote on October 30.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	<B>Mr. Crête:</B> Unacceptable.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dubé:</B> As my colleague for Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup 
suggests, totally unacceptable because this shows a contempt for 
democracy.
<P>
	Yet the Minister of Human Resources Development is an 
experienced parliamentarian. A parliamentarian who has been in 
opposition for at least nine years. For nine years, and I have read 
and reread many of his speeches, he has been severely critical of 
the accomplishments of the Conservative government, as it was his 
role to do. I find no fault with that. When he was in the opposition, 
it was his role to criticize government programs.
<P>
	In this case, he refers to one letter, yet the next day the 
parliamentary secretary indicated to me that there was a second 
letter on two projects. As for the projects in  question, there was a 
project sponsored by Ateliers Jeunesse in my riding, a project 
<P>

<B><A NAME="15326"> 15326 </A></B>
<P>
called JET created to set up a part time job bank for high school 
students. It had nothing whatsoever to do with training.
<P>
<B>(1835)</B>
<P>
	The next day, the parliamentary secretary, substituting for the 
minister, mentioned another project connected with Youth Service 
Canada. Sure, I criticized Youth Service Canada, but this was for an 
incubator program. My complaints about Youth Service Canada 
were about the fact that the training components contradicted of 
Quebec's policy on manpower training.
<P>
	I was consistent in supporting the project submitted under this 
program because there was no manpower training component. The 
emphasis was more on an incubator program to help young people 
create their own business.
<P>
	I would have a lot more to say about this, but since there is so 
little time, I would say it is a matter of principle. As I see it, this is 
blackmail, an attack on our democratic system.
<P>
	I was elected by the people of my riding to represent them. That 
was my purpose when I sent projects to the minister for his 
approval. Now he asks me to support the No side, and if I do, he 
will approve this project. That is unacceptable.
<P>
	If it were an isolated incident, I would say it was just a slip of the 
tongue. In that case, the minister should have said: ``Listen, I spoke 
without thinking. That is not what I meant''. But the next day he 
was not in the House, and he let his parliamentary secretary answer 
instead, who proceeded to criticize my criticism of this program.
<P>
	I think that is unacceptable, especially in the present 
circumstances when comments of this kind keep cropping up. For 
instance, in a secret document prepared by Industry Canada, 
companies were listed according to their political allegiance, to see 
whether the project should be funded.
<P>
	I think that is unacceptable. I am making this speech today 
within the precincts of the House of Commons, where we meet as 
democratically elected representatives. I invoke the right we have 
in this House to demand that this be rectified, that members 
opposite on the government side stop their blackmail, because we 
will not tolerate this.
<P>
	Thank you, Mr. Speaker, for giving me this opportunity. It seems 
no one will bother to respond. Very democratic indeed.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ronald J. Duhamel (Parliamentary Secretary to 
President of the Treasury Board, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, first of all I 
would like to point out that the Minister of Human Resources 
Development was rather surprised at the support shown by the hon. 
member for Lévis for a Youth Service Canada project in his riding.
<P>
	This was the same member who had previously said Youth 
Service Canada was an invasion of provincial jurisdiction. It is 
therefore difficult to account for the enthusiastic support shown by 
the hon. member, considering his opinion of federal initiatives.
<P>
	Nevertheless, as the Secretary of State for Training and Youth 
pointed out to the hon. member in a letter dated September 5, 1995, 
the proposal is still quite interesting, but we need a few details.
<P>
	The promoter, Alliance-Jeunesse, was asked to revise its 
proposal, and the Youth Service Canada secretariat offered to send 
one of its representatives to provide assistance. As soon as we 
receive the proposal, I can assure the hon. member it will be 
processed immediately.
<P>
	Meanwhile, I think the hon. member will be pleased to hear that 
the minister has already provided a great deal in the way of 
employment assistance in his riding. In fact, according to the latest 
figures, those available for 1994-95, assistance for residents in the 
riding of Lévis totalled $7.7 million. That is a very substantial 
amount.
<P>
	This would seem to argue against the assumption of the hon. 
member that the minister allocates funding on the basis of the way 
the member for the riding voted or intends to vote.
<P>
	Clearly the hon. member's allegation has no basis in fact.

	<B>Mr. Geoff Regan (Halifax West, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, today in 
question period I asked a question about the share of spinoffs from 
Canadian international development aid that goes to Quebec. From 
what I have heard over the past few weeks in question period from 
Bloc Quebecois members, it seems they cannot decide whether or 
not they want the federal government to spend money in Quebec.
<P>
	The Bloc claims that Quebec would be better off outside Canada 
in a separate country. However the facts and even the reports put 
out by the Parti Quebecois government in Quebec show that is not 
true. They show that Quebec is much better off inside Canada than 
it would be as a separate country.
<P>
	One example of those kinds of facts is the case of international 
development aid.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	For the year 1992-93, the last year for which provincial 
comparisons were made, nearly 30 per cent of IDA supplies came 
from Quebec. One third-which means 33.4 per cent-of 
registered consultants are from Quebec. More than one 
third-which means 36.3 per cent-of the contracts go to Quebec. 
The value of these 
<P>

<B><A NAME="15327"> 15327 </A></B>
<P>
contracts-a  little less than $100 million-represents about one 
third or 33.1 per cent of the national total.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	It is very clear that with approximately 25 per cent or a little less 
of the population of Canada or about one-third of these contracts in 
relation to international aid, Quebec does very well under the 
CIDA programs and under programs relating to international aid.
<P>
	On the other hand, in the past at least, Atlantic Canada has done 
so well. Atlantic Canada in recent years has received less than its 
share of international development aid spinoffs. We are seeking 
improvements in that regard.
<P>
	I had the pleasure of serving on the foreign affairs committee 
until recently when I was moved to the justice committee. Last 
spring we had the president of the Canadian International 
Development Agency before our committee on the estimates. I had 
the opportunity to question her about a number of things. One of 
the matters I asked her about was the share of development aid 
contracts and spinoffs going to the Atlantic region. She agreed that 
there needed to be work done to improve that number. She 
recognizes or should recognize that Atlantic Canadian companies 
can perform as well as anyone else. I think we showed during the 
Halifax G-7 meeting that Atlantic Canadians can do things as well 
as anyone in the rest of the country and in fact the rest of the world.
<P>
	I am looking forward to seeing the results of this year. I am 
hoping to see considerable improvements in regard to the level of 
the share of CIDA contracts going to Atlantic Canada.
<P>
	Atlantic Canada has other complaints in other areas where we 
feel we do not necessarily always get our share. However we 
believe very strongly in the country. I think the majority of 
Quebecers believe strongly in the country; they believe strongly in 
Canada. Like the majority of Quebecers, we believe we can 
continue to work together to work out our problems. We can 
continue to improve and build Canada, the best country in the 
world.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ronald J. Duhamel (Parliamentary Secretary to 
President of the Treasury Board, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, all of 
Canada's regions, without exception, benefit from the spinoffs of 
the official development assistance budget. The Government of 
Canada is not shy about drawing on the know-how of Canadians, 
who have both the necessary skills and the desire to contribute to 
the growth of a developing country.
<P>
	Quebec has a wealth of such skills. It has always been committed 
to helping the most disadvantaged peoples. The Government of 
Canada is fully aware of this and  regularly draws on this 
knowledge and goodwill in carrying out its assistance program.
<P>
	This is how a number of Quebec companies have obtained 
contracts from the Canadian government enabling them to export 
their know-how. Permit me to name a few whose contribution is 
well known. They include the Société Vitronov of Montreal, which 
this year won the award of excellence from the Canadian 
Exporters' Association for an innovative project in biotechnology 
in Morocco. Other companies include SR Télécom, ADS Associés, 
Tecsult, to mention but a few.
<P>
	The fact is that Quebec receives much of the spinoffs of 
Canadian ODA. Nearly 30 per cent of ODA procurement is done in 
Quebec. More than a third, 36.3 per cent, of contracts are 
concluded in Quebec.
<P>
	Of the 45,000 jobs created in Canada by official development 
assistance, over 12,000 are in ``la belle province''.
<P>
	Like other Canadians, Quebecers are opening up more and more 
to the world. They understand, as the century draws to a close, that 
the planetary stakes are so high we must pool our resources and 
strengthen existing partnerships.
<P>
	The ODA program tries to resolve problems that present a real 
threat to security, both in Canada and in the rest of the world. The 
Government of Canada intends to continue to draw on Quebec 
know-how in helping to make the world a richer and a fairer place.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Pursuant to Standing Order 
38, the motion to adjourn the House is now deemed to have been 
adopted. Accordingly, this House stands adjourned until tomorrow 
at 10 a.m., pursuant to Standing Order 24.
<P>
	(The House adjourned at 6.47 p.m.)
