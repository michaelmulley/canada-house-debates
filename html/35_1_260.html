	The House resumed from June 20, 1995 consideration of the 
motion that Bill C-275, an act respecting the protection and 
rehabilitation of endangered and threatened species, be read the 
second time and referred to a committee.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Lee Morrison (Swift Current-Maple 
Creek-Assiniboia, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, not long ago Bill S-7 was 
introduced through the back door by the government and passed 
into law without serious thought about its long term consequences.
<P>
	With Bill C-275 we again see Liberal environmental policy 
being brought to the House surreptitiously. Why do I say this? By a 
curious coincidence, a discussion document issued by Environment 
Canada last winter contains, almost verbatim, material now 
incorporated into Bill C-275.
<P>
	For example, section 9 provides for the prohibition or restriction 
of any activity deemed threatening to an endangered species on 
privately occupied land under federal jurisdiction or, with 
provincial consent, on any provincial lands.
<P>
	That clearly threatens grazing and timber leases in western 
Canada. Also, according to the definition in the bill of provincial 
lands it threatens any private lands registered under provincial law. 
So much for property rights.
<P>
	What evidence would the environmental bureaucrats need to 
designate a species as endangered and its habitat as protected? 
Pursuant to section 4 the minister would have the arbitrary 
authority to declare a species endangered. Page 26 of the discussion 
paper recommends that scientific uncertainty should not be used as 
a reason not to act.
<P>
	I will read briefly from this document:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>In cases when high quality scientific data are not available for a candidate 
species, methods involving estimation, inference and projection are acceptable. 
The effect of current or potential threats may be extrapolated into the future as 
long as it can be reasonably supported. If estimates about the status of a species 
vary, it is appropriate to choose the one that leads the listing in the highest risk 
category as a precaution.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	The sorry state of science in 1995 is that witch hunting 
bureaucrats are forthrightly recommending that the scientific 
method be discarded. I think the envirocrats are smoking 
something and it is not environmentally friendly.
<P>
	That pamphlet refers to public consultation work shops to be 
held in cities across Canada. Consultation with whom? Certainly 
not with the people most likely to be affected, Canada's farmers 
and ranchers and their municipal councils which brought this 
matter to my attention.
<P>
	This document and the bill spawned by it illustrate the typical 
attitude of Canadian urbanites that rural Canada is their 
playground, unfortunately cluttered up by all those quaint rustics 
who do nasty things like cultivating land and producing cheap, 
wholesome food for Canada and for the world.
<P>
	Much of rural Canada is lawfully owned by those who live on it. 
Urbanite nature lovers looking for pleasant places to have picnics, 
build fires, ride dirt bikes and dump their beer cans should consider 
the convenience of doing these things on the lawns of the hon. 
member for Davenport or the hon. member for Hamilton East. 
Perhaps then those members would have a more sympathetic 
attitude toward our much put upon farmers.
<P>
	Farmers do not have much clout in today's Canada. They made 
up 30 per cent of the population in 1931 but account for only 3.2 
per cent today. They are the real endangered species because in the 
eyes of Liberal politicians and bureaucratic whiz kids they are 
irrelevant.
<P>
	Rural people are as powerless to stop this bill as they were to 
stop gun control Bill C-68 which the House shoved down their 
protesting throats last June with no significant input from them. 
With their feeble numbers they do not matter to a government 
preoccupied with the electoral map. Like Napoleon, Liberals 
measure the importance of a group by the size of its battalions.
<P>
	Legislation of this nature can be counterproductive because it 
casts Environment Canada in an adversarial role. For example, any 
farmer with burrowing owls in the  pasture would have to be 
demented to report their presence to anyone. I do not think that we 
in Canada will ever reach the point that has been reported in 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16512"> 16512 </A></B>
<P>
Oregon where it is claimed that some woodlot owners shoot spotted 
owls on sight. When someone's livelihood is threatened, who 
knows?
<P>
	Most rural Canadians, especially ranchers in the west, have been 
very good stewards of the land and most are appreciative of the 
wildlife which sometimes grazes on their crops and competes with 
them for native forage. As a result, wildlife populations in the rural 
west, especially in my riding, are immeasurably larger than they 
were 50 or even 20 years ago.
<P>
<B>(1110 )</B>
<P>
	Canadians like to poke fun at the endangered species lunacies of 
our friends south of the border. It has been 17 years since the 
Tellico dam project in Tennessee was stopped to protect the habitat 
of the snail darter, a species remarkably similar to scores of others 
which, in the fullness of geological time, has become extinct. The 
silliness took place because under the stringent conditions of the 
U.S. endangered species act the regulators had no choice.
<P>
	If that act had been literally applied the deliberate international 
extinction of the smallpox virus could have led to fines or jail 
sentences for the public health officials who so wantonly and 
cruelly destroyed the species.
<P>
	Tens of millions of dollars have been spent down there to 
preserve the habitat of various rodents, including the 
Choctawahatchee beach mouse in Florida and the kangaroo rat in 
California.
<P>
	When the U.S. fish and wildlife service learned of the presence 
of kangaroo rats on 800 acres of Cindy Domenigonis' California 
farm it would not allow her to work her land for three years. That is 
the direction in which Canada will be heading if this so-called 
private member's bill becomes law.
<P>
	Bill C-275 epitomizes the Liberal propensity to regulate, control 
and run roughshod over individuals who do not have big battalions 
at their command. I oppose it and I urge anyone who believes in 
sound science, effective conservationism and the rights of rural 
people to oppose it as well.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Andrew Telegdi (Waterloo, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, if there is 
doubt whether a species is going to be extinct then we want to make 
sure we make the right decisions and err on the side of caution. I 
am pleased to speak on Bill C-275, sponsored by the member for 
Davenport, the chair of the environment committee.
<P>
	The paddlefish, the swift fox and the blackfooted ferret have one 
thing in common: they no longer exist in the wild in Canada. The 
Labrador duck, the sea mink and the blue walleye have one thing in 
common: they no longer exist at all.
<P>
	The eastern cougar, the salish sucker, the right whale, the white 
prairie gentian and the spotted owl are all endangered in Canada. 
The white-headed woodpecker, the blue ash, the western Atlantic 
harbour porpoise and the spiny softshell turtle are threatened. The 
polar bear, the eastern bluebird, the orange spotted sunfish, the 
pugnose minnow, the prairie rose, the blue whale and the trumpeter 
swan are vulnerable.
<P>
	Two hundred and forty-four species of wild fauna and flora are at 
risk in our country. They suffer from loss of critical habitat, 
overharvesting, the introduction of foreign species, climate change 
and contamination from toxic substances.
<P>
	The time has clearly come for the federal government to set 
legislation to protect endangered species. The protection of 
endangered species is the responsibility of all sectors of our society 
and all citizens in our country. We need legislation in which all 
Canadians feel a vested interest.
<P>
	Legislation would call for regulations on the killing, wounding, 
capturing, collecting or distributing of endangered plants, fish, 
mammals and embryos. Legislation would also call for Canadian 
controls on the buying, selling and international trafficking of 
endangered species.
<P>
	Canadians want us to throw the book at anyone who tries to 
make a fast buck from illegally importing or exporting endangered 
species.
<P>
	The committee on the status of endangered wildlife in Canada, 
an arm's length scientific body, would assess species at risk on an 
annual basis. The Minister of the Environment would be required 
to establish a list of the species at risk in areas of federal 
jurisdiction. Response statements outlining planned actions would 
be mandatory. Recovery plans if required would be prepared within 
two weeks for endangered species and within three years for 
threatened species.
<P>
<B>(1115)</B>
<P>
	Legislation would also permit emergency measures to be taken 
to conserve and protect species requiring the equivalent to 
emergency ward treatment. Legislation would authorize the 
Minister of the Environment to establish funding for conservation 
agreements with other governments, organizations and private 
landlords in partnership efforts to preserve endangered species. 
Legislation would also authorize tough enforcement and severe 
penalties.
<P>
	The federal government has a responsibility to set a benchmark 
for effective endangered species legislation in all of Canada's 
jurisdictions. That is not enough. We have a responsibility to work 
with the provinces, the territories and aboriginal people to ensure a 
comprehensive national approach to the protection of endangered 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16513"> 16513 </A></B>
<P>
species in all parts of Canada. The federal  government is 
committed to doing its part in this shared enterprise.
<P>
	Acting alone, the federal government cannot come close to 
solving all the problems. I want to congratulate Manitoba, Ontario, 
Quebec and New Brunswick for already passing legislation on 
behalf of endangered species. I also want to congratulate Alberta 
which has committed to introduce legislation. I particularly want to 
congratulate wildlife experts, environmentalists, farmers, 
fishermen, foresters and the mining, pulp and paper and petroleum 
industries. They are the people on the front lines. They have acted 
in good faith despite their often divergent interests.
<P>
	Farmers and aboriginal people, the stewards of the land, must be 
treated fairly by the new legislation. The maximum number of 
Canadians must participate in protecting endangered species. We 
must have a national safety net for species at risk.
<P>
	As we move toward new endangered species legislation, a very 
large part of the credit must go to young Canadians. Students from 
throughout the country have kept the pressure on the government. 
They have collected petition after petition and they have sent to the 
Minister of the Environment thousands and thousands of carefully 
considered individual letters and drawings. We want the continued 
help and support of Canada's young people in preparing a final bill.
<P>
	The government's proposed legislation is already on 
Environment Canada's green lane on the Internet. We look forward 
to receiving feedback. We want the best possible law to achieve 
economic growth while preserving the diversity of genes, species 
and ecosystems that are the biological foundation of the world. We 
owe that to the endangered species. We owe that to future 
generations of Canadians.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Maria Minna (Beaches-Woodbine, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
am very pleased to support this bill today.
<P>
	Canada has a strong reputation in the world in matters of the 
environment. Indeed, Canada is involved in many international 
projects to help save the environment, the ecosystems and the 
species which allow people in the rest of the world to live decent 
lives in a rich environment.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	People in other countries are convinced that our actions show 
leadership in protecting the planet's biodiversity and species.
<P>
	The fact is that human beings with whom we share this earth are 
counting on Canada to show them the way. We must ensure that our 
actions are up to our reputation.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	People in the rest of the world have faith in Canada's 
fundamental decency and commitment to protecting planetary 
biodiversity. The world believes that we care and that we are 
acting. Quite frankly the world does not  know that Canada is one 
of the few countries in the world without federal legislation on 
endangered species.
<P>
	We have also been moved by Canada's kids. They know we do 
not have federal legislation and our children through their program 
``There Otter Be a Law'', have been a driving force in pushing 
Canada to do what it needs to do to protect endangered species.
<P>
	In my riding I have a classroom of kids who have worked very 
hard in the last year to protect the bowhead whale. They have sent 
petitions. They have written letters to the Minister of the 
Environment and to myself. I have made statements in the House. 
In fact today we have a sanctuary for the bowhead whale which is 
absolutely wonderful. These children have been extremely 
gratified. When I met with them this week in my riding to tell them 
what had happened, they felt they had had a wonderful impact on 
the issue. This is great for them because they learn a little about 
democracy. They also felt that it is possible to fight with facts and 
they felt very gratified. To me it was very worthwhile.
<P>
<B>(1120)</B>
<P>
	Since we began looking at protecting endangered species in 
federal legislation, we have received more than 5,000 individually 
written and carefully thought out letters from students calling for 
swift action to protect endangered species.
<P>
	The classes are in every riding. There is a class also in Iqaluit 
working on the issue of the bowhead whale. In fact the class in my 
riding is hooked up to the Internet to work with the class in Iqaluit 
to discuss the issue of endangered species.
<P>
	This is a wonderful way to connect Canadians across the country. 
These children are working for the future of their environment and 
their space. They have started now connecting and talking to one 
another in parts of the country. That is one of the most worthwhile 
things that we can encourage.
<P>
	Therefore we, as the adults of this country, can only but follow 
the example. We can no longer leave it up to the children.
<P>
	In every province and territory and in communities big and 
small, when we meet with public and high school students, they 
want to know what governments, businesses, environmentalists, 
farmers and scientists are doing to ensure a bright future for the 
beluga whale, the prairie rose, the porpoise, the whooping crane, 
the leatherback turtle and the polar bear.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	We all know, I think, that the future of endangered species has 
become a major concern not only for young people but also for the 
whole Canadian population. Canadians clearly understand federal 
responsibilities with respect to cod and halibut, as well as the 
economic consequences of the extinction of marine species.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16514"> 16514 </A></B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	In the last few weeks every Canadian watched as our skies filled 
with migratory birds leaving Canada. That rite of fall is part of 
Canada's psyche. Canadians love those species and regard them as 
part of what makes us a country.
<P>
	Canadians understand that when a species disappears, it 
disappears forever. They do not want Canada to be responsible for 
making that happen. Canadians understand that when a species 
disappears, the world loses and when the world loses, humanity 
loses.
<P>
	When we deal with the world's environment, we speak of 
common but differentiated responsibilities. We need to find a 
means to fulfil both our common responsibilities and our 
differentiated responsibilities.
<P>
	For our part, that means we must push for a solid, co-ordinated 
and co-operative national approach to ensure the survival of 
species. That is our common responsibility. It also means that the 
federal government must fulfil its differentiated responsibilities by 
showing legislative leadership in areas of federal jurisdiction.
<P>
	Every jurisdiction and every landowner have common but 
differentiated responsibilities. Each of us must show the maximum 
leadership possible in our own sphere. We do not need to point 
fingers at each other. We need to point ahead.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> There being no other members wishing to 
speak, the hon. member for Davenport is entitled under our rules to 
briefly sum up.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Charles Caccia (Davenport, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I wish to 
make two points. It is customary to thank colleagues on all sides of 
the House for their intervention, particularly the member for 
Bourassa, the member for Madawaska-Victoria, the member for 
Kindersley-Lloydminister, the member for Simcoe North, the 
member for Anjou-Rivière-des-Prairies, the member for 
London-Middlesex, the member for Comox-Alberni, the 
member for Laurentides, the member for Brandon-Souris, the 
member for Bramalea-Gore-Malton, the member for Brant, the 
member for Hastings-Frontenac-Lennox and Addington, the 
member for Beaches-Woodbine and the member for Waterloo.
<P>
	The intent of this bill is to protect biodiversity. That has been 
repeatedly indicated by those who want to accept what is its real 
intent. It aims as well as we can through words and proposed 
legislation to identify, protect and rehabilitate threatened and 
endangered species of flora and fauna.
<P>
<B>(1125 )</B>
<P>
	We cover the Canadian territory as we know it. We are well 
aware that nature does not respect political boundaries. There is a 
distinct responsibility for any government that flows mainly, as 
some members have  recognized, from the fact that Canada was the 
first nation to ratify the biodiversity convention in Rio de Janeiro in 
1992. As many members have quite rightly pointed out there is a 
responsibility at the provincial level, at the municipal level and at 
the federal level because of federal lands, interprovincial 
movements and international commitments.
<P>
	Therefore the three levels of government together could do 
something useful for the benefit of future generations and for the 
benefit of nature, wealth, for the benefit of le patrimoine, as they 
call it in French, in terms of protecting threatened and endangered 
species of flora and fauna.
<P>
	We know that species when severely threatened disappear from 
the face of the earth. There is a tremendous concern about the 
rapidity of this trend. This bill cannot go beyond the scope and the 
jurisdiction of the federal government. I would like to allay the 
fears of some members who had spoken earlier about this aspect.
<P>
	It must be stressed that the bill is being examined by Parliament 
at a time when the member for Lachine-Lac-Saint-Louis and the 
delegation he led to Indonesia has managed to bring Canada to the 
forefront of global efforts to protect biological diversity. As we all 
know, last week Canada won a competition in Jakarta. Montreal 
will be housing the United Nations secretariat on biological 
diversity. It is a tremendous development for which we are all 
proud and for which we would like to congratulate our colleague 
for Lachine-Lac-Saint-Louis.
<P>
	The secretariat will monitor the 1992 biological diversity 
convention. It should be remembered and stressed that it has been 
signed and even ratified by some 150 nations. We are moving 
ahead with other nations, as well we should. The goal of the 
protection of the earth's plant and animal species is becoming an 
urgent item on the agenda.
<P>
	To conclude, I would like to again thank the members of the 
House who have participated in the debate and have endorsed the 
initiative which aims to ensure strong federal legislation on 
endangered species and preserve biological diversity as it is 
prescribed by the convention ratified in 1992. It aims at showing 
respect for other living organisms and ensures that we maintain a 
rich and diverse ecosystem for the benefit of present and future 
generations.

<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="DEPARTMENTOFHUMANRESOURCESDEVELOPMENTACT">DEPARTMENT OF HUMAN RESOURCES 
DEVELOPMENT ACT</A></H3>
	The House resumed from November 10 consideration of the 
motion that Bill C-96, an act to establish the Department of Human 
Resources Development and to  amend and repeal certain related 
acts, be read the second time and referred to a committee; and of 
the amendment.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ian McClelland (Edmonton Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I would like to take this opportunity to put before the 
people of Canada what I consider to be one of the most 
disconcerting aspects of the financial situation our country finds 
itself in today.
<P>
	Make no mistake that what is happening in Canada today is a 
result of circumstance. It has far more to do with circumstance than 
it has to do with ideology. We are talking about how to go about 
getting the country out of the financial mess it is in. As everyone 
knows, we are in a financial mess federally and provincially.
<P>
<B>(1205)</B>
<P>
	As was so clearly illustrated in the <I>Globe and Mail</I> on Saturday 
in an excellent article on individual and family debt, Canadians by 
and large are in a financial mess personally. The <I>Globe and Mail</I> 
article stated that the average family consumer debt in Canada 
equals 88 per cent of disposable income. This is up from 
approximately 60 per cent 10 years ago.
<P>
	The net result is that our federal debt is up, our provincial debt is 
up, the debt in most municipalities is up and individual credit card 
debt is up. We find ourselves paying more and more for less and 
less. All we have to do is add zeros to see that the financial 
situations of the country and the provinces really are no different 
from the financial mess most citizens are in.
<P>
	I can speak with some assurance in saying that most Canadians 
and certainly those Canadians with whom I am familiar find 
themselves in an increasingly difficult financial situation. Our 
incomes have remained fairly stagnant but the cost of living has 
continued to escalate, even though it is escalating more slowly. We 
find ourselves being pinched and businesses are being pinched for 
profit.
<P>
	What do we do? How do we go about extricating ourselves from 
this horrid mess? One way the federal government is doing it is 
definitely a step in the right direction. It is amalgamating the 
various cash transfers from the federal government to the provinces 
which are paid in support of people. The transfers used to be 
separate under education, health, welfare, et cetera and were sent to 
the provinces with strings attached. These moneys which were 
transferred to the provinces had to go to individuals specifically 
and we could track where the money was going.
<P>
	That was changed in the last budget. Under the Canada health 
and social transfer act, this money was pooled and is being 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16516"> 16516 </A></B>
<P>
transferred to the provinces with strings attached. The strings are 
rather tenuous and not direct. It is pretty difficult for the federal 
government to tell the provinces: ``We gave you the money. These 
are the national standards to which you must adhere in order to get 
the money''. I do not think the federal government  has any right, 
responsibility or place to send this money to the provinces with 
strings attached. Who does it think it is kidding? It is our money 
anyway and it is just being recycled by the federal government.
<P>
	At any rate, the Liberal government opposite finds itself in the 
situation where it will be transferring to the provincial 
governments and then to the people, $7 billion less this year than it 
did last year. If we think that is tough, wait until the next budget. 
We still have at least $20 billion to go in the reduction of transfers 
before we get to a neutral position and we stop going further into 
the hole. This is the first scratch, the first attempt at fiscal 
responsibility in the country.
<P>
	Some provinces in Canada, most notably Quebec, have yet to 
cross that rubicon. Quebec is still going along blissfully without 
considering its provincial debt which is $5.7 billion in deficit this 
year. Just wait until Quebec begins to address that problem.
<P>
	We recognize the necessity of addressing the debt problem 
responsibly on federal, provincial and personal levels. How do we 
go about making sure that the most vulnerable people in our society 
are protected? That is what I would like to speak to. There has been 
built in this foundation the necessity for objectively and 
realistically looking at what we can do to ensure that those who are 
the weakest and the most vulnerable are protected and looked after 
in the true Canadian spirit. This is one of the values which is 
pan-Canadian, a value we all share regardless of our political 
persuasion.
<P>
<B>(1210)</B>
<P>
	We share the value that the weakest and most vulnerable in our 
society should be and will be protected. We are also very much of 
the understanding that the most privileged in our society are going 
to have to pay a premium to ensure that those who are the weakest 
are protected. That is the way it works and that is how we get social 
order. The only way we are going to have a society that works is if 
we are prepared to share. I do not think anybody seriously 
questions that.
<P>
	What is being seriously questioned is whether or not people have 
a right to say: ``We have always done it this way and therefore, we 
are always going to continue to get it this way''. We are going to 
have to change things dramatically in order to make sure we are 
able to live within our means nationally. Recognizing and 
understanding this and accepting the fact that we are going to 
accept change, that we are going to have to work with it, how do we 
go about making sure that those who are least capable of looking to 
this change and the most vulnerable are protected?
<P>
	I have looked at this very carefully over the last few months as a 
member of the Standing Committee on Human Rights and the 
Status of Disabled Persons. The government has seriously fallen 
down in its fiduciary responsibility to make sure that the most 
vulnerable  people are at least to a modicum consulted before 
change happens and that they feel some sense of confidence that 
when this necessary change takes place they will be protected.
<P>
	To my knowledge, the government has not convened one single 
solitary meeting with the provincial governments responsible for 
delivering the programs to those persons with disabilities; people 
in wheelchairs, people confined to their beds, people who cannot 
get around, people with learning disabilities, people with mental or 
physical disabilities, motion disabilities. These people who are the 
most vulnerable have not been consulted through the provinces 
which are responsible for delivering the care and the services.
<P>
	The national Parliament has said that in the total basket under the 
Canada health and social transfer $7 billion less is being 
transferred to the provinces than was transferred last year. That 
money has to go to education, welfare, a whole myriad of purposes. 
One of the purposes is persons with disabilities.
<P>
	People with disabilities already feel vulnerable. Imagine how 
people with disabilities feel when they see that funding is going to 
be reduced by such a substantial amount. They are the most 
vulnerable of the people in the categories to which the funding is 
going to be reduced.
<P>
	The federal government has not done a thing. There has not been 
one meeting with the provinces to say that it recognizes the 
relationship between the federal government, which is responsible 
for funding, and the provincial governments, which also fund, but 
in addition to delivering the programs deliver the bulk of the 
money necessary to support these programs. How do you suppose 
vulnerable people feel if the federal government has not convened 
one meeting with the provinces to say: ``We recognize there are 
changes coming in the way we fund these programs. Things of 
necessity are going to change, but let us work together with the 
consumer groups in the disabled community to make sure the 
people are protected''.
<P>
	Over the last couple of months witness after witness after 
witness have come to the committee. They said that because of 
funding cuts there are people in our country today who are mobility 
impaired, who cannot get out of bed by themselves, and have been 
lying in bed in their own waste for hours and hours and hours. 
There is no funding for people to come in and help them change 
their linen or even get to the bathroom. This is happening in our 
country.
<P>
<B>(1215)</B>
<P>
	We as parliamentarians have a fiduciary responsibility. How we 
treat the least among us is a measure of the worth of society, the 
greatness of society. We must look to the most vulnerable people in 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16517"> 16517 </A></B>
<P>
society and ask how we  are treating them and, if we were in that 
position, how we would want to be treated.
<P>
	When speaking to people in wheelchairs in the disabled 
community we realize that any one of us as Canadians could be in a 
wheelchair tomorrow morning. We need to think about how it 
would be for us if we were in that position. We must give some 
extra thought to the absolute necessity of reducing funding to 
people and transfers to people from all orders of government so 
that we protect the weakest and the most vulnerable among us.
<P>
	I appreciate the opportunity to put these comments on the record.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dennis J. Mills (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Industry, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the opportunity to 
participate in the debate on Bill C-96, an act to establish the 
Department of Human Resources Development.
<P>
	I was quite taken by the member's remarks about looking out for 
the most disadvantaged. I have stated repeatedly in the House the 
essence of government. We in the Chamber should not be spending 
most of our time ignoring the advantaged because they form a very 
important part of the economic equation of the country. However, 
we in the House are supposed to be the people who speak for the 
most disadvantaged. That is the essence of why we are in the 
Chamber.
<P>
	I was touched when I heard the member for Edmonton 
Southwest talk with caring, sensitivity and compassion about the 
most disadvantaged in the country. I should like to put a question to 
him and expand my thoughts that are driven by the set of core 
values of caring, compassion and approachability. I am sure the 
member believes the same set of principles should apply to young 
people who are out of work or anyone who is out of work in the 
country.
<P>
	Could the hon. member consider building on that same 
traditional value system by saying that maybe as a government at 
this moment in time our focus has been too much on the right wing 
agenda, too much on the cutting, the slashing and the tight fiscal 
framework to a point where we have basically lost sight of the most 
disadvantaged? In this case I focus on people who do not have the 
dignity of getting up in the morning and going to a job, of having 
enough money in their pockets to pay for their kid's hockey stick or 
their daughter's clothes or food. Perhaps as a Chamber we should 
review our right wing agenda and go back to looking after the 
disadvantaged in a more aggressive way.
<P>
<B>(1220 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. McClelland:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member 
opposite for the question. I assure everyone here that it was not a 
set up question. I appreciate the question because it strikes at the 
heart of what is the difference between members on this side and 
members  opposite. We virtually share all the same values but we 
do not share how we go about achieving them.
<P>
	From discussions with members opposite I know the vast 
majority of representatives in the House share common values. 
How do we go about providing the kind of society the hon. member 
for Broadview-Greenwood is talking about? How do we get 
young people working? Why is it that kids cannot play hockey? 
Why cannot their parents cannot afford it even if both parents are 
working? Why is it so expensive? How do we go about ensuring 
that everyone can participate in our wonderful nation?
<P>
	The root cause of the problem can be found in <I>The Canadian 
Global Almanac</I> for 1996. It shows the per capita accumulated 
federal debt. In 1975 it was $849 and the interest per capita was 
$139. Today, 20 years later, the debt per capita is $17,381 and the 
interest per capita is $1,299. If we multiply that by four members 
of the family, it does not take very long to realize that we do not 
have any money.
<P>
	We could then consider provincial debts and at our credit card 
debts as families. It costs 15 per cent, 16 per cent or 17 per cent to 
service credit card debt. We have the situation where most of us as 
a country, as provinces and as individuals are using today's income 
to pay for what we have already consumed in the past. Therefore 
instead of the money being used to purchase goods and services it 
is being used to service debts.
<P>
	It makes us wonder when we read the paper today and see that all 
five of our national banks have record profits. They have $5 billion 
worth of profit. How do they get that money? They get it from the 
interest on the debt. The debt goes up and the interest goes up. The 
amount of interest goes up in real terms even if the rates do not 
increase. The banks get richer. The rich get richer and the poor get 
poorer.
<P>
	People who are able to make financial investments get more 
money through investing in passive capital investments where 
there is no risk than people who risk everything they have to start a 
new business. They put every nickel they have including their 
homes and everything else into a business to get it going. And what 
happens? They pay tax after tax after tax.
<P>
	I sat next to a person travelling from Vancouver to Ottawa 
yesterday in an aeroplane. He is in the garment business. He is also 
in the sports and recreation business. He has a fitness business. He 
is getting out of the fitness business. He said the problem was that 
it cost $33 a month for people to come to work out. People do not 
even have $33 a month that they can spend. It has to be dragged out 
of them. People just do not have any money any more.
<P>
	Why do we not have the ability to create employment, especially 
entrance employment for young people, generation X? If they are 
not gainfully employed they  will waste their time, get involved in 
crime and all other social ills. It is that people do not have enough 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16518"> 16518 </A></B>
<P>
money to invest in anything other than necessities. Therefore 
businesses cannot sell, manufacturers cannot manufacture and 
shippers cannot ship.
<P>
	Until we deal with the root cause of the problem, which is that 
we are all broke because we are paying interest on money we have 
already spent for goods and services, we will not get ourselves out 
of this mess. We cannot borrow our way out of this mess. If 
spending money we do not have worked, everybody would have 
five jobs.
<P>
<B>(1225 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mills (Broadview-Greenwood):</B> Mr. Speaker, I should 
like to pursue this thought with the member because I obviously do 
not see it the way he does.
<P>
	I have a difficult time understanding the derivatives section of 
the Royal Bank of Canada. I use the expression its private casino 
where they play with derivatives and sometimes even bet against 
the Canadian dollar. I have a difficult time understanding how the 
derivatives section of a bank can find an average of $30 billion a 
day to play with and make money. That is one bank. It is said that 
the derivatives game in the world now involves a trillion dollars a 
day. This money is being pushed. It is paper pushing all over the 
world. There is no production related to that trillion dollars a day.
<P>
	I find it difficult to accept that our largest bank can find $30 
billion a day to gamble in pushing paper alone. Yet the small 
business float for a whole year for the entire small business sector 
is only $28 billion. And I am only talking about one bank.
<P>
	The issue is not that we must eliminate waste and watch our 
spending. When we talk about debt we should not avoid talking 
about the tremendous assets in the country: our resources, our 
water, our infrastructure and our educated people. We are talking 
about human resources. Our human resources are recognized as the 
best on the planet. We have to measure that into the economic 
equation.
<P>
	Would the member not agree that when we talk about getting at 
root causes we must talk about who is controlling all the capital, 
who is pushing all this capital around the world and preventing a 
sufficient amount of it from being distributed into the economy 
where there is true production in the manufacture of goods and 
services? Does the member not think that is a debate we should 
have in the House?
<P>
	<B>Mr. McClelland:</B> Mr. Speaker, I do not pretend to know enough 
about the derivatives market or international finance to be able to 
respond thoughtfully to the question.
<P>
	I have a general sense of unease and malaise about the lifeblood 
of our economy. I do not know it well enough  to speak to it so I 
will not. However I know what makes business work, particularly 
small business, entrepreneurial business, because that is my 
background. What makes people start a business, what makes 
people risk a business, what makes people get up in the morning 
and provide employment, is a chance to make some money, a 
chance to be one's own boss.
<P>
	I was out with one of my sons on the weekend. I said: ``Always 
do the best job you can when you are working. You owe that to your 
employer. But you will never get rich working for somebody else. 
If you want to get rich you have to work for yourself''. Not 
everybody will do that, but one will never get rich working for 
somebody else or being a member of Parliament, for that matter.
<P>
	What makes people get up in the morning, risk everything they 
have in life and start a new business is the expectation that they will 
make some money at it. The problem is that it is getting more and 
more difficult to make money at business or even to do it. Once one 
has established a business and sells it what happens? How much of 
the money does one get to keep after paying all the taxes? It is 
relatively little.
<P>
	We can look at the difference between passive investment, for 
instance investing in bank stock or investing finances with no risk, 
and investing in an entrepreneur with a lot of risk. What do most 
people do? In my case I could make a decision to invest in stocks, 
bonds or mutual funds at virtually no risk or I could make a 
decision to invest in people, which is high risk. I can invest in the 
people. Because of my tax situation I get virtually no return on it. I 
can invest in stocks and bonds and get essentially the same return 
but I have no risk.
<P>
<B>(1230)</B>
<P>
	Investing in people is by far the best way to go. It is what we 
need to do for our country. It is what I am going to do as well. I 
have a situation right here in Ottawa. A person who works with me 
in my office is from Edmonton. She is unilingual. She has moved to 
Hull. She lives and is working in Chelsea. She has taken over as a 
unilingual anglophone a little cafe, the Cafe Meech, in Hull near 
the Gatineau Park.
<P>
	She has to raise the capital independently because it is not a very 
bankable deal. She has the fire in her belly that she is definitely 
going to make it work.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mills (Broadview-Greenwood):</B> Derivatives.
<P>
	<B>Mr. McClelland:</B> The point the hon. member for 
Broadview-Greenwood raised is so important to what we are to 
do as a country to get people back to work, for first time 
employment for all our young people so that they have something 
to look forward to, so that they feel part of the community, so that 
they have something rather than standing on the sidelines looking 
in.
<P>
	The debate the hon. member opposite has suggested is a good 
one. It is timely. How do we go about doing that?  How do we go 
about getting someone to risk their capital, to get their idea in gear, 
to get that sense of drive and ambition so they will start a little 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16519"> 16519 </A></B>
<P>
widget manufacturing business or a service and will hire one or two 
people?
<P>
	That is the way we will get the country working. That is the way 
we will get unemployment insurance premiums down. That is the 
way we will take off the dependence on government and make the 
country work. We have to re-establish that sense of purpose and 
entrepreneurialism and zeal on a personal basis. country.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The time has expired for questions and 
comments, as have the five hours of debate. We are now into 
10-minute speeches.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jesse Flis (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Foreign Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I remind the House that we 
are debating Bill C-96 but we are also debating the amendment to 
the bill put forward by the hon. member for Mercier.
<P>
	That party objects that the bill does not give full and alone 
jurisdiction over human resources development. That phrase 
frightens me. Again it shows that the official opposition is pushing 
its hidden agenda of separating so that it has full powers, full 
control over human resources and other things.
<P>
	I draw the attention of the official opposition to recent post 
referendum polls, which state that 61 per cent of Quebecers want to 
remain in Canada and 78 per cent of Quebecers want to see major 
changes to the way the Canadian federation works. It is through 
bills such as this that hopefully through provincial federal 
co-operation we can get more people to work.
<P>
	Last week I had a town hall meeting. There was a qualified 
veterinarian in the audience. He was from another country. Sadly, 
he is on social assistance. He does not have a job in Canada.
<P>
	Two weeks ago I saw a switch from the official opposition to the 
Reform Party when the member for Calgary Southeast debated this 
bill and said very little about it. She talked about pensions and 
everything else.
<P>
	I was pleased to hear the member for Edmonton Southeast at 
least talking about the purpose of government being to help the 
most vulnerable people in society. He talked about the disabled.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> I am sure the member meant Edmonton 
Southwest. The member for Edmonton Southeast is the chair 
occupant and does not participate in debate. This small correction 
will not come out of the member's time.
<P>
<B>(1235 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Flis:</B> Thank you for the correction, Mr. Speaker.
<P>
	I was pleased that the member talked about the disabled because 
it was this government in the early  1980s that set up a special task 
force across the country to look at how obstacles could be removed 
for the disabled. The work of that task force is benefiting many 
handicapped people today. By removing the obstacles they are no 
longer handicapped.
<P>
	The Reform Party criticizes the bill because it does not solve any 
problems with the Canada pension plan, for example. We all agree 
there are problems with the plan. The Reform Party knows 
perfectly well the government takes these problems seriously. I 
object very strongly to the Reform Party's suggestion that the 
Canada pension plan is about to collapse.
<P>
	The government is preparing a working paper which will set out 
options for reforming the CPP. We will present those options to the 
provinces which share responsibility in this area. With their 
goodwill we will negotiate a new and better plan which will meet 
the needs of seniors not only today but in the future.
<P>
	Bill C-96 is not about pension plans. It is an administrative bill 
to establish a department. The Reform Party then takes advantage 
of this debate to decry the federal plan for gender equality. We 
make no apology for advancing women's equality by examining 
initiatives related to economics, autonomy, poverty, employment, 
education and training. However, this has nothing to do with Bill 
C-96 which is an administrative bill to establish a department.
<P>
	The Reform Party members criticizes this bill because it does 
not radically transform post-secondary education into its strange 
vision of the future. However, it knows full well that Bill C-96 is 
not about changes to post-secondary education at all. It is an 
administrative bill to establish a department.
<P>
	The Reform Party criticizes Bill C-96 because it does not change 
the Constitution and prevent the federal government from fulfilling 
its responsibilities for labour market programs. Even if we wanted 
to do that, the Reform Party knows full well that one does not 
amend the Constitution through an administrative bill to establish a 
department.
<P>
	The Reform Party and Bloc Quebecois criticize the bill for 
intruding into provincial jurisdictions and then complain that the 
bill does not radically alter areas such as education where the 
provinces do have jurisdiction. Opposition knows full well this has 
nothing to do with Bill C-96.
<P>
	Opposition members can try to side track the debate on this bill, 
throw up smoke screens and parade their own pet theories on every 
issue under the sun, but lets us keep one thing clear. It has been said 
many times that Bill C-96 deals with consequential amendments to 
a variety of legislation related to the reorganization of government 
departments. That is all it does. It is not intended to change the 
world.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16520"> 16520 </A></B>
<P>
	This does not mean the world does not need changing but let 
us keep a proper perspective on the task at hand. The task at hand 
is providing Canadians with a department that supplies them with 
essential programs and services, a department that has been 
remarkably successful over the past few years in bringing our 
labour market and social programs out of the past and into the 
21st century.
<P>
	Bill C-96 is about the department that launched one of the 
biggest grassroots consultations on social programs ever seen in 
this country, with more than 100,000 Canadians taking part.
<P>
	It is this department that made the first major changes to the 
Canada student loans program, changes the Reform Party seems to 
have ignored. As a result of these changes over 13,000 high school 
students are getting special grants to pursue their education. One 
hundred thousand underemployed graduates, twice as many as 
before, are getting expanded interest relief. The program is costing 
taxpayers less while students are getting a better service.
<P>
	It is this department that is pioneering an approach that puts 
programs and services into the hands of local communities with 
tools and resources that can be customized by communities to meet 
their needs.
<P>
	It is this department that is building the most decentralized 
service delivery network in any government moving from 450 to 
700 points of service, moving it to rural communities across 
Canada; people can get help where they live.
<P>
	It is this department that is providing Canada's seniors with four 
times as many offices where they can get personal service. This is 
what Bill C-96 is about. It would be useful if the Reform Party and 
the Bloc Quebecois would talk about the bill and look at what is 
really going on in the department.
<P>
<B>(1240)</B>
<P>
	When the member for Calgary Southeast complains that the bill 
does not eliminate overlap and duplication between federal and 
provincial services, she should look at the real progress the 
department is making in building new partnerships with the 
provinces, with the private sector, with communities across the 
country. Look at what we are doing in the real world; the work with 
provinces on pilot projects that test the joint delivery of federal and 
provincial programs. These are designed specifically to improve 
efficiency and eliminate overlap and duplication.
<P>
	Let us get constructive and talk about moving forward that 
effort. Let us encourage the provinces to join with us in the new 
agreements that will clarify roles and responsibilities, as we have 
invited them to do. Let us look at the very essence of Bill C-96, the 
focus on a better integration of programs and services that is so 
critical to  this effort. By passing Bill C-96 without delay we can 
move on to address these concerns more efficiently.
<P>
	Let us not hold up change on the pretext that change is not 
happening fast enough to suit the Reform Party. Let us not pretend 
that change is not taking place right now. Everyone in the House 
knows that real reform in our social and labour market programs is 
taking place and will continue to take place.
<P>
	Bill C-96 does not do everything but it is an important step 
toward getting the architecture right, establishing a department that 
can provide the highly integrated, focused programs and services 
Canadians need.
<P>
	Of all the comments on Bill C-96 from the Reform Party, I can 
find only one based on fact. Bill C-96 does not require an annual 
report to be tabled from the Department-alleluia.
<P>
	Members of the Reform Party appear to be equivocating on this 
issue. For example, they praise the decision to eliminate the annual 
report from the department of public works as a move towards 
greater efficiency, and yet they condemn the elimination of annual 
reports from Heritage Canada. Let us hear some consistency from 
the Reform Party.
<P>
	The government's own view is clear. We want to handle the 
question of annual reports in the most efficient manner. Section 
157 of the Financial Administration Act calls for the elimination of 
annual reports when the information they provide is duplicated in 
public accounts or the estimates. That applies in this case. 
Members of the House will still have access to the information they 
need to monitor departmental spending through these other 
resources.
<P>
	For a party that professes to want grassroots control over 
programs, the members opposite seem surprisingly tied to the old 
ways of doing things, or to doing nothing. Bill C-96 is not a 
defence of the status quo or of outmoded ways of doing things.
<P>
	The government does not pretend that by passing this bill it can 
achieve everything it wants to achieve overnight. It is one step 
along the way. It would be foolish to hold back, to block this 
important step forward simply because it does not do everything at 
once. It would be equally foolish to block this step forward because 
we are afraid of change.
<P>
	Whatever the Reform Party may think, Canadians want change. 
We saw that in the referendum, we see it post-referendum, and the 
government has addressed this. The old ways no longer work. By 
bringing about change, it does not mean it has to be constitutional 
change. The way we share services with provinces is a good place 
to begin.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16521"> 16521 </A></B>
<P>
	The government is giving Canadians change, not just rhetoric. 
With this bill we can move forward. With this bill we can get on 
with the real challenge of building a more efficient, effective form 
of government for Canada.
<P>
	I remind the official opposition and the Reform Party of the 
realities of today. When I was seeking a job in 1956 after I finished 
teacher's college, there were about a dozen boards of education that 
wanted my services. One board was hiring 600 teachers at a time; 
another, 500 teachers. Boards were recruiting teachers in England, 
in Australia, in New Zealand. Today teachers graduating with much 
higher qualifications than I had cannot get a teaching position. 
They can hardly get their names on the supply list.
<P>
<B>(1245)</B>
<P>
	There was a time when teachers complained because they did not 
pay unemployment insurance. The government of the day insisted 
that teachers should pay unemployment insurance. As a teacher, I 
supported that move because you never know when you might be 
unemployed and this is an insurance scheme. Teachers then started 
paying UI. Today many teachers are benefiting from that.
<P>
	Because of the changing nature of the workforce and the 
competitiveness, more and more workers are going to have to move 
from province to province and require training and retraining. I 
hope we can count on the official opposition and the Reform Party 
to give this bill speedy passage.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilbert Fillion (Chicoutimi, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to speak on Bill C-96.
<P>
	As you probably know, barely one month has gone by since the 
Quebec referendum and already another federalist mask is 
dropping. Bill C-96 is one of those masks. This government waited 
till after the referendum to bring this bill back and try to go ahead 
with it.
<P>
	Far from signalling the federal government's withdrawal from 
manpower training, this bill will allow even greater interference in 
a provincial area of jurisdiction. This government is going over the 
heads of the provinces. Quebec has been asking for many years to 
be given full and complete jurisdiction over manpower training. In 
December 1990, labour and management partners in Quebec joined 
in a co-operative effort and unanimously took position in favour of 
repatriating all federal funding for manpower training. There is a 
consensus in Quebec, and a rather telling one at that. Even the 
Liberal Quebec government in office at the time agreed with its 
partners. So, this is not a separatist initiative but rather an opinion 
shared by the public at large.
<P>
	Why then does the federal government not listen? Because this 
government has only one thing in mind: to  gain total, perfect 
control, up, down and sideways. It wants to have all of the powers, 
even in an area like this one, in which its poor performance is 
legendary. This is just one more stepping stone.
<P>
	This government should know that all its centralizing actions 
ultimately affect people of course. And it is with people in mind 
that consistent policies should be developed, and for people that 
manpower training is offered, so as to increase our manpower's 
performance.
<P>
<B>(1250)</B>
<P>
	Here is more good news: last Friday, the Chicoutimi-Jonquière 
region, in my riding of Chicoutimi, was once again declared the 
winner because it has the highest unemployment rate in Canada. 
How nice. How very nice. This shows how incapable this 
government is when it comes to manpower training.
<P>
	People in my riding are increasingly tired of winning this 
dubious award month after month, year in year out. What can the 
government do to help our economy get out of this mess? It must 
provide a consistent manpower policy. When faced with 
unemployment, people must know where to go, and not only to 
claim UI benefits. I am referring to employment centres, which 
have now become places where people go to claim UI benefits. 
People are well aware of that. However, they do not know where, in 
the future, they will go to find jobs.
<P>
	The key to the future is a good training program based on the 
manpower requirements of the region in which they live. It is 
certainly not here in Ottawa, far from my region and others, that 
public officials can determine the best training programs for my 
constituents. They are too far away, and they do not know about our 
specific needs. Therefore, the decision making process regarding 
manpower training must be closer to those concerned.
<P>
	Bill C-96 will certainly not settle this issue once and for all, far 
from it. Given the way things are going right now, people in my 
riding will be even more concerned. In addition to giving powers to 
the minister, this bill bypasses the provinces. It will give Ottawa 
the required judicial and legal basis to justify interfering in and 
encroaching upon the area of manpower training.
<P>
	This is confirmed by clause 20, which provides that the minister 
may enter into agreements with a province or group of provinces, 
financial institutions, municipalities and such other persons or 
bodies as he considers appropriate. Since the minister is in charge, 
will financial support follow, or is this just a ploy from the federal 
government to shift its problems?
<P>
	This bill does not make it compulsory to reach an agreement 
with the provinces. Again, the number of stakeholders is being 
increased, at a time when joint action is taking place in that sector. 
The bill will make things even more complicated for those 
involved. Dividing budgets among a variety of groups, chosen  
goodness knows how by the minister, is not the way to establish 
some degree of cohesion in training programs.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16522"> 16522 </A></B>
<P>
	Will these groups have the necessary expertise? And when will 
the single window approach materialize? This is not the first time 
the Bloc has brought up one-stop service. As it now stands, Bill 
C-96 does not guarantee it.
<P>
<B>(1255)</B>
<P>
	I believe that is what could make the difference. The single 
window approach is essential. It would ensure that the reform 
would be focessed on the individual. Making the individual the 
focal point of the reform cannot help but be beneficial from the job 
creation point of view.
<P>
	It is also beneficial for our young people, who do not always 
know what training would be best for their future. For years 
Quebec has been demanding full jurisdiction over manpower. 
There is plenty of proof that the federal government has missed the 
boat in the way it has managed this.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, you are indicating to me that I have only a few 
seconds left, so I shall close with the following remark. Last 
October 5, in response to a question on this bill from the leader of 
the official opposition, the minister stated-and his words are 
recorded-that we ought to have read the bill.
<P>
	Let me assure you, Mr. Speaker, we have read the bill. And not 
only Quebecers have read it, moreover. The Minister of Human 
Resources Development should-and these are my closing 
words-redraft his bill. I shall vote in favour of my colleague's 
amendment.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Geoff Regan (Halifax West, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to speak this morning on Bill C-96.
<P>
	Clause 3 of the bill states:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>There is hereby established a department of the Government of Canada called 
the Department of Human Resources Development-</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Perhaps the most remarkable part of the bill is the very name of 
the department it creates: ``Human Resources Development''. 
Those three words stand for one of the most critical challenges and 
also one of the greatest opportunities facing Canadians today. They 
stand for one of the most basic beliefs underlying the government's 
commitment to Canadians.
<P>
	We believe that Canada has enormous potential, economically 
and socially. We believe that people, our human resources, are the 
key to unlocking that potential. It is the talents and skills of people 
that have made this country one of the most prosperous nations on 
earth. It is those same skills and talents that will secure for Canada 
and Canadians a prosperous future.
<P>
	By investing in people, by developing our human resources, we 
want to ensure that every Canadian has a chance to take part in the 
future. We want to ensure that  every element of the social 
programs works toward that goal. That focus is what the new 
department is all about. It is about helping the people who need 
help the most, by giving them the tools they need the most, by 
giving them a chance to overcome the barriers of poverty, a chance 
to gain access to good training and skills and a chance to get good 
jobs.
<P>
	Throughout the social security reform consultations we have 
been asking Canadians how to focus our social programs better to 
achieve that goal. It has been going on throughout the Department 
of Human Resources Development over the past year as 
departmental officials have worked to sharpen the focus of 
programs and services to make them more effective. It is going on 
right now as we develop the new human resources investment fund, 
which will lead to greater decentralization in this area. We will be 
working more with our partners at the local level and will be 
reducing the 39 current programs to a handful which can be hand 
tailored to local needs.
<P>
	Social security reform will continue to evolve as the government 
prepares legislation to refocus the UI program and integrate the 
lessons it has learned from consultations into departmental 
operations.
<P>
	If members want to see social security reform in action as an 
example of focusing resources on investing in people, they can take 
a look in my riding at the Bedford Professional Training Services. 
With this program each project consists of a mix of classroom and 
on the job training in modern office management. Many of the 
trainees are older workers who have been displaced from their 
former employment. In addition to learning new skills, they must 
deal with low self-esteem, grief, embarrassment and frustration 
which accompany a midlife job loss, as we all know well. A strong 
counselling component is built into the training package to address 
these issues.
<P>
<B>(1300)</B>
<P>
	The co-ordinator of the program, Fran Hill, is to be commended 
for her excellent work. In fact the placement rate for this program 
in its first two projects was 90 per cent. Ninety per cent of those 
people who were actually in the program were placed in jobs. That 
is excellent and is to be commended. One former trainee has 
successfully started her own business and is now employing 
another of Fran's graduates.
<P>
	These people do not want handouts from the department. They 
want jobs and they want help getting the tools and skills they need 
to get on with their lives. That is what they are getting at places like 
Bedford Professional Training Services. They are getting a second 
chance at education and learning skills for new jobs. That is just 
one example of the strategic initiatives we are undertaking to 
refocus the department's resources away from the status quo 
toward real, productive and meaningful change.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16523"> 16523 </A></B>
<P>
	I will give another example. Let us look at the communities of 
Lucasville and Upper Hammonds Plains which are two minority 
communities in my riding of Halifax West. These communities 
have benefited tremendously over the past two years working 
closely with the Bedford Canada Employment Centre.
<P>
	Through a section 25 program a UI recipient prepares a strategic 
development plan. Right now they are arranging for community 
consultation on this plan but they will soon begin the initial stages 
of implementation. Part of that plan involves tutoring programs 
which have already begun and have been very successful.
<P>
	Through the Youth Services Canada summer program, students, 
including eight from the summer program and four in the career 
placement program, did two activities. The first involved 
recreation services in the communities. The second involved 
renovations of homes, churches and community centres in those 
communities but according to priorities which were established at 
the local level by the people in those communities. That is a very 
important point.
<P>
	The curriculum they used was developed with funding by the 
delivery of systems project of the department. The curriculum 
works to improve educational standards. It gives the area the 
capability as a remote learning centre. It will actually start in the 
middle of this month.
<P>
	There are many examples like these across the country that 
reflect the new focus and direction of the department. We can see it 
in the assistance that thousands of Canadians receive every day in 
our network of CECs, Canada Employment Centres, across the 
country. Thousands of Canadians who need help to get the training, 
the jobs and income support they need are helped in these centres.
<P>
	We can see it in the hard work and dedication of some 30,000 
departmental employees. I want to mention one in particular with 
whom I worked over the past couple of years and who retired this 
summer. Keith Cameron was the manager of the Canada 
Employment Centre in Bedford. I was very impressed by his 
commitment to his community and his commitment to his work.
<P>
	In fact on Canada Day in 1994 I visited Upper Hammonds 
Plains. There on a day off was Keith Cameron coaching the local 
ball team. If that is not commitment to a community that needs 
assistance and needs involvement, I do not know what is. To me 
that shows the kind of dedication and commitment of many of the 
employees of the human resources development department. It is 
an excellent example for others to follow.
<P>
	Day in and day out, people like Keith Cameron and other 
departmental employees are working with people who are looking 
for jobs. They help mediate labour disputes. They help 
communities with economic development. They help young people 
get started in the  world of work and help seniors benefit from 
income support programs.
<P>
	This new focus of the department is an integral part of the human 
resources investment fund established in the last budget. They 
work closely together. The whole point of this fund is to make the 
most flexible use possible of our resources to ensure that people get 
the support and services they need to find jobs, jobs that they want 
desperately.
<P>
<B>(1305 )</B>
<P>
	For example, this fund will support the government's 
commitment to child care, a crucial measure to help unemployed 
parents find work and get training. We made a commitment to 
co-invest with the provinces in child care and we will live up to that 
commitment.
<P>
	We are also working to improve the child care that is available to 
aboriginal peoples. Our officials are working with a team from the 
First Nations. Together we are making good progress. The 
government hopes to have a new program in place this fall.
<P>
	Additionally the department has launched the child care visions 
fund with $5 million annually. The money will be used to help 
support new research and development in this area which is so very 
important to Canada's future human resources potential.
<P>
	These are some of the ways the new focus of the department is 
reflected in concrete action. In the immediate future one of the 
government's top priorities will be to integrate this focus into the 
unemployment insurance program with a major overhaul of the 
program.
<P>
	A few weeks ago the Minister of Human Resources 
Development spoke to the human resources standing committee 
about the direction this overhaul is going to take. A key objective 
of the overhaul is to transform the UI program to focus on 
re-employment not unemployment, on jobs not joblessness. This 
means finding ways to remove disincentives in the program that 
hamper job creation and discourage workers from returning to the 
workforce. It also means simplifying the system for both workers 
and employers, making it easier to work with and less costly to 
administer. It means integrating the UI program with a variety of 
tools to help people get back to work.
<P>
	The government will introduce legislation to reform UI in the 
next few weeks but the department is already working on the basic 
operational changes needed to make the integrated employment 
program work and succeed. This means streamlining the current 39 
separate programs and services that are delivered through CECs 
across the country and integrating them in a way that allows the 
communities to implement them in different ways. That seems to 
be very appropriate.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16524"> 16524 </A></B>
<P>
	The objective is to ensure the department's energies are driven 
not by program rules but by the needs of individual Canadians in 
different parts of the country. There will be much more room for 
discretion and judgment at the local level which is important. If 
we want to tailor re-employment programs to fit local needs, we 
must have that kind of local discretion.
<P>
	Bill C-96 does not in itself accomplish these changes. What it 
does is it consolidates the administrative framework for changes 
that have taken place, are taking place now and will continue to 
take place in the future. It reflects the basic focus that underlies the 
government's approach to social and labour market programs. It is 
this focus that will help to develop Canada's human resources 
giving those who need help the most the tools they need to work 
and prosper in the future.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Werner Schmidt (Okanagan Centre, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
it is with pleasure that I join the debate on Bill C-96, a bill which 
sets up the Department of Human Resources Development. I would 
certainly hope the kinds of remarks and words my hon. colleague 
across the way has just expressed will come to fruition, at least in 
part.
<P>
	This bill, which is a structural kind of bill to set up a department, 
takes place in the environment we find ourselves in as far as 
Canada and the world is concerned. It deals with things such as the 
fact that we live in an information society. Taking place around us 
is a technological revolution toward a knowledge based economy. 
There is the globalization of politics, industry and trade. There is a 
move toward the devolution of power to individuals. There is a 
gradual recognition that the past is not a model for the future.
<P>
	There is an express need now for a new federalism. We are very 
well aware of that having just experienced the referendum in 
Quebec. All of society must be involved, not just the elite. This 
hinges on a very major part. We need to recognize that if we are 
going to have real change in our country, it is going to come from 
the rank and file. It is not going to come from the top down. We 
have had enough of that. That model is not working, has not 
worked and will not work in the future.
<P>
<B>(1310)</B>
<P>
	What do we need? This is where the bill lacks a lot of its input 
for Canada's society and for the government. Canada needs the 
development of people. We need an innovation and technology 
orientation. We need to have an infrastructure in science and 
engineering. I will only deal with those three areas. Many more 
ought to be addressed but those are the three I will limit my 
remarks to this afternoon.
<P>
	If we are going to develop people successfully, the number one 
requirement as we move from the old society to the new 
information and knowledge based society is the ability to change. 
Individuals will have to  have the willingness and motivation inside 
them to learn continually and to do so in all aspects of life.
<P>
	I was rather impressed with the Electrical and Electronic 
Manufacturers Association which has a very interesting set of 
requirements for people who need to be up to date in their 
particular industry. The association says that some of the best 
programs are those developed by the industry on the shop floor as 
the best learning takes place on the shop floor.
<P>
	Those are the two elements: the ability and willingness to change 
and subsequently the willingness to learn and to do so on a 
continuing basis. It goes beyond that. We need to develop people 
who have the ability to handle the technological and social aspects 
of living and working. We are developing some very competent 
people in the technological area. We are not developing them as a 
balanced position in terms of handling their social and other 
situations.
<P>
	Let me alert the House to the findings of <I>Maclean's</I> magazine 
which just did a poll ranking all the universities in Canada. It 
became pretty obvious on listening to various people that what 
individuals require today is the ability to do technical work very 
effectively and at a very high level. However at the same time they 
need to be able to balance their home life and their primary 
relationships with other people. We need this balance in people but 
we need more than that. We need particular technological 
development in areas that are not presently being developed.
<P>
	It was rather interesting to listen to some of the captains of 
industry say that they need particular emphasis, willingness and 
ability in people who deal with computers and the skills required to 
do that successfully.
<P>
	Today there is the breakdown of our families. If there was ever a 
need for the family to be strongly structured it is in this situation 
where constant learning is required. When there is a need to change 
there has to be a place where there is quiet, comfort and security. 
That comes from strong interpersonal relationships which are best 
found within the family. As we develop these other aspects, the 
high technical skills, we need to develop the reason and the basis 
for strong families and strong primary relationships.
<P>
	In order to achieve that what is necessary? We need a balanced 
education system, one that encourages an entrepreneurial spirit 
which shows people how to be entrepreneurs. We live in a culture 
that encourages entrepreneurship and rewards the risk taking that is 
incumbent upon those who venture out in their own businesses. We 
then need to develop that skill and ability for people to blend 
economic and management awareness with science and 
technology.
<P>
	It is so easy to become focused in a very narrow area of a 
particular science or technology and forget that unless we can 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16525"> 16525 </A></B>
<P>
manage people it does not matter how  good we are at running 
machines or computer programs. We have to learn to manage 
people. In the new high tech industries that seems to be the area 
which is most in need of development.
<P>
	It goes beyond that. We need to have a balance among 
educational institutions. There are hundreds of universities in this 
country. They seem to spring up all over the place. It seems to me 
that parents want their kids to go to university. That is the best. The 
summum bonum of all education aspirations is graduating from 
university, preferably with a Ph.D. That is not necessarily the 
requirement for technological development. We need to balance 
our institutions so we focus on the highly academic skilled people 
but also develop the person who can do the actual technical stuff of 
putting a computer together, of writing a computer program, of 
recognizing the interrelationships of computer networks and things 
of that sort.
<P>
<B>(1315)</B>
<P>
	We need more than just university institutions. We need other 
post-secondary institutions. We have technical institutions such as 
BCIT, the Northern Alberta Institute of Technology and institutions 
of that nature, but we need a group that goes in between those as 
well, which brings a level of sophistication and understanding of a 
Ph.D. but that is not a Ph.D. in the academic sense, but rather in the 
technical and science sense, as contrasted with existing university 
programs.
<P>
	There are two specific suggestions I now draw to members' 
attention. The first is it is necessary for us to examine, validate and 
help diffuse or reject research studies prepared by other 
organizations and build on valid work by undertaking or 
commissioning research to study the linkages between education 
and the economy, the forecasting of skill requirements, 
international comparisons, quality of education and training, 
gender and equity policies, student learning styles and core 
curriculum.
<P>
	The second is to facilitate linkages between all levels of the 
education system: business, labour, government, the community, 
social services, non-governmental organizations. If we move into 
that kind of an environment we will do away, or at least certainly 
reduce, the town/gown conflict that exists now between the 
university professor on the one hand who rests primarily on his 
seniority to maintain his position rather than on new ideas. We have 
some wonderful professors who have great seniority and who rest 
on that particular thing. A lot of them need to change their lifestyle 
and have a new orientation.
<P>
	We also need to develop a receptivity among our companies, our 
various industries, that they will take and integrate into their 
operations the best practice technologies. Then we can play the 
leadership role that Canada is capable of in the development,  
commercialisation and marketing of technology. The challenge is 
ours. We can do that.
<P>
	Another area I draw attention to is developing the science and 
engineering infrastructure. We need to again emphasize the 
excellence required in education, the excellence in skill 
development and a vibrant research department.
<P>
	The complexity of the relationships among research, education, 
skills training, innovation and competitiveness is not to be 
denigrated. It is extremely difficult and it is the one area where we 
have not done a good job. This bill should have addressed those 
kinds of things. It did not.
<P>
	Universities, community colleges and technical institutes must 
re-examine their missions, establish clear goals and improve the 
mobilization, allocation and management of their resources to 
achieve these goals.
<P>
	Consideration should be given to the complementarity between 
the program offerings of colleges and universities as well as to 
greater differentiation between the roles and missions of each 
institution. Concurrently there must be a review of post-secondary 
funding in view of redefined missions. This review should result in 
a clear definition of goals, outcomes and increased accountability.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Jon Gerrard (Secretary of State (Science, Research and 
Development), Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is an honour and a pleasure 
to be here today as the member for Portage-Interlake in Manitoba 
and speak about Bill C-96, the act which will formally establish the 
new Department of Human Resources Development, a department 
for which my close colleague and fellow Manitoban, the hon. 
member for Winnipeg South Centre, is responsible.
<P>
	Some might ask why the Secretary of State for Science, 
Research and Development would be particularly interested in 
talking on Bill C-96. There are several reasons. First and foremost, 
the bill brings together people and resources in a new way, a way 
that will position the Government of Canada to play a more 
effective role in human resource development.
<P>
	The bill is central to a redefinition of the role of government in 
Canada, a role that improves the ability to form partnerships, to 
share resources, to enhance local and national understanding of the 
issues and to use national networking and research to ensure 
effectiveness and accountability.
<P>
<B>(1320)</B>
<P>
	It is a paradox perhaps of our age that governments, like 
computers, must cost less and do more at the same time. Sharing 
powers through partnerships, bringing groups and resources 
together at the local level is the process this bill enables, a process 
essential to meet the challenge of our times.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16526"> 16526 </A></B>
<P>
	The process is now operating in many locations across Canada: 
at the new Learning Centre in Portage la Prairie, at the Learning 
and Life Centre in London, Ontario, at le Centre de resources 
humaine de Matagami in Québec, and in many other areas.
<P>
	Sectoral partnerships like the Automotive Repair and Service 
Council, the Canadian Steel Employer's Council, partnerships with 
industry leadership, are further examples of sharing, decision 
making and resources through partnerships.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Decentralization and a sharing of powers through partnerships, a 
regrouping of stakeholders and resources locally, this is what the 
DHRC is about and this is what Bill C-96 will enable us to continue 
doing.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	We now live in the knowledge age, a time when an 
understanding of science and technology is vital for the 
development of human resources. This has happened for several 
reasons. More and more of the employment and the business 
opportunities of today depend on a knowledge of science and 
technology.
<P>
	Over the last five years there has been a net gain of more than a 
million jobs for those with a college or university education but a 
net loss of more than 600,000 jobs for those with only high school 
training or less.
<P>
	Employment in some science and engineering based areas, 
computer science, software engineering, advanced materials, 
biotechnology, environmental technology, are now and continue to 
be among the fastest growth areas for employment. Just being able 
to use a computer well in one's job has been estimated to provide a 
15 per cent additional income benefit compared to a similar worker 
without such skills.
<P>
	Science and technology are important as well because they are 
increasingly essential for the efficient delivery of government 
services. In Portage-Interlake constituents have historically often 
had to travel long distances to get to the nearest Canada 
employment centre.
<P>
	Constituents from Ashern, Gypsumville, Dauphin River, Peguis, 
Fisher River, Jackhead and many more communities have had to 
travel two, three, four hours one way to get to the nearest Canada 
employment centre.
<P>
	Fortunately due to the advance in technology and the foresight of 
the Minister of Human Resources Development it will not be long 
before employment kiosks are much closer so that increasingly 
constituents will be able to receive effective service in their own 
communities, as the citizens in Stonewall in my riding already do.
<P>
	We look forward to the day when such service will be provided 
cost efficiently over the Internet to all people in their own 
communities. The government's community access program is 
providing rural communities across  Canada the opportunity to get 
connected and to be served effectively at home.
<P>
	Science and research are also increasingly essential to the design 
and the implementation of programs through the human resources 
development department.
<P>
	As the National Advisory Board on Science and Technology 
emphasized in its report ``Health, Wealthy and Wise'', all levels of 
government need to evaluate the effectiveness of their programs 
and the efficiency of their delivery. They need to begin to 
understand the underlying causes in order to reduce the overall 
demand for remedial social programs.
<P>
	NABST further emphasized that social science humanities 
research may be the key to responding to these issues. NABST 
singled out the self-sufficiency project of the human resources 
development department as an example of the sort of critical action 
research needed, testing by doing.
<P>
	Numerous strategic initiatives now being undertaken by the 
human resources development department follow in the same 
fashion. Examples include the taking charge initiative in Manitoba, 
helping single parents on social assistance, and the improved 
access to child care initiative in British Columbia, a four-year 
project to test new ways of delivering and developing child care 
services.
<P>
<B>(1325)</B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The Government of Canada is not taking the lead in any of these 
initiatives. We do not want to take the lead. It is the results of these 
partnerships that interest us.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	It is the creation of the human resources department in its 
present structure and the leadership of its present minister which 
have allowed the effective integration of sophisticated social 
science and program design so that we can expect to see for the first 
time with the upcoming reform of the unemployment insurance 
system an overhaul which has effectively used science based 
testing to ensure a better and far more effective program.
<P>
	Science and technology in the development of human resources 
are only effective to the extent that they are used wisely and are 
balanced by the ability to develop critical human elements, ethics, 
discipline, creativity, hope, courage, self-esteem, compassion, 
tolerance, diversity, co-operation and team work.
<P>
	It is also these elements which are important and can be nurtured 
within the focus of the new department which is focused on 
co-operation and partnerships, sharing resources and decision 
making, targeting these particular values. Our bottom line is that 
we must advance in the development of human values even as we 
advance in science and technology for economic purposes. To 
make wonderful developments in science and technology for 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16527"> 16527 </A></B>
<P>
economic goals alone but to fail to  make the same developments in 
social and human sciences would be like a see-saw with all the 
weight on one side.
<P>
	In this context it is appropriate to mention today, national child 
day, the important role the newly developed human resources 
development department can and is playing in nurturing the 
children of Canada.
<P>
	Let me use an example of an effort in my riding of the newly 
opened learning centre in Portage la Prairie. It offers technology to 
help provide citizens with an alternative learning mode, including 
self-directed computer based learning, for all levels from grade 4 
through first year university. The facility is of particular relevance 
to single mothers and their children.
<P>
	As noted in the statistics reported last week, some 56 per cent of 
single mothers in Canada live in poverty. These mothers and their 
children deserve and need our attention. At the Portage learning 
centre they are receiving it. It is coupled with a day care facility 
which enables single mothers to be full participants and to learn 
new skills and to enhance their success in the participation in the 
job market and to enhance their income.
<P>
	This example and many others like the improved access to child 
care initiative I mentioned earlier are important building blocks for 
our society and our children tomorrow.
<P>
	Let me now return briefly to the theme I began with, a new 
department with a new approach, decentralized in that it shares 
resources and decision making in the most effective ways. This 
approach allows the rapid emergence and development of creative 
local initiatives to respond to local needs, and yet at the same time 
provides a nationally networked department which can share 
experiences, best practices and test results from new initiatives 
from one end of Canada to the other.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Today, the government has begun an in-depth reform of our 
labour market and social security programs, by creating a system of 
employment for the 21st century.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	As a government we started the process of reform from the 
ground up. We have engaged almost 100,000 Canadians directly in 
deciding how to deal with unemployment insurance, how to deal 
with job programs, how to deal with issues like employment equity 
and child care.
<P>
	The result will be a job system built by Canadians for Canadians. 
The result will be a system preoccupied not with turf wars but with 
results and getting things done. The result will be a system run by 
partners who can get those results. The result will be a system that 
favours the creation of employment in the wealth creating private 
sector rather than enlarging the government sector.
<P>
	That is what Canada needs and that is why the government is 
creating through Bill C-96 a new Department of Human Resources 
Development and ensuring its mandate.
<P>

<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Mercier (Blainville-Deux-Montagnes, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, as soon as the all clear sounded on October 30, the 
government rushed to release a flood of centralist and/or antisocial 
bills. These bills had been ready for some time, but it would have 
been poor timing to table them before the referendum and in the 
process cause many voters in Quebec to turn away from that great 
and beautiful Canada of ours in the privacy of the voting booth.
<P>
	It was a close call for Ottawa, but now that it has managed, just 
barely, to negotiate this rocky stretch, the government can at last 
heave a sigh of relief and calmly pursue its usual goals. Can a 
leopard change its spots? Of course not. So, full speed ahead, 
towards an even bigger and more beautiful Canada which, 
according to this government, means even more centralized and 
antisocial.
<P>
	The promises to decentralize, made in a prereferendum panic, 
are now gone with the wind of victory, slim though the margin was, 
and too bad for the believers who naively voted no.
<P>
	Remember the last days of the referendum campaign, when the 
polls made them break out in a cold sweat and federalism's big 
guns sang the hymn to decentralization. They understood what we 
wanted, they chorused, and they loved us. Time would tell. From 
now on, provincial jurisdictions would be respected. If we voted 
no, there would be no more wicked ministers trying to graze in the 
greener pastures of provincial jurisdictions.
<P>
	After the majority voted no, the very first thing this government 
did, as if to make it abundantly clear to those who had not yet 
understood how they had been tricked, was to table the bill before 
the House today. A real masterpiece of centralization and 
leap-frogging over the heads of the provinces. The no side won, 
which means there is no longer any incentive for Ottawa to respect 
us. Here comes the first wave over the damn, Bill C-96, loaded 
with new powers Ottawa has the effrontery to assume in the field of 
manpower training, thus ignoring not only its own promises but 
also a general consensus in Quebec including even the Liberals.
<P>
	Until now, the minister could not sidestep the provinces 
altogether in this area, to enter into agreements with financial 
institutions, persons or bodies, as the minister considers 
appropriate. This was of course intolerable. It was high time the 
referendum was over with so the government could finally do 
something about this. Otherwise, people would start thinking that 
Ottawa respected the powers of the provinces.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16528"> 16528 </A></B>
<P>
	Some will say that one swallow does not a summer make. One 
centralist bill is not necessarily a harbinger of all out 
centralization. It is true, but, believe me, you can trust the 
government, a whole flock of swallows is on the way. Bill C-96 
is merely a forerunner, Bill C-95 is already peeking out from 
behind it. This bill not only gives birth to the Department of 
Health, it is giving it as a christening gift comfortably broadened 
ministerial powers.
<P>
	Before long, we will also be seeing Bill C-98 with which the 
government is giving itself environmental control over the oceans 
and also the waters that flow into the ocean. Now, since all waters 
flow into the ocean-
<P>
	In short, ever shrinking transfers to the provinces and ever 
expanding involvement in provincial jurisdictions. Pay ever less 
and control ever more: this is the incredible policy of our 
colleagues opposite. How long, we wonder, will the other 
provinces meekly go along with this little game.
<P>
<B>(1335)</B>
<P>
	If they accept another round of cuts to their rights without 
flinching, it makes little sense to me, but, after all, it is their 
business. However, this steam roller of a centralizing and antisocial 
legislation whose rumblings we hear, this campaign that they have 
just boldly launched against provincial prerogatives now that they 
have nothing more to fear, this bellicose rumour arising from the 
ranks of the Liberals, can you see how clearly it is revealing the 
intentions of the Prime Minister when he talks about unearthing old 
legislation that has fallen into disuse?
<P>
	The aim, as everyone will see, is to prevent Quebecers from 
holding a third referendum when the time is right. All the 
Quebecers who were misled into voting no because they believed 
in the promises made are very likely to change sides, do you not 
suppose, and vote yes after the steam roller has gone by. At that 
point we will be able to assess the damage done to the social safety 
net and to provincial jurisdictions. What kind of reaction can we 
expect from Quebecers faced with the inflated arrogance of the 
federal government as it sports the new powers it has snatched 
from the provinces like new plumage?
<P>
	One day we will be sovereign, because one day a majority of 
Quebecers will understand. Believe me, they will not be misled 
again by excessive flattery before the referendum only to be pistol 
whipped after. This is why those opposite want nothing to do with a 
new referendum. Bill C-96 will at least begin to open the eyes of 
the half of Quebecers who have yet to understand.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Eleni Bakopanos (Saint-Denis, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is a 
pleasure to speak to Bill C-96, a bill which talks of partnership, of 
collaboration between the federal  and provincial governments, of 
the need to develop our greatest asset, human resources.
<P>
	I know firsthand from my constituents in Saint-Denis that we 
must develop efficiently this important resource in order to meet 
the challenges facing Canada in the 21st century.
<P>
	Questions have been raised about the powers granted to the 
minister in this bill, specifically with respect to clause 6, which sets 
out the mandate of the department. They suggest that somehow this 
clause allows the federal government to intrude on matters of 
provincial jurisdiction. I find myself puzzled by some of those 
questions. I wonder if we are all reading from the same bill or do 
some members opposite have their own private version that they 
would like to share with us.
<P>
	In my copy of the bill, clause 6 has a very important and I think 
very clear phrase that puts definite limits on the minister's powers. 
It limits those powers to ``matters over which Parliament has 
jurisdiction''. What part of that phrase is unclear?
<P>
	By some kind of hocus-pocus, members opposite read that 
phrase and it comes out ``matters over which the provinces have 
jurisdiction''. That is just plain nonsense. It is not what the bill 
says. It says just the opposite.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	In fact, Bill C-96 does not affect federal and provincial powers in 
any way. It does not give the minister any extra powers or 
undermine those he already has. All the powers now granted to the 
minister under the law will remain the same.
<P>
	Bill C-96 does not create any new programs or bring any 
substantial changes to those that already exist. All programs and 
services in effect the day before this bill is passed will remain the 
same.
<P>
	There is no ambiguity in this. There is no doubt whatsoever. 
Whichever way you look at it, this bill does not grant any new 
powers. This encroachment exists only in the fertile imagination of 
those who would like to see such an encroachment.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Perhaps some members would be more comfortable if clause 6 
spelled out in laborious detail all of the specific programs offered 
by the government. That is certainly an option but it is an option the 
government decided would be ill-advised and counterproductive.
<P>
	We are dealing with a very large department and with a wide 
range of programs and services. Enumerating all of those programs 
point by point would take pages and in the end nothing very 
positive would be accomplished.
<P>
<B>(1340 )</B>
<P>
	The whole direction of the department, of the government, of 
governments at all levels and indeed most business organizations is 
to stay flexible and ready for  change. At a time when flexibility, 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16529"> 16529 </A></B>
<P>
streamlining and efficiency are so important, it makes sense to set 
out the responsibilities of the department in a better way. That is 
what clause 6 does. It sets out the basic objectives of the 
department: enhancing employment, encouraging equality and 
promoting social security. These objectives are very clear. They are 
very important and are within the jurisdiction of this Parliament.
<P>
	The people who use our programs every day, whether they are in 
Newfoundland, Quebec, Manitoba or British Columbia, do not 
want the federal government to shirk its responsibilities. I trust that 
no one in the House is suggesting that we do so.
<P>
	At the same time, we all recognize that there is room for more 
productive partnerships between all levels of government. We 
recognize the need to clarify roles and responsibilities in labour 
market development. That is why we have made it very clear that 
as we proceed with social security reform, as we put a new 
unemployment insurance program in place, as we develop a new 
human resource investment fund and the Canada health and social 
transfer, we are open to change.
<P>
	We are willing to take a hard look at who is in the best position to 
deliver programs and services most efficiently. It may well prove 
that some programs managed now at the federal level can be better 
managed by others: the provinces, private sector partners or 
community groups.
<P>
	The federal government wants to work with Quebec and all 
provinces with an open mind. We are really not interested in turf 
wars. We are interested in working with our partners in a 
constructive way to meet common goals and serve Canadians.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Let us consider the agreements already concluded between 
HRDC and Quebec: the interim Canada-Quebec agreement on 
certain manpower development measures; the agreement on the 
implementation of a deal affecting welfare recipients; the 
Canada-Quebec agreement on agricultural employment; the block 
funding granted Quebec under the Canada student loans program, 
to name but a few.
<P>
	These umbrella agreements may not be perfect, but they work. 
They directly affect the lives of thousands of people in that 
province.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The whole thrust of HRDC activity is to strengthen those 
partnerships and to decentralize power away from the centre to the 
local level. Labour market programs and services are already 
among the most decentralized of all federal programs. We are 
decentralizing them even further with a new, modern service 
delivery network firmly rooted at the local level in communities 
across this country.
<P>
	The federal government is also committed to working with the 
provinces to provide the most flexible services possible to 
Canadians.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	For example, the Canada transfer for health and social programs 
will give Quebec another source of funding for measures such as 
the parental wage assistance program or PWA, which cannot be 
funded under the old system; the provincial sales tax rebate to 
welfare recipients, which does not come under the old system; a 
nutrition program for disadvantaged children, which cannot be 
funded under the old system either; as well as transportation 
services for handicapped people, without having to assess the needs 
as would be required under the old system.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Because clause 6 of Bill C-96 sets out the department's mandate 
in terms of general objectives rather than the minute details of 
existing programs, we will have this kind of flexibility. It provides 
a basis for a more efficient department and clears the way for 
continued evaluation and reform down the road.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Diverting the debate on this bill by inventing jurisdictional 
problems-by finding in clause 6 words that are obviously not 
there-is doing a disservice to thousands of Canadians across the 
country who benefit every day from the services provided by the 
Department of Human Resources Development.
<P>
	It is doing a disservice to the million Quebecers throughout that 
province who rely on and use this department's services, to the 
people who come to our human resources and student employment 
centres, who register in our employment programs, who receive 
unemployment insurance, who benefit every day from the $14 
million that HRDC spends in Quebec on an annual basis.
<P>
<B>(1345)</B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Canadians are entitled to the best possible services. They 
deserve the kind of integrated, focused, practical programs that 
HRDC is working to deliver, and Bill C-96 is important to that 
effort.
<P>
	Let us not sacrifice good, productive service on the altar of 
rhetoric. In the end all levels of government are striving for the 
same goal: to help people find and keep good jobs. That is what is 
important. That is what we promised as a party and that is what we 
are delivering as a government.
<P>
	I have numerous examples in my riding of programs that work. 
Young people who had no future, who had no hope for the future, 
are now in programs financed by the department. I have the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16530"> 16530 </A></B>
<P>
example of 13 young high school dropouts who are now in a 
program that is a  collaborative effort of the federal government 
and the private sector. All 13 of them will have jobs the minute that 
program ends.
<P>
	We need to consolidate the progress we have achieved in 
integrating social and labour market programs and sharpen the 
focus on developing Canada's human resources. More important, 
we need to clear the way for further progress as we launch the new 
employment insurance program, as we develop new programs and 
services under the human resource investment fund, as we work to 
improve programs for seniors, and as the department continues to 
re-engineer and streamline services to Canadians.
<P>
	It is important to clear up the administrative tangles left over 
from earlier times. It is important to establish a clear identity and 
coherent mandate for the new organization to function properly. It 
is important to ensure that as the department looks to the future 
there is a solid foundation to build on. As I said earlier there are 
numerous programs by which we want to build a solid foundation 
for the young people of the country. For instance, the youth 
services program in my riding has helped a number of young 
people have hope for the future, as I said earlier.
<P>
	Bill C-96 provides that foundation. We need to pass the bill and 
get on with the work of serving Canadians.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Daphne Jennings (Mission-Coquitlam, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I rise today to speak to the government's Bill C-96, an act 
to establish the Department of Human Resources Development.
<P>
	The bill basically does little more than transfer legal powers 
from the former Ministry of Employment and Immigration to the 
new department. In summary, the enactment establishes the 
Department of Human Resources Development with a presiding 
minister to be appointed by commission under the Great Seal of 
Canada, with the powers, duties and functions as therein set out, 
and a deputy minister to be appointed by the governor in council 
with provision for employees. It also provides that a minister of 
labour may be appointed and that a deputy minister of labour may 
be designated. That is it.
<P>
	With all the huffing and puffing the minister of human resources 
did regarding his intentions for social reform, Bill C-96, all 44 
pages, does very little but change the name of the department and 
continue as usual.
<P>
	I will comment on a few clauses I take issue with before I 
address the need for social reform especially for our seniors. I fear 
clause 6 means the government will continue to interfere in the 
provincial areas of social programs, in other words entrench the 
status quo that causes overlap and duplication.
<P>
	Clauses 20 and 21 enable the minister to enter into negotiation 
with any group including the provinces and municipalities. The 
provinces are waiting for less  interference in social programs. 
Reform would support real decentralization with the provision of 
power going directly to the provinces to administer at their 
discretion.
<P>
	Then there is the matter of government accountability. If there is 
no annual report from the department how will Canadians have full 
knowledge regarding its administration and cost to the taxpayers? 
We are also kept in the dark about staffing in the new human 
resources department. Will it increase or decrease?
<P>
	Canadians have waited a year for the discussion paper to come 
out. It seems we are still waiting. Once again the government, in 
this case the Minister of Human Resources Development, has 
failed Canadians. There is no meaningful social reform in the bill, 
no decentralization as the provinces have been asking for.
<P>
	As Reform's deputy critic for human resources I must look at 
seniors' concerns. I must tell the House that seniors are so 
concerned about the future of their pensions that Canada's usual 
seniors groups have joined to create a coalition of seniors for social 
equity. The coalition consists of five major national seniors groups 
concerned in a large part about the future of income security 
programs for the elderly. It is hoped that by giving seniors a strong 
voice the coalition which claims to represent 500,000 seniors 
across Canada will ensure that government considers the wishes of 
seniors. The paper was written a year ago. I must consider the 
remarks of one senior spokesperson who stated:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>When our coalition was formed, we set ourselves some rigid criteria. We 
decided that we, as seniors' organizations, have to face the hard facts. We have 
to recognize that the deficit and growing government debt are real. We have to 
recognize that the elderly population is growing faster than the population as a 
whole and that government expenditures on the elderly are increasing.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>We recognize that seniors, like others in society, may have to pay higher 
levels of taxation and receive lower levels of government services. The seniors 
of today have always paid their fair share to society and will continue to be 
willing to do so. What they object to is being singled out to pay more than their 
fair share. Seniors recognize that, with due consideration and consultation, 
some changes may be necessary to the income security system for older 
Canadians.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>(1350)</B>
<P>
	They stated their major concern as follows:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>When change is necessary, people who can adjust must be given enough time 
to plan and adjust, and those who cannot must have benefits continued.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>People have to know what to expect when they retire so they can prepare their 
financial affairs well in advance.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	It is interesting to note that others in society, especially the 
financial experts, say the same thing. Most Canadians recognize 
that due to the country's changing demographic profile Canada's 
pension system is facing a cash flow crisis.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16531"> 16531 </A></B>
<P>
	The Canadian birth rate soared after World War II, producing 
a baby boom generation that will start to retire around the year 
2010. The number of pensioners per working Canadian will more 
than double by the year 2031.
<P>
	This would not be a problem if Canada's government 
administered pensions were funded, that is if each person's 
contributions to the CPP were placed in an individual account and 
invested. Instead the CPP is funded on a pay as we go basis. For 
example, the funds collected from today's workers are paid out 
immediately to today's pensioners. Thus every time the ratio of 
retirees to workers increases the per capita cost of the system to 
workers increases in lock step.
<P>
	Canadian politicians have shown little creativity in addressing 
the pension funding crisis and seem to believe that the rise in 
pension demands can be dealt with only by cutting benefits to 
pensioners or by raising taxes for working Canadians. If the first of 
these two options is chosen, pension benefits will have to be cut by 
over 50 per cent by the year 2031 to keep payroll deductions for 
CPP at their current levels.
<P>
	If the second option is chosen, taxes on working Canadians will 
be driven to unprecedented heights. To maintain CPP benefits at 
their present levels payroll deductions will have to be increased 
from the current level of 5.4 per cent to 10.28 per cent by the year 
2011 and eventually over 14 per cent. That source is from the 
Canada pension plan 15th statutory actuarial report of February 
1995.
<P>
	Health and Welfare Canada in ``Charting Canada's Future'', 
1989, stated:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The term ``demographic aging'' refers to an increase in the relative weight of 
the elderly in the total population. The aging of the Canadian population has 
come about largely because of declining fertility rates and, to a lot lesser degree, 
because of an increase in average life span.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	By the time the post-second world war baby boomers retire 
roughly one in every five Canadians will be 65 years of age or 
more, compared to approximately one in ten today. What is more, 
while senior citizens will form an increasingly large proportion of 
the population the percentage of young people will decline.
<P>
	It is wonderful news that our seniors are living longer and 
healthier lives. However with this fact comes the realization that 
our social programs must change.
<P>
	Unfortunately, although the Minister of Human Resources 
Development promised change to our social system two years ago, 
we are still waiting. Why is he still compiling evidence when our 
government's experts have had papers written on the subject for 
years now? Is he hoping that through more and more consultation 
he can stall any meaningful change until after the next election?
<P>
	I wonder when politicians will realize that Canadian voters only 
expect their politicians to do their best while spending the 
Canadian taxpayers' dollars wisely. If the government starts to 
show that responsibility and accountability are major 
considerations in any social reforms program the government 
initiates, the Canadian public will be supportive. If politicians do 
their job there is nothing to fear from voters. When politicians do 
not do their jobs, force unwanted legislation on Canadian voters, 
appoint friends and party faithful to high positions, keep Canadian 
citizens dependent rather than helping them to be independent and 
productive, Canadians lose faith in their politicians.
<P>
<B>(1355)</B>
<P>
	Our human resources minister said it in his article ``Breaking 
Down Barriers'' in <I>The Hill Times</I> of August 31, 1995:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>By changing nothing, we are condemning people to the same old rut, the same 
old cycle of dependency which has been holding people back for years. And 
what is worse by ignoring fiscal imperative, it won't be long before the 
international financial community is going to come in and dictate those changes 
for us.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	If he thinks this way, why is he doing nothing? The Liberal 
government promised that by the fall of 1994 it would implement 
comprehensive reform of Canada's social programs. Instead, in 
October 1994 the Minister of Human Resources Development 
issued a paper ``Social Security in Canada''. To date no meaningful 
legislative changes have been introduced. The minister has also 
promised that a comprehensive paper on aging including pensions 
will be issued by the end of 1995.
<P>
	The Reform Party has a proposal for seniors to look at. It is 
responsible social reform, taking a look at reforming the Canada 
pension plan to secure retirement years for all Canadians.
<P>
	We recognize and listen to all the experts, including the chief 
actuary for Canada who states that CPP will be exhausted by 2015. 
He predicts that CPP will be gone in 20 years. What is to become of 
the millions of Canadians at that time who are currently 
contributing to the unsustainable black hole? What happens to the 
next generation with no hope of receiving its benefits?
<P>
	The groundwork for the Reform Party's revision of Canada's 
social policies was outline in the taxpayers' budget of February 
1995, a blueprint for achieving both fiscal and social security for 
Canadians in the 21st century.
<P>
	I wish there was time to go over Reform's four-point plan which 
addresses the seriousness of the upcoming pension crisis in 
Canada. Basically it deals with protection of seniors' benefits, 
recognition bonds, super RRSPs and survivors' benefits.

	<B>Mr. Leon E. Benoit (Vegreville, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, a short

from the beauty of the Island and the friendliness of the people I 
could not help but notice the political oppression of the system in 
Atlantic Canada.
<P>
	Politicians use their positions to garner support through 
patronage and threats. For example, one day I met a provincial 
cabinet minister and informed him of a public meeting planned for 
later the same day. The minister appeared that night not to attend 
the meeting but to find out who else was attending. More than one 
person turned and walked out the door when they saw the minister.
<P>
	If the people of the Island cannot openly express political beliefs 
and attend a meeting without fear of reprisal, we must challenge 
the system under which Islanders live.

alternative, an alternative that will allow them to break free from

	<B>Mr. John Godfrey (Don Valley West, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
statistics are staggering. One and a half million Canadians are 
diabetic. The disease grows at a  rate of 6 per cent per year. By the 
year 2004 experts predict that one in four Canadians over the age of 
45 will have developed the disease.
<P>
	November is Diabetes Awareness Month in Canada. Most people 
do not realize that diabetes is the leading contributor to heart 
disease, stroke, kidney failure and blindness. Furthermore, most 
people incorrectly believe that insulin is a cure. Across Canada we 
spend $200 per person annually to treat diabetes and diabetes 
related illnesses. That totals $5 billion in government health 
expenses alone.
<P>
	I commend the Juvenile Diabetes Foundation for its efforts in 
this, the 25th year since its formation, for continuing to fight for a 
cure to this disease.
<P>

awareness and dollars to make sure that the slogan of the 1990s is 
achieved and truly make this the decade of a cure.

	<B>Ms. Jean Augustine (Etobicoke-Lakeshore, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, today we commemorate the adoption of the UN 
Convention on the Rights of the Child.
<P>
	In 1989 Canada and other member countries of the United 
Nations gathered together to develop a set of formal obligations to 
the world's children. At that time a standard was set for nations 
with the best interests of the child being the primary concern in all 
actions relating to children.
<P>
	The government takes seriously its responsibilities to better the 
lives of Canadian children. As Canadians we must be vigilant to 
ensure that the values and guarantees in the Convention on the 
Rights of the Child are respected.

as it can possibly be.

	<B>Mr. Werner Schmidt (Okanagan Centre, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
last week I spent some time knocking on the doors of constituents.
<P>
	I asked people what was of concern to them now, halfway 
through the mandate. Three issues were stated most frequently. 
Several seniors said: ``I'm afraid to go out on the street alone in my 
neighbourhood. Several years ago I felt no threat for my own safety 
as I walked to see my neighbour. Today I either take a cab, my car 
or ask someone to come with me. Can't you do something that will 
discourage the criminals?''
<P>
	The second issue was: ``When will the government get its 
spending under control? I am worried that when I reach retirement 
age there won't be any money left for me''.
<P>
	The third issue came from a 16-year-old. He quoted Winston 
Churchill: ``Democracy is the worst system ever invented except 
for all the rest''. He talked about the problems of the Quebec 
referendum balloting and said: ``We need to tell the government to 
do everything it can to punish the guilty ones and to make sure that 
we take all possible precautions to prevent it from ever happening 
again''.
<P>
	That is what the people are saying. I challenge the Prime 
Minister and every MP to get on with the Canadian agenda.

	<B>Mr. Chris Axworthy (Saskatoon-Clark's Crossing, NDP):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, last Thursday I had the honour to be invited by the 
Metis Nation of Saskatchewan to join them to commemorate the 
110th anniversary of the hanging of Louis Riel, a most important 
date on the Metis calendar.
<P>
	That the Metis community would come together to mark one of 
the gravest crimes ever committed by the Canadian government 
against one of its leaders says a lot about the determination and the 
patience of the Metis people.
<P>
	To some degree history has put Riel's contributions to Canada 
into perspective. The House has pardoned him of the crime for 
which he was executed and now he is rightfully recognized as a 
Father of Confederation. While we have made some retribution to 
Riel's memory we have failed as a nation to properly recognize the 
role that the Metis have had in building this country and their 
rightful role in its future.
<P>
	Riel was twice elected to sit as a member of this House and it is 
an honour to be in the same House as someone whose commitment 
to justice and to the west was so firm.
<P>
	Last Thursday's ceremony was a reminder of the continuing 
struggle for justice that the Metis people are waging and the need 
on the part of Canada to redress the years of injustice. Each of us in 
this House has an important role to play in that struggle.

<P>
<B>(1405)</B>
<P>
	Unable to develop a policy that meets the traditional demands of 
Quebecers-demands that they had been denying for years-the 
best that these ministers can think of is to disguise their failure to 
act by striking one committee after another.
<P>
	First, they announced the establishment of a phoney committee 
on national unity, but the ministers who were to sit on this 
committee did not know that they were members of the committee. 
They did not even know what their mandate was.
<P>
	Then, a shadow committee on economic growth and 
employment was established. Two years after taking office, the 
federal ministers have decided that the time has come to start 
tackling the problem of unemployment. More committees and still 
no action. This reeks of improvisation.

across Canada are hosting a variety of activities and events to 
celebrate children and their families.
<P>
	In the words of Dr. Benjamin Spock ``children are made to 
love''. Parents love children because they remember being loved so 
much by their own parents. And despite all the hard work, taking 
care of children and seeing them grow and develop into fine people 
gives most parents their greatest satisfaction in life. To reflect on

complicity in the degrading politics of an undemocratic, 
unaccountable institution.

	The other place consumes over $40 million a year from hard

it just a rubber stamp for bad legislation?

	In the last few days the justice minister has stated that he will not 
accept any amendments to Bill C-68 which might be proposed by 
the Senate. A few weeks ago he also said that Senators should get

that we have a responsibility to ensure that they are raised in an 
adequate environment conducive to proper growth and 
development.
<P>
	In Canada, a country that calls itself the best in the world, more 
than one million children live in poverty. For a child, to be born 
poor also means facing higher risks of emotional and physical 
health problems because it clearly makes them more vulnerable to 
the consequences of poverty.

	We have a responsibility to preserve the well-being of those

that children do not have to go through some of the adjustment 
problems associated with the teenage years. This, in turn, will have

the Prime Minister, who is experiencing a severe panic attack. We 
now know that if the yes side had won the referendum, the Prime 
Minister would have rejected the democratic choice made by 
Quebecers.
<P>
	The Prime Minister also said that he would take all necessary 
means to ensure that Quebecers are no longer consulted through a 
referendum on the issue of sovereignty. These two statements alone 
confirm an absolute lack of political ethics on the part of the Prime 
Minister and his entourage. But the Prime Minister went even 
further when he said that CBC's information services do not 
comply with their mandate, which should be to actively promote 
Canadian unity.
<P>
	The Prime Minister's lack of respect for the public consultation 
process and for those who hold different views clearly confirms 
that he turns his back on democracy when it takes a direction with

	The one thing that saved the Minister of Finance and allowed

Canadian taxpayers for another $7.3 billion; $2.8 billion of that 
was applied to the ever-rising cost of servicing our debt and $4.5 
billion was used to reduce the deficit.
<P>
	Is it the intention of the Liberal government to balance the 
budget on the backs of the taxpayers? If it is, taxpayers need to 
know the costs. Their taxes will double in the next 10 years in order 
to pay for the ever-rising cost of the debt while reducing the deficit

	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the government, if there is still one over there.
<P>
	Having already implied that he did not intend to respect the 
outcome of the referendum, the Prime  Minister stated a second 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16536"> 16536 </A></B>
<P>
time that he wanted to stop Quebecers from holding a second 
referendum on the future of Quebec if they wished to. In a repeat 
performance later, he criticized the CBC's lack of partisan 
involvement in the referendum campaign. The CBC was too 
impartial for the Prime Minister's taste during the referendum.
<P>
	My question is directed to the Deputy Prime Minister or 
whoever might be so kind as to reply. Are we to understand that the 
Prime Minister wishes not only to stop Quebecers from deciding 
their future on another occasion they deem appropriate but also to 
control the information they will get from the CBC?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Finestone (Secretary of State (Multiculturalism) 
(Status of Women), Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, I believe that we need to 
stress that the Prime Minister may perhaps be completely right in 
this, but with respect to the comment from my colleague, he is also 
aware that CBC President Perrin Beatty has set up a committee to 
examine our Prime Minister's comments, which I feel are clearly 
justified, and the response will be forthcoming in due course.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, since the 
hon. secretary of state does me the honour of a reply to my 
questions, I shall ask her another.
<P>
	Since Perrin Beatty, in keeping with the operating provisions of 
the CBC, has set up a committee to assess the professional conduct 
of CBC and Radio-Canada journalists and the manner in which the 
news was presented, does she not think that the Prime Minister 
would have been wiser to wait before nailing the CBC?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Finestone (Secretary of State (Multiculturalism) 
(Status of Women), Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, as my colleague must be 
aware, the mission of the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation and 
Radio Canada International is, and I quote:``[-] to reflect major 
current events and contribute to the exercise of 
democracy''-something you and others need to learn about-``to 
the affirmation of the sovereignty of the country and to helping the 
various regions to come to know more about each other, and to 
more accurately reflect the national identity''. This has not been 
denied by our Prime Minister and this is how we promote all of our 
undertakings.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the hon. 
secretary of state is rather surprising. She indicates to the 
opposition that we ought to be learning what democracy is all 
about, while what is at issue here is the behaviour of the Prime 
Minister, who finds that the CBC was too impartial in the 
referendum. Amazing. Amazing.
<P>
	Does the hon. secretary of state not consider, when a Prime 
Minister initially indicates his intention not to recognize the 
outcome of a democratic exercise, then tells us that he want to see 
no more democratic consultations in Quebec, and then again 
decides that the CBC ought to  stop being impartial when 
broadcasting information, that these are three somewhat 
disquieting actions within a democracy?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Finestone (Secretary of State (Multiculturalism)

about democracy, when it comes to talking about how language 
should be understood or one's accent, when it comes to discussing 
who has the right to vote and the weight of that vote, I do not think 
there are any exercises in democracy that need to be taken by this

<P>
	Last week, the Deputy Prime Minister clearly established a link 
between the funding received by Radio-Canada and its news 
coverage. She said it did not make sense for us to pay the cost of 
running the corporation when there was no commitment to 
Canadian unity.
<P>
	Are we to understand that the government wants to tie 
Radio-Canada's budget to a partisan performance with respect to 
news coverage?
<P>

<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Finestone (Secretary of State (Multiculturalism)

my hon. colleague would recognize we are in a significantly 
changing environment with respect to telecommunications, 
broadcasting, film distribution, marketing, et cetera.
<P>
	The government spends in excess of $1 billion for 
Radio-Canada, CBC, Telefilm Canada and the National Film 
Board. Perhaps that money could be spent more succinctly, more 
successfully and in a more focused way. It is for that reason that a 
committee was set up by the minister responsible for Canadian

	<B>Miss Deborah Grey (Beaver River, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
Airbus scandal provides yet another example of what happens 
when a government buries its head in the sand. The most 
outrageous aspect of this Airbus scandal is not Brian Mulroney's 
$50 million lawsuit, nor is it the righteous indignation coming from 
his Sherbrooke sidekick.
<P>
	The most outrageous aspect of this entire thing is that it took 
articles in a Swiss newspaper and a German magazine to convince 
this government to take action. None of these are new allegations. 
The RCMP was investigating this matter back in 1989. Paul 
Palango was naming names in 1994 and the CBC was uncovering 
new and damaging evidence as recently as this March.
<P>
	My question is for the Minister of Justice. Why did it take the 
work of a German newspaper to get this government to act on the 
Airbus scandal?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Herb Gray (Leader of the Government in the House of 
Commons and Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the RCMP has been active for months, as it has confirmed, in 
looking into these allegations. It has been doing its job. I hope the 
hon. member in her questions will express support for the work of 
the RCMP rather than this unjustified scepticism.
<P>
	<B>Miss Deborah Grey (Beaver River, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
support the RCMP, especially in its guarding of 24 Sussex, part of 
its job.
<P>
	Not all governments have been asleep at the switch in this 
scandal. According to the federal government and in contrast to it 
the American embassy has been hard at work, having already 
accumulated a fat file on this subject which includes actual names, 
timelines and Swiss bank account numbers.
<P>
	It seems to me the Minister of Justice could save Canadian 
taxpayers a great deal of time and money by simply walking across 
Wellington Street and asking the Americans for a photocopy of 
their file.
<P>
	In order to help get to the bottom of this matter will the Minister 
of Justice make a formal request to have the American government 
share all relevant information and material it has gathered on the 
Airbus deal?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Herb Gray (Leader of the Government in the House of 
Commons and Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
I am sure the RCMP will do everything necessary to pursue its 
inquiries. I suggest the hon. member do more in constructing her 
questions than to base them on the Insider column of the Ottawa 
<I>Sun</I>.
<P>
	<B>Miss Deborah Grey (Beaver River, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, there is 
more at stake here than some sort of hilarity from the solicitor 
general. Things have been bad enough in that department already 
these past couple of weeks. If anyone is being facetious here it is 
he.
<P>
	The Canadian people deserve better from the Liberal 
government. What we have here are all the makings of a Stevie 
Cameron sequel. In writing about this Prime Minister's approach to 
governing, she might entitle that sequel ``I am not aware of 
anything''.
<P>

<P>
	The members opposite were aware of the Airbus scandal for five 
years when they were in opposition and have been aware of it for 
the two years they have been in government.
<P>
	Will the government commit to making public, totally public at 
the earliest possible date, every relevant aspect of this smelly 
Airbus deal?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Herb Gray (Leader of the Government in the House of 
Commons and Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
as the hon. member has confirmed, the government has been, 
through the RCMP, properly looking into these allegations. This 
began after it took office.
<P>
	With respect to making matters public, surely the hon. member 
does not want to prejudice the investigations and inquiries already 
under way. If she wants to have these inquiries and investigations 
properly carried out, she should not suggest that things be done 
which might prejudice the success of those inquiries.

friendly comments in recent weeks.
<P>
	By refusing to specify a certain percentage of Canadian content 
in the contract for search and rescue helicopters, the Minister of 
National Defence has paved the way for a procurement policy that 
from now on would eliminate any Canadian content requirements 
from purchase contracts for military equipment. In so doing, the 
government is directly jeopardizing the existence of the defence 
industry in Canada and Quebec.
<P>
	What explanation does the minister have for the fact that barely 
two months ago, he awarded a $2 billion contract, without tender, 
to a company in Ontario and that now, in the case of the search and 
rescue helicopters, he will call for tenders without a Canadian 
content requirement, when the aerospace industry happens to be 
concentrated in the Montreal region? Another example of the

	<B>Mr. Cliff Breitkreuz (Yellowhead, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
minister of agriculture has stated he will not recognize the outcome 
of the wheat and barley plebiscite currently taking place in the 
province of Alberta.
<P>
	Why is the minister ignoring the democratic rights of farmers to 
choose how they want to market their wheat and barley for export?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Ralph E. Goodale (Minister of Agriculture and 
Agri-Food, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, what I have said is I do not regard 
this plebiscite in Alberta as the be all and end all on the issue of 
wheat and barley marketing. I say that for the obvious reason that 
grain marketing of this kind is under the jurisdiction of the federal 
government. It involves farmers in British Columbia, Alberta, 
Saskatchewan, Manitoba and in some cases in portions of a corner 
of Ontario.
<P>
	The issue by definition cannot be resolved by one partial 
plebiscite in one province alone.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Cliff Breitkreuz (Yellowhead, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
Prime Minister during the 1993 election campaign promised a 
producer plebiscite on marketing barley and promised he would 
honour that result.
<P>
	Right after the election the minister of agriculture said he 
favours giving farmers a voice through plebiscites which are, to 
quote the minister ``the most appropriate vehicle by which to 
determine what farmers' preferences are''.
<P>
	Why did the Prime Minister and the agriculture minister promise 
producers a democratic voice when it is clear they had no intention 
of honouring that promise?
<P>
<B>(1430 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Hon. Ralph E. Goodale (Minister of Agriculture and 
Agri-Food, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, obviously we have not ruled out 
the notion of a plebiscite in due course if that turns out to be an 
appropriate vehicle to resolve this particular issue. At the same 
time we have observed the difficulties that flow with plebiscites 
which can in fact make a difficult situation even more divisive 
rather than resolve a problem.
<P>
	With reference to the remarks made in 1993, both the Prime 
Minister and I indicated that the jurisdiction of the Canadian Wheat 
Board should not be altered in the absence of some kind of voting 
mechanism among producers. That is a far cry from advocating a 
change in the Canadian Wheat Board.

if such an event happened-and I have expressed in the House

<P>
	In my riding the police are investigating a report of sexual 
assault against an eight-year old girl by two boys under twelve. 
Because of their ages the Young Offenders Act does not cover these 
crimes, nor do Bills C-41 and C-37.
<P>
	On this morning's news, probably because of National Child's 
Day a priest in Ottawa spoke of his concern about the younger and 
younger ages of Canada's young offenders.
<P>
	What does the minister intend to do about it, to hold children and 
their parents responsible for their children's criminal actions?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney General 
of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, just this morning I had occasion to 
appear before the House committee on justice and legal affairs. I 
was the first witness in a comprehensive review of the Young 
Offenders Act the committee is now undertaking. We spoke exactly 
to this issue, the question of the age of the children to which the 
Young Offenders Act applies. I invited the committee to examine 
how we should deal with the cases of crimes by children younger 
than 12 to determine how best to ensure that the interests of those 
children in society are taken into account.
<P>
	I am not certain that the answer is simply to extend the 
application of the Young Offenders Act because we are dealing 
with children of a very young age. I have asked the committee to 
look at the evidence, to hear from witnesses and to make 
recommendations on how best to deal with this, if only by ensuring 
that in the provinces, between us, the levels of government have 
appropriate ways to respond to these situations, look after these 
children, deal with the families that produce them and ensure 
public safety.
<P>
<B>(1435 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Daphne Jennings (Mission-Coquitlam, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, if we do not deal seriously with these young offenders, we 
are not helping these young offenders. It is a horrific crime. 
Canadians are sick about this happening in their communities. 
When we ignore the crimes of children, we ignore their victims. 
We ignore those children who are committing the crimes and we 
ignore helping them.
<P>
	Is the minister in favour of changing the ages in the Young 
Offenders Act to make young offenders responsible for their 
criminal actions?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney General 
of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, two of the hon. member's 
colleagues are on the committee before which I appeared this 
morning. I have expressly asked the committee to consider the very 
question she has raised. I want the committee to hear the evidence, 
consider that evidence and make recommendations that the 
committee believes are in the public interest.
<P>
	I must also point out in answer to the question asked that this 
government has already acted to strengthen the Young Offenders 
Act. With Bill C-37 which comes into force 10 days from now, the 
Young Offenders Act will be strengthened to deal more effectively 
with serious crimes of violence that most concern the public.

the hon. member advocating?

	On the one hand the member is asking for an expedited

a basic difference is that it is one of a series of prisons for women

women confined to one, single, outmoded facility in Kingston, 
Ontario.

	By having this series of regional prisons women will be closer to

that fishermen who are in difficult circumstances are not impacted, 
we brought that forward. We put in place a licence freeze for all of 
those affected by the groundfish crisis. We have already said to the 
fishermen in British Columbia who have been affected by the 
decline in salmon runs that there will be no dramatic increase in 
fees. We are saying to those who make very large incomes in a way 
which is progressive and fair that they ought to pay a little more for 
the privilege of those very large incomes.

from the federal level of $220 million to the province of Quebec 
under the EPF, CAP and equalization.

anglophones who listen to it. I am a very good example.

minister is an excellent example, I am sure.
<P>
	The point being that there are already all kinds of services 
provided through cable and over satellite. We do not need 
dedicated stations in all these communities.
<P>
	The CBC, Telefilm Canada and the NFB are undergoing a 
mandate review and will be reporting to the minister soon. The 
people who should be giving this mandate are the taxpayers of the 
country. They already understand that the level of funding in any 
public enterprise should be based on how many people in this case 
are viewing it.
<P>
	Is the government prepared to cut spending for services that 
taxpayers do not support? If so, will it direct the CBC to make its 
cuts accordingly?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Finestone (Secretary of State (Multiculturalism) 
(Status of Women), Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the government and the 
minister in charge have made it eminently clear that the changing 
circumstances and the economic aspects of the CBC, the National 
Film  Board and Telefilm are all to be taken into account as the 
mandate is reviewed. The CRTC is involved as well.
<P>
	From that perspective, the hon. member might well wait for the 
results which should be announced shortly.

	<B>Mr. Chris Axworthy (Saskatoon-Clark's Crossing, NDP):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Human Resources 
Development.
<P>
	I was looking through <I>Hansard</I> and found that when the budget 
was debated in 1991 the then member for Winnipeg South Centre 
criticized the cuts by the provincial government in health care, 
social programs and post-secondary education. He said:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>As a result, the ability to have any kind of national system of education and 
health care now stands in jeopardy.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	He also said that these cuts cut the very fundamental institutions 
on which people depend and that they were being dismantled.
<P>
	Since the minister was so critical of measures considerably less 
harsh than those his government has taken, could he say why the 
cuts to education, health care and social programs, much deeper 
than the last government's, are so good when the last government's 
cuts were so bad?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Human Resources 
Development and Minister of Western Economic 
Diversification, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, we have made it very clear 
from the last budget that one way to restore the country to a form of 
economic health is to make sure there is more integrity and 
stability in federal financing.
<P>
	His home province has been able to achieve a balanced budget. 
We are still on track to do that but it will take some time because 
the previous government, of which I was quite critical, did not take 
the measures that were necessary when it should have to ensure a 
proper formulation of a fiscal plan that would allow us to have 
good economic investment.
<P>
	The proof of that is very clear. Since the two years of coming 
into office we have created over 500,000 full time permanent jobs. 
The best way to deal with the problems of low income and of social 
insecurity is to get people a job. That is what our last budget was all 
about.

Ken Saro-Wiwa.
<P>
	Canada took actions beyond that at the Commonwealth heads of 
government meeting in Auckland, New Zealand last week. Our

Commonwealth for a period of two years. This will be reviewed 
when Nigeria shows it has improved its democracy, respect for 
human rights and governance.

	<B>Hon. Diane Marleau (Minister of Health, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
it is with much sadness that we mourn the passing of a truly great 
Canadian, the hon. Justice Emmett Matthew Hall.
<P>
	We extend our deepest condolences to his family.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	It is with sadness that we mourn the passing of a great Canadian, 
the hon. Justice Emmett Matthew Hall, whose many achievements 
included being a founder of our health care system. He was also 
one of the keenest crusader for the system.
<P>
	We extend our deepest condolences to his family.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Justice Hall led a long and distinguished legal career, becoming 
Chief Justice in Saskatchewan and later serving on the Supreme 
Court of Canada. He was noted for his forward thinking ideas and 
keen sense of equity which resulted in his being named a 
Companion of the Order of Canada and receiving other tributes 
including numerous honorary degrees, distinguished titles and 
select memberships.
<P>
	Of his many achievements Justice Hall may best be known as a 
founder and lifelong crusader for our medicare system. In 1961, 
prior to the introduction of the first provincial plan for medical care 
insurance in Saskatchewan, the federal government established the 
Royal Commission on Health Services, chaired by Mr.  Justice 
Hall. Its mandate was to inquire into and report on existing 
facilities and future needs for health services for Canadians and to 
assess the resources required to provide these services.
<P>
	The commission report, published in 1964, recommended 
Canada should introduce the legislative organizational and 
financial frameworks necessary to ensure that health services 
would be available to all residents without barriers. The 
commission also called for universal and comprehensive coverage 
on uniform terms and conditions, in all provinces, regardless of 
age, condition or ability to pay.
<P>
	These recommendations formed the basis of the federal 
medicare act proclaimed in 1968. This act, which established a 
conditional cost sharing program, empowered the federal health 
minister to make financial contributions to those provinces which 
operated medical care insurance plans that met certain minimum 
criteria: comprehensiveness, universality, portability and public 
administration.
<P>
<B>(1505 )</B>
<P>
	By 1972 every province and territory had established medical 
care insurance plans in addition to their hospital insurance 
programs, and the two main features of Canada's universal health 
care system were in place from coast to coast.
<P>
	Justice Hall summed up the need for a national publicly funded 
medicare system in these words: ``The only thing more expensive 
than good health care is inadequate or no health care''.
<P>
	The guarding principle of health care in Canada is as meaningful 
now as it was when the system began. Justice Hall's support for this 
system never waned or wavered.
<P>
	In 1979 when the federal government asked that the status of 
publicly financed health insurance programs in Canada be 
reviewed Justice Hall again accepted the call and chaired the 
review which also bears his name. After months of public hearings 
and hundreds of briefs from various consumer groups, individuals 
and health care organizations, Justice Hall released his report, 
Canada's national-provincial health program for the 1980s, ``A 
Commitment For Renewal''.
<P>
	Once again reflecting a broad Canadian consensus, the report 
called for a renewed national commitment to the principles of 
medicare. Justice Hall could find no one, not any government or 
individual, not the medical profession nor any organization not in 
favour of medicare.
<P>
	On extra billing by doctors, Justice Hall said it was inequitable 
because it not only denies access to the poor, it also taxes sick 
persons who, besides paying premiums, are already paying the 
major cost of the system through their taxes.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16545"> 16545 </A></B>
<P>
	Canadians owe a great debt of gratitude to Justice Emmett Hall. 
In his report Justice Emmett Hall states: ``Canadians understand 
the full meaning of the hospital insurance and medical care acts. 
They said through these two acts that we as a society are aware 
that the trauma of illness, the pain of surgery, the slow decline 
to death are burdens enough for the human being to bear without 
the added burden of medical or hospital bills penalizing the patient 
at the moment of vulnerability''.
<P>
	The fundamental principle of medicare is equity. All Canadians 
are treated the same according to medical need regardless of their 
ability to pay. This recognizes and fosters the compassionate nature 
of our people. Our universal health care system is constitutive of 
our identity. Clearly it is part of who we are as a nation. It is the 
outward manifestation of fundamental shared values, the values of 
justice and caring. All Canadians pay homage to this great 
Canadian.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The people of Canada are greatly indebted to the late Justice 
Emmett Hall.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Pauline Picard (Drummond, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would 
also like to pay tribute to Emmett Hall, who, among other things, 
chaired the Royal Commission on Health Services from 1961 to 
1964. Mr. Hall was one of those who contributed to inspire the 
debate that had already started on an issue under consideration and 
discussion in most Canadian provinces: the establishment of a 
health system accessible to all, regardless of one's socio-economic 
circumstances.
<P>
	This principle, oft mentioned and presented as a basic aspect of 
any society that wants to be fair and equitable, was also part and 
parcel of the discussions that were taking place at the provincial 
level at the time. Based on respect for human dignity, the principle 
of accessibility met with the agreement of all primary stakeholders 
and players in the health sector.
<P>
	I am therefore pleased and honoured to pay tribute to a man like 
Emmett Hall, who participated in this reflection of major 
importance to preserve the dignity of all Canadians. We must 
however be careful not to forget the efforts made by Mr. Hall and 
by the other men and women who participated in this extensive 
reflection, which revolutionized the concept of health care and the 
way that services were provided, nor the message they left us.
<P>
	No one, let alone the federal government, has the right to 
jeopardize such a system. But the government certainly seems to be 
bent on making decisions that will have a disastrous impact on the 
quality of health care and services.
<P>
<B>(1510)</B>
<P>
	It is therefore essential that serious thought be given to the 
decision this government is about to make, to fully assess its real 
impact.
<P>
	As you do so, think about the women and men who, like Mr. 
Hall, were in favour of the establishment of a health system 
accessible to all, regardless of their socio-economic circumstances.
<P>
	I am joined by my colleagues of the Bloc Quebecois in extending 
my deepest condolences to the family of Emmett Hall.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Sharon Hayes (Port Moody-Coquitlam, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, today I rise on behalf of the Reform Party to recognize a 
Canadian who was not afraid to leave his mark on the pages of our 
history. Emmett Hall was a man who led, a leader who asked not 
why, but why not. Today I join with colleagues from all parties to 
pay respect to his memory.
<P>
	Emmett Hall had an outstanding record of personal achievement. 
After a successful and long career in law, at age 57 he rose to new 
and increasing challenges as Chief Justice of Saskatchewan, 
Supreme Court judge, royal commissioner and finally elder 
statesmen.
<P>
	It was his Supreme Court judgment in 1975 that set the stage for 
negotiations on Indian land claims. The Ontario education system 
was profoundly changed with the Hall-Dennis report of 1968.
<P>
	Even in retirement in 1977 he led the commission that addressed 
the challenging need to balance affordable rail transportation with 
small town survival in central Canada. Even at the age of 90 he was 
mediating a logging and land claims dispute between the B.C. 
government and two Indian bands.
<P>
	Historians, however, will recognize his greatest contribution as 
the chairman of a royal commission whose report led to the 
introduction of our national medicare system through the Hall 
report of 1964.
<P>
	Medicare to this day continues to be a federal cost shared 
program. It is and should be the best health care safety net in the 
world. It was made in Canada for Canadians, first on a provincial 
level and then federally through the Medical Care Act, and it is 
now mandated to bring comprehensive coverage for health service, 
publicly funded, portable across Canada and universally accessible 
to all Canadians regardless of ability to pay.
<P>
	I would be remiss today to neglect to mention that the 
confidence of Canadians in medicare is severely eroding. Cutbacks 
have forced health care professionals, governments and the public 
to take time to address, analyse and protect this aspect of our life 
and country.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="16546"> 16546 </A></B>
<P>
	Emmett Hall was never afraid to challenge the status quo. Today 
we recognize a man who bravely put forward ideas to propose 
change, not for change itself but to bring about a better solution.
<P>
	All that Canadians value in medicare is recognized today in his 
memory. His vision of health care reform was that it result in the 
highest quality health care for all Canadians. That challenge 
continues and needs new Canadian solutions once more in these 
times of increased pressures on public finances.
<P>
	Our condolences go out to his family. We salute with others 
today a great prairie pioneer and statesman.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chris Axworthy (Saskatoon-Clark's Crossing, NDP):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, it is indeed an honour for me to rise today on behalf of 
my colleagues in the New Democratic Party caucus to pay tribute 
to one of Canada's and Saskatchewan's greatest sons, Mr. Justice 
Emmett Hall.
<P>
	It perhaps seems trivial at a time like this to simply talk about a 
great man's achievements and to reiterate the many honours 
achieved in his lifetime. As the Very Reverend Len Morand said in 
delivering the homily at Mr. Justice Hall's funeral service in 
Saskatoon, if we were to simply list the man's honours he would 
have more medals than a Russian general.
<P>
	As important as these honours may be, there is something more 
important and more enduring for each of us to take from Justice 
Hall's life. He was a visionary and a pioneer. In his professional 
and personal life he created many landmarks which now serve to 
mark our course as a great country, as a caring and compassionate 
country; guide posts and landmarks which still guide us today.
<P>
	He is perhaps best known for his historic and heroic Royal 
Commission on Health Services which paved the way for the rest 
of Canadians to enjoy the universal health care service that was 
born in Saskatchewan.
<P>
	Even then, in 1964, Justice Hall was looking far into the future, 
talking about the second stage of medicare, about enhanced 
services to seniors, dental care, pharmacare and much of what we 
in Saskatchewan now call the wellness model.
<P>
<B>(1515 )</B>
<P>
	He foresaw a Canada with an ongoing, permanent commitment 
to a universal and improving health care system. He served as an 
inspiration to those who continued to battle for just that.
<P>
	It would be unfair to ignore some of Justice Hall's other great 
accomplishments. His sense of justice and his belief in our sense of 
community guided him to make a number of other remarkable 
changes to this nation and to our culture.
<P>
	He was an early advocate of the equality of women. He set that 
concept into law with his precedent setting 1961 decision which 
ruled that a homemaker's contribution to  the household was no 
less than that of the income earner. It was groundbreaking in 1961 
and still is guiding us today.
<P>
	A religious and spiritual person, Mr. Justice Hall also believed it 
was important to keep promises. His courageous Nisga'a land 
claim decision of the 1970s helped the nation keep its promise. It 
was courageous in the 1970s and still is guiding us today.
<P>
	There were, of course, many political leaders in attendance at 
Justice Hall's funeral service in Saskatoon last week. The Premier 
of Saskatchewan was there. The Minister of Health and the 
Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food were there. I hope that each 
of them used the occasion to commit himself or herself to the 
vision of a caring nation of supportive communities of which Mr. 
Justice Hall so ably spoke and for which he so determinedly fought.
<P>
	More important than the dignitaries who were in attendance is 
the fact that hundreds of ordinary people joined in to pay tribute to 
a man whose many deeds have touched the lives of every Canadian.
<P>
	One of the scriptural readings at the service was the letter from 
Timothy, in which he talks of fighting the good fight. Justice 
Emmett Hall committed his life to fighting that good fight and it is 
up to each of us to continue it.
<P>

DEVELOPMENT ACT</A></H3>
	The House resumed consideration of the motion that Bill C-96, 
an act to establish the Department of Human Resources 
Development and to amend and repeal certain related acts, be read 
the second time and referred to a committee; and of the 
amendment.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Jean Augustine (Parliamentary Secretary to Prime 
Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise to speak on second reading of 
Bill C-96, a bill that deals primarily with administrative 
reorganization.
<P>
	Canadians have made it clear that they want government and 
government services to operate in a more efficient and cost 
effective manner. The service delivery network initiative is an 
ambitious effort to respond to this message.
<P>
	I will focus on the service delivery network because this is a key 
part of the government's overall plan to renew and revitalize 
federal programs and services. The service delivery network 
should be viewed in the same context as Bill C-96, the Department 
of Human Resources Development Act.
<P>
	Does Bill C-96 contemplate new programs? No. Does it create 
new authorities? No. Does it alter jurisdictional arrangements? By 
no means. Bill C-96 is not a policy initiative aimed at new 
authorities or new programs. Rather it is a means to improve the 
delivery of programs and services while saving taxpayers' dollars.
<P>
	It introduces creative and innovative delivery mechanisms. The 
service delivery network is a vital part of this policy initiative. It 
looks to the future instead of to the past. It puts people first by 
providing comprehensive service at the local and community level. 
The evolution of this service delivery network would not have been 
possible without a strong commitment to meet the needs of 
Canadians without jeopardizing the economic and social future.
<P>
<B>(1525)</B>
<P>
	We firmly believe that it is possible to enhance the quality of 
services to the public while delivering those services in a more cost 
effective manner. Indeed, this approach has been tested within the 
Department of Human Resources Development.
<P>
	Through innovation and creativity, the Department of Human 
Resources Development has been able to create a network of some 
700 outlets across the country. When the network is fully opera-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16549"> 16549 </A></B>
<P>
tional, it will ensure access to  human resource development 
service for a full 97 per cent of working Canadians.
<P>
	In concrete terms, I want to stress that these improvements will 
mean applications for old age security will take only a half a day 
instead of eight days to process. The processing of Canadian 
pension plan applications will take one day instead of 15 days. 
Canadians from all walks of life will find it easier to access 
services and information and some services will be available 24 
hours a day.
<P>
	As well, the network will deliver a broader array of programs 
and services. Employment counselling and other employment 
services, unemployment insurance, federal labour programs, 
income security programs such as the Canada pension plan and old 
age security, will be provided at the more than 300 human resource 
centres across the country.
<P>
	In addition, up to 400 self-serve electronic kiosks will be located 
in strategic sites, such as Outreach offices, libraries and municipal 
offices. In my constituency I am now working with HRD to ensure 
that we have three to five kiosks in our general area. They will 
provide access to job information, UI programs, CPP and OAS.
<P>
	Personnel assistants will be available at all but a few sites, 
meaning that for seniors personalized service will be available at 
four times as many points of service as is presently the case. There 
will be someone there to offer assistance to the seniors ready to use 
the kiosks.
<P>
	That is not all. Self-serve access through mail, computers, 
telephones and the Internet will continue to be expanded. As well, a 
new electronic labour exchange system is being tested. The system 
will connect job seekers to employers by computer.
<P>
	A system to allow unemployment insurance claimants to 
complete their report cards by telephone is operating on a pilot 
basis in Calgary and Sherbrooke.
<P>
	The genius of the self-service delivery network is its capacity to 
adapt to local realities. Through agreements with organizations 
such as the YMCA or YWCA and other service groups, the 
network permits community based delivery of services. This 
grassroots approach makes tremendous sense in a country as vast 
as Canada, where local circumstances can vary considerably.
<P>
	By tailoring programs and services to individual communities, 
in co-operation with Canadians, the department demonstrates 
wisdom and foresight. Partnership arrangements, such as 
co-location of offices and merging of services are being entered 
into with other federal agencies, provincial and municipal 
governments, and social service organizations outside government.
<P>
	All of this demonstrates the sensitivity and breadth of vision the 
government has brought to bear in designing this network. A great 
deal of thought and preparation went into its creation. The idea for 
this particular  initiative did not happen overnight. It grew out of 
our red book commitments to improve services and opportunities 
for Canadians.
<P>
	It began to take greater shape during the extensive social security 
reform consultations held with important stakeholders, business 
people, labour and community groups. Over and over, as we tour 
the country, Canadians delivered a clear and compelling message: 
get Canadians back to work, put more power into the hands of 
individuals to help themselves, remove unnecessary obstacles to 
Canada's social and economic prosperity.
<P>
<B>(1530 )</B>
<P>
	The service delivery network responds directly to the demands 
we heard. It achieves the twin goals of improved service and 
reduced cost. Clearly this is the kind of government renewal 
Canadians have demanded: better, more personal, more efficient, 
responsive, flexible, innovative and creative services, aimed at the 
individual needs of clients where they live, and it saves taxpayers' 
dollars.
<P>
	If there is any formula for its success it lies with the network's 
overriding focus on the people it serves. The network zeros in on 
local needs and priorities. It maintains personalized services for 
those who need help while increasing the number of access points. 
It also makes use of proven application of new technologies.
<P>
	Does it attempt to create new authorities or change the power of 
the federal government to initiate or administer programs of any 
sort? No. It is simply innovative, a more creative and responsible 
approach to delivering services to Canadians.
<P>
	Does it attempt to change existing jurisdictional provisions, as 
some members opposite would have us believe? Not at all. Existing 
agreements remain in place. Arrangements, partnerships, joint 
programs and so forth will continue to be negotiated as always. Our 
partners will be better able to achieve their own goals and 
objectives as a result of the service delivery network.
<P>
	This new service delivery network strengthens the community of 
shared interest across the country. Canadians have placed their trust 
in us to make the best possible use of our resources, both economic 
and human, and I call on all members of the House to understand 
this new delivery service.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Pauline Picard (Drummond, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, once 
again, I welcome the opportunity to rise in the House to defend the 
interests of those I represent. Today we are discussing Bill C-96, an 
act to establish the Department of Human Resources Development 
and to amend and repeal certain related acts. At first glance there is 
nothing to be worried about.
<P>
	According to the minister, the bill merely brings together 
elements of various departments under the  single name: 
Department of Human Resources Development. The stated purpose 
of this reorganization, to improve management of various services, 
is entirely praiseworthy, but unfortunately, we must point out that 
such bills are being used by the federal government to continue its 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16550"> 16550 </A></B>
<P>
attempts to encroach on the jurisdictions of Quebec and the other 
provinces. Unfortunately, these attempts are often successful.
<P>
	Less than a week ago, I rose to condemn another bill, C-95, 
which also turned out to be a direct attack on the prerogatives of the 
Government of Quebec. I strongly condemned this approach, and I 
must say that the situation today calls for much the same treatment.
<P>
	When we analyse Bill C-96, we see it is typical of a government 
that is discreetly trying to extend its powers, a government for 
whom provincial prerogatives are far from sacrosanct. In this 
respect, my colleague the hon. member for Mercier pointed out that 
coming hard on the heels of a vote in which Quebecers gave 
Canada a brief respite to shape up, Bill C-96 is an insult. How right 
she was. With this bill, the government is trying to legislate powers 
it never had under the constitution.
<P>
	For instance, in clause 6 we read that the powers of the minister 
are to be exercised with the objective ``of enhancing employment, 
encouraging equality and promoting social security''. Never mind 
the minister: encouraging equality and promoting social security 
were not part of the original legislation. Similarly, what about 
clauses 7 and 13, the former providing that the minister may 
``co-operate with provincial authorities with a view to the 
co-ordination of efforts made or proposed for preserving and 
improving human resources development''? Now that is a good 
example of the government's attitude to co-operation with the 
provinces.
<P>
<B>(1535)</B>
<P>
	When we see what it does with the suggestions and the 
consensus there, it is easy enough to believe. Clause 20 provides 
that the minister may, as part of his duties: ``-enter into 
agreements with a province or group of provinces, agencies of 
provinces, financial institutions and such other persons or bodies as 
the Minister considers appropriate''. This is what the government 
is calling decentralization, this circumventing of provincial 
jurisdiction and going directly to persons or bodies. This is what 
they call decentralization.
<P>
	Once again, despite what the Minister of Human Resources 
Development says, this clause enables him to enter into agreements 
with, as I have just indicated, a number of bodies and institutions 
and even with individuals. With this clause, the minister is giving 
himself the power to go over the heads of the provinces-this 
cannot be said often enough-and enter into agreements with 
whomever he deems appropriate.
<P>
	Do I need to point out that this does not appear in the original 
legislation? No clause in this bill provides that  the government 
should respect provincial jurisdiction. Bill C-95, which a number 
of my colleagues and I strongly criticized recently, to its credit, at 
least attempts to respect the provincial governments by precluding 
the possibility of its exercising ``any jurisdiction or control over 
any health authority operating under the laws of any province''.
<P>
	When we see the extent of the federal government's 
encroachment, even when it says it wants to respect areas of 
jurisdiction, we can easily imagine the situation had it not 
expressed its desire to do so.
<P>
	This bill definitely confirms the federal government's 
involvement in social and job programs. This fact is all the more 
obvious in the area of manpower training.
<P>
	The minister talks of a whole other sort of decentralization. He 
intimates that his aim is to give communities and individuals more 
manoeuvring room. It is clear, however, that Bill C-96 is a way to 
get around what the provinces and Quebec want in order to deal 
directly with the groups and individuals the minister considers 
appropriate, who will, of course, be subject to whatever standards 
he may wish to impose.
<P>
	The minister also talks of a single window. In this regard, the 
Quebec minister of employment, Louise Harel, said recently that 
Bill C-96 was the antithesis of the single window Quebec would 
like to establish by making the Société québécoise de 
développement de la main-d'oeuvre the primary intervenor in 
training matters. The SQDM is the embodiment of Quebec's 
consensus on the need for the Government of Quebec to be given 
full powers in manpower matters.
<P>
	Despite this, according to the federal documents <I>Le Devoir</I> cites 
in its November 10 issue, the federal government is apparently 
preparing to end its co-operation with the Société québécoise de 
développement de la main-d'oeuvre in order to deal directly with 
community organizations and private institutions that it will 
finance and that will be subject to its eligibility criteria.
<P>
	At a time when only the present Prime Minister and Pierre 
Trudeau still believe that further centralization is the solution to the 
multiple problems of federalism, it is not surprising that Bill C-96, 
although long ready, was not debated before the referendum.
<P>
	This government has a very disappointing record with 
employment and social services; more than two years have passed 
and there is as much unemployment and even more people on 
welfare, and the coming unemployment insurance reform, also 
long ready and also kept hidden to keep Quebecers from knowing 
the true intentions of the government, will only make its record 
even worse.
<P>
	Recently, in response to questions from the Leader of the 
Opposition on Bill C-96, the Minister of Human Resources 
Development replied that ``obviously the  Leader of the Opposition 
has not taken the time to read the bill''. To counter this pretentious 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16551"> 16551 </A></B>
<P>
statement, I would like to refer to a number of Quebec reactions to 
the federal announcement of its intent.
<P>
	The Société québécoise de développement de la main-d'oeuvre 
under Claude Béland and Ghislain Dufour has unanimously 
adopted a resolution calling for the federal government to transfer 
all of its manpower training budgets to Quebec.
<P>
<B>(1540)</B>
<P>
	The Quebec Minister of Employment, Louise Harel, described 
Bill C-96 as ``the blunt rejection of the unanimous consensus in 
Quebec-''.
<P>
	We might add the reactions of the Canada Labour Congress and 
the Canadian Institute of Adult Education, both denouncing Bill 
C-96, one calling it ``an attempt to bypass the provinces'' and the 
other ``a flagrant lack of respect for the aspirations of the 
provinces, Quebec in particular, in matters of education, training 
and manpower development''.
<P>
	For his part, the secretary general of the FTQ, the largest labour 
federation in Quebec, deplored the federal government's thumbing 
its nose at areas of provincial jurisdiction, and the Quebec 
consensus, in order to put into place a parallel structure to what is 
already there. He added ``Even the Conseil du patronat sides with 
the unions on this. And even Robert Bourassa's Liberal 
government opposed a similar attempt by Ottawa in 1991. Anyone 
who still harbours any illusions about Canadian federalism ought to 
think twice before voting in the referendum''.
<P>
	These comments were made three weeks prior to the 
referendum, but they hold as true today as they did then.
<P>
	For all these reasons, it is obvious that we in the Bloc Quebecois 
share the opinion of the majority of Quebecers and would be unable 
to vote in favour of such a bill.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Larry McCormick (Hastings-Frontenac-Lennox and 
Addington, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is a pleasure to speak on Bill 
C-96.
<P>
	A year ago our human resources development standing 
committee conducted public hearings in Ottawa and all across 
Canada. As a member of this committee I attended hearings in 25 
cities in 35 days in 10 provinces, 2 territories and the East Arctic. 
In my own riding constituents shared their ideas and concerns with 
me at four town hall meetings held in Napanee, Sydenham, 
Bancroft and Tweed.
<P>
	I believe the bill addresses the concerns we heard from many 
Canadians. Recently in my riding I had the opportunity to attend 
the opening of an HRDC job kiosk in Northbrook, Ontario. Mr. 
Adrian van Asseldonk, our local HRDC manager, and his staff have 
provided  residents from the Northbrook area, the northern part of 
our Lennox and Addington County, access to job market 
information. They no longer have to make the long trip to Napanee, 
Belleville or Kingston.
<P>
	As we look at the legislation before us we could talk for hours on 
end about what this mandate clause means or that qualification 
entails or about what wordings should be changed; indeed we have 
to do this. It is our responsibility to get the legislation right but we 
also have to take our eyes away from the fine print, look at the 
thing as a whole and ask what it really means.
<P>
	We can find out what it means outside these four walls in the 
communities because in the end this is about people; people who 
have hopes and dreams for the future, people who are willing to 
work hard for those dreams, people who are often struggling to 
hang on to a job or fund a new one, old people who are struggling to 
get by on a fixed income, young people stepping out of the school 
room into a world few of us could have imagined just a few short 
years ago. Those are the people who know about the real work this 
department is doing day in and day out across the country.
<P>
	HRDC touches the lives of millions of Canadians every year 
perhaps more directly than any other government department. 
From survivor benefits to student loans, unemployment insurance, 
employment programs and services, old age security, HRDC has an 
impact on Canadians at each stage of their lives.
<P>
	The HRDC described in the bill is working with Canadians in a 
new way. The government recognizes that Canada and Canadians 
are in the midst of a sea of change economically and socially. Our 
labour market and social programs have to change as well. For 
women, for aboriginal peoples, for people with disabilities and 
visible minorities this means a new Employment Equity Act, a 
stronger, more effective act which was tabled last year. In times of 
economic upheaval our commitment is to equity for all Canadians 
and it must be stronger than ever before.
<P>
<B>(1545 )</B>
<P>
	For people looking for a chance to learn and expand their 
opportunities, it means a new Canada student loans program, the 
first major overhaul of the program in years and one that puts a 
good education into the reach of more Canadians than ever before.
<P>
	For the first time there are specific grants to help women go to 
graduate schools in areas once dominated by men. For the first time 
students with disabilities can get support for the special facilities 
they need. For the first time single mothers can go back to school 
and get the financial help they need to pay for child care. At a time 
when knowledge and education are so critical, the new program is 
vital to many Canadians.
<P>
	For older workers displaced by technology or by the decline of 
an industry, the bill means marshalling our  resources to give them 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16552"> 16552 </A></B>
<P>
a hand, through strong partnerships with other governments like we 
have in Quebec through the program for older worker adjustment.
<P>
	It means bold new approaches like the Atlantic groundfish 
strategy, helping displaced fishers and plant workers across 
Newfoundland and Labrador.
<P>
	For young people who are unemployed and out of school it 
means youth services Canada. At last count, there were 200 
projects across the country where they are learning new skills 
through community service.
<P>
	Projects like one in Red Deer, Alberta where young people are 
working with the RCMP to deal with drug programs. Projects like 
the one in Clayoquot Sound where 20 young aboriginal men and 
women are working to develop a promising new eco-tourism 
program. Projects like the one in New Brunswick where young 
people are cleaning up and reclaiming polluted streams and rivers.
<P>
	For young Canadians still in school the new approach means 
youth internships where private sector firms are giving kids in 
grade 10 or 11 hands on work experience tied in with the school 
curriculum. This year alone there are 25,000 young interns across 
Canada thanks to the strong partnerships we are building with the 
private sector. Business and government are working together to 
give young people a shot at a great future.
<P>
	Bill C-96 means the Canadian Tourism Human Resource 
Council addresses the training needs of 1.2 million workers across 
this country. For women, this bill means Women in Trades and 
Technology, a national group helping women get into more trade, 
technological and blue collar jobs, with a national support network, 
courses and training programs designed specifically for women.
<P>
	For some 30,000 unemployed Canadians it means getting a 
helping hand as they create their own jobs and become 
self-employed and, in the process, creating an additional 30,000 
jobs for other Canadians.
<P>
	For all Canadians this bill means the federal government 
working with the provinces to test new approaches in employment 
and training, learning and education and income support and 
services.
<P>
	For example, in P.E.I. the Choice and Opportunity Project is 
designing and testing a delivery model to improve integrated 
services for persons with intellectual disabilities, eliminating 
barriers within generic programs and services and moving from 
segregated to inclusive community systems. The project is 
conducted in partnership with the Canadian Association for 
Community Living and the P.E.I. Association for Community 
Living.
<P>
	In Newfoundland, the project ``Transitions-The Changes 
Within'' is helping over 5,000 people by testing  a tuition voucher 
system that helps students remain in full time studies, helping 
post-secondary graduates gain work experience and becoming 
self-employed, helping unemployed workers find full time work.
<P>
	In British Columbia an initiative is under way to improve the 
quality and access to child care for working and studying families 
through community one stop access centres, testing delivery 
models for the delivery of child care and finding ways to help 
children with special day care needs.
<P>
	In New Brunswick the job corps project provides an annualized 
income to participants, people over 50 who were unemployed or on 
social assistance, in return for 26 weeks of volunteer work.
<P>
	In every province we are making a real difference in the lives of 
Canadians from all walks of life. We are making a difference 
because we have transformed HRDC and our approach to 
delivering the programs that Canadians need.
<P>
	This transformation will continue. In August the Minister of 
Human Resources Development announced the establishment of a 
new modern service delivery network that will reach more 
Canadians than ever before, the most sophisticated, efficient 
delivery network in the government.
<P>
	We are developing new, more flexible programs and services 
through the human resources investment fund, programs that will 
be locally based, locally driven and focused squarely on results.
<P>
<B>(1550 )</B>
<P>
	That is what the bill really means: a new direction for the 
department; a new focus for jobs and opportunity; a new approach 
to helping Canadians catch hold of their dreams for the future.
<P>
	The human resources development department is doing good 
things for Canada. Bill C-96 will let us do more and better things. 
Let us not put up roadblocks. Let us get on with the job of serving 
Canadians.
<P>
	I have a comment for an hon. member opposite. When I, along 
with other colleagues of the House, put in 12, 15 and 16-hour days 
across the country, in all corners, from sea to sea to sea, most 
members of the committee stayed in the room, listened to the 
witnesses. They listened to Canadians. Some hon. members stayed 
for one hour a day. There were stories of them going out on to the 
streets and signing up members for their party. I am ashamed of the 
conduct of some members of the House.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Hart (Okanagan-Similkameen-Merritt, Ref.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to have the opportunity to rise on behalf 
of the people of Okanagan-Similkameen-Merritt to oppose Bill 
C-96, an act to establish the Department of Human Resources 
Development and to amend and repeal certain related acts.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16553"> 16553 </A></B>
<P>
	As we all know, this piece of so-called legislative genius 
proposes to transfer legal powers from one department to a new 
department. A new department. Another department.
<P>
	Once again the Liberals are not listening to Canadians. 
Canadians have repeatedly demanded, in fact they have begged, the 
Liberals to reduce the size of the federal government. All over the 
world, western democracies are reducing the size of bureaucratic 
monsters. Canadian provinces are doing everything they can to 
reduce the size of their operations. Other governments are trying to 
eliminate the waste of taxpayers' dollars, to eliminate duplication 
of tasks, to eliminate overlap in duties and to eliminate inefficiency 
and ineffectiveness. Not the Liberal Party of Canada.
<P>
	The federal government, under the command of a man who 
brought our country to the brink of destruction, is creating more 
bureaucracy and red tape.
<P>
	The Liberals are quick to say that this legislation only serves to 
reinforce existing federal powers for social programs. In the 
current post-referendum phase in which we are living Canadians do 
not want to reinforce any areas of federal government intervention. 
In fact, Canadians are demanding alternatives to the status quo.
<P>
	The Liberals insist the legislation does not create any new 
powers for the federal government. How can we believe this, given 
the Liberal government's intention to increase government and to 
reinforce its firm grip of power over social programs for 
Canadians?
<P>
	The Liberals are silent with respect to the increase or decrease of 
staff in the human resources development sector. There is nothing 
more scary than a silent Liberal, unless it is the Liberal defence 
minister saying that he needs a pen. In fact, this legislation contains 
a royal recommendation which authorizes expenditures that are 
undisclosed. Undisclosed?
<P>
	This bill is a masterpiece of Liberal silence. Ask any Liberal 
member and he or she will tell you with a straight face that any 
expenditure under the bill is expected to be minimal, so Canadians 
have nothing to worry about.
<P>
	The defence minister's new quill-tipped, gold lettering engraved 
pens, encased in some kind of black velvet, were a minimal 
expense.
<P>
	The Liberal government's $100 million gun registry is a minimal 
expense. Most non-Liberal Party sources agree that $100 million is 
the minimal amount that the punishment of law-abiding, 
responsible firearms owners and users is going to cost. On the 
subject of how much the gun registry is going to cost, most 
authorities, that is those who do not belong to the Liberal Party of 
Canada, believe it will cost Canadian taxpayers much more than 
$100 million.
<P>
<B>(1555)</B>
<P>
	Since this past August I have uncovered over $100 million worth 
of wasteful and questionable spending by the Minister of National 
Defence and his senior officials. One hundred million dollars 
means nothing at all to this Liberal government. It has only to be 
careful to make sure that the defence minister does not spend $100 
million on gold-plated pens.
<P>
	The Reform Party of Canada is looking forward to building a 
new Canada of the 21st century. The Reform Party has a program 
which would allow the federal government to withdraw from fields 
it currently occupies jointly with the provinces.
<P>
	The provincial premiers are in favour of negotiating the transfer 
of power from the federal government to the provincial 
governments. The Reform Party's voice has no attachment to the 
status quo. The Reform Party is not interested in dragging our 
country back into a constitutional quagmire. Our 20-point plan can 
modernize and decentralize the country, something for which 
Canadians are clearly asking.
<P>
	Bill C-96 is an embarrassment to the Liberal government. The 
Liberals should withdraw this phoney bill. The Prime Minister has 
nearly smashed our nation to smithereens as a result of his 
complete misunderstanding of the will of the people of Quebec and 
all other provinces. The Prime Minister misjudged the referendum 
within Quebec. He misjudged the referendum as a national issue. 
Canadians had to take it on themselves to travel to Quebec to 
express their wish for that province to remain in our family.
<P>
	Canadians were hoping the Prime Minister would lead the way 
in assuring Quebecers that all Canadians wanted Quebec to vote no. 
Canadians as usual since October 1993 were sorely disappointed by 
the Prime Minister. We have been let down. The Prime Minister 
and the Liberals have lost the confidence of our nation. Yet the 
Liberals are busy creating another federal government department. 
This is pure balderdash.
<P>
	The Minister of Human Resources Development and the 
Minister of Western Economic Diversification has been fudging his 
handling of Canadian social programs since the Liberals took 
office. The infamous red book made lofty promises of social policy 
reform. This minister has yet to be able to get anything meaningful 
past the Liberal cabinet.
<P>
	The bill is a desperate attempt by this minister to do something 
about our nation's social policy. Canadians want social policy 
reform. This bill creates bureaucracy. It does not reduce 
government or reform social policy. This bill takes the existing 
situation and shuffles it all around.
<P>
	The Reform Party is offering Canadians the opportunity to 
decentralize powers to the provinces and truly reform our public 
tax supported institutions. We  propose to get our money's worth 
from what we have to work with. Unlike the Liberals, we want to 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16554"> 16554 </A></B>
<P>
bring power closer to the grassroots of Canada. We do not propose 
to continue allowing bureaucrats in Ottawa to answer their phones 
and just say no to whatever the people of British Columbia, 
Ontario, Quebec, Nova Scotia and all other provinces are asking.
<P>
	Western Canadians have as many problems with the status quo 
as our Quebec counterparts. Virtually all Canadians want change 
and the Liberals do not realize it. Our forefathers managed to 
change our nation each time we were faced with difficulties in how 
we would govern ourselves.
<P>
	In terms of social services, including medical services, we 
propose to change the role of the federal government to that of 
fostering co-operative interprovincial agreements rather than 
imposing unilateral standards and withholding transfer payments 
as a punishment for non-conformity. By proceeding with the bill 
the Liberal Party is acting completely against the will of 
Canadians. The government should be ashamed.
<P>
<B>(1600)</B>
<P>
	I must sound the alarm for Canadians watching that the bill does 
away with an annual report for the new department. As hard as it is 
to believe, even though we are $550 billion in debt the Liberals are 
creating a department of the federal government that does not even 
have to report its administration costs.
<P>
	The Liberal Party and its leader have been terribly smitten 
because they have been trying to appease Quebec without 
consideration for the wants and desires of other provinces.
<P>
	The Reform Party is rising like a phoenix out of the west. After 
the next election the Reform Party will have at least an additional 
100 seats. These seats will come from lost Liberal seats in rural 
Ontario and eastern Canada. The grassroots movement of our party 
is a wave that is sweeping across the nation. After the next election 
Canadians will see a new form of federalism come to the country 
with the Reform Party of Canada as a new government.
<P>
	On behalf of my constituents and all Canadians I say no to Bill 
C-96.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Shaughnessy Cohen (Windsor-St. Clair, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am pleased to participate in the debate on Bill C-96, the 
Department of Human Resources Development Act.
<P>
	I am also pleased to respond to some of the suggestions of the 
member for Okanagan-Similkameen-Merritt. He said that his 
party seeks to eliminate overlap and inefficiencies and is a rising 
phoenix. The phoenix is dragging its tail. It is trying to make its 
point on cheap shots about the Prime Minister and about the 
minister of human resources.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stinson:</B> There is nothing cheap there.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Cohen:</B> A phoenix is a bird that cheeps and this phoenix is 
certainly about the cheapest around.
<P>
	Canadians are demanding alternatives to the status quo. 
Canadians are demanding efficiencies. The bill does not deals with 
substantive issues. The bill deals with issues consequential to not 
creating a new department but merging three different departments. 
The bill is about efficiencies, about preventing overlap and about 
producing better results for the Canadian taxpayer.
<P>
	Members know that the Department of Human Resources 
Development already exists through orders in council. An obvious 
question might be: Why bother proceeding with this in a legislative 
format? The department is working. Why not put the legislation off 
until other substantive issues could be included? It is a fair question 
and I would like to address it briefly. In my view there are 
essentially five reasons why we need the bill and why we should 
proceed without delay.
<P>
	First, we need a straightforward way to clarify the role of the 
department and to clarify ministerial responsibilities. The existing 
arrangements are set out through orders in council. They are 
perfectly legitimate as transitional arrangements. However, in the 
final analysis the government, and I am sure everyone in the 
House, even the great Reform phoenix, would prefer to see this 
complex trail of statutory powers leading back to the enabling 
legislation of many different founding departments replaced with 
one single, coherent bill that sets out the mandate and the powers of 
the department in one place. That is just common sense. It ought to 
appeal to all of us. It certainly ought to appeal to the Reform Party.
<P>
	Second, by providing that single coherent mandate we could 
then clarify the identity of the department, something that is 
important both for its employees, although I do not think the 
Reform Party is worried about them, and for its clients, Canadian 
citizens, people the government cares about.
<P>
	For more than a year employees from the four founding 
departments, labour, employment and immigration, health and 
welfare and the secretary of state, have been working together to 
create a new organization. They have accomplished a great deal but 
their own sense of belonging, being part of a single focused 
organization, really cannot be complete until the legislation is 
passed.
<P>
	Bill C-96 means that the people who work for the department 
can turn the page and head into a new chapter. At the same time 
people in organizations who work with the department need to 
know with whom they are working. This is difficult when, for 
example, departmental officials at this point legally cannot really 
use human resources department letterhead. For legal and 
contracting purposes they still use letterhead from  departments 
that in the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16555"> 16555 </A></B>
<P>
eyes of our partners do not even exist any more. That may seem 
like a minor issue, but it creates a great deal of confusion among 
our partners and is expensive.
<P>
<B>(1605)</B>
<P>
	It is related to the third reason why we need Bill C-96 now. It 
would be overstating the case to say that existing arrangements are 
an administrative nightmare, but it does not overstate the case by 
much. Without enabling legislation for the department even simple 
issues like getting a person transferred turns into a complex, time 
consuming and costly process.
<P>
	When more detailed contracts are involved the process gets very 
messy. This is understandable and unavoidable during a major 
restructuring and transition, but there comes a time to bring that 
transition to an end. Two years have passed since the reorganization 
started and the time is now because we need to move forward. This 
is the fourth reason for the bill.
<P>
	We have to consolidate the progress we have achieved in 
integrating social and labour market programs and sharpening the 
focus on developing Canada's human resources. More important, 
we need to clear the way for further progress.
<P>
	As we undertake a major overhaul of the UI program, as we 
develop new programs and services under the human resources 
investment fund, as we work to improve programs for seniors, as 
the department implements the next phase of re-engineering and 
streamlining services to Canada, we need to clear the way.
<P>
	This brings me to the fifth and most important reason we need 
the bill. Canadians need and deserve the best possible service. In 
the end that is what really matters about the bill. In the end that is 
what Liberals worry about. The displaced workers who walk into 
the Canada employment centre in Windsor, Ontario, deserve the 
same kind of integrated, results oriented support focused on 
helping people adjust and get new jobs.
<P>
	The single mother from my riding who is looking for help needs 
the kind of integrated service that will help her care for her children 
while getting the skills and income support that will help her to 
build a life with a future.
<P>
	The young person stuck in a cycle of dead end jobs and 
unemployment after leaving school needs help breaking that cycle. 
That is what Human Resources Development Canada is there for. 
We need to ensure that the department can do its job. It is important 
to clear up the administrative tangles left over from earlier times. It 
is important to establish a clear identity and a coherent mandate for 
the new organization to function properly. It is important to ensure 
that as the department looks to the future there is a solid foundation 
to build on.
<P>
	It is important also to continue to fulfil the overwhelming desire 
of Canadians, a desire that is clear in all 10 provinces and in the 
territories. What Canadians want is a strong federal government 
that can make sure that programs and services are delivered 
uniformly across the country.
<P>
	Bill C-96 provides the department that will provide that 
foundation in the human resources development area. We need to 
pass the bill. We need to get on with the work of serving Canadians.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Yves Rocheleau (Trois-Rivières, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is 
with great pleasure that I take part in this debate today on Bill C-96, 
an act to establish the Department of Human Resources 
Development.
<P>
	Over the next ten minutes, I intend to look at the issue of 
employment centres restructuring, from the particular point of 
view of Quebec, where, from now on, we will have 78 suboffices 
coming under 28 offices called regional management centres.
<P>
	I will also address this issue as it relates to a case of particular 
concern to me, namely the CEC of Trois-Rivières, because we were 
stunned and outraged to learn, on June 22, 1995, that the 
department planned to establish the regional management centre in 
Shawinigan rather than in Trois-Rivières.
<P>
	This announcement immediately gave rise to a general outcry. 
Yours truly was the first one to denounce such plans, soon to be 
followed by the mayor of Trois-Rivières, the Chamber of 
Commerce and 70 organizations of the greater Trois-Rivières area, 
including 40 municipalities, all of which passed resolutions 
denouncing the federal government's plans in this respect.
<P>
	This eventually resulted in a petition being circulated over the 
summer by the EIC employees' union, with the full support of the 
Federation of Senior Citizens, because this bill is a direct attack on 
senior citizens, and of the local branches of the Fédération des 
caisses populaires Desjardins, which helped circulate the petition. 
As a result, upwards of 25,000 citizens have signed the petition and 
expressed in writing their opposition to these plans the federal 
government has regarding our region.
<P>
<B>(1610)</B>
<P>
	As you can see, in addition to being very unpopular in the 
Trois-Rivières region, this decision actually contradicts the 
department's own criteria for determining the most sensible 
location for these offices.
<P>
	In fact, the criteria were based first of all on the total population; 
second, on the number of people on unemployment insurance; 
third, on the number of people receiving income security benefits; 
fourth, on the number of senior citizens concerned; and finally, on 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16556"> 16556 </A></B>
<P>
the number of businesses and employers affected by the  activities 
of the employment centres. The department, preferring to ignore its 
own criteria, concluded for obvious reasons that it was better to 
locate the regional centre in Shawinigan instead of Trois-Rivières, 
although there is twice as much economic activity in the 
Trois-Rivières region as in Shawinigan.
<P>
	The same ratio applies to the total population, the number of 
senior citizens and the number of businesses. This is one more 
example that shows why it makes no sense to locate in Shawinigan 
instead of Trois-Rivières. The practical implications are all 
explained in a document we happened to receive not long ago. This 
is an internal management document entitled: ``Preliminary Report 
on Centralization of Claims Processing''.
<P>
	This document was released less than a month ago on October 
23, 1995, and prepared by a committee of 11 department officials, 
including several senior officials. The report more or less describes 
the future role of the sub-offices, including Trois-Rivières. The 
sub-offices will receive benefit claims, transmit the claims and 
collect the facts from the client. According to a note in the 
document, this will only consist in taking down information 
provided by the client.
<P>
	So they will take this information down in Trois-Rivières and 
routinely send it on to Shawinigan, where more than half of the 
files will come from Trois-Rivières and the surrounding region. 
Trois-Rivières in this case includes Cap-de-la-Madeleine and 
Trois-Rivières West. And what about Bécancour, which will have 
to deal with Drummondville? It does not make sense. There is no 
administrative or historic link between the residents of Bécancour 
and Drummondville, which is another absurd aspect of this plan.
<P>
	We, that is my colleagues for Champlain and Richelieu and 
myself, wrote to the minister to make the appropriate 
representations. People in our regions, especially the unemployed, 
will have a hard time as a result of this plan. Six weeks later on 
November 10-as soon as possible, as usual-we received a 
written reply from the minister who, by the way, was too busy to 
meet three members of Parliament. He referred us to an assistant 
deputy minister in Montreal, Mr. Gladu. We will let somebody else 
go and meet him.
<P>
	In his letter, the minister explained why Shawinigan had been 
chosen instead of Trois-Rivières, and I quote: ``The government 
decided to centralize Human Resources Development Canada's 
internal services for the Mauricie region at the Shawinigan centre 
because it felt it would be useful to bring together a certain number 
of services and departments, including Revenue Canada and 
Human Resources Development Canada''.
<P>
	Which means it was a matter of accommodation, office space 
would appear to be available at the Taxation Data Centre in 
Shawinigan. The reason is therefore simply a physical one, despite 
the decision's unpopularity and  unreasonableness. It is a matter of 
premises that has led to preparations to move it to 
Shawinigan-South and yet, in the present building, there are 
premises available. Even more will be coming available soon, 
because the network will disappear in the restructuring, and this 
will free up a whole floor and another one, two floors leased until 
1999 which will be available and could accommodate all the 
personnel required for a regional management centre in 
Trois-Rivières.
<P>
<B>(1615)</B>
<P>
	So this reason does not hold. What is more, the minister says that 
the future centre in Shawinigan, in addition to offering the same 
programs and services as in Trois-Rivières, will manage internal 
services relating to the administration and processing of 
unemployment insurance claims. This tells us about the particular 
role of the Shawinigan centre rather than the one in Trois-Rivières.
<P>
	Here again, according to this document, not only will the actual 
files of people from Trois-Rivières be in Shawinigan, but 
departmental investigations will be done from Shawinigan, appeals 
to the board of referees will be made there and complaints about 
unemployment insurance will be lodged there. According to the 
same document, three claims out of four will be reviewed, as they 
call it, and will be given special follow-up because of some 
complexity or other. Therefore three claims out of four arriving in 
Trois-Rivières will be transferred to Shawinigan and given special 
treatment.
<P>
	And yet, here is what the minister says in his missive. He tells us 
that he has no intention of making any changes to the way the 
department is serving the people of Trois-Rivières. Well, at this 
time, the physical files of UI claimants are in Trois-Rivières; 
departmental investigations are conducted in Trois-Rivières; 
appeals to the UI arbitration board are heard in Trois-Rivières; and 
relatively complex files are processed in Trois-Rivières. Therefore, 
we cannot trust the minister when he tells us that the services 
provided to the people of Trois-Rivières will not be affected in any 
way. This cannot be true in my opinion.
<P>
	How can we trust the minister? What guarantee does he give in 
this letter that there will be no changes? There is no guarantee. The 
more we look at this, the more we realize that the decision to move 
and almost dismantle the Trois-Rivières manpower centre-whose 
staff, according to our information, will be reduced from around 
100 one or two years ago to 12-is purely political.
<P>
	This is a purely political decision. If the hon. member for 
Saint-Maurice and Prime Minister wants to show his constituents 
that electing him was not a mistake, that they did the right thing for 
the riding of Saint-Maurice by electing him, he may have the right 
to take measures, but he has no right to do so at the expense of the 
people of Trois-Rivières and the surrounding region and to look  
down on them. He has no right to do that, and I take this 
opportunity to tell you, Mr. Speaker, and to tell this House that we 
will not give up. We do not accept this decision and we never will.
<P>

[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Ms. Marlene Catterall (Ottawa West, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
service delivery network initiative, a feature of this bill, is a 
significant step forward in providing Canadians with faster, more 
effective and efficient services. It gives the government and local 
communities greater flexibility to help those about whom we are 
all most concerned, those Canadians in need of some assistance 
from their government, whether it is through unemployment 
insurance, a retirement pension or many of the other services now 
under the jurisdiction of the Department of Human Resources 
Development. Not only does it provide for greater self-service, it 
enhances access to in-person service.
<P>
	The service delivery network was spurred by the need to 
accomplish two goals: improve the quality of service and reduce 
costs. These goals may seem contradictory. The government, 
however, was convinced from the beginning that better and more 
innovative service is a means saving money. It is also a way to meet 
the needs of Canadians more effectively.
<P>
	Canadians clearly agree. They know fiscal restraint and social 
responsibility are both essential to Canada's future; they told us so 
during our wide ranging consultations. That is what the new service 
delivery network achieves; faster, more responsive, localized and 
personalized service at less cost.
<P>
<B>(1620 )</B>
<P>
	Given the tone of the debate on Bill C-96, it would be useful to 
restate the background behind the reform. First, it bears repeating 
that Bill C-96 is an administrative measure, not a policy 
instrument. The new service delivery network breaks new ground 
in terms of innovation and creativity. What it does not do is create 
new powers for the federal government; nor does it invade 
provincial jurisdiction in matters of labour market development. It 
is an administrative reform initiative, period. It is not necessary or 
even desirable to alter jurisdictional arrangements or create new 
authorities.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	How will this new service delivery network benefit Quebecers? 
The new network will affect the lives of Quebecers in many ways. 
Across the province, Human Resources Development Canada 
provides services through an expanding network of offices. 
Whether through programs and services relating to employment, 
old age pension benefits and unemployment insurance or any of the 
various job-related services, every Quebecer will be affected by 
one or more of these programs at one time or another, from their 
youth to their retirement.
<P>
	HRDC offices in Quebec serve more than one million people. 
For students alone, there are 87 Canada Employment Centres for 
Students. The Quebec network administers several employment 
programs and Canada-Quebec agreements, a number of joint 
ventures involving the province and the federal government, 
50,000 contracts relating to manpower and a $13.3 billion budget.
<P>
	In 1994-1995, HRDC helped more than 164,000 Quebecers find 
jobs and nearly 45,000 students find summer jobs.
<P>
	Education is another area in which HRDC makes a significant 
contribution. Without the required skills, Canadians and Quebecers 
have no hope of matching the competition on the rapidly changing 
global market we are dealing with today. That is why HRDC 
pumped $1.5 billion into the Quebec post-secondary education 
system. Young Quebecers certainly took advantage of this financial 
assistance to further their education.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The department helped nearly 280,000 participants in 
employment services and nearly 150,000 employment program 
participants. It served 850,000 old age security pension plan 
recipients. As well, HRDC contributed more than $2.7 billion 
under the Canada assistance plan to help some 700,000 people 
receiving social assistance benefits. It provided the unemployment 
insurance service to a monthly average of 528,000 claimants.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	HRDC funds pilot projects like Éduplus, Formetal and La Puce 
to develop innovative ways of serving the public. The department 
also contributed to the outstanding success of groups like the 
Cirque du Soleil, which flourished with the financial support of 
HRDC.
<P>
	This list of achievements speaks volumes. It shows that 
meaningful partnerships between the federal government and the 
people of Quebec promote community building and shape its 
future. By providing easier access to improved services, we 
broaden even more future prospects.
<P>
<B>(1625)</B>
<P>
	These initiatives and programs did not appear out of thin air; 
they are the result of sustained efforts by the department in Quebec. 
They certainly bear the Quebec government's seal of approval, 
since most of them arise from various partnership agreements that 
have been signed.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	There are the Canada-Quebec interim agreement on labour force 
development measures, the Canada assistance plan, the agreement 
on enhancing employment opportunities for social assistance 
recipients, the Canada-Quebec agreement on the assignment of 
unemployment insurance benefits, the Canada-Quebec  agreement 
on the exchange of information, the Canada student loan program 
with 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16558"> 16558 </A></B>
<P>
block funding to Quebec, the post-secondary education financing 
agreement with block funding to Quebec.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Do Quebecers appreciate these services? Undoubtedly, as 
evidenced by the 50,000 contracts relating to manpower, 
representing about $685 million, that were awarded in Quebec, 
including 9,600 contracts with non-profit organizations; 9,300 
contracts with private sector enterprises; 2,800 contracts with 
public sector enterprises such as municipalities; 3,200 contracts 
with the Government of Quebec for the provision of institutional 
training and 25,000 contracts under the fee payer trainee program.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	I have described the daily ongoing service of Human Resources 
Development Canada to the residents of Quebec and in 
co-operation with the people of Quebec. These are not the 
inventions of the new service delivery network. They are the 
content the network was designed to deliver more effectively, more 
responsively, more creatively.
<P>
	Opposing improvements in the delivery of programs does not 
serve the interests of Quebecers. Confusing administrative reform 
with reform of social policy or jurisdictional changes does not 
serve the interests of Quebecers or of Canadians anywhere. 
Innovation and creativity do serve the interests of all Canadians, 
including Quebecers, and innovation and creativity are what the 
new service delivery network is all about.
<P>
	The Department of Human Resources Development has every 
intention of remaining innovative in its delivery of services and 
programs but it has not by this initiative invented any new 
programs. We do need new ideas and ways of doing things. We 
need clarity of vision, which is what this bill represents, a new way 
for a new future of delivering programs right across the country, 
helping those who most need to adapt in a new economy.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dennis J. Mills (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Industry, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker. I appreciate the opportunity to 
participate in this debate.
<P>
	Human Resources Development Canada I believe, from my 
longstanding commitment to the Liberal tradition, is central to the 
government's maintaining its credibility with the people of 
Canada. Of all government departments Human Resources 
Development Canada is the one at this time that should get the 
most support and the most encouragement from all members of the 
House.
<P>
<B>(1630 )</B>
<P>
	As we are going through a period of restructuring we have these 
incredible forces from the right that say cut, eliminate, offload, 
decentralize. When we are doing that for the purpose of eliminating 
waste I am sympathetic.
<P>
	I believe human resources development has to be one of the 
departments of the national government that remain strong and 
intact. It must be the counterbalance to provincial forces that quite 
often are shortsighted and think in a parochial way rather than in 
the interest of the whole of Canada. I maintain that unless we have 
national programs with national standards it will be very difficult 
for us to maintain a sense of national will.
<P>
	I am totally opposed to offloading any more of the decision 
making process in an area like human resources development to the 
province of Quebec or to any other provinces. All of a sudden we 
will have that parochial thought process emerge. We will become a 
country in which essentially we have about five or six different 
standards, thought processes emerging. When we are trying to 
develop national standards it is virtually impossible when we go 
that route.
<P>
	I will give an example in terms of my own province, Ontario. We 
have a Conservative government which is being very shortsighted 
in the way it is treating its human resources development 
opportunities.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stinson:</B> Not according to the people.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mills (Broadview-Greenwood):</B> A member from the 
Reform Party said not according to the people.
<P>
	I have to take a minute to talk about the people and why the 
provincial government is so popular in Ontario. We have in the 
country now an emerging culture. A book written by John Kenneth 
Galbraith was called <I>The Culture of the Content</I>. What we have 
now is a culture in which there are people who have work, who 
have a job, who have everything going for them, who might have a 
lot of RRSPs, whose business may be in good shape, who are 
essentially content. They represent about 70 per cent.
<P>
	The 70 per cent who are basically content, who have their 
paycheque secure, or who have enough investment income that 
they can look after themselves are essentially comfortable with this 
right wing agenda. Those people are not being as sensitive as they 
used to be toward those in our community who do not have, who do 
not have work, who do not have the opportunity to get retrained. 
We must as governments invest in some people to be retrained.
<P>
	We have in our province a Conservative government catering to 
the contented culture. It is forgetting the 30 per cent who are having 
a very difficult time. The Ontario government's vision is very 
much like a business vision. It is like earnings per share per quarter.
<P>
<B>(1635)</B>
<P>
	When building a country we cannot run it like a business. We 
have to think of the investment in human capital for the long term. 
It is essential that we have a counterbalance at the national level.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> Oh, oh.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16559"> 16559 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mills (Broadview-Greenwood):</B> Mr. Speaker, when I try 
to talk in a constructive way about the issue here, the Reform Party 
does not let me finish. There may be a day when those gentlemen 
might be given the trust by the people of Canada. If they have 
been given the trust of the people of Canada, they are not supposed 
to get the trust and then simply say hand it over to the province.
<P>
	The Chamber is meant to be a counterbalance to those regional 
and provincial forces. When one is in the Chamber, one does not 
speak only for one's own riding and one's own province. When in 
the Chamber, one is supposed to speak for all of Canada. We are 
here to speak for all of Canada.
<P>
	Ontario has a shortsighted vision evolving in which we do not 
have investment dollars going into human resource development. 
We should be thanking God that we have a minister who will not be 
pushed around by the bureaucrats in the Department of Finance 
when they are trying to offload this place. He will maintain his 
presence for a strong national human resources development 
department.
<P>
	To the members of the Reform, there are many I have had good 
constructive debate with-
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> Does that include giving something to the 
Winnipeg Jets?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mills (Broadview-Greenwood):</B> The member asked 
whether giving money to the Winnipeg Jets is a good decision? He 
is taking me off the subject matter of my speech but I will talk 
about the Winnipeg Jets. I declare conflict of interest with the 
Winnipeg Jets. As members know, my son played his nine games 
with the Winnipeg Jets. He is only a 19-year old kid.
<P>
	I support the commitment of the Government of Canada to try to 
maintain another National Hockey League franchise in this 
country. I come from Toronto where we do not have any problems 
maintaining a franchise. This is not a country that has looked out 
only for those provinces that have. We should be looking out for 
provinces that do not have the same resources as downtown 
Toronto.
<P>
	It does not bother me if some of the cashflow from Ontario is 
distributed to Winnipeg or other places if it means we can maintain 
our national sport. It does not bother me.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> Big business.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mills (Broadview-Greenwood):</B> It is big business. It is a 
multi-billion business that has created exports, equipment, players, 
tourism and exposure. Do not underestimate the contribution of 
hockey as a national sport.
<P>
	Let me get back to my speech on human resources development. 
Mr. Speaker, please do not dock me for the diversion that was 
generated by the Reform Party on the Winnipeg Jets.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> The only commitment I will 
make-I cannot put you in the penalty box-is you have two 
minutes to wrap it up.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mills (Broadview-Greenwood):</B> I will not argue with the 
Speaker because I am afraid of a 10-minute misconduct. That 
means I will not be able to speak tomorrow.
<P>
<B>(1640 )</B>
<P>
	I want to go back to the essence of the department, human 
resources. Many of the ideas and decisions taken by the 
Department of Human Resources Development do not always 
come out of Ottawa. It is very rare. That is one of the myths, one of 
the spins we hear from the Reform Party.
<P>
	I know many of the ideas for human resource development, ideas 
for job creation or jobs for retraining, actually come from the 
grassroots, from the local human resource development offices. I 
bet there is not a member of Parliament who has not had an idea 
come through the system and get approved where the idea came 
right from the community.
<P>
	To all members and to my dear friends from the Bloc Quebecois 
please, the people of Canada have spoken. They want a strong 
national government. We must begin by reinforcing the voice of the 
people to make sure the Department of Human Resources 
Development is the ground swell for rebuilding this great, strong, 
national government that once was.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> It is my duty pursuant to 
Standing Order 38 to inform the House that the questions to be 
raised tonight at the time of adjournment are as follows: the hon. 
member for Saskatoon-Clark's Crossing, education; the hon. 
member for St. John's East, domestic violence.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Madeleine Dalphond-Guiral (Laval-Centre, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, now that the Quebec referendum is over, the Liberal 
government is finally tabling the most important piece of its 
legislative agenda, that is Bill C-96. We had to put up with years of 
Liberal dickering and federal pussy footing to arrive at this result: 
at last, this government is showing its true colours.
<P>
	The government can try its best by including so-called 
``technical'' details in its bill, by saying that it merely seeks to 
``establish'' a legal entity, and that it ``streamlines'' federal 
bureaucracy to meet the concerns of those involved. However, 
nothing can hide this obvious will to increase federal involvement 
in fields of provincial jurisdiction.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16560"> 16560 </A></B>
<P>
	On October 5, in response to questions from the official 
opposition, the Minister of Human Resources Development 
deemed appropriate to say that the Bloc Quebecois obviously had 
``not taken the time to read the bill''.
<P>
	Whether the minister agrees or not, the fact is that the Bloc 
Quebecois, the Quebec government, the Société québécoise du 
développement de la main-d'oeuvre, the socio-economic partners 
in Quebec, including those representing management, union and 
social sectors, not to mention the Quebec minister of state 
responsible for joint action, have all read the same document and 
come to the same conclusion: Bill C-96 strengthens the 
centralizing views of the federal government and increases its 
involvement in the employment and social program sectors, 
including manpower training. This shows a complete disregard for 
the consensus reached in Quebec on the need to have all necessary 
powers, so that the Quebec government, in co-operation with its 
socio-economic partners, can channel its energy and its resources 
where they are needed most, based on the actual and increasing 
needs of its population.
<P>
	On October 4, Louise Harel denounced, in a press release, the 
federal attempt to set up a parallel structure to get involved in the 
manpower training sector:
<P>
	``Like its labour market partners, the Quebec government 
denounces Ottawa's intentions to set up its own parallel manpower 
structures in Quebec. This federal initiative amounts to a flat 
rejection of the unanimous Quebec consensus, repeatedly 
expressed, both under the previous administration and under the 
current one, on the need for Quebec to regain control over all 
labour adjustment measures, including the related budgets''.
<P>
<B>(1645)</B>
<P>
	Let there be no mistake. This bill is a screen allowing the Liberal 
government to hide its real intentions. This makes it the 
cornerstone of federal interventionism for the Liberal government, 
which is now determined to ignore Quebec and overlook the 
provinces' wishes. This is a great example of the importance and 
role the federal government wants to give the provinces in 
tomorrow's Canada.
<P>
	Bill C-96 mirrors the Canadian constitution: encroachments, 
overlap, duplication, and waste. Bill C-96 clearly shows that the 
federal government has no intention of respecting provincial 
jurisdiction. How can we not denounce this attitude?
<P>
	This is not the federal government's first encroachment on 
provincial jurisdiction. After taking over unemployment insurance 
in the 1940s, it consolidated its hegemony in the labour sector by 
creating employment centres and manpower training programs. 
Fifty years later, we are forced to recognize  that the federal 
government has no intention of withdrawing from that sector.
<P>
	Bill C-96 undermines Quebec's efforts to set up a single 
framework for labour initiatives, thus confirming the official 
opposition's worst fears. The minister is trying to take advantage of 
his reform to give himself more powers at the expense of the 
provinces. Bill C-96 gives the government the powers it needs to 
bypass the provinces in concluding agreements with local 
organizations.
<P>
	The federal government will then be able to go after 
municipalities and offer them responsibilities contracted directly 
with the Department of Human Resources Development. This 
would allow the minister to delegate powers to the new 
employment commission or any other entity, thereby bypassing 
provincial governments and administrations. Quebec's fears and 
concerns are justified, since the minister can impose his own 
standards on these entities by delegating these powers, without, of 
course, the agreement of the Canadian Parliament or the provinces. 
This is the Canadian version of decentralization.
<P>
	This bill, if passed, will provide the necessary legislative 
framework to allow the minister to implement his much 
talked-about UI reform, which is the second piece of the federal 
puzzle. Several clauses of Bill C-96 grant huge discretionary 
powers to the head of the department, which, in the opinion of the 
official opposition, promotes greater federal interference and 
invasion of the provincial jurisdiction over social matters, and 
manpower in particular.
<P>
	For instance, clause 6 of the bill states that the ``powers, duties 
and functions of the Minister extend to and include all matters over 
which Parliament has jurisdiction-not by law assigned to any 
other Minister, department, board or agency of the Government of 
Canada, and are to be exercised with the objective of enhancing 
employment, encouraging equality and promoting social security''.
<P>
	It is clear that, with Bill C-96, the powers, duties and functions 
assigned to the minister are larger, because his thrust area is no 
longer specified in the act. One can wonder about the deeper 
motives of the legislator.
<P>
	As for clause 7, it could hardly be vaguer. It states that ``In 
exercising the powers or performing the duties or functions 
assigned to him under this or any other act of Parliament, the 
minister may- cooperate with provincial authorities with a view 
to the coordination of efforts made or proposed for preserving and 
improving human resources development''.
<P>
	Nowhere does it say that the minister has to cooperate with the 
provinces. The minister is not required to respect provincial 
jurisdictions.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16561"> 16561 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1650)</B>
<P>
	However, clauses 20 and 21 are even more worrisome. Clause 20 
provides that:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>-the Minister may enter into agreements with a province- agencies of 
provinces, financial institutions and such other persons or bodies as the Minister 
considers appropriate.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	This covers a vast range. As for clause 21, it provides that:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The Minister may authorize the Minister of Labour, the Commission or any 
other person-to exercise any power or perform any duty or function of the 
Minister.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	It is obvious to the official opposition that, through these 
legislative provisions, the minister is getting the powers necessary 
to delegate, to whoever he considers appropriate, the management 
of his department's policies and programs. From now on, the 
minister will have the power to contract out, at his full discretion 
and with full impunity.
<P>
	In this instance, the minister will have the power to enter into 
agreements with local or regional organizations, such as 
municipalities, and thus completely ignore the provinces.
<P>
	The federal strategy taking shape with this bill will inescapably 
generate a clash between the already well established manpower 
network and that of the federal government, with the numerous 
programs and grants of all kinds that the government will provide 
throughout Quebec. That strategy is already being used by the 
federal government. The establishment of this superdepartment, 
along with the discretionary powers given to the minister, will only 
reinforce the centralizing position of the federal government.
<P>
	Unfortunately, by acting in this way and rejecting Quebec's 
efforts and desire to be effective in the manpower sector, the 
federal government clearly shows a lack of integrity. By 
establishing national standards in that field, the government carries 
on its tradition of interfering in fields which are not under its 
jurisdiction.
<P>
	Quebec and its dynamic forces denounce the federal will to 
further interfere in an area where the programs and initiatives must 
be defined by the Quebec government, based on the real needs of 
its population.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mac Harb (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
International Trade, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, Bill C-96 does not in any 
way alter present federal and provincial powers. No matter how 
you look at the situation, there is absolutely no intrusion in spheres 
of provincial jurisdiction. This is forbidden by the bill itself.
<P>
	The time has definitely come for all levels of 
government-federal, provincial, municipal-to rise above all 
jurisdictional quarrels and to start finding solutions for working 
together, pooling their resources and helping the people they serve.
<P>
	The Bloc would prefer to see us do nothing. On November 9, the 
member for Mercier served up a fine piece of jargon about 
jurisdictional issues. Perhaps she might like to come back down to 
earth and talk to us instead about the people concerned.
<P>
	Perhaps she might talk to the millions of Quebecers who each 
year turn to the Department of Human Resources Development for 
help, to let them know which of them will be abandoned and unable 
to take advantage of the $ 13.3 billion we spend in their province 
every year.
<P>
	Perhaps the Bloc ought to talk to the 164,000 Quebec men and 
women we helped to find a job last year, to let them know ``We will 
not be helping you any longer''. Perhaps the Bloc members could 
let us know which of the 44,789 students who found summer 
employment last summer we ought not to have helped.
<P>
	Perhaps they could tell some 700,000 Quebecers that the federal 
government ought not to have spent close to three billion dollars 
for the social aid program they depend upon to live.
<P>
	Perhaps the Bloc could explain jurisdictional issues to the half 
million unemployment insurance recipients there are in Quebec 
every month.
<P>
<B>(1655)</B>
<P>
	Perhaps they could tell us which of the 400,000 Quebecers who 
benefit from our employment programs and services we should 
abandon.
<P>
	Perhaps they could explain to the 850,000 Quebec seniors why 
they should not receive their Canada pension plan and old age 
security benefits.
<P>
	Perhaps they could explain to Quebecers why the federal 
government should not invest $1.5 billion in their postsecondary 
education system.
<P>
	While some members worry about the imaginary threat of 
federal power grabs, the Department of Human Resources 
Development is doing the work it has to do, with Quebecers and the 
Quebec government. Bloc members say we should not do anything, 
to avoid encroaching on provincial jurisdiction. I, however, say 
that, in the name of change, we should find ways of doing a better 
job.
<P>
	It is not by erecting walls that we will do a better job. We need a 
better philosophy. We need the type of philosophy articulated by 
the minister when he talked about the need to empower the 
community and the people to make more choices.
<P>
	What was the hon. member for 
Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup's answer? No. People should not 
be empowered to make more choices. This is not the Bloc's 
philosophy. We need the kind of philosophy articulated by the 
minister when he talked about new partnerships between the 
government and the  private sector, 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16562"> 16562 </A></B>
<P>
between the government and the school boards, between the 
government and the provinces.
<P>
	What was the hon. member for 
Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup's answer? ``No, we do not want to 
work together to bring about changes''. The hon. members for 
Mercier and Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup made much of the 
fact that Bill C-96 allows us to conclude agreements with Quebec 
organizations for implementing our programs and delivering our 
services.
<P>
	HRDC already has thousands of contracts and agreements with a 
myriad of Quebec organizations, including agreements with the 
Quebec government that are important to those people trying to 
return to the labour force. The existing legislation already allows us 
to negotiate such agreements. In 1994-95 alone, HRDC signed over 
50,000 labour agreements in Quebec, representing a total of $695 
million in funding for programs and income support. This bill 
simply renews these agreements. Nothing has changed.
<P>
	Is the Bloc telling us that we should stop investing millions of 
dollars to help laid-off workers, as we are now doing under the 
program for older worker adjustment? We could not do so without 
the power to enter into agreements with financial institutions and to 
buy the pension plans these workers need.
<P>
	Does the Bloc mean to say that we should stop building new 
partnerships in Quebec, partnerships that help reduce duplication 
and overlap and improve service delivery to Quebecers? Because 
we would be unable to establish partnerships if we no longer had 
the means of ensuring their smooth running.
<P>
	Let there be no mistake about it, the partnerships we enter into 
are indeed effective, and the basic concept of flexible federalism 
which supports these partnerships is also effective. Think about the 
many current agreements between HRDC and Quebec, including 
the interim Canada-Quebec agreement on certain manpower 
development initiatives, the welfare recipient accord 
implementation agreement, the Canada-Quebec agreement on 
employment in the agricultural sector and the agreement on the 
global transfer of funds to Quebec under the Canadian Student 
Loans Program, just to name a few.
<P>
<B>(1700)</B>
<P>
	These master agreements are effective and they have a decisive 
impact on the lives of thousands of Quebecers.
<P>
	I submit that we should consolidate these partnerships, further 
decentralize powers and let Quebecers decide what programs and 
services are best suited to their needs.
<P>
	Labour market programs and services are already amongst the 
most highly decentralized federal measures. They are implemented 
through a very wide network of  local centres that have gained a 
reputation for reliability and co-operation within the communities 
they serve.
<P>
	The government is currently decentralizing by delegating 
decision making authority back to the regions, all the way down to 
the local level, where it should rest. Over the past year, we have 
been leaders and made tremendous progress in this area. We 
completely redesigned the way the Department of Human 
Resources Development operates within communities in Quebec 
and across Canada.
<P>
	The federal government also undertook to work together with the 
provinces to afford Canadian maximum flexibility with respect to 
services. Take for instance the Canada social transfer for health and 
social programs, which is to replace the Canada assistance plan. 
The purpose of the social transfer is to help provinces provide the 
social services and benefits of their choice, which they cannot do at 
present because of inflexible rules.
<P>
	Obviously, this is good news. We are making real progress on the 
road to co-operation, while also preserving our integrity. We are 
making real progress by putting stable social programs in the hands 
of Quebecers.
<P>
	Bill C-96 is about the pursuit of these achievements. It will allow 
us to continue to work together, to define the roles of the various 
levels of government, and to create links between them.
<P>
	These initiatives are certainly better than the alleged usurpations 
of authority. It is high time we started creating links that will bring 
us closer together.
<P>
	This is why we officially asked the Government of Quebec, as 
well as those of the other provinces, to co-operate with us to 
decentralize services. Several provinces have already joined us to 
discuss ways to define our respective roles and promote more 
effective co-operation. Consequently, I urge all members of the 
House to encourage Quebec to join us to meet that challenge.
<P>
	The motion from the Bloc Quebecois is certainly not a 
constructive move to bring about the type of changes that we all 
want. Rather, it is yet another obstacle on the way to the future.
<P>
	What purpose would be served if the House did not go ahead 
with Bill C-96? None at all. It would not help the Bloc Quebecois 
to proceed with the type of changes it claims to be seeking. It 
would not help Canadians to get the services which they expect and 
which they need.
<P>
	It would only force the Department of Human Resources 
Development to continue to work in isolation, outside the simple 
and consistent framework provided by the bill. It would only 
maintain the administrative burden resulting from the lack of 
enabling legislation, since even the simplest operations, such as a 
transfer of personnel, can trigger a complex, long and costly 
process.
<P>
	We can certainly do better than that.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16563"> 16563 </A></B>
<P>
	It goes without saying that co-operation is better than 
confrontation, discord and separation. We have to recognize that, 
at a time when we are trying to make the best of the resources 
of federalism, in which Quebecers have put their faith.
<P>
	Co-operation is better than living in the past, as we are trying to 
redefine the role of partners which must be fulfilled by 
governments, that is being partners with individuals and 
communities, but also partners among themselves.
<P>
	Such is the philosophy, the vision underlying the establishment 
of the new Department of Human Resources Development.
<P>
	Bill C-96 is the foundation of that department. With the approval 
and support of this House, we will pass this legislation and carry on 
our work.
<P>
<B>(1705)</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean-Guy Chrétien (Frontenac, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is 
with great interest that I am intervening today in this House on Bill 
C-96, an act to legally establish the Department of Human 
Resources Development.
<P>
	This is a long way from the agricultural portfolio for which I am 
usually critic for the official opposition, but the significance of the 
changes brought in by Bill C-96 requires me to speak out.
<P>
	Application of this bill would be disastrous for Quebec, and I 
must defend the interests of my constituents first, but also those of 
all Quebecers.
<P>
	What the government is preparing to do by going ahead with this 
bill is quite simply unacceptable. Bill C-96 is a tool with which the 
minister intends to broaden his powers once again, going over the 
heads of the provinces to do as he sees fit.
<P>
	This bill enables the minister to ignore the provinces by 
establishing direct links with local organizations or individuals of 
his choice. What we are to understand from this is that when the 
federal government speaks of decentralization, it is merely 
replacing the salaries of federal employees with grants to local 
organizations, thus retaining total control over program standards.
<P>
	With Bill C-96 it is absolutely clear that the federal government 
does not intend to respect this area of provincial jurisdiction in any 
way. We in Quebec will not allow this to happen.
<P>
	Once again, this reminds me that, only hours after the last 
referendum, the Prime Minister of this country, the leader of the 
party across the floor here, the Liberal Party, the one that started off 
promising no changes, nothing on the table, after the conference on 
the UN, said there was no question whatsoever of proposing any 
changes. And with that great declaration of love, paid for by all of 
us of course, that put any possibility of decentralization, any 
possibility of change, on ice.
<P>
	This bill was already prepared, of course, but it is totally 
contradictory to what the Prime Minister of Canada had suggested.
<P>
	In reaction to Bill C-96, a proposal was made by Claude Béland, 
with the support of Ghislain Dufour, a person who cannot be 
accused of defending the sovereignist cause. As you are well 
aware, Mr. Speaker, Ghislain Dufour does not run with the 
sovereignists, but with the party across the floor. He asked that the 
SQDM unanimously adopt a resolution demanding that the federal 
government transfer the budgets it allocates for manpower training 
to Quebec and that it not establish a parallel structure to the SQDM.
<P>
	Henri Massé, secretary general of the FTQ, also pulled no 
punches in his attack against this federal plan. ``We no longer want 
the federal government butting in where it has no business to 
be-that is, manpower-and going over our heads to implement a 
parallel structure''.
<P>
	Still in connection with the referendum campaign, Victoriaville, 
in the next riding to mine, Lotbinière, had an important visitor, the 
Minister of Foreign Affairs, representing a Montreal riding whose 
name escapes me.
<P>
<B>(1710)</B>
<P>
	I know that an Ontario resident who has a riding in Montreal 
happens to be our Minister of Foreign Affairs. He told about fifteen 
people at a public meeting in Victoriaville that it was Quebec's 
fault if there was any duplication. Now really! Sure, that is what he 
said. He did not realize it but there was a reporter-he thought he 
was alone, no media-who only had a tape recorder and the next 
day they played his tape of the minister's speech on the radio news.
<P>
	It really takes colossal nerve and then some, to go to 
Victoriaville, in the riding of Lotbinière, and say it was Quebec's 
fault if there was any duplication. Now that is a clear case. Let 
them stay home. We do not want them. The Liberal predecessor of 
the PQ government, under Robert Bourassa and then Daniel 
Johnson, unanimously adopted a resolution asking this government 
to stay out of manpower training. They just do not understand. Two 
structures and deficit upon deficit.
<P>
	In fact, one of my constituents from East Broughton, Clément 
Paré-I asked his permission to mention his name-told me: 
``People do not understand. It is like a well at one end of my 
property. I take a pipe to bring the water from the well down to the 
bottom of my property. The further I get from the well, the more 
likely I am to get leaks, and I also lose pressure''. It does not take a 
university degree to understand that.
<P>
	He said: ``It is the same in Ottawa. You pay taxes to Ottawa, the 
money goes from East Broughton and Frontenac and is sent to 
Ottawa, some of it gets lost on the way, and then it goes back down 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16564"> 16564 </A></B>
<P>
to East Broughton and to Thetford, and some more gets lost, and 
we are left  with the crumbs''. That is the kind of system we have: 
duplication throughout.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, I told you the story about the well and I saw your 
knowing smile. This is a very good example. I think my 
constituent, Mr. Paré, has very good judgment, and that is probably 
why he voted and worked for the Yes side in his beautiful 
municipality of East Broughton.
<P>
	As I left my riding this morning, I stopped in Weedon to get 
some gas, and I noticed the Pepsi-Cola vending machine had been 
struck by a car. So I told the garage owner: ``Too bad about that. 
Your Pepsi machine is broken already''. He replied: ``Yeah, sure, it 
was not big enough''. In fact, it was huge, standing there outside 
the garage. Actually he was joking when he said: ``It was not big 
enough''. I said: ``Too bad, it will cost you a few dollars to repair 
that''. He said: ``Oh, that does not matter''. So I said: ``How 
come?'' He said: ``It does not belong to me, it belongs to Pepsi''. 
You see, Mr. Speaker? It belongs to Pepsi, so it does not matter.
<P>
	People often react the same way to Ottawa. When I was the 
mayor of a small municipality, I remember we spread eight inches 
of nice new gravel on the sixth line. My constituents who were, of 
course, a small group, came to complain that the municipality was 
spending too much money. I said: ``No problem. You are not 
paying for it''. They said: ``How come?'' I said: ``The money 
comes from the province''. They said: ``So you got a grant, Mr. 
Mayor?'' I said: ``Yes. I got it through our MNA''. They said: 
``Great, the money comes from Quebec! It is not our money''.
<P>
	So you get the same reasoning when it comes from the federal 
government. When it comes from the federal government, it comes 
from somewhere on this planet, nobody knows exactly where. My 
point is that when the Minister of Foreign Affairs, this Ontarian 
who represents a Montreal riding, when he said in Victoriaville that 
if there was any duplication, it was not the federal government but 
the Quebec government, it really takes a colossal nerve.
<P>
<B>(1715)</B>
<P>
	The board of directors of the Canadian Institute of Adult 
Education has also condemned the Liberal government's initiative. 
The CIAE strongly objects to Bill C-96. The Bloc Quebecois is not 
alone in its opposition to Bill C-96. With this bill, the federal 
government has demonstrated a flagrant lack of respect for the 
aspirations of the provinces and especially those of Quebec in 
matters of education, manpower training and development.
<P>
	With all these agencies and many others that are opposed to Bill 
C-96, the government of Quebec condemns outright the federal 
Liberal government's insistence on going ahead without 
considering the needs expressed by the groups concerned. Quebec 
Employment Minister Louise Harel reacted as follows to Bill C-96:  
``This is an outright refusal on the part of Ottawa to consider the 
consensus that exists in Quebec and was repeatedly expressed by 
the previous administrations of Mr. Bourassa and Mr. Johnson and 
by the present government headed by Mr. Parizeau, a consensus on 
the need to patriate all programs and budgets for manpower 
adjustment to Quebec''.
<P>
	In concluding, I want to point out that the Quebec Liberal Party, 
when it was in power, demanded that the federal government 
withdraw from this provincial jurisdiction.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Osvaldo Nunez (Bourassa, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased 
to take part in the debate, at second reading, on Bill C-96 
establishing the Department of Human Resources Development 
and amending certain acts, which was tabled in June.
<P>
	This bill provides, essentially, for the administrative 
reorganization of the department and brings together sections and 
services from the former Departments of Employment and 
Immigration, Health and Welfare, Labour and the Secretary of 
State.
<P>
	It reaffirms the federal government's involvement in manpower 
training, employment and social programs.
<P>
	It contains no indication of the federal government's intention to 
respect federal jurisdictions.
<P>
	Reaction in Quebec to Bill C-96 was therefore negative. The 
FTQ cautioned the federal government about its latest attempt to 
intervene in areas of Quebec's jurisdiction in manpower 
development. The federation's general secretary, Henri Massé, 
indicated they had had enough of Ottawa's involvement in this area 
and its bypassing the province to set up parallel structures. He said 
that Quebec had established a special partnership in the area with 
the Société québécoise de développement de la main-d'oeuvre or 
SQDM. He added that there was a strong consensus favouring 
Quebec's becoming solely responsible for policies on manpower 
adjustment and occupational training within its borders and its 
acquiring the funds the federal government allocates to these 
programs.
<P>
	The Conseil du patronat agrees with the unions on this, 
something that does not happen very often. Even Robert Bourassa's 
Liberal government opposed a similar move by Ottawa in 1991.
<P>
	The SQDM has asked the federal government to keep out of 
areas of Quebec's jurisdiction in manpower development.
<P>
<B>(1720)</B>
<P>
	The board of directors, on a motion by Claude Béland, the 
president of the Mouvement Desjardins, seconded by Ghislain 
Dufour, the president of the Conseil du patronat, unanimously 
adopted a resolution to call on the federal government to transfer to 
Quebec the funds it allocates to manpower training. Furthermore, 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16565"> 16565 </A></B>
<P>
they asked  Ottawa not to establish any structure parallel to the 
SQDM.
<P>
	The Quebec minister of employment, Louise Harel, denounced 
the bill in the following terms: ``This federal initiative amounts to a 
flat rejection of the unanimous Quebec consensus, expressed, both 
under the previous administration and under the current one, on the 
need for Quebec to regain control over all manpower adjustment 
measures, including the related budgets''.
<P>
	I take this opportunity to again protest the upcoming closure of 
the Canada Employment Centre on rue Papineau, which serves the 
population of my riding of Bourassa in North Montreal, where the 
real rate of unemployment is nearly 30 per cent. It is a model CEC, 
which provides top quality service to a large clientele. Unions, 
business, community groups, users and my constituents vigorously 
oppose its closure.
<P>
	Furthermore, the federal government has decided to close 34 
other Canada Employment Centres in an effort to cut expenses, 
thus resulting in the layoff of nearly 1,000 public servants. 
Computerized job kiosks will become more prevalent.
<P>
	The unemployment rate remains a very high 11.2 per cent in 
Quebec. The jobless have an urgent need for support services to 
which only 10 per cent of them had access last year. Instead of 
helping people who are looking for a job, the government makes it 
more difficult for them to have access to information and 
counselling services.
<P>
	One must add that these closures are all the more difficult to 
explain as the unemployment insurance fund, which is entirely 
financed by employee and employer contributions, has a five 
billion dollar surplus.
<P>
	Last September, the unemployment rate in Canada increased 
from 9.2 to 9.4 per cent. In Quebec, it went from 10.9 to 11.2 per 
cent. In British Columbia, it climbed from 8.8 to 9 per cent. Last 
year, cuts in the federal and provincial public sector resulted in the 
loss of 86,000 jobs. In October only, 3,000 civil servants lost their 
jobs. And yet, Bill C-96 contains no concrete measure to create 
jobs.
<P>
	If you allow me, I will take this opportunity to ask the minister 
of Human Resources Development to speed up the negotiations 
with regards to a social security agreement between Canada and 
Chile. In 1990, with the return of a democratic regime in Chile, as 
president of the Chilean council in Quebec, I had asked for 
negotiations to start on this issue.
<P>
	As a member of Parliament, I wrote the minister on several 
occasions. It was only at the end of 1994 that representatives of 
both countries met for the first time in Santiago. The second 
meeting took place last June, in Quebec City and in Ottawa. The 
Chilean community in Quebec and Canada would like this 
agreement to be  signed without delay; it will benefit many 
Canadian and Chilean citizens who lived and worked in both 
countries.
<P>
<B>(1725)</B>
<P>
	I would also like to congratulate the FTQ and the CSN who 
signed on November 13 a solidarity and co-operation agreement 
which will create a partnership between these two unions. That 
agreement confirms their common will to enhance the impact and 
the influence of organized labour in our society.
<P>
	I think that it is an historical agreement and an extraordinary 
measure bringing together two Quebec labour unions which will 
jointly face future challenges, including employment and the 
protection of existing social benefits.
<P>
	The next FTQ convention will be held from November 27 to 
December 1st in Montreal, where the theme will be to fight 
unemployment and prepare the future.
<P>
	The job issue will be the focus of all debates because the 
streamlining, reorganisations, voluntary termination of 
employment and early retirement programs are continuing and 
even increasing, both in the public and the private sectors.
<P>
	I wish my FTQ friends an excellent convention.
<P>
	Given the cuts in unemployment insurance, thousands of 
unemployed people will have no other choice but to ask for 
welfare, but welfare benefits have also been cut over the past few 
years. Recently, Ontario decreased welfare benefits by 21.6 per 
cent. It is unfair and cruel for Canada to fight the deficit at the 
expense of the have-nots of our society. I denounce the Liberal 
government's irresponsibility and lack of action in the fight against 
poverty.
<P>
	In closing, I would like to say that I approve the amendment to 
Bill C-96 presented by the member for Mercier.

	<B>Mrs. Monique Guay (Laurentides, BQ) </B>moved:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Motion No. 1</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That Bill C-83, in Clause 5, be amended by deleting lines 1 to 23, on page 3.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	She said: Mr. Speaker, I want to address the motion that we have 
tabled, an amendment to remove the amendment tabled by the 
Liberals during the committee meeting of November 2, which 
amended Bill C-83, in clause 5, by adding section 21.1, from (a) to 
(h).
<P>
<B>(1730)</B>
<P>
	I note that this bill was given a fairly bumpy ride in committee, if 
I may say so. The Liberals seemed to be caught between a rock and 
a hard place, to be torn between public servants and politicians. 
First, members opposite moved and voted on their own 
amendments, then cancelled them and moved and voted on new 
ones. You will agree that this is confusion at its best.
<P>
	The amendment our friends opposite, our friends of confusion 
and discord, are proposing seems to be a big catchall of 
environmental principles that constitutes a dangerous foot in the 
door of provincial jurisdiction.
<P>
	A careful reading of section 21.1 and its points (a) to (h) leads us 
to believe that the Liberals may have wanted to better explain the 
work of the future commissioner of environment and sustainable 
development. If that was their objective, I think they are way off 
the mark. Instead of presenting precise objectives in support of the 
future commissioner, the Liberals propose to give him a series of 
broad environmental principles that, ultimately, will not make his 
task any easier. Even worse, these broad principles will extend his 
mandate to a point where he will be unable to carry it out.
<P>
	However, this section is, once again, a case of the federal 
government wanting to interfere in provincial  jurisdiction. Indeed, 
through this section, the commissioner will have the mandate to 
monitor the progress of departments according to sustainable 
development criteria that are clearly the responsibility of the 
provinces.
<P>
	Thus, under section 21.1, a department encroaching on an area of 
provincial jurisdiction will get a positive appraisal from the federal 
commissioner. There was certainly nothing else to be expected 
from the Liberal committee members. True to themselves, they 
repeated the same arguments they had put forward when we were 
studying the CEPA, the Canadian Environmental Protection Act.
<P>
	It is becoming increasingly clear that the goal of Liberal 
committee members is to extend as much as possible federal 
jurisdiction on environmental matters and to use the federal 
government's spending power as much as possible, although that 
attitude is viewed as an aggression by the provinces. Committee 
members constantly refer to great green principles such as 
sustainable development, bio-diversity or systemic approach, to 
promote an increased federal presence in the area of environment.
<P>
	Of course air pollution is not restricted to one region. Of course 
water knows no boundary. Of course species move around. We all 
know this, but this is no reason for the federal government to 
become or set out to become the sole keeper of the environment, 
especially since the provinces have made great strides in that area 
and have taken their responsibilities. The same certainly cannot be 
said for the federal government, something the Liberals should 
recognize.
<P>
	The federal government has not made rapid progress and has 
failed on many environmental issues under its jurisdiction. Why 
then should we give it more responsibility, when it does not even 
carry out its primary duties? Why do they absolutely insist that the 
federal should interfere in areas of provincial jurisdiction against 
the provinces' will? There lies the failing, if I may say, of our dear 
Liberals. The Liberals have some great environmentalists such as 
the hon. member for Davenport and the hon. member for 
Lachine-Lac-Saint-Louis, who, much to their credit, are also 
great champions of Canada. But that is exactly where their 
weakness lies: they are fervent federalists.
<P>
	Their vision of the environment is clearly influenced, not to say 
marred by their natural federalist tendencies. That is why they tie 
everything that has to do with the environment to the federal 
system. This kind of attitude is alarming and dangerous for the 
environment because the farther you are from the field, the harder 
it is to find a solution. It is obvious that the provinces are closer to 
the environment and are therefore in a better position to deal with 
environmental issues.
<P>
	Let us have a look at the concept of sustainable development to 
be found in the bill, a concept the  Liberals use a great deal to 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16567"> 16567 </A></B>
<P>
crowd out the provinces. Sustainable development is an ideal all 
societies should strive for.
<P>
<B>(1735)</B>
<P>
	What is at stake here is not the validity of this principle, but the 
way it is implemented. The Bloc Quebecois not only recognizes the 
validity of the principle, but also the need, not to say the urgent 
need, to translate it into concrete measures.
<P>
	We believe this principle should be implemented by the 
provinces because they have the overriding jurisdiction over the 
environment. It is up to the provinces to promote the conditions 
needed for sustainable development.
<P>
	In a federal system, the principle of sustainable development 
takes on a new dimension, that is respect for jurisdictions and areas 
of authority. Obviously, the squandering of both financial and 
human resources, due to a double structure, is in no way 
sustainable. However, pursuant to their amendment, the Liberals 
are asking the commissioner to monitor the progress of the various 
departments, by taking into consideration criteria which clearly 
come under areas of exclusive provincial jurisdiction.
<P>
	Let us look at item (a) of the clause dealing with the integration 
of the environment and the economy. In fact, this part of the 
commissioner's mandate can turn into subsidy programs for 
suppliers or targeted purchase programs, for example.
<P>
	Using its spending power, the federal government has often 
launched programs or projects in areas of provincial jurisdiction. In 
many cases, after a few months, the federal government withdrew 
and let the provinces, including the province of Quebec, foot the 
bill and go through the ordeal of squashing these projects.
<P>
	This way of doing things can in no way help to protect the 
environment. Short term and paltry measures are to be excluded.
<P>
	Item (b) talks about protecting the health of Canadians. Health is 
an area of exclusive provincial jurisdiction. It is the responsibility 
of the provinces to prevent health risks due to water and air 
pollution or soil depletion.
<P>
	Again, the duplication of standards and the inconsistency with 
the provincial standards are inefficient and costly for the 
governments as well as for the private sector and the public. The 
federal government has again opened the door to new quarrels 
concerning the division of powers.
<P>
	Given the rather firm stand taken by the provinces on this issue, 
it is hard to understand the attitude of the federal government. That 
proves again that the Liberals do not understand a thing about the 
repeated demands for change made by Canadians and Quebecers.
<P>
	We are anxious to see the changes promised by the other side on 
October 30. It will probably, in the end, be another case of ``Much 
ado about nothing''. But I am fair-play and ready to wait and see. 
All the more so since the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs 
seems to be quite a miracle-worker.
<P>
	Item (c) of clause 21.1 has to do with protecting ecosystems. As 
owners and managers of the land, the provinces have jurisdiction 
over ecosystems. As an example, to assume this role, Quebec 
created 17 national parks. It also gave itself the legislative tools to 
preserve biodiversity.
<P>
	Provinces which have not yet done so have the responsibility to 
act and pay heed to the demands of the world community which, 
for example, made some criticisms in the OECD report concerning 
Canada's environmental performance when it comes to protecting 
ecosystems.
<P>
	Those are some of the items that make us doubt the will of the 
federal government to respect the provinces.
<P>
	Clause 21.1 of Bill C-83 is rather to the contrary. In mentioning 
vast environmental concepts the federal government shows its 
intention to interfere further in areas of provincial jurisdiction.
<P>
	The federal environmental record is nothing to cheer about.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Peter Milliken (Parliamentary Secretary to Leader of 
the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
on behalf of the government, I want to respond to what the hon.

<P>
	I think I should read the section the hon. member wishes to

<B>(1740)</B>
<P>
	It is section 21.1, which reads as follows:
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16568"> 16568 </A></B>
<P>
	I find it really surprising that the hon. member for Laurentides 
has decided to move such an amendment to the bill at this time.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	She knows perfectly well that her leader, the hon. member for 
Lac-Saint-Jean, was a minister of the environment and supported 
all these same principles. She comes into the House today while he 
is occupied considering his future and proposes an amendment that 
undermines the whole concept of sustainable development and a 
way of treating it in Canada.
<P>
	I am absolutely astounded that the hon. member for Laurentides 
is getting away with this. I suspect that if the Leader of the 
Opposition were in Ottawa he would hound his colleague, the 
member for Laurentides, for proposing such an amendment as this. 
She has tried to claim this amendment is one that affects provincial 
jurisdiction but on its face it most patently does not.
<P>
	It says that the commissioner will provide sustainable 
development monitoring and reporting on the progress government 
departments are making. How can government departments be 
making progress on things that are not within their jurisdiction? 
They must deal with matters within their own jurisdiction. If they 
were dealing with matters beyond their jurisdiction, they would be 
doing something unlawful. Everyone know that government 
departments do not do things that are unlawful, at least not very 
often.
<P>
	The hon. member who is making these claims is saying that 
government departments are in fact dabbling in provincial matters 
all the time and therefore this section is bad because the 
commissioner in his work might impinge on provincial jurisdiction 
if the government department was doing so and he was reporting on 
it. Presumably if he thought the federal government department 
was overstepping its bounds he would report that.
<P>
	After all, he is an officer who has some authority, according to 
my reading of this bill. I do not claim to be terribly familiar with it. 
I was not on the committee where the amendment was brought in 
but I understand the commissioner is given certain authority, which 
in my view is very sensible authority, to deal with a whole host of 
issues, all of which are of great concern to Canadians. Every one of 
the items I read from the list is of concern to Canadians.
<P>
	Yet we have a situation where a party headed by a former 
minister of the environment who supported all of these things when 
he was minister-
<P>
	<B>Mr. Boudria:</B> He invented some of them.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Milliken:</B> As the hon. member for 
Glengarry-Prescott-Russell has said so ably, he invented some 
of them and I am sure his memory of these things is better than 
mine. The hon. member for  Lac-Saint-Jean invented these very 
concepts and now one of his henchmen comes into the House and 
tries to undermine the whole process.
<P>
	I am shocked. I am sure every member of the House is shocked 
at the duplicity of the opposition in saying one thing through its 
leader when he was minister of the environment and saying another 
now through the hon. member for Laurentides with this frankly 
ridiculous amendment.
<P>
	I see even the members of the Reform Party are smirking. They 
must agree this amendment is pretty wild. It is not something they 
would support. I am sure they support the bill. I am sure they 
realize the bill is in the best interests of all Canadians as I am sure 
the Leader of the Opposition does. After all he knows more about 
environmental issues than I do. He was minister for several years. I 
know it was with a government that showed a callous disregard for 
the environment but he had a reputation for doing the best he could 
in difficult circumstances.
<P>
	Some say that perhaps-
<P>
	<B>Ms. Augustine:</B> -he should have remained.
<P>
<B>(1745 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Milliken:</B> Some say that perhaps he should have remained 
as Minister of the Environment, but he did not. On the other hand, I 
understand there were often times when he did not get a lot of 
support from his cabinet colleagues on environmental matters he 
raised. He may have gone out on a limb and done it in an 
appropriate way from time to time, but I do not know. I was not in 
the cabinet. It is not something I could easily comment on, but we 
certainly can see the effect of his environmental crusade. The hon. 
member for Laurentides has wilfully abandoned all the principles 
her leader stood for when he was Minister of the Environment.
<P>
	As I said, I find myself almost at a loss for words in trying to 
understand the amendment she has put forward today. I can only 
assume that the Leader of the Opposition did not see this 
amendment before it was tabled. If he had, he would have blown a 
gasket, in common parlance, and that would have been the end of 
the amendment.
<P>
	I can only say that I hope there is a vote on this. I want to see the 
Leader of the Opposition come into the House and vote against the 
principles he so resolutely stood for when he was Minister of the 
Environment.
<P>
	He may have forgotten some of the things he learned when he 
was minister.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> Remind him.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Milliken:</B> I am trying to remind him by this speech. I hope 
he reads it very carefully and I am sure the hon. member for 
Glengarry-Prescott-Russell would agree.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16569"> 16569 </A></B>
<P>
	Sometimes remembrance is important in these things. The 
Minister of the Environment always learns something about his 
or her portfolio when occupying that portfolio. When the member 
for Lac-Saint-Jean was a minister, I remember him standing and 
answering questions, defending the government's environmental 
policy in the House. Now we see his party trying to undo the work 
of a committee of the House and the work of the present very 
competent Minister of the Environment, the hon. member for 
Hamilton East.
<P>
	The hon. member for Laurentides is pleading with me to 
continue this eulogy. I certainly could do that. She knows what a 
competent minister we have. The fact is all these ministers have 
stood for this kind of principle and they have all adopted the 
principle of sustainable development as the cornerstone of 
Canada's environmental policy.
<P>
	The hon. member for Davenport, who I am sure will be speaking 
on this amendment in a few moments, can remind us of how long 
this principle of sustainable development has been a cornerstone of 
Canadian environmental policy. It is reflected in this bill. Here is 
an opportunity to have an officer with some authority to report on 
government departments on how they are doing on specific 
concerns. It was a great list.
<P>
	The hon. member for Laurentides wants to throw the whole thing 
out of the bill. I do not understand it. Of course, the government 
will oppose this change. It is wrong headed. It is contrary to 
principles espoused by the hon. member's own leader. It is contrary 
to the principles that were agreed on in the committee which 
studied the bill. I am shocked to hear at this late date that the hon. 
member for Laurentides would take it in her own capacity to move 
an amendment to the bill that would undermine what I think is the 
view of the vast majority of Canadians and the vast majority of 
members of the House.
<P>
	I want to indicate the government's strong opposition to the 
amendment. We will support the bill and the amendments that were 
made in committee. We feel the committee's amendments were 
entirely appropriate and the bill as it stands is a good bill.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Forseth (New Westminster-Burnaby, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, there is no doubt that the environment is an issue very 
dear to Canadians. We all want to do what we can to preserve this 
great country. Every day we ask ourselves: What can we do to 
make certain that the environment can be preserved and saved?
<P>
	The member for Laurentides is a great believer in environmental 
issues yet I have to question her amendment to Bill C-83. The bill 
is not a solid, forthright piece of legislation. There is no doubt 
about that. However, removing the part in clause 5 dealing with 
sustainable development makes a weak bill all that much weaker. It 
removes benchmark measurements on reporting.
<P>
	The Reform Party has been consistent in its position on Bill 
C-83. The bill would be much more effective if the role of the 
environmental commissioner were completely taken over by the 
auditor general. We know that the commissioner will be an 
employee of the Office of the Auditor General. The commissioner 
will have to pass everything by the auditor general before it can be 
released to Parliament and the public.
<P>
<B>(1750 )</B>
<P>
	Bill C-83 makes the government look as if it is serious about 
cleaning up the environmental practices of federal departments. 
However, the real question is whether or not this commissioner is 
going to really make a difference. The role is a strange one. The 
commissioner would monitor and report annually to Parliament 
through the auditor general on the extent to which federal 
government departments had met sustainable development 
objectives and implemented the actions set out in their sustainable 
development strategies.
<P>
	When the auditor general came before the environment 
committee, he stated quite clearly that there would not be a 
responsibility given to the commissioner that could not be 
performed by the auditor general himself. Therefore, Reform sees 
the role of the commissioner as outlined in this bill to simply be 
another level of bureaucracy, all of course at the expense of the 
taxpayers. It is a long envisaged proposal now coming in the form 
for the sake of appearances without any real substance.
<P>
	Let us not forget the Minister of the Environment stated that one 
objective of the commissioner would be to look into waste 
reduction. Therefore, if the auditor general's office took over more 
responsibility in terms of environmental issues would this not be 
cost effective as well as a reduction of wastefulness?
<P>
	The environment minister has truly convinced herself that Bill 
C-83 will be a solution to some of Canada's environmental chaos. 
The minister believes that when the commissioner reports to 
Parliament, federal departments are going to listen and then act. 
However, if they do not act now to the regular auditor general's 
reports, why would they act on a commissioner's report on 
environmental issues?
<P>
	Let me illustrate the point. The report from the auditor general in 
May 1995 looked at Environment Canada and the management of 
hazardous wastes. The auditor general reported that there was a 
lack of effort on Environment Canada's part to control the storage 
and destruction of PCB wastes. The control of PCBs is under the 
regulation of the Canadian Environmental Protection Act in order 
to minimize risk to human health and the environment.
<P>
	The auditor general stated: ``On March 31, 1995, Environment 
Canada terminated its leadership role in the management of PCB 
destruction without devising a  plan to guide federal departments to 
further consolidate PCB wastes, reduce their volume and develop 
action plans for their destruction. This could seriously impede the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16570"> 16570 </A></B>
<P>
government's ability to ensure safe and cost effective storage and 
timely destruction of federal PCB wastes''.
<P>
	The control of PCB wastes is crucial for true sustainable 
development. Unfortunately, the environment minister has not 
followed through with the auditor general's recommendations. 
Therefore, my question is: When and if the environmental 
commissioner is put into place, what will he or she say that will be 
any more convincing than what has already been said by the auditor 
general himself? The answer is nothing. The section of the bill 
adjusted by the Bloc amendment before us makes the bill ever 
more unfocused and vague and does not enhance any function at 
all.
<P>
	Canadians will soon realize that the commissioner is just a 
smoke screen created by the environment minister to make it 
appear that she is working to clean up the environment. She has 
done little throughout her tenure as minister that accomplishes an 
improvement to our environment. Her talk is shrill and her actions 
are sometimes expensive; the end result being an increased deficit 
with little to no environmental improvements.
<P>
	My friend from the Bloc Quebecois has an amendment at this 
stage that deletes what I believe to be the only clear specification in 
this legislation. While I do not agree that we should have a separate 
commissioner under the auspices of the auditor general, I do 
believe that if there has to be one it is essential that the person 
provide the best report possible on all sustainable development 
strategies to all category one departments.
<P>
	In this time of budget restraint and fiscal responsibility, I am 
bothered that the minister has chosen to spend the taxpayers' hard 
earned money with such a redundant position merely to add 
prestige and political significance to environmental issues. Such 
redundant spending is common among most Liberal ministers. It 
will only be a matter of time before Canadians come to the 
realization that to achieve a new and more environmentally 
sustainable Canada a different party must come to government.
<P>
	In closing, I cannot support the Bloc amendment. Bloc members 
continue to whine about preserving provincial jurisdiction while at 
the same time the Quebec provincial government creates overlap 
after overlap. The fiscal consequences for the poor people of 
Quebec due to the separatists' colorations and manipulations of 
public policy are very serious. The amendment adds nothing 
positive or helpful to a poor bill and therefore I cannot support it.
<P>
<B>(1755 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Hon. Charles Caccia (Davenport, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, to put 
this amendment into perspective, I would like to  pay homage to the 
hon. member for Frontenac and the hon. member for Terrebonne. 
They participated in the work of the committee which produced a 
report over a year ago proposing the measures contained in this 
bill, namely the creation of the position of the commissioner for the 
environment and sustainable development.
<P>
	Both the hon. member for Terrebonne and the hon. member for 
Frontenac conducted themselves in committee in a very 
constructive manner. In the conclusion of their dissenting report, 
they outlined three principles. One of the three principles reads as 
follows: ``It is imperative that the economic and environmental 
aspects of federal government decisions and policies be 
intrinsically linked''. We fully agree with that principle. We 
applaud the hon. member for Terrebonne and the hon. member for 
Frontenac for having concisely put forward such an important 
concept.
<P>
	However, we have enormous difficulties in reconciling the 
political direction which was taken by the hon. member for 
Laurentides and her colleagues. They are running in conflicting 
directions. They are not reinforcing each other. The motion of the 
hon. member for Laurentides which is now before us dismantles 
and ridicules the concluding principle I have just read.
<P>
	That is what the amendment the committee proposes, which the 
hon. member for Laurentides wants to wipe out, intends to do. It 
intends to intrinsically link the environmental and economic 
aspects of government decisions. The hon. member for Laurentides 
is proposing to wipe out this important concept.
<P>
	This is a very sad moment. The amendment by the hon. member 
for Laurentides means that her party is not in favour of protecting 
the health of Canadians. This is what her amendment would 
achieve.
<P>
	Her party is against the integration of the environment and the 
economy. This is what the amendment would achieve. Her party is 
against the protection of the ecosystem. That is what her 
amendment proposes. Her party is against meeting international 
obligations. That is what her amendment would achieve. Her party 
is against the promotion of equity. That means that her party is in 
favour of inequities. That is the effect of her amendment.
<P>
	Her party is against an integrated approach to planning and 
making decisions which take into account the environmental and 
natural resource cost of different economic actions. That is what 
her amendment would achieve.
<P>
	Her amendment would eliminate the principle of pollution 
prevention. Does that mean the Bloc Quebecois is against pollution 
prevention? That is the net effect of the amendment. The net effect 
of the amendment is to delete pollution prevention from the bill. 
The net effect of the amendment is to eliminate the concept of 
protecting the health of the public, of protecting the ecosystems 
and of meeting international obligations.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16571"> 16571 </A></B>
<P>
	Finally, the net effect of the amendment is to eliminate the 
respectful nature and the needs of future generations. In other 
words, the effect of the amendment is to say that the Bloc 
Quebecois rejects the Brundtland report and the definition of 
sustainable development. As the parliamentary secretary to the 
House leader already asked, is that the direction the member for 
Laurentides has received from her leader? Is that the new political 
direction of the Bloc Quebecois? Or, is it perhaps that the member 
for Laurentides badly needs a psychiatrist to remove her obsession 
with federal-provincial relations, her obsession with seeing under 
every chair a federal monster, a federal presence which may 
disrupt the quiet life of the people in her riding?
<P>
<B>(1800)</B>
<P>
	It is absurd to say that the amendment by the Bloc Quebecois 
reflects the majority of thought of members of her party for whom I 
have the highest respect. I do not recognize in the amendment the 
preachings, the interventions or the thoughtful examination I have 
experienced when the member for Frontenac and the member for 
Terrebonne were members of the committee. This is diametrically 
opposed to what I have heard from that party until now.
<P>
	I find it unbelievable that we should be debating an amendment 
of this nature which runs counter to everything the leader of the 
Bloc Quebecois said when he was Minister of the Environment and 
what his colleagues have said until now in support of sustainable 
development. There is no federal plot, I reassure the member for 
Laurentides. There is no fear to be had for jurisdiction because 
Canadians know very well that the environment does not know 
boundaries.
<P>
	Perhaps the member for Laurentides forgets there would not be 
any clean up of substance of the St. Lawrence River were it not for 
the federal government, were it not for the intervention in the Great 
Lakes of the federal government in co-operation with Washington. 
We know very well the source of pollution in the St. Lawrence 
River. It emanates and originates from activities on both sides of 
the border well upstream. Therefore the role of the federal 
government in cleaning up the St. Lawrence River is of paramount 
importance.
<P>
	The geopolitical law of gravity of water whereby rivers have to 
flow in a certain direction has escaped the attention of the member 
for Laurentides. She is more preoccupied with the federal presence 
than with the health of the people in Montreal and downstream. 
This is the obsession of the member for Laurentides when 
analysing and considering bills of an environmental nature.
<P>
	The member for Laurentides is worried about the waste of two 
levels. If we do not have a federal level concerned with 
international relations, who will do it? We will have a Canada for 
the next thousand years and therefore we need a federal presence in 
implementing  this type of legislation. Whether or not the member 
for Laurentides likes it, that is the political reality of today, 
tomorrow, the day after and for many generations to come, as the 
vote proved on October 30.
<P>
	Turning to the Reform Party members, they seem to be engaging 
in a very fashionable game in the House. Unfortunately they are 
copying the member for Laurentides. They like to attack the 
minister. They find this is the greatest sport since the invention of 
soccer. We have news for them. The minister is the best we ever 
had considering the work she has done under most difficult 
political and economic circumstances.
<P>
	Whether or not the Reform Party likes it, the minister has 
managed to promote harmonization on federal-provincial relations 
on the environment. This minister has managed to bring about an 
agreement on harmonization with British Columbia. It is quite 
interesting that the criticism is from members from British 
Columbia. The minister achieved that. The minister has produced 
the bill dealing with a commissioner for sustainable development, 
keeping a red book promise. The minister has engaged the 
Americans in consultations on the Great Lakes for the sake of the 
health of Canadians who live in that basin, namely the health of 
Canadians whose livelihood and well-being depend on the fresh 
water of that fantastic system.
<P>
<B>(1805)</B>
<P>
	The minister brought in and has before the House legislation on 
manganese, legislation that would remove MMT from gasoline, 
legislation that is opposed tooth and nail by the Reform Party on 
behalf of the Ethyl corporation which seems to have quite an 
influence on its way of thinking. We have a Minister of the 
Environment who has the courage to bring legislation before the 
House that hopefully will be approved very soon.
<P>
	This is not the end of the list. The minister will provide a 
governmental reply to the Canadian Environmental Protection Act 
report of the committee of the House, which is probably one of the 
most difficult tasks ever faced by an environment minister who has 
to be concerned at the same time with the environment, with health 
and with the economy. That is not a minor feat for any environment 
minister.
<P>
	Members of the Reform Party cannot appreciate that fact. It is 
only an indication of their political naivete or their political 
inability to understand the complexity of issues and to appreciate 
the complex role faced today by the Minister of the Environment. 
That is not all.
<P>
	The Minister of the Environment has managed to put on the table 
the extremely difficult issue of climate change and the necessity of 
reducing carbon dioxide emissions in the country, probably one of 
the most difficult issues to handle.
<P>
	It may well be it has escaped members of the Reform Party that 
there is a climate change issue surrounding us,  one that is at least 
accepted and talked about by the scientific community. The 
Minister of the Environment has managed to put the issue on the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16572"> 16572 </A></B>
<P>
agenda and is right now in Edmonton discussing the matter with 
her provincial colleagues.
<P>
	The Minister of the Environment has put on the agenda the 
question of the protection of endangered species, a matter which to 
my greatest disappointment does not have the support of the 
Reform Party. As recently as this morning the Reform Party 
opposed proposed legislation not by the minister but by a 
backbencher.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> I am sorry to interrupt the hon. member 
but his time has expired.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean-Guy Chrétien (Frontenac, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, for 
more than a year, I had the opportunity to sit on the Standing 
Committee on Environment and Sustainable Development chaired 
by the member for Davenport. I have to admit that, up until about 
ten minutes ago, I admired the member for Davenport. 
Unfortunately, I discovered this afternoon, in the speech he just 
made, that he had a total lack of respect for my colleague, the 
member for Laurentides, specially when he asked her if she needed 
a psychiatrist.
<P>
<B>(1810)</B>
<P>
	It was a low blow and I think the member for Davenport should 
apologize. He really went a little too far. During all the time that I 
sat with him on the environment committee, I always noticed his 
honesty and his judgment as a politician, particularly in 
environmental matters.
<P>
	It is therefore with great pleasure that I stand in this House to 
speak to Bill C-83, an Act to amend the Auditor General Act.
<P>
	It has been a few weeks since we last talked about this bill in the 
House, so I should take a few minutes to review its contents briefly.
<P>
	Bill C-83 amends the Auditor General Act to achieve five 
objectives which I will sum up quickly.
<P>
	Firstly, to ensure that environmental considerations in the 
context of sustainable development are taken into account in the 
Auditor General's reports to the House of Commons.
<P>
	Secondly, to require the appointment of a Commissioner of the 
Environment and Sustainable Development.
<P>
	Thirdly, to impose requirements for responding to petitions 
received by the Auditor General about environmental matters 
under federal jurisdiction-and I repeat it for the benefit of the 
member for Davenport-under federal jurisdiction in the context 
of sustainable development.
<P>
	Fourthly, to require monitoring and reporting to the House of 
Commons on petitions and the extent to which departments have 
met the objectives, and implemented the plans, set out in their 
sustainable development strategies.
<P>
	And finally, fifthly, to require that departmental sustainable 
development strategies be prepared and tabled in the House of 
Commons.
<P>
	On a technical level, the adoption of this bill will require the 
implementation of a number of things. First of all, there must be an 
appropriate definition of sustainable development. I will come 
back to that later.
<P>
	But I will say to the hon. member for Davenport, who got carried 
away a few minutes ago, that the government has been in power for 
two years. A sunken barge has sat in the waters between Prince 
Edward Island and the Magdalen Islands for 25 years now. At the 
end of June, we learned quite by accident that there was an 
important quantity of PCB tainted oil in the sunken ship. The barge 
has been there for 25 years and the Liberals were in power during 
most of that period, except for the nine years of the Mulroney 
government and the nine months of the Clark government.
<P>
	It is easy to boast about sustainable development, but that barge 
was supposed to be refloated this year and nothing has been done. 
They chose the wrong solution because it was cheaper, but I can 
guarantee you, as does my colleague for Davenport, that, once the 
<I>Irving Whale</I> is refloated, when we get the bill the cost will be more 
than if we had chosen the better solution to begin with.
<P>
	Sustainable development, what a trendy expression. It is useful 
if one wants to get reelected, of course. But why did they not apply 
it in the two years since their election? Of course, the Liberal Party 
sed up a fine committee-the Easter-Gagnon committee-that 
went to the Magdalen Islands and self sufficiently told to the 
people to step aside, that they would refloat the barge.
<P>
<B>(1815)</B>
<P>
	We can refloat it, they claimed. Give us 12 months, and we will 
refloat it. How much did it cost us to have the Gagnon-Easter mini 
caucus go around making political points?
<P>
	The member for Bonaventure-Îles-de-la-Madeleine learned his 
lesson with the last referendum. The islands' voters showed the 
member who had promised to resign if the no lost in Quebec where 
the door was.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Robichaud:</B> He won in his riding.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chrétien (Frontenac):</B> He was scared. He was so scared on 
the evening of October 30 that he was shaking all over. ``I should 
never have made empty promises''.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Robichaud:</B> He won in his riding.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chrétien (Frontenac):</B> He won in Bonaventure, but he lost 
in the Magdalen Islands. Close to 60 per cent  of the voters on the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16573"> 16573 </A></B>
<P>
Islands voted against him. There is one Liberal member of the 
Quebec legislature, Georges Farrah, however, and one in Ottawa, 
who barely got 40 per cent. That really requires a colossal amount 
of nerve.
<P>
	I was teaching ecology at the Disraeli comprehensive high 
school when several million dollars were spent there. The Liberals 
were not in government at the time, of course; it was the member 
for Sherbrooke who was acting as Minister of the Environment. He 
had organized a television show in prime time Sunday evening, 
coast to coast, paid for by the taxpayers, on the Green Plan, six 
billion dollars over five years. That turned into five billion over six 
years, and got watered down and watered down, until today no 
trace remains. Nobody knows what became of the Green Plan.
<P>
	In the schools we showed videotapes of it, which provided our 
young students with some glimmer of hope about the environment 
and sustainable development. Now it has been junked. In the waste 
basket. And that is where the environmental commissioner is 
headed.
<P>
	The intent is to water the thing down so much that it will end up 
in the waste basket and thousands, hundreds of millions of dollars 
will be spent and-
<P>
	I would like to tell you about an example given by a friend from 
East Broughton, who said to me on the day after the referendum ``It 
is a bit like bringing water from several kilometres away. You start 
with a big pipe and you end up with a tiny one at the other end; 
there is surface tension, leaks here and there along the way''. We 
know what it is like in the federal pipeline system with its leaks 
here and there, you get to the end of the pipe and there is hardly any 
water coming out, no water pressure, nothing left. Everything got 
lost along the way.
<P>
	It is the same thing, what we are asking of you, my friends across 
the way. ``Mind your own business, but mind it well. And when 
something is not your business, not within your area of jurisdiction, 
then butt out and stay where you belong''.
<P>
	It is true we all breathe the same air, we all drink the same water 
and we all walk on the same ground. When you came to Montreal 
on October 27 to tell us you loved us, at taxpayers' expense, of 
course, we let you breathe our air. When we come to Ontario, you 
let us breathe your air.
<P>
	This is how we want to live. So stay home, and when it is a 
provincial matter for Quebec, mind your own business. We are 
quite capable of minding our own business, better than you are.
<P>
	An agreement was signed with the United States to develop the 
Great Lakes. It is working out fine. We get a report every two years. 
That is fine. It is having no effect on the United States' 
environment. You are not going to meddle with American 
environmental jurisdictions, why do you want to meddle with 
Quebec's? We will not tolerate it. That time is long gone.
<P>
	When your jurisdictions are involved, look after them, but keep 
out of our space.
<P>
	Having said that, I again call for an apology from the hon. 
member for Davenport, who showed disrespect for my colleague 
for Lotbinière.

<H2 ALIGN="CENTER">ADJOURNMENT PROCEEDINGS</H2>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	A motion to adjourn the House under Standing Order 38 deemed 
to have been moved.
<P>
<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="EDUCATION">EDUCATION</A></H4>
	<B>Mr. Chris Axworthy (Saskatoon-Clark's Crossing, NDP):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, a little while ago I asked the Minister of Human 
Resources Development what he thought of Statistics Canada 
reports that Canadians with lower levels of education are having 
serious difficulties in the workforce. How did he see the serious, 
significant reduction of funds to post-secondary education and how 
did he think it would affect the generation of opportunities 
Canadians need.
<P>
	Education is a right of all Canadians. Research studies suggest 
that technical institutes, colleges and universities offer Canadians 
the most fertile ground for future prosperity and a place in the 
workforce. In today's information economy, the job prospects of 
Canadians and their earnings are increasingly dependent on what 
they know. The success of Canadians and, indeed, of Canada's 
future rests on the notion of accessible and affordable 
post-secondary education for all who can benefit from it.
<P>
	This unfortunately is not the case in Canada. With the present 
government's policies these crucial objectives are farther from 
being met than ever before.
<P>
	Studies reveal that the majority of post-secondary education 
students originate from an upper middle class socioeconomic 
background. Higher tuition fees and increasing living expenses are 
creating huge debt loads for students and reducing accessibility for 
potential university and college students.
<P>
	More effort, not less, needs to be directed to ensuring that young 
people from sections of society which are presently under 
represented in our post-secondary education institutions are 
provided with opportunities to study. Post-secondary education 
must be available to all Canadians if Canada is to prosper.
<P>
	A recent Statistics Canada study reveals that educational 
requirements have risen so sharply that young Canadians now need 
a university degree to earn roughly as much as a high school 
graduate in the same age group earned a decade before. Over the 
same period the earnings of high school graduates decreased by 
about a quarter. Those without high school certificates have an 
even more difficult time of it.
<P>
<B>(1825)</B>
<P>
	Young people have lost significant ground over the last decade. 
However it is also important to recognize that the incomes of 
university graduates have grown rapidly  with work experience, 
while high school graduates have only seen modest gains.
<P>
	The broad point is that future economic growth for Canada and 
for Canadians will depend on how much education Canadians 
attain. The country and the government need to commit themselves 
to the notion that all Canadians have a right to accessible and 
affordable education. Quality education should not only be 
available to the rich.
<P>
	Over the last 15 years under successive Liberal and Conservative 
governments this right has been eroded by drastic cuts to funding. 
Considering that only 43 per cent of young Canadians in the 25 to 
29 year old age group had a high school diploma in 1993, the future 
of Canada's economy does not look bright unless we turn the 
situation around.
<P>
	In 1995 university applications were down about 5 per cent on 
average for first year university places. This is the sharpest drop of 
its kind in more than 20 years. We are going in the opposite 
direction to what Canada needs. With nearly half of young 
Canadians facing a future of low or stagnant incomes, high 
unemployment and diminishing opportunities for full time work, 
we are headed toward a polarized society and an economy 
functioning at well below desired objectives if we do not reduce the 
educational deficit.
<P>
	Despite all the evidence showing that higher education is a 
prerequisite to prosperity both for Canadians and for Canada, the 
federal government continues to cut funding for post-secondary 
education; a 25 per cent cut to health, post-secondary and social 
programs, the deepest cut since the second world war.
<P>
	The government states that we cannot afford the cost of investing 
in our young people and of investing in the future. It must start 
listening to common sense. The government must not cut 
Canadians' lifeline to future prosperity. Instead it must start 
listening to young Canadians who want a quality future, a quality 
workforce and the opportunity to contribute to a quality economy 
and a quality society.
<P>
	These drastic cuts to post-secondary education cannot be 
justified. Since the government has forgotten, I will remind it once 
again that funding for post-secondary education is a critically 
important investment in Canada's future. Canadians and Canada 
deserve better.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Maurizio Bevilacqua (Parliamentary Secretary to 
Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
I should like to start by making a very clear statement: young 
people are very much a priority of the federal government.
<P>
	In April 1994 the government announced the youth employment 
and learning strategy to address problems that have held back many 
young people from participating fully in society. By that I mean 
high school dropout rates have been high. There has been a lack of  
<P>

<B><A NAME="16575"> 16575 </A></B>
<P>
access to post-secondary education, work experience and effective 
job training.
<P>
	We have moved on several fronts. We have made serious 
amendments to the Canada student loans program by increasing 
loan limits for full time students from $105 to $165 per week and 
by raising the yearly loan limit for part time students to $4,000. For 
the very first time we are offering special opportunities grants for 
women pursuing doctoral studies, for high need students and for 
persons with disabilities. We have begun to offer the programs 
because we saw within the federal sphere there was a void that 
needed to be filled and we did that. We also have Youth Services 
Canada and youth internship programs. Combined they have had a 
positive impact on the lives of over 30,000 young people.
<P>
	These measures speak to how the government, the federal 
Government of Canada, has been able to address key concerns and 
issues affecting young people.
<P>
	This is only the beginning. We realize that the future lies within 
our young people, within future generations. For this reason we 
have combined all these tools so that the future for the country and 
for future generations will look bright.
<P>
	We have also made some headway in youth entrepreneurship 
programs that have helped young people acquire the proper skills, 
not to mention the important measure taken this summer of 
creating over 44,500 jobs through our summer job action plan and 
the spinoff from the Canada employment centre for students which 
was over 175,000. The commitment of the government as far as 
youth policy is concerned is crystal clear.

	<B>Mrs. Bonnie Hickey (St. John's East, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, a 
number of years ago Nellie Nippard was stabbed 33 times by her 
husband and left for dead. By some miracle Ms. Nippard survived 
and today works with the women's organizations in Newfoundland.
<P>
	Just two years ago another woman, Brenda Young, suffered 
multiple stab wounds at the hands of her boyfriend while her two 
young children slept in the other room. Unfortunately Ms. Young 
did not survive her attack.
<P>
	Both of these women are from my home province of 
Newfoundland. One of them lived in my riding of St. John's East. 
The violence they endured was extreme but unfortunately it is not 
rare.
<P>
	There are thousands of women in Newfoundland and across the 
country who live in fear and are subject to violence. In spite of the 
good work and good will which exists across the country for 
enhancing the security and safety of women, the violence persists.
<P>
	Statistics show that more than half of all women in the country 
have experienced at least one incident of violence, as defined under 
the Criminal Code, in their adult lives. Twenty-five per cent of 
women have experienced violence at the hands of a current or past 
marital partner. On average, a woman is killed every six days in 
Canada, often in a private home or by someone she knows.
<P>
	Women make up 59 per cent of all homicide victims killed in a 
domestic relationship. Forty-two per cent of women surveyed in 
1993 reported they felt unsafe walking in their neighbourhood after 
dark, over four times the figure of men.
<P>
	Despite the statistics, some cling to the belief that the problem is 
not that bad or dismiss it as a women's issue. This problem needs to 
be addressed. The eradication of violence against women can be 
accomplished only with the full partnership of all members of 
society.
<P>
	This can no longer remain a women's issue. Violence against 
women affects us all. When women are abused there are costs to 
the victim, the family and to society. Taxpayers pay significant 
sums of money in medical costs for doctors, hospital emergency 
wards and medical health clinics; in criminal justice, costs for 
police services, courts and corrections; and in social service, costs 
for welfare, housing and daycare. As well, employers pay for 
violence against women in higher absentee costs and low 
productivity rates.
<P>
	The most recent example of how violence against women affects 
more than just the victim was raised in the Newfoundland Select 
Committee on Children's Interests. The committee has been 
holding public hearings across the province. It heard from the 
administrator of the Iris Kirby House, a women's shelter in my 
riding, about how devastating domestic violence can be for our 
children.
<P>
	The committee heard how children who witness family violence 
show signs of low self-esteem, which leads to a lack of 
self-confidence and a feeling of insecurity. As these children get 
older, depression, withdrawal and pessimism set in, leading to 
suicidal tendencies, drug dependency and emotional instability.
<P>
	These children often do poorly in school because they have 
difficulty concentrating, are frequently absent and show 
behavioural problems. Also, research shows that children who 
witness violence in the home are more likely to live in a violent 
relationship in their adult lives.
<P>
	We are approaching December 6, which some may not realize is 
the national day of remembrance and action on violence against 
women. It is a time for us to pause and remember the 14 women 
who died tragically at the Ecole Polytechnique in Montreal six 
years ago. As important as December 6 is, we need more than just 
one day of awareness about violence against women. We need to 
take action on a daily basis.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="16576"> 16576 </A></B>
<P>
	We need to continue to provide support and funding for the 
various women's shelters and treatment programs which provide 
cost effective support and services.
<P>
	I know the government has taken action over the past two years 
to address the issue of violence against women, but I would like the 
parliamentary secretary to assure my constituents and all 
Canadians that this is and will continue to be a priority of our 
government.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Finestone (Secretary of State (Multiculturalism) 
(Status of Women), Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague for 
articulating the situation very well.
<P>
	I assure her that in the past two years the government has taken 
many concrete and positive steps toward reducing and preventing 
violence against women and children. Our strategy is multi-faceted 
just like the problem of violence which is particularly costly 
socially, psychologically and economically to our society.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	We also took a number of legislative measures, starting with the 
firearms bill.
<P>
	I wish to urge the members of the other place to pass this bill 
immediately. They cannot remain insensitive to the distress call 
sounded by the families of the victims of events at the École 
polytechnique and by the individuals my hon. colleague just 
mentioned. Two thirds of the people killed by their partners are 
women and one third of all victims of homicide are women.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	We have introduced amendments to the Criminal Code to make 
peace bonds more effective in keeping abusers away from women 
and children. As of January 1, 1996 Bill C-41 will require tougher 
sentences for crimes involving abuse of trust or those motivated by 
gender based hate.
<P>
	The government supports community based solutions. For 
example, more than 2,000 projects have been funded through the 
family violence initiative, which has been extended for another 
year. Status of Women Canada has made available community kits 
on violence against women, a step by step guide to community 
action. I hope many communities will write in to get copies of it 
and use it, as many have already done.
<P>
	At the recent fourth United Nations world conference on women 
in Beijing Canada was active in securing strong wording on 
violence against women. The final agreement states that violence is 
never a private matter, that the state has an obligation to legislate 
against violence against women and to prosecute and punish those 
who commit violence.
<P>
	In the interest of our women and our children and the men in our 
society we must reduce violence in our society. In Canada the 
government is working to fulfil that obligation.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The motion to adjourn the House is now 
deemed to have been adopted. Accordingly, this House stands 
adjourned until tomorrow at 10 a.m.
<P>
	(The House adjourned at 6.38 p.m.)
