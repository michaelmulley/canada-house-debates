	<B>The Speaker:</B> I have received notice from the hon. member for 
Mount Royal that she is unable to move her motion during private 
members' hour. It has not been possible to arrange an exchange of 
positions in the order of precedence.
<P>
	Accordingly, I am directing the table officers to drop that item of 
business to the bottom of the order of precedence. Private 
members' hour will thus be cancelled and the House will continue 
with the business before it.
<P>
	Today is a supply day and I would encourage all members to 
refrain from using props in any way. I leave that just where it is.

	<B>Mr. Jack Ramsay (Crowfoot, Ref.)</B> moved:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That this House recognize that the families of murder victims are subjected to 
reliving the pain and fear of their experience as a result of the potential release of the 
victims' murderers allowed under section 745 of the Criminal Code, and as a 
consequence, this House urge the Liberal government to formally apologize to those 
families for repeatedly refusing to repeal section 745 of the Criminal Code.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	He said: Mr. Speaker, I am please to stand this morning to speak 
to this motion. Tomorrow in a B.C. courtroom a drama begins, 
initiated by one of Canada's most sadistic and despicable 
criminals, a drama that will rekindle the pain, horror and anguish of 
the 11 families whose children fell victim to mass murderer 
Clifford Olson.
<P>
	The legal base for this horrifying drama has been created and 
sustained by the bleeding hearts who have controlled the Liberal 
and Tory governments for the past 20 years. That legal base is 
section 745 of the Criminal Code.
<P>
	These bleeding hearts believe that a mass murderer like Clifford 
Olson should have a legal base to seek a reduction in his penalty for 
kidnapping, raping and murdering 11 little children.
<P>
	Section 745 of the Criminal Code is irrefutable proof of the 
existence of that belief in the Liberal Party, the Tory Party, the NDP 
and the Bloc.
<P>
	These bleeding hearts, supported by a host of judges, crown 
prosecutors, defence lawyers and touchy-feely groups, insist that 
Clifford Olson have this right in spite of the horror and terror Olson 
created in the minds of 11 innocent little victims as he savaged 
them in the pursuit of his own sexual lust and then murdered them 
after his lust was spent.
<P>
	These bleeding hearts insist that Olson have this right in spite of 
the feelings of terror and horror suffered by the parents and 
families over the loss of their innocent little sons and daughters and 
the fact that these families will have to relive these feelings all 
because of the simplistic thinking of those who man our 
institutions of government and the clinging vines who suck their 
sustenance off a sick and pathetic justice system.
<P>
	Compare the pain, the agony and the loss suffered by the victims 
and their families with that of a life term for Clifford Olson. He 
lives safe and secure. He does not have to work. He has the best 
food. His medical needs are provided. He has a coloured television. 
He has the right to vote and to initiate lawsuits over the most 
frivolous of matters, all at taxpayer expense. Now he has the right 
to appeal for a reduction of his parole ineligibility while taking the 
families of his victims through hell one more time.
<P>
	These are the gifts of the bleeding hearts to Clifford Olson. 
These are the gifts to Clifford Olson from the Prime Minister of 
Canada and his Liberal government, from the Tory Party, the NDP 
and the Bloc, from the bleeding hearts in our court system and from 
the touchy-feely groups of society.
<P>
	While providing all these gifts to Clifford Olson, what do the 
Prime Minister and the rest of them have to say to the families of 
his victims? Nothing, absolutely nothing.
<P>
	I am splitting my time with the member for Edmonton 
Southwest. I will therefore be speaking for approximately 10 
minutes.
<P>
	I have repeatedly stood in this House, as have my colleagues, 
and asked one simple question, a question the  justice minister, the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8806"> 8806 </A></B>
<P>
Prime Minister and the rest of the bleeding hearts refuse to answer. 
What is a fair and just penalty for the taking of an innocent life? 
Their silence to this question is their answer. They believe an 
innocent life is worth only 15 years imprisonment while their 
murderers are extended every right and privilege.
<P>
<B>(1110 )</B>
<P>
	On February 24, 1976 the Liberal government introduced Bill 
C-84 to abolish the death penalty and to create two new categories 
of murder, first and second degree murder, both of which carried a 
minimum sentence of life imprisonment.
<P>
	The 25 year minimum for first degree murder was the Liberal 
government's trade-off for the abolition of the death penalty. 
Instead of the death penalty, society was to be protected by the 
incarceration for life of those who deliberately and premeditatedly 
killed, with no consideration for parole until a minimum of 25 
years had been served.
<P>
	However, unbeknownst to Canadians the Liberal government 
betrayed them by slipping section 745 into the Criminal Code. 
Section 745 nullifies the term life imprisonment and bestows on 
killers an unjustifiable right to early release before serving a 
minimum of 25 years.
<P>
	A life sentence is not about rehabilitation, it is about punishment 
and retribution for the most horrible crime in society, the unlawful 
taking of an innocent life and the devastating effect this has on 
society.
<P>
	The Liberal government's Bill C-45 was nothing more than a 
meagre attempt by the justice minister and his government to sugar 
coat those repulsive provisions of the Criminal Code for reasons of 
political expediency. In doing so the justice minister violated his 
own promise to the Canadian Police Association wherein he had 
agreed to do business with it to support its position to remove 
section 745 in return for its support of this ill conceived and useless 
firearms control bill.
<P>
	The Canadian Police Association learned from this experience 
that it cannot trust this justice minister or the Prime Minister.
<P>
	I am not just expressing my view on section 745. This view is 
shared by victims' groups and countless Canadians across the 
country. Bill C-45 may delay but it will not prevent killers from 
getting a judicial review and ultimately a reduction in their parole 
ineligibility. Bill C-45 and a review of a killer's application by a 
judge does nothing but add an expensive layer of bureaucracy to 
our growing criminal justice industry. This will add to Canadians' 
financial strain and undermine their personal security.
<P>
	The minister's June 11 introduction of Bill C-45, just 10 days 
before the House recessed for the summer, was nothing more than a 
half baked attempt to deflect  criticism for not preventing Clifford 
Olson from once again making headlines despite the fact he had 
almost three years and ample support to do something about 
section 745 of the Criminal Code.
<P>
	The justice minister's efforts to limit child serial killer Clifford 
Olson's bid for early release failed. And to the horror of all 
Canadians who have shared the pain of the Rosenfeldts and the 
other 10 families whose children were brutally ripped from their 
lives, on August 12, 1996 Clifford Olson was eligible for apply for 
early release.
<P>
	On March 11, tomorrow, the initial process of Olson's 
application for early release begins, much to the horror of not only 
his victims' families but to the horror of all Canadian citizens.
<P>
	March 11 will truly be a day of national disgrace. For the Liberal 
government to have turned its back on the families of Olson's 
victims, for the Liberal government not to have done everything 
within its power to prevent their anguish from festering more and 
more is absolutely appalling.
<P>
	Every time a killer applies for a judicial review of his parole, the 
family and society relive the horrible memories and live in terror of 
the possibility that these killers will be released from prison early.
<P>
	Every time Clifford Olson exercises his right, courtesy of the 
past and present government, to seek early release all Canadians 
visualize the pain and suffering his murder victims endured.
<P>
	Section 745 of the Criminal Code demeans the value of human 
life. The Liberal government's refusal to eliminate section 745 
clearly demonstrates the value it places on the lives of Canadians. 
The Liberal government, as well as the Bloc, believes the lives of 
our children and grandchildren are worth only 15 years.
<P>
	I suggest that if the Liberal justice minister asked Canadians to 
place a value on the lives of their children, overwhelmingly their 
response would be life imprisonment or capital punishment.
<P>
	I implore the Liberal government to repeal section 745 of the 
Criminal Code. I implore the government to validate immediately 
the lives of all Canadians by making these cold blooded killers who 
would take a life serve a true life sentence or grant the people of 
Canada a binding referendum on the return of capital punishment.
<P>
<B>(1115)</B>
<P>
	If my appeal to the government is in vain and if the appeals of 
the families of murder victims fall on deaf ears, as they have in the 
past, then I make a commitment to all Canadians today. There will 
be a federal election soon. A Reform government will remove 
section 745 from the Criminal Code in its entirety. Then first 
degree murderers like Clifford Olson will serve their full life 
sentences. In addition, we will grant the people of Canada  a 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8807"> 8807 </A></B>
<P>
binding referendum on the return of capital punishment for first 
degree murder.
<P>
	I make this commitment today in the memory of Christine, 
Colleen, Daryn, Sandra, Ada, Simon, Judy, Raymond, Sigrun, 
Terry Lyn and Louise, all who died horribly at the hands of Clifford 
Olson. I make this commitment to their families and to the memory 
of all murder victims, and to their families and to the citizens of the 
country. A Reform government will repeal this obnoxious and 
reprehensible portion of the Criminal Code of Canada.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bill Graham (Rosedale, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I listened with 
great interest to the member's comments. Could the member for 
Crowfoot tell us how a Reform government would go about 
amending the Constitution in a way which would have the effect of 
removing section 745 and which would affect Clifford Olson's 
situation?
<P>
	Surely the member is aware that this provision has been in the 
Criminal Code for some time now. This is a vested right under the 
law of this land which people have. I suggest to the member that in 
playing with people's emotions in this way, by attacking the law, he 
is being rather irresponsible. He knows, or he ought to know, that 
this is not a matter that could be removed in this case without a 
constitutional amendment. He knows or ought to know that no one 
on this side of the House has any brief for Clifford Olson. Everyone 
despises everything he did and everything he stands for.
<P>
	Surely the member believes in a certain amount of respect for 
law. Surely he believes that we do not live-
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hermanson:</B> The law is wrong and we are trying to change 
it.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Graham:</B> He spoke of living in a lawful society. He has 
trouble with gun control. After all it is guns that allow murderers to 
do their dirty work. This does not seem to bother him. It also does 
not seem to bother him to and suggest that a Reform government 
could wipe out the effect of section 745 while he fails to recognize 
this is a legal matter of great complexity which must be addressed 
properly. If he were honest in his speech he would address it now.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ramsay:</B> Mr. Speaker, I take exception to my colleague's 
suggestion that I am less than honest. That is simply not true. That 
is a false statement, if what he has suggested is that I am not honest. 
I am honest and I am reflecting the honest and sincere concerns of 
the families of victims of crime.
<P>
	He touched on an important point, the retroactive power of any 
government to remove the parole ineligibility section from the 
Criminal Code. We have researched this topic. Our legal 
researchers and others have indicated there is a question of the 
constitutionality of the powers of the federal government to 
remove the rights of Clifford Olson and others. It is a constitutional 
question.
<P>
	The government, supported by the member opposite, has passed 
other bills which have been challenged constitutionally. It is being 
done today. Why not err on the side of the victims and the families? 
Why is this member prepared to support the government in putting 
those families through hell one more time, of having the horror and 
the terror reawakened one more time?
<P>
<B>(1120 )</B>
<P>
	Why do we not think about the victims and their families more 
than granting privileges like the right to vote, like the right to sue 
and now the right to appeal a life sentence after serving only 15 
years?
<P>
	I ask this member to look at his own conscience and justify what 
he is saying to the families of the victims that have been raped and 
murdered by Clifford Olson. What would he say to them and what 
would he say to Clifford Olson? I know what he would say to 
Clifford Olson: ``Here's your gift. This is your gift from the Liberal 
government. We will not try to protect the families from the 
rekindling of their fear, horror and agony''.
<P>
	That is what this member is saying. ``We will not try that. Why? 
Because we are afraid of a constitutional challenge''. But he is not 
afraid of a constitutional challenge in things like the Pearson 
airport bill that went through this House. No.
<P>
	I find behind his comments a charade that is disgusting and 
reprehensible to the people of Canada who are concerned about 
causing the families to live one more time through that kind of 
agony and pain. Why do we not balance the law so that reasonable 
rights are granted the accused, but at the same time ensure that the 
families are not subjected to relieving their terror, not only this 
time at the hands of Clifford Olson, but if he is turned down he will 
be able to appeal again, and again and again.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Gouk (Kootenay West-Revelstoke, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I too find the question from the last member on the other 
side of the House quite unbelievable. I would like to ask a very 
straightforward question of the hon. member for Crowfoot-
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> I guess the hon. member did not hear that 
the five minutes questions and comments has ended. We are now 
back on debate. The hon. member indicated that he was splitting 
his time with the hon. member Edmonton Southwest.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ian McClelland (Edmonton Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I apologize to the House. I was under the impression that I 
would be following my Bloc colleague.
<P>
	This debate brings to mind just about the very first comment that 
I made in the House. I recall it very specifically. I had been in the 
House and spoken once or twice before. I commented on something 
that had taken place when the member for Notre-Dame-de-Grâce 
who had been the solicitor general at the time, was involved.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8808"> 8808 </A></B>
<P>
	When I made my statement he looked up at me and then after 
I had finished he rose on a point of order and said that was not 
the case, that he had taken part in the debate and that I was 
misquoting him. I apologized to the House and to the member for 
Notre-Dame-de-Grâce. I believe now that he is no longer a sitting 
member I may name him. We all know that I am talking about 
the former solicitor general Warren Allmand. I am glad that I did 
apologize for what he felt was misrepresenting him. Although we 
come from different planets as far as our approach to criminal 
justice affairs are concerned, I came to know him over the 
succeeding couple of years as a very fine individual.
<P>
	We may not have agreed on very many things as far as criminal 
justice affairs are concerned, but we found that we could 
honourably disagree and respect and like each other, even though 
we did not sing from the same song sheet.
<P>
	Section 745 came about as a direct result of the abolition of 
capital punishment. The abolition of capital punishment came 
about, as members know, because it was considered that there were 
two standards of justice in our country. It was considered by many 
in the civilized world as barbaric and that capital punishment in the 
name of the state was still murder. It really puzzles me how the 
same people who can be violently against capital punishment can 
be at the same time in favour of abortion but that is a whole other 
story.
<P>
<B>(1125)</B>
<P>
	Another major concern with capital punishment is that from time 
to time the state makes mistakes. That is evidenced by what is 
going on now in Ontario with the Morin inquiry. The criminal 
justice system has becomes more capable of making scientific 
evidence available that will-I am talking now about DNA 
evidence-conclusively prove that someone was not involved. 
When we look back at what could have been a mistake in the name 
of the state we have to say we are glad we do not have capital 
punishment.
<P>
	Opposition to capital punishment comes from the notion that in 
our society it is better that a thousand people go free than one 
innocent person be convicted. And carrying that to an extreme, it is 
better that the benefit of the doubt stay with the potential victim of 
the state so that an innocent person will not be punished. That is 
really the bottom line and basis of our jurisprudence, our criminal 
justice system, of our common law, that came to us over 800 or 900 
hundred years ago and has stood us very well.
<P>
	The quid pro quo for Canadians concerning capital punishment 
is that people who are convicted of capital offences will be in 
prison for 25 years, not for 15 years or not for 10 years. The quid 
pro quo to get rid of capital punishment was if someone, having 
committed first degree murder-we are not talking about 
manslaughter here, we are talking about premeditated murder as a  
capital offence-would find themselves in jail for 25 years. The 
maxim used all the time is ``if you cannot stand the time don't do 
the crime''.
<P>
	Our society says that at minimum people convicted of capital 
offences will be imprisoned for 25 years. That brings me back to 
the ex-hon. member from Notre-Dame-de-Grâce, Warren Allmand. 
When he was the solicitor general he stated, I will paraphrase but at 
the time I quoted from <I>Hansard</I><B> </B>that ``from this day forward the 
raison d'être, the reason of our criminal justice system, will be 
rehabilitation. It will not be the protection of society,'' which it had 
been up until that time. It was going to be from this day forward in 
Canada rehabilitation of the criminal.
<P>
	That is not all wrong. It makes sense because the recidivism rate, 
the rate at which criminals would find themselves out of jail, back 
in jail, as everyone knows is just like a revolving door. It makes 
sense to try to stop this never ending revolving door of people 
getting into trouble and then back into jail, getting out and then 
going back in. The only way that we can possibly stop this is by 
rehabilitation. The notion of rehabilitation just makes eminent 
sense.
<P>
	However, as it often is, when the pendulum swings it tends to 
swing too far. In my opinion and in the opinion of many the 
pendulum has swung far too far in favour of the rights of the 
criminals. It needs to swing the other way to give balance to the 
rights of victims.
<P>
	When we are talking specifically about section 745 which is the 
so-called faint hope clause, we have to ask ourselves who should 
have the faint hope? How is society best served? Are we serving 
society by saying to everyone who commits a crime, as Edward 
Greenspan, the famous criminal defence attorney, has said, that a 
person's future should not be determined by one horrific event, no 
matter how horrific that event was? The idea is that everyone is 
deserved of a future and the opportunity to right a wrong, and that 
we as individuals should not be known forever because of the 
results of one mistake, no matter how horrific.
<P>
<B>(1130)</B>
<P>
	On the other side of the coin, how is society to be protected if we 
do not hold people accountable and responsible for what they do?
<P>
	Our society has decided against the death penalty. Many people 
including myself believe that the death penalty is horrific and 
should not to be done in the name of the state. How are we to 
protect innocent victims? The only way is to ensure that before 
people commit a crime they understand the time that is involved. 
Before people make a decision to commit a crime they should 
understand they will be held accountable. To take another person's 
life in a premeditated first degree murder will result in 25 years 
behind bars, period, with  no hope of parole. If they do their time 
properly in the future they will be allowed to leave.
<P>

<P>
	In conclusion I move an amendment to the motion:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That the motion be amended by inserting the words ``and immediately'' after the 
word ``formally''.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The amendment of the hon. member for 
Edmonton Southwest is acceptable.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier-Montcalm, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, this morning, the Reform Party motion focuses attention 
on the Clifford Olson case. This is a truly terrible case, and one that 
does not reflect well on the Canadian justice system.
<P>
	Independent of the Bloc Quebecois position with respect to the 
amendments to section 745, studied here in this House when it was 
Bill C-45, does the hon. member of the Reform Party agree on two 
points?
<P>
	Before the government's proposed amendment to section 745, 
does he think that a well-informed jury would have released an 
individual like Olson-assuming that there had been no changes to 
section 745? On the other hand, we know that section 745 has been 
modified and that the amendments to section 745 contained in Bill 
C-45 do not allow multiple murderers access to a judicial review. 
Does he consider that Olson is a multiple murderer and therefore, 
in accordance with section 745 as modified by the government, 
Olson will not be freed?
<P>
<B>(1135)</B>
<P>
	Can the hon. member provide me with some information? In my 
opinion, under section 745 as it was before, Olson would not have 
been released, and the amendments made by the government will 
make it even more difficult for him to obtain his release, because it 
will be blocked immediately.
<P>
	His case has been chosen as typical. Although I do not wish to 
call them demagogues, they are coming very close to it this 
morning, by naming names and bringing all that up again. I know 
this is a serious matter, but could the hon. Reform member who has 
just spoken clarify section 745 for me? I know that they want to 
abolish it, but I am speaking of the present situation.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. McClelland:</B> Mr. Speaker, the fact that Clifford Olson is 
subject to review now makes this a particularly timely motion. The 
motion also reflects on every other section 745 review before the 
courts at this time.
<P>
	The point is not the process by which a murderer is able to utilize 
the law. The point we are making is when will the law protect the 
victims. It is not that the criminal has to go through several more 
hoops and that it is more difficult to be released under the 
provisions of section 745. It is that section 745 exists at all and that 
it causes the victims to have to go through the judicial process one  
more time to have the scab removed from the sore and to be hurt 
once again. They then become the victims not only of the criminal 
but of our criminal justice system.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Herb Gray (Leader of the Government in the House of 
Commons and Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
I am pleased to rise today to speak in response to the Reform Party 
motion concerning section 745 of the Criminal Code.
<P>
	For the information of hon. members I note that section 745 is 
now section 745.6. The section has been renumbered as a result of 
the coming into force of Bill C-41 on September 3, 1996.
<P>
	I want to spend a few minutes explaining what section 745.6 of 
the Criminal Code is all about. I fear there is still a great deal of 
misunderstanding about what the section is and what the section 
does.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Section 745.6 of the Criminal Code provides for a judicial 
review of the parole ineligibility period in cases of life sentences 
for those found guilty of murder or high treason.
<P>
	In cases of first degree murder or high treason, the ineligibility 
period is set by law at 25 years. In cases of second degree murder, 
the parole ineligibility period is 10 years, unless the trial judge 
orders a longer period of from 10 to 25 years. Offenders cannot 
have their parole ineligibility period reviewed until they have 
served at least 15 years of their sentence.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The decision in a section 745.6 review is made by a jury of 
ordinary citizens drawn from the community. Under the section as 
recently amended by the government, the decision to grant an 
offender a reduction of his or her parole ineligibility period can 
only be made by a unanimous jury. Twelve members out of twelve 
must be convinced that the offender deserves a reduction in the 
parole ineligibility period before the offender can apply for parole.
<P>
<B>(1140 )</B>
<P>
	After hearing evidence called by the applicant and by the crown 
attorney the jury-and not the judge or the crown attorney or the 
government-decides whether or not to reduce the parole 
ineligibility period. Where the jury decides not to reduce the period 
it may decide when the offender may apply again if at all. In any 
case it is not before another two years has been served.
<P>
	In cases where the parole ineligibility period is reduced the 
offender becomes eligible to apply to the National Parole Board for 
parole when the parole ineligibility period as reduced by the jury is 
up. The parole board then considers the case and may grant parole 
in appropriate cases. In making its decision the parole board must 
consider whether the offender's release would present an undue 
risk to society.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8810"> 8810 </A></B>
<P>
	The decision of the parole board has nothing automatic about 
it. Just because a parole ineligibility period is reduced and as a 
result an application is made to the National Parole Board, it does 
not mean in any way, shape or form that the applicant would get 
parole.
<P>
	I emphasize a point that is crucial to an accurate understanding 
of the issue which may not be well understood by members of the 
public. The life sentence imposed on a person convicted of murder 
or high treason continues literally for the offender's entire life. 
Accordingly, even in those cases where such an offender is released 
on parole, offenders continue to be subject to the sentence for the 
rest of their lives and can be reincarcerated or put back in prison at 
any time, should they breach the conditions of release imposed by 
the parole board.
<P>
	I repeat. The granting of parole by the National Parole Board is 
not automatic. It could and often is rejected.
<P>
	I also remind hon. members of the House of the legislative 
history of what is now section 745.6. As some members will recall 
the section was enacted in 1976 at the time capital punishment was 
abolished. At that time a 25-year parole ineligibility period was 
established for first degree murder and high treason.
<P>
	The section was enacted after full and vigorous review and 
debate of the legislation. It was not, as some critics of the section 
have suggested, slipped into the statute books by stealth as a 
surprise to the unwary. It was a fundamental aspect of the 
compromise reached at that time by the House on the very difficult 
question of the appropriate penalty for murder. It was enacted as a 
response to the recognition the 25-year parole ineligibility period 
was significantly longer than murderers were then serving before 
parole in cases of non-capital murder and in cases of capital murder 
commuted to life. I am told it was enacted in recognition of the fact 
that 25 years without eligibility for parole was and still is longer 
than comparable periods in many western democratic countries.
<P>
	The section was enacted to offer a degree of hope for the 
rehabilitation of some convicted murderers, as a protection for 
prison guards, and in recognition that in some cases the public 
interest would not necessarily be served by keeping offenders in 
prison beyond 15 years.

	We all know that the public has concerns about section 745.6. 
Many have called for its repeal because they were worried about 
the risks this section could pose to public safety.
<P>
	Others have invoked the fact that victims' families are 
victimized all over again when a judicial review is held 15 years 
after the trial, just when the pain of the trial is beginning to fade.
<P>
	Others would like to define an appropriate minimum period of 
imprisonment for the most serious crime in our Criminal Code.
<P>
	I share Canadians' concern for public safety. I am also moved by 
the suffering experienced by families of the victims of brutal 
crimes. The prospect of again victimizing these families during a 
public review before a judge and jury, when the offender has no 
chance of being granted a reduction in his or her parole ineligibility 
period is one of the reasons the government tabled the recent 
amendments to section 745.6.
<P>
<B>(1145)</B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The government has struggled long and hard with this issue. We 
have listened to all those who are concerned about section 745.6 
and have considered all the perspectives of those who wish to retain 
the section and those who want it repealed. In the end, the 
government does not support the repeal of the section. We believe 
that the reasons that justified its addition to the Criminal Code in 
1976 are still valid today.
<P>
	The section exists to recognize the possibility that at least some 
offenders can change after serving 15 years of their sentence. Our 
challenge is to find a way to ensure that the provision is applied 
sensibly and in a way that reflects public concerns. Indeed, that is 
exactly what the government's recent amendments to section 745.6 
will do.
<P>
	Members of the House will know Bill C-45, an act to amend the 
Criminal Code, which received royal assent on December 18, 1996 
and came into force on January 9, 1997, made three significant 
changes to section 745.6.
<P>
	First, the amendments eliminate any possibility of judicial 
review under section 745.6 for all persons who commit multiple 
murders in the future. For the purposes of the amendments a 
multiple murderer is anyone who murders more than one person, 
whether at the same time or not, and this would include serial 
murders.
<P>
	Second, the amendments create a screening mechanism whereby 
the chief justice of the superior court or a judge designated by the 
chief justice conducts a paper review of the application to 
determine if it has a reasonable prospect of success before the 
application is allowed to proceed to the review jury. If the offender 
cannot demonstrate that his or her application has a reasonable 
chance of success, the application will be screened out by the 
judge. This change applies to all offenders eligible to bring a 
section 745.6 application provided they have not already brought 
an application before the amendments came into force.
<P>
	By introducing this screening mechanism the government has 
ensured that for applications brought after January 9, 1997 the 
victims' families will not be forced to relive the offence through a 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8811"> 8811 </A></B>
<P>
public hearing  before the jury where the offender has no 
reasonable prospect of success.
<P>
	Finally, the amendments require that for all applications brought 
after January 9, 1997, the review jury must be unanimous in order 
to reduce the offender's parole ineligibility period. Before this 
change the jury had the authority to reduce the parole ineligibility 
period if two thirds of the jury or eight members out of twelve 
thought it should be reduced. Now the offender will have to 
convince each and every member of the jury in order to get a 
reduction.
<P>
	The government believes that these amendments have responded 
to legitimate public concerns about the section 745.6 review 
procedure while at the same time preserving the essence of the 
procedure in recognition of the hope that some offenders may be 
able to change after serving 15 years of their sentence. However, 
the government has not been content to leave the matter there.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	During the process of developing and passing these 
amendments, it was clear to us that one of the reasons for the 
public's concern with section 745.6 was that many people were 
unaware of the existence of this provision. Murder victims' 
families often learn of the existence of section 745.6 through the 
media, several years after the trial has ended and the murderer has 
been sentenced.
<P>
<B>(1150)</B>
<P>
	This belated discovery leads to a feeling of surprise and betrayal. 
This feeling of surprise and betrayal is evident among the lawyers 
of many victims who appeared before the House of Commons 
Standing Committee on Justice and Legal Affairs and the Senate 
Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs when 
these committees were examining Bill C-45.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	On February 27 the Minister of Justice and Attorney General of 
Canada announced that he had written to his colleagues, the 
provincial attorneys general, to ask them to issue instructions to 
their crown attorneys that victims' families are to be advised of the 
existence and effect of section 745.6 at the time of sentencing in all 
appropriate murder cases. At that time the Minister of Justice said: 
``I am asking the assistance of my provincial colleagues to ensure 
that this simple and practical step is taken to respond to the 
legitimate concerns of victims' families''.
<P>
	This government is doing what it can to ensure that section 745.6 
is applied sensibly and in a way that reflects the concerns of the 
public. I am pleased to be able to take part in this debate, to set out 
true facts about section 745.6, about how it works and about the 
recent amendments and other steps this government has taken to 
respond to legitimate concerns on this matter. I hope my remarks 
will help set the proper tone for a more  reasoned and thoughtful 
debate on this important matter of public policy.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jack Ramsay (Crowfoot, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I listened 
with interest to the comments made by the Solicitor General of 
Canada. He made a number of comments but overall it is very clear 
that this government has no intention whatsoever to respond to the 
needs of the victims, the families whose children have been 
murdered that will have to go through this painful experience 
again.
<P>
	The solicitor general indicated that he was deeply moved by the 
realization of the pain and agony that those families will have to go 
through again. But he was not so deeply moved that he would be 
prepared to do anything about it, which is the problem with this 
government.
<P>
	There have been petitions and cries from victims across this land 
who have said they have done nothing to violate the law and yet 
they must suffer again and again and again. Where do they stand in 
the scheme of things? That is what they are asking. Why are they 
not being considered? Why are members of Parliament and our 
government being deeply moved but not so deeply moved that they 
are prepared to lighten the burden that these victims have to carry 
for the rest of their lives? Why must they have that agony 
reawakened time and time again?
<P>
	According to the legislation the first 15 years is the longest 
period they may have in order to get over this horrible trauma. The 
murderers who apply and who take the victims through that agony 
again may apply within perhaps one, two or three years, certainly 
before 15 years again. There is a shortening of the period even if 
they are denied by the courts to have their parole ineligibility 
reduced, if they are denied day parole or early parole. If the 
murderer's request is rejected the victims' families will still have 
to go through that kind of torment again, and this government is 
unprepared to do anything about it.
<P>
	Being deeply moved is cold comfort to these people who are 
seeking justice, a balance in our justice system, a balance between 
the punishment of a murderer and the rights of the citizens of this 
country, in particular families of victims.
<P>
	He suggested that this bill was broadly debated and that 
Canadians knew about section 745 at the time it was placed in the 
Criminal Code.
<P>
<B>(1155 )</B>
<P>
	We had a police chief appear before the Standing Committee on 
Justice and Legal Affairs who said that he did not know. He was a 
member of the chiefs association and they did not know. He 
apologized: ``We must have been asleep at the wheel''.
<P>
	There was a lack of understanding. He made reference to the fact 
that the 25 year minimum that was imposed at  the time capital 
punishment was removed from the bill was much more time than 
what was normally being served by first degree murderers. Then 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8812"> 8812 </A></B>
<P>
why was it put there in the first place? Was it put there to deceive or 
dupe the public while section 745 was slid in the back door quietly, 
unbeknownst even to the police chiefs?
<P>
	I have listened to the hon. Solicitor General of Canada. All his 
comments tell me that the government is not prepared to move, in 
spite of the fact that the justice minister said to the Canadian Police 
Association ``we can do business; you support our firearms 
legislation and we will support your effort to remove section 745 
from the Criminal Code''. That is what he said on television. That 
is what we heard him say.
<P>
	Members of that association are now coming to us and indicating 
they were betrayed, that the justice minister did not keep his word. 
That is what the people of this country are saying to us as we travel 
across the land, that the government is insensitive, that it is not 
hearing our cries and that it has less concern for the victim and 
more concern for the rights and privileges of the murderer, just as is 
being demonstrated in the drama that unfolding in a B.C. 
courtroom beginning tomorrow.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gray:</B> Mr. Speaker, the record of the House of Commons is 
there for everyone to examine. It will demonstrate, if one looks 
back at the period when section 745 was debated in this House, that 
the bill was fully debated. It was voted on in the usual manner. It 
was considered not only in the House of Commons but in the 
Senate. The idea that this was brought in by stealth is totally wrong.
<P>
	If somebody in a population of 20 million people did not notice 
it, that is inevitable. It happens with respect to every piece of 
legislation. But the original section 745 bill was fully considered 
and fully debated.
<P>
	I submit we have responded to concerns of victims through the 
amendments to section 745 which were adopted and proclaimed in 
force recently. In addition to that the attorney general has asked his 
provincial counterparts to make sure that victims in cases of 
murder are fully informed of the possibility of section 745 
applications so this will not come as any kind of surprise.
<P>
	My hon. friend is mistaken when he suggests that if an 
application to reduce parole ineligibility is rejected another 
application can be brought immediately. This is not the case. The 
applicant has to wait several years.
<P>
	I point out that this does not lead automatically to parole if the 
application is successful. It is only successful if there is a decision 
by a jury of ordinary Canadians. This will simply lead to the 
applicant's making an earlier application to the parole board which 
does not have to and does not always grant the parole application.
<P>
	I realize the difficulties here. This is not an easy situation. This 
motion is being brought before the House at a time when there 
could well be an application with  respect to a very despicable 
individual, but the law is made on the basis of general application, 
not simply looking at one case, no matter how difficult it is.
<P>
	I suggest that this government has given great consideration to 
concerns of victims in the amendments that were passed and 
declared in force recently. Therefore I submit that this motion 
which is votable should be rejected.
<P>
<B>(1200)</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Leon E. Benoit (Vegreville, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
solicitor general has missed the point again. Whether or not 
Clifford Olson is granted early release there is a hearing taking 
place tomorrow on the issue. The families of those who had their 
children murdered by Clifford Olson will have to go through pain 
again.
<P>
	I would like to ask the solicitor general a very direct, 
straightforward question. I hope he will give a very direct, 
straightforward answer. Have any of the changes the solicitor 
general and his government put before the House since coming to 
power in 1993 prevented a situation which is painful to the families 
of those victims who indeed are victims themselves? Have any of 
the changes made it so that they would not have to go through the 
pain of Clifford Olson having a hearing for early release?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gray:</B> Mr. Speaker, my hon. friend knows as well as 
anybody that the bill is not retroactive and does not apply to 
Clifford Olson. It was our intention to have it apply retroactively. I 
hope the Bloc will correct me if I am wrong. If there had been more 
co-operation from the Bloc the bill might well have covered the 
Clifford Olson situation but it did not turn out to be the case.
<P>
	However the bill as amended will speak from and after the 
beginning of this year. It will make it less likely that victims will 
have the emotional and mental strain my hon. friend is speaking of 
because of the need for screening by a judge before an application 
can proceed, because it does not apply to serial murderers and 
because any decision will have to be unanimous. We are taking 
steps to help prevent the type of concern my hon. friend is talking 
about in future.
<P>
	Unfortunately for reasons we well know the bill is not 
retroactive, but as I have said before and as difficult as it is when 
we are making public policy we are dealing with the best interest of 
the country as a whole. We cannot base legislative decisions simply 
on one case. We are taking meaningful steps to deal with the 
concerns of victims in these situations.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier-Montcalm, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, before starting on the motion as such, I would like to say a 
few words about one of the Solicitor General's comments. He said 
that if the Bloc Quebecois had not delayed the passage of this bill, 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8813"> 8813 </A></B>
<P>
Mr. Olson would  have been eligible, in other words, he would have 
been covered by the new bill, the new section on parole.
<P>
	I think the Solicitor General should consider that his government 
has been in power since 1993 and should have foreseen the 
eventuality of Clifford Olson applying for parole under section 
745. The Bloc Quebecois cannot help it if the government was 
asleep at the switch, so to speak. When the government tabled the 
bill, it was already too late in the case of Mr. Olson. We tried to add 
a number of amendments to make the bill more in tune with the real 
situation.
<P>
	Before the Solicitor General made this remark, which was both 
uncalled for and unwarranted, I agreed with his comments, his 
position and his explanations on Bill C-45 and the amendments to 
Section 745. However, I think that this brief flash of partisanship 
from the Solicitor General was unwarranted, considering that the 
government was responsible for the delay, if there was any.
<P>
	That being said, to be sure everyone understands what this is 
about, I would like to take a few seconds to read to you the motion 
tabled in the House this morning by the hon. member for Crowfoot. 
The motion reads as follows:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That this House recognize that the families of murder victims are subjected to 
reliving the pain and fear of their experience as a result of the potential release of the 
victims' murderers allowed under section 745 of the Criminal Code, and as a 
consequence, this House urge the Liberal Government to formally apologize to those 
families for repeatedly refusing to repeal section 745 of the Criminal Code.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>(1205)</B>
<P>
	Obviously, it is not up to me to defend the Liberal government. 
However, the Bloc Quebecois cannot agree with the way the 
Reform motion is worded. I am not trying to defend the Liberals, 
but this goes against everything we have been asking for since 
1993, we, as members of the Bloc Quebecois, whose approach to 
the whole area of parole, social reintegration and rehabilitation is 
quite different from that of the Liberals opposite, from what we 
find in English Canada, and is, above all, the exact opposite of the 
Reform position.
<P>
	It is appalling. If we read the motion presented by the Reform 
Party, and we consider everything they ever said about capital 
punishment, they are getting pretty close to crossing the line.
<P>
	The message I heard from the two Reform members who spoke 
this morning reflects much the same attitude that Henry VIII, the 
king of England, had to his former wives and some ministers who 
were not to his liking. If they made any trouble, off with their 
heads! That is more or less what the Reform Party is proposing this 
morning. Remove section 745, reinstate capital punishment, stop 
investing in social reintegration and rehabilitation, and if someone 
is too dangerous, cut off his head or hang him or send him to the 
electric chair or whatever.
<P>
	Wake me up! Is this Canada? This is not the philosophy that for 
years parliamentarians in this House have tried to get across to the 
public. Indeed, section 745 was amended somewhat and, as I said 
earlier, one can either support or oppose the amendments the 
government proposed. We in the Bloc Quebecois said that section 
745 was more than adequate as it was worded at the time of the 
amendments.
<P>
	Let us have another look at a case frequently cited this morning, 
that of Mr. Olson. Although, as a lawyer who has practised only 
eight or nine years, I may be wrong, I am convinced that Mr. Olson 
will not be granted parole under the rules of section 745, although 
there are certain acquired rights.
<P>
	Clearly, with section 745 and the amendments of the Liberal 
government, a case like Mr. Olson's would be blocked 
immediately. He would not be able to even submit an application, 
or, if he did, it would be immediately blocked, and there would be 
no hearing. It is even better for the extreme cases, like that of 
Clifford Olson.
<P>
	Do we amend the Criminal Code every time there is a case like 
this? Do we amend the Criminal Code only whenever we have a 
mind to, because a particular event is so distressing?
<P>
	Earlier, I listened as calmly as I could to the Reform member 
accusing the Bloc members and the Liberals of being bleeding 
hearts, but only for murderers. This is not what we have been trying 
to show since 1993. I will speak for the official opposition, I will 
speak for the Bloc Quebecois, the party I represent: we are indeed 
sensitive. We think we have to work toward a fairer society, one 
that is free, pluralistic and tolerant and that believes in 
rehabilitation and reintegration into society.
<P>
	We have shown in a number of bills that we should educate not 
pummel society's deviants. Perhaps we should find out why they 
behaved the way they did.
<P>
	When we look around the world, we see violence in society. We 
turn on the television and what do we see? Violence. Some toys 
encourage violence, even toys for children two, three or four years 
old: ``Bonk your troll on the head, if you want to make him happy. 
Do not feed him, if you want something else to happen''. We can 
start with these problems first, that is, we can look for a way to stop 
violence before it starts. As far as this whole issue is concerned, it 
takes time to find a happy medium.
<P>
<B>(1210)</B>
<P>
	As it stands, I think that section 745 was a compromise, which 
was how it came to be. The Solicitor General referred to that just 
now. This measure was introduced around 1976 under the Trudeau 
government, when the death penalty was abolished. This measure 
was introduced late in the debate in order to ensure a parliamentary 
majority in favour of abolishing the death penalty.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8814"> 8814 </A></B>
<P>
	Much was said on this issue, and I imagine that Reform 
members, if they had been around at the time, would have been 
on the side of retaining the death penalty. Section 745 was aimed 
at obtaining the approval of the highest possible number of MPs 
in order to obtain the desired changes.
<P>
	Section 745 was already an improvement. If memory serves, the 
average length of the sentence served by those found guilty of first 
or second degree murder was 13 years. With the introduction of 
section 745, prisoners had to serve 25 years, with the possibility of 
a judicial review still being referred to as the faint hope clause. 
There was indeed such a possibility, but inmates had to meet a 
whole series of conditions before obtaining their release.
<P>
	Section 745 may have had its shortcomings, but if we look at the 
cases of people who made use of it, before the government's 
modifications, the results were not so catastrophic. I will give a few 
statistics.
<P>
	As of December 31, 1995, before the government amendments, 
175 inmates were eligible to apply for a judicial review. Of that 
175, 76 had done so, and 13 of the applications were still pending. 
Of the 63 applications that had been processed, 39 inmates were 
granted a reduction in their parole ineligibility period but there 
were no immediate releases. As of December 31, 1995, there had 
been only one repeat offence, an armed robbery, by a person who 
had obtained a reduction.
<P>
	You will say that even one repeat offender is too many. That is 
true, but that is still a pretty good batting average. I am not saying 
that nothing at all ought to be done. That is not what I am saying. 
We ought perhaps to start with the existing system, and look for 
alternative solutions. Is throwing prisoners into jail for the rest of 
their lives without any possibility of release, even after 25 years, a 
solution? I do not think so. I think this is going to extremes.
<P>
	In spite of what people were saying and the position taken by a 
number of legal experts, the government decided to introduce an 
amendment. Perhaps under pressure from Reform members, who 
were asking questions daily about repealing section 745. So what 
has actually changed since the Liberals amended section 745 under 
pressure from certain people in the field but especially from the 
Reform Party?
<P>
	The solicitor general was quite specific in this respect. I will not 
go into every comment he made on section 745.6, but roughly, as a 
result of the legislative amendments to this section, the two-thirds 
of the jury rule will no longer apply. In the past, someone who 
applied for parole had to convince two thirds of the jurors to obtain 
permission to apply for a reduction in the number of years of 
ineligibility for parole. This rule has now been changed. The jury 
must be unanimous.
<P>
	The government is more or less doing what the Reform Party 
wanted to do. It did not repeal section 745,  but the obligation to get 
a unanimous determination from the jury will make it very difficult 
to implement this provision. If a jury member does not like the look 
of the guy who is applying for parole, that individual will not get 
his parole.
<P>
<B>(1215)</B>
<P>
	The other aspect that was significantly changed, and in a case 
like Mr. Olson's, it would automatically be blocked, is the 
application for judicial review. It would be blocked altogether for 
perpetrators of multiple murders.
<P>
	Third, a selection mechanism is created under which the chief 
justice of the Superior Court or a designated judge will have to 
determine, on the basis of written submissions, whether the 
applicant has a reasonable chance of having his application 
accepted by a jury.
<P>
	If we add up the three criteria I just mentioned, one after the 
other, the individual will have to appear before a judge, the chief 
justice of the Superior Court or a designated judge, make his 
application, and then the judge determines whether or not he would 
have a chance before a well-informed jury of obtaining what he 
wants in his application for parole. If the answer is yes, he submits 
this to another judge who, assisted by a jury, will consider whether 
the individual's application should be accepted or not. Here, the 
jury must be unanimous.
<P>
	All this applies to murderers who did not commit multiple 
murders. The government says: ``No, we must keep section 745''. 
Otherwise it would be like siding with the Reform Party or caving 
in to the Reform Party's demands. But on the other hand, it has put 
in so many criteria-the Bloc Quebecois was against this to start 
with-that it is tantamount to repealing the section, since after this 
screening process, nothing much will happen. In the end, there is 
practically no hope of obtaining anything under section 745.6.
<P>
	We said that, after 20 years, and I will conclude with this point, 
because section 745 had already existed for 20 years, it was normal 
to take a little time to consider and review proposals, but it was 
most definitely out of the question to use the particular case before 
us, that of Clifford Olson, as a starting point. It was absolutely out 
of the question to start with such a distressing case, one in which 
children are involved, to try to amend the Criminal Code. There is 
perhaps a problem, but it is a problem inherent in the parole 
system.
<P>
	Instead of going for piecemeal amendments-trying to solve one 
problem because a certain person is applying for parole, trying to 
fix something else because of pressure from English Canada and 
trying to correct some other problem because the maritimes are 
putting on a bit of pressure-why not look at the whole issue of 
parole?
<P>
	Not all those in favour of a revision of the parole system are 
fanatics and extremists. In Quebec, we have cases, very sincere 
ones, where, for example, a father is  even prepared to undertake 
studies and try to come up with a way for murderers to be taken 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8815"> 8815 </A></B>
<P>
under the wing of the community and for them to be reintegrated as 
quickly as possible.
<P>
	These people have a problem. You do not kill 11 people in a row 
for the pleasure of it. They certainly have a problem. We should 
perhaps be looking for the cause of the problem and see whether we 
can find a solution to prevent such things from recurring.
<P>
	We will not solve the problem by trying to expand on one case 
and frightening people. I am not saying this debate is not 
important. I do think, however, that we are not in the right place. It 
is more the job of a commission of inquiry, of a parliamentary 
commission, to look at the problem in its entirety and review the 
entire parole process, including section 745.
<P>
	We could really debate the facts, with precise figures in hand and 
not with the tabloids, the rags that give their readers far more than 
they could ever want in an effort to sell papers. We could have the 
figures, the exact statistics. People who have regrettably had a bad 
experience could come and tell us what they really want: what 
would be right and what would not be right.
<P>
	It is not true to say that everything is wrong with the parole 
system. Changes certainly need to be made to bring it more into 
line.
<P>
<B>(1220)</B>
<P>
	Earlier, I mentioned toys. Perhaps there are things we could do 
as part of an overall assessment of this problem. The legislator 
could make some changes, regulate certain things that are the 
source of the problem. To do so, however, the matter has to be 
looked at very seriously. It cannot be done simply on a whim. We 
must not speak with our hearts alone on the atrocities we see in the 
papers.
<P>
	It is easy to do so, and perhaps it pays off politically. I do not 
know whether it pays off in English Canada, but I do not think that 
it helps the cause at all and it does not lead to a fair balance in 
society, when the government takes it into its head to attempt to 
move the Criminal Code always a little more to the right.
<P>
	That said, you will understand why I am totally opposed to the 
motion tabled this morning by the Reform Party.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Lee Morrison (Swift Current-Maple 
Creek-Assiniboia, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I wish the hon. member 
for Berthier-Montcalm would pay a little more attention to 
Reform members when they are speaking. Had he been paying 
attention he would have noticed that of the two Reformers who 
have spoken so far this morning one wishes the reinstatement of the 
death penalty. The other one wants its continued abolition. This is a 
50:50 split between the two speakers. However they  both agree 
strongly, and I agree, that section 745.6 is an abomination. It is 
unfit to serve the criminal law of a country that values decency.
<P>
	The hon. member seems to have missed the point of the motion. 
We have debated the issue on two occasions in the House. We have 
debated it when a private member's bill came forward to abolish 
section 745. We debated it again in conjunction with Bill C-45. In 
both those cases arguments were very wide ranging. Reference was 
made to dozens and dozens of specific cases where section 745 
allowed the most despicable of individuals to apply for parole and 
ultimately get it.
<P>
	Of the 43 who applied prior to 1994, 15 were granted immediate 
parole after application. Let us not hear this nonsense about it being 
a faint hope clause. It is a pretty good piece of hope if anyone asks 
me.
<P>
	What we are debating today refers specifically to the Clifford 
Olson case. We are debating it from the point of view of the 
families of that monster's 11 victims that are being dragged 
through all this muck and mire again for no good purpose.
<P>
	We know the man will not get out of jail, but why does the 
system allow him to make the application? Why can he twist the 
justice system to his own ends and get a bit of publicity? 
Apparently he has an ego as big as a house. At the same time the 
unfortunate family members have to relive the horror again. If he 
does not get a review this time he will be able to appeal regardless 
of what the solicitor general said.
<P>
	There has already been an instance of a murderer who applied 
for a review that was refused. He was allowed to appeal. We are not 
talking about oddities. We are talking about real people and real 
things that happen to real people.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bellehumeur:</B> Mr. Speaker, when I hear the statistics being 
cited by members of the Reform Party, I am convinced we must 
take a very serious look at this issue, with accurate statistics to 
hand.
<P>
<B>(1225)</B>
<P>
	I do not wish to question the hon. member's figures; I myself 
have figures provided by Statistics Canada, and I think they are as 
reliable as his. And they do not point to nearly as many parole 
applications as the Reform Party member mentioned.
<P>
	In Manitoba, four offenders obtained a partial reduction. One 
was turned down completely; a grand total of five offenders 
applied, in 1995, under section 745 as it then stood. In 
Saskatchewan, two offenders obtained a partial reduction, while 
another was turned down. A grand total of three offenders and 
murderers applied under section 745. The only province where 
there were more than seven people was Quebec, with 28; two were 
turned down.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8816"> 8816 </A></B>
<P>
	Earlier, I mentioned cases of recidivism for 1995; there was one. 
That is already too many, you will say, but there was only one. 
That is the first thing I notice about the Reform Party, which does 
not seem to have the same figures we do. Perhaps we will have 
to sit down at some point and compare our figures and particularly 
our sources.
<P>
	The second thing is that, if the Reform Party took the trouble to 
read the amendments introduced by the government, it would 
understand why we were against these amendments. The reason is 
that, for all practical purposes, the Liberal government's 
amendments are almost the same as what the Reform Party is 
calling for, which is the repeal of section 745.
<P>
	Section 745.6 imposes so many criteria that, when all is said and 
done, almost nobody will be eligible.
<P>
	The last point I would make to my hon. colleague in the Reform 
Party is that I read the opposition's motion very carefully and that 
is why I oppose it. I also listened very carefully to the two Reform 
Party members who spoke before me, and this only strengthens my 
resolve to oppose the Reform Party's motion.
<P>
	This motion calls on the Liberal government to formally 
apologize to families for repeatedly refusing to repeal this section. 
This is the same Reform Party the great majority of whose 
members refused their support on a number of occasions, when the 
Bloc Quebecois merely asked the House to recognize that Louis 
Riel had been wrongfully executed. We were not asking for public 
apologies or anything like that. We were asking for recognition that 
Louis Riel was fighting for democracy and freedom and calling for 
responsible government. The Reform Party members would not 
give their support.
<P>
	Now they go all teary eyed on us and move a motion completely 
divorced from reality. They do not take the time to look at what is 
really happening. They do not give the right figures in the House; 
in any event, I have my doubts about their figures, and we are at 
cross purposes.
<P>
	I can assure the hon. member of the Reform Party that, before 
taking a position, I read his motion very carefully, that I listened 
with what for me was unusual calm to the discourse of the Reform 
Party members, and I have reached the conclusion that my position, 
the position of the Bloc Quebecois, which opposes this motion, is 
the right one.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> There are approximately two minutes 
remaining with half going to the member for Crowfoot and the 
other half to the time member responding.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jack Ramsay (Crowfoot, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I will be as 
brief as I can.
<P>
	Bill C-45 was the justice minister's bill that tinkered with 
section 745 of the Criminal Code. We opposed it  from the 
beginning. We voted against it but we would not delay it. When a 
representative of the government approached our caucus to ask us 
to allow the bill to go through before the summer recess without 
any delay tactics, we said certainly we oppose the bill and will vote 
against it.
<P>
	If the bill had gone through before the summer recess and were 
passed by the Senate before August 11, 1996, Clifford Olson would 
have had to appear before a Federal Court judge. The families of 
his victims would have been screened. The judge would have made 
a decision on whether or not he had a likelihood of succeeding and 
could have stopped his application there.
<P>
	However it was the Bloc that refused to allow the bill to go 
through before the summer recess and allow Clifford Olson his full 
court press before a judge and jury. That is the reason Clifford 
Olson is now making his application for that full court press before 
a judge and jury.
<P>
<B>(1230)</B>
<P>
	I have listened to the Bloc members, as I listened to their 
previous speeches on Bill C-45. I would ask the hon. member what 
is a fair and just penalty in his mind. I hope he will answer that 
question. Those who have been asked that question before have not 
answered it. What is a fair and just penalty for the taking of an 
innocent life, the premeditated murder of an innocent person? Is it 
15 years? Is it 25 years? What is it? What value does the hon. 
member place on the life of an innocent human being?
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bellehumeur:</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like to touch on two 
things before I answer the hon. member's last question.
<P>
	First of all, I believe that if the Reform Party member found that 
the government was not moving fast enough with the desirable 
amendments to section 745, under British parliamentary rules he 
would have been free to table a private member's bill in this House 
to amend that section. He could have done so as far back as 1993. 
We must conclude, therefore, that the hon. member from the 
Reform Party was asleep at the switch, dozing along with the 
Liberals perhaps, and did not table any modifications at the 
appropriate time.
<P>
	Second, judging by the comments made by the Reform Party 
member, it can be demonstrated to all Canadians that the Senate is 
pointless. This we demonstrate daily, I think, but he is the one who 
has just demonstrated that we could very easily do without the 
Senate, since the time taken for examination in the Senate is time 
wasted. If there were no Senate, Bill C-45 could have been adopted 
faster and royal assent could have been obtained more quickly, so 
that it could have taken effect much earlier. In a brief aside, we are 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8817"> 8817 </A></B>
<P>
certainly in agreement with  abolition of the Senate; it is of no use 
and costs the taxpayer a fortune.
<P>
	In addition, the hon. member of the Reform Party is asking me a 
highly complex question: What is a fair prison sentence, and do I 
think a human life is important? Certainly, a human life is 
important to me, but it is equally important to determine what a fair 
sentence is, and this is not something that can be answered quickly 
off the top of one's head.
<P>
	One thing is certain, I am opposed to the principle of an eye for 
an eye, a tooth for a tooth, for this is not the kind of society we live 
in. When someone is appointed to the bench, it is because he or she 
has the capacity to examine the case, taking into account the facts, 
the murderer's background, and a number of other elements, in 
order to find the fairest sentence. If someone is sentenced to 25 
years, but allowed to apply for judicial review under section 745, I 
think that is starting to be fair. I could have said more, but I see that 
I am out of time.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley East, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
will be dividing my time with the hon. member for Vegreville.
<P>
	It is sad that a motion such as this is necessary. It is also sad to 
listen to members of the Bloc Quebecois and the Liberal Party 
drum up every imaginable excuse as to why this motion is 
unnecessary. The latest excuse made by the Bloc Quebecois is that 
because its private member's bill on Louis Riel was not supported, 
it cannot support a Reform Party motion.
<P>
	We are talking about real live families having to suffer through 
the indignity of having all the facts dragged back into a court where 
they can be cross-examined by the murderer himself. It is 
disgusting that we even have to discuss these facts today.
<P>
<B>(1235 )</B>
<P>
	I would like to know how anyone in this House cannot support 
this motion today. The motion states that this House recognize that 
the families of murder victims are subjected to reliving the pain 
and fear of their experience as a result of the potential release of the 
victims' murderers allowed under section 745 of the Criminal 
Code. That is the first part of this motion.
<P>
	How can the government not admit that is true? Tomorrow is a 
sad day, a national day of disgrace that Clifford Robert Olson will 
be on a telephone pleading his case that he should be released early 
because he has done enough time, 15 years, and he should be 
released early from his life sentence and is that not a good idea.
<P>
	It is an absolute fact that the families of these murder victims are 
going to have to relive that whole incident because this government 
has not cancelled the provisions  of section 745. The first part of 
this motion is absolutely true in every way, shape and form.
<P>
	Clifford Olson pleaded guilty to these 11 murders. He has 
received a life sentence. He is in there for at least 25 years. We all 
know and all hope and pray that he will be in there for life at the 
very least.
<P>
	Even after all the tragedy that went on, even though the 
government paid $100,000 to find out where all the victims' bodies 
were, even though he got 25 years instead of, as many people 
would argue, an exchange of his life for having taken so many 
lives, even after all of that and he is in jail where at the very 
minimum he should be, what has happened? He is now before these 
victims' families saying that he should be let off early.
<P>
	He will be on a speaker phone from the Prince Albert 
penitentiary in Saskatchewan. If the hearing takes place he will be 
transported to Vancouver at taxpayer expense for the hearing where 
he will interrogate the families of his victims, probably later this 
summer if that goes ahead.
<P>
	Unbelievably section 745 allows guys like Clifford Olson to 
cross-examine the families of his victims because probably he is 
going to be acting on behalf of himself as his own lawyer. We can 
imagine what that is going to mean. As in the first part of this 
motion, is it true that they are going to have to relive the pain and 
fear of their experience? It is absolutely true. It is a disgrace but it 
is true.
<P>
	The second part of this motion states that this whole thing is 
allowed because under section 745 of the Criminal Code the 
Minister of Justice has not deemed it necessary to disallow it.
<P>
	As the Canadian Police Association, CAVEAT and other 
victims' rights groups have, we have supported the repeal of 
section 745. There has been a groundswell of support for that 
across the land.
<P>
	When the member for York-South Weston brought forward a 
private member's bill to repeal section 745, we supported it. We 
supported him in committee. We supported that the bill come back 
from committee earlier. We have tried to get it back in the House 
for resolution. As the member for Crowfoot has mentioned, we 
even agreed to hurry some legislation that was otherwise 
ineffective through the House of Commons in order to specifically 
cut Olson off at the pass, so that he could not get in there and grill 
his own victims' families. We specifically did all of that.
<P>
	What is going to happen? Because the minister will not deal with 
this the Liberal government is going to allow this to take place. 
This tragedy is going to start tomorrow.
<P>
	How about an apology, something that the ethics counsellor 
could possibly teach the guys across the way? How about an 
apology to the families for repeatedly refusing to repeal section 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8818"> 8818 </A></B>
<P>
745? That is a small thing to do. Again, when we are looking at the 
very least, and we  do not expect a lot more when it comes to justice 
issues from Liberals, but at the very least they could apologize for 
what these families are going to have to go through.
<P>
	The names on this ribbon that many of us are wearing today are 
the names of the victims of that animal some years ago. The 
families of those people are now going to have to relive the entire 
horrible incident from beginning to end because of this 
government's inaction.
<P>
	It has already been mentioned that of the 43 murderers who have 
applied for early release under section 745, 70 per cent of them 
were successful and some who were not will be allowed to reapply 
in three to four years.
<P>
<B>(1240)</B>
<P>
	It is disgusting that is taking place. Furthermore, we now have a 
double standard. Those who are convicted of multiple murders will 
not be allowed but a single murderer can get away with that and 
apply for early parole. It is a special status for single murderers and 
this is disgusting as well.
<P>
	I want to give a couple of quotes if members are wondering why 
so many people are annoyed, outraged and enraged at the justice 
system. When Joanne Kaplinski's brother Ken was murdered some 
years ago, her request was denied to present a victim impact 
statement. At the hearing the judge said: ``The pain and anger of 
the Kaplinski family has no place in this court''. Imagine an 
attitude that says the family, the victims, those who live on with the 
tragedy cannot give their two bits worth but the perpetrator, the 
murderer, can drag up every so-called character witness to testify at 
the hearing. It is truly disgusting.
<P>
	I want to bring forward something I can see happening in this 
upcoming campaign. In my own constituency the local Liberal 
candidate, John Les, has expressed his outrage at a horrible 
paedophile in our area and has suggested that this man should be 
hanged for his actions. This man is truly despicable. He has been in 
the national papers. He is an animal and it is a horrible thing but I 
do have to ask of my running opponent: who do you think you are 
running for in his upcoming election?
<P>
	The Liberals will not entertain, Mr. Les, the idea that capital 
punishment is a credible alternative in these justice issues. They 
will not entertain it at their convention. They will not entertain it in 
a free vote in the House of Commons. They will not entertain it in a 
national referendum. They will not entertain it in their caucus. 
They will not talk about, they will not allow it. So get used to it 
because you are going to take part in and run for a party that is not 
going to listen to your view.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The hon. member knows that we have a 
procedure in here where all comments are supposed to be addressed 
to whomever is in the Chair and not to somebody in a riding or 
somebody on the moon or anywhere else. I would ask the member 
to respect that.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Strahl:</B> Mr. Speaker, I only bring this up because the 
candidate is going to have to explain as the candidate for the 
Liberal Party the position on section 745. Does he or does he not 
agree with it? Does he or does he not agree with capital punishment 
provisions of the Liberal Party? Does he or does he not agree that 
there should be no free votes on this in the House of Commons? 
Does he or does he not agree that if he were to become a member of 
the Liberal caucus that he will be silenced and sent to the back row 
where he will never be heard from again? That is the tragedy of 
what is going on here.
<P>
	The other day I debated on ``Ottawa Inside Out'' the necessity of 
having occasional referendums in Canada to consult with the 
people to allow them to make the decisions on important matters 
like this. The professor I was debating with said members of 
Parliament should be the ones who decide these things because 
they have all the education for it and they have the credentials for 
it. I said in essence balderdash, that is not true. The Canadian 
people on issues as important as this should be allowed to be 
consulted and their word taken as the last word on an important 
subject like this.
<P>
	Canadians should be outraged over what is going to happen 
tomorrow with Clifford Robert Olson. That is a given. Canadians 
should also think in this coming election how much say do they 
want to have in the future of not only the justice system but of other 
important things in the Canadian political realm. Canadians should 
have the right to come to the politicians and say they are going to 
bypass them, they want a right to say in a referendum whether 
capital punishment should be reinstated.
<P>
	The Reform Party will give them that right and it is the only 
party to suggest that is possible.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Reg Alcock (Winnipeg South, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, this is a 
very interesting debate on a very important topic. I will be speaking 
on it shortly but I would like to ask the member a simple question. 
It is reasonable to assume that someone who commits a crime as 
heinous as Mr. Olson's is mentally ill and does not care much about 
the feelings, the beliefs or the attitudes of society.
<P>
<B>(1245)</B>
<P>
	Are we not just feeding his pathology and giving him the very 
thing he wants by having this kind of debate? Are we not 
reinforcing the sick, sadistic pleasure that this individual takes in 
these acts? Are we not, in fact, advancing him in a kind of 
disgraceful way by even putting this on the floor of the House 
today? I would like the member to answer that.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Strahl:</B> Mr. Speaker, it does not give me a great deal of 
pleasure to talk about this prisoner in this way. In one sense, the 
member is right. Every time he sees his name in print, I bet he gets 
his own little set of jollies out of it.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8819"> 8819 </A></B>
<P>
	However, we have tried for three years to pre-empt this very 
thing from happening. Last year we went to the minister and said 
that we would quickly pass a bill that was flawed just to make 
sure that the debate we are having today did not take place. That 
is exactly what we were trying to do.
<P>
	If I could say: ``Let's not talk about it and it won't happen,'' I 
would not talk about it. I would shut up. It would go away and it 
would not happen. Will it happen? You're darn tootin' it will 
happen. It will happen tomorrow whether we talk about it or not.
<P>
	I am saying that enough is enough on this. It is time to put a stop 
to this so that the victims of Olson can heal. It is not just Olson. I 
could go down a list.
<P>
	Let me take a list from Ontario. In May, it will be Jeffrey Breese 
and it will be the same thing. Again in May, David Dobson; in July, 
Daniel Wood; in August, Fernand Robinson; in September, Terence 
Cooke will be up. I have pages and pages of names of people who 
will be doing the same thing as Olson from now, right through the 
summer, right through the fall for the next 10 years.
<P>
	Someone has pointed out that before long, it will be the next 
crop, the current ugly people in the press: the Bernardos, the 
Homolkas. You name them and they will be up for their next dibs.
<P>
	We are trying to point out with this debate today that this thing 
should have been stopped three years ago. We had a chance. We 
could have done it. We could have prevented the tragedy of the 
gruelling court process that these victims will have to go through. It 
could have been done and we did not. It was not because the 
Reform Party did not do its share of begging. We begged and 
begged.
<P>
	The Canadian people are saying enough of this. It should not 
have happened. We could have cut it off but we have to talk about it 
today. Tomorrow it will be a national story, whether the Reform 
Party brings it up or not. That is the disgrace. We should not have to 
talk about it. I agree with the member. We should not be talking 
about it. However, it is time now to raise it so that it will not happen 
again.
<P>
	If the justice minister will not listen to the House surely he will 
listen to the cries of millions of people in Canada who say that 
section 745 needs to be repealed. Listen. Get that out of the 
Criminal Code. It should never have been there to begin with.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Leon E. Benoit (Vegreville, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, normally I 
say when I start a speech that I am pleased to rise to debate the 
issue that we are talking about but I cannot honestly say that today.
<P>
	Had the government done what it should have done, what 
Canadians said it should do again and again, what we have said it 
should do again and again, it would not  have been necessary to 
have this debate. I too feel bad that it is necessary to talk about this 
and to give Clifford Olson the delight that he seems to take from 
being talked about and being in the media but we have to talk about 
it.
<P>
	We have to let the surviving victims of Clifford Olson, the 
families of those killed, know that we are trying our best to do 
something that will allow them, as well as they can, to put this 
aside so that their lives are not totally consumed with memories, 
with the thoughts, with reliving the horror that they have lived as a 
result of what Clifford Olson has done. Somebody has to tell them 
that they care and that they are trying to change things so they will 
not have this dragged through their lives again and again.
<P>
<B>(1250)</B>
<P>
	Unfortunately here we are. There are so many things I would like 
to say on this issue but there are two things on which I am going to 
focus. The first has become very obvious just from listening to this 
debate so far. It is the issue of balance in the justice system, the 
balance between the rights of the accused and the rights of citizens 
and victims to be protected. That balance is clearly out of whack.
<P>
	The second issue is in response to the solicitor general's 
statement in response to my question where he dumped the blame 
for Clifford Olson having the opportunity to once again present his 
case on early release on the Bloc. I will deal with that issue first 
because I want to be sure I have time to do that.
<P>
	It is true that the Bloc did prevent the bill from going through the 
normal course and it did prevent changes that would have 
prevented the fiasco that will be taking place tomorrow of Clifford 
Olson having a chance to apply for early release. Therefore, the 
Bloc deserves some of the blame.
<P>
	However, when we look at what has happened in this place again 
and again, we know that we cannot allow the Liberals to dump the 
blame on the Bloc. If things are looked at realistically, the 
government has again and again used closure to force legislation 
through the House. The latest closure was on the tobacco bill which 
was supported by Reform members and most of the government 
members. Yet the government saw a need to use closure and 
override the democratic process to force that bill through the 
House. That was last week.
<P>
	The Liberal government has done this again and again. It has 
often used closure to force legislation through. If closure is 
something that should have been used on Bill C-68, the so-called 
gun bill, then why was not this change important enough to use 
closure? I am not advocating the use of closure. It should not be 
used. It has been abused terribly. However, when we look at the 
way the government puts legislation through the House, it is clear  
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8820"> 8820 </A></B>
<P>
that it could have forced this through unamended. It has absolute 
power.
<P>
	We do not have democratic process in this House. For example, 
about 60 Liberal MPs did their homework on the gun bill. They 
talked to their constituents. They was debate. In many cases they 
did surveys and found that their constituents did not want them to 
support Bill C-68. How many actually at third reading voted 
against the bill? I believe there were three. What happened to 
them? They were thrown off their committees and punished for 
doing what their constituents told them to do. That is not 
democracy.
<P>
	Then the Prime Minister publicly said that any government MP 
who ever dared to vote against a government bill again, no matter 
what their constituents want, will be punished. He will not sign 
their nomination papers. Their political careers will be over. That is 
the kind of power the government has. With that kind of power it 
could have put the bill through in any form it wanted. Therefore, 
the government cannot dump the blame on the Bloc. It cannot do 
that in good conscience. The solicitor general knows that.
<P>
	The second issue I want to raise is the lack of balance in the 
justice system. We have a justice system that gives too high a 
priority to the rights of the accused and the criminal. Their rights 
are put higher than the rights of citizens and victims to feel safe and 
be safe.
<P>
	Since Reforms have been here we have been calling for is to 
rebalance the scales of justice so that the rights of the citizens and 
victims are to be protected and given a higher priority than the 
rights of the accused and the rights of the criminal. We want to 
rebalance the system. It is clearly needed and Canadians have been 
calling for it for some time.
<P>
<B>(1255)</B>
<P>
	If the House needs evidence that the system is out of whack, let 
me use as an example one I have used many times of a women in 
Montreal who was viciously raped by a criminal who was out on 
early release. He had viciously attacked women before. All she 
asked from the justice system was for the criminal to be forced to 
give a blood sample so she could determine whether he had the 
HIV virus and then should would know whether she was likely to 
contract AIDS from this violent criminal. What was she told? She 
was told the answer was no, because in our justice system the rights 
of the criminal are placed higher than the rights of the victim. I 
could cite example after example that would demonstrate this exact 
point.
<P>
	Why have we come to this? I can very honestly say that it is as a 
result of Liberal governments over the last 30 years and 
Conservative governments did not fix the problem when they were 
given the time to do so.
<P>
	I will paraphrase what Solicitor General Boyer said in 1972 in 
<I>Hansard</I>: ``For too long we have put the rights of the citizens too 
high''. He did not even mention the  rights of victims. ``It is time 
that we place as a top priority in our justice system the rights of the 
criminal and the rights of the accused''. A very deliberate change 
was made over the years of Liberal governments and the 
Conservative governments refused to fix the broken system.
<P>
	We have been calling for changes that would fix the system. It is 
clearly out of balance and it must be rebalanced. At present in our 
justice system, victims have virtually no rights. We have been 
calling for the rights of victims to be given a higher priority than 
the rights of the criminal or the rights of the accused. Certainly the 
rights of the criminal and the accused are important. I want to make 
it clear I recognize that. We are just looking for a better balance.
<P>
	A Reform member has put before the House a victims' bill of 
rights. It passed second reading but has not gone any further. It has 
not become law because it has not been given a high enough 
priority by the government. If it had been given a higher priority it 
could have been passed by the House. It specifies their rights in our 
justice system.
<P>
	Some of those rights are worth noting. First, it is important to 
define victim. When we talk about Clifford Olson and early release 
and the hearing, the victims we are most concerned about are the 
families of those who are longer with us, the children who were 
murdered.
<P>
	In this victims' bill of rights, a victim is defined as anyone so 
suffers as a result of an offence, physical or mental injury or 
economic loss or; any spouse, sibling, child or parent of the 
individual against whom the offence was perpetrated or; anyone 
who had an equivalent relationship, not necessarily a blood 
relative''.
<P>
	Then the 10 rights that the legislation will give to victims their 
proper place in the justice system are:
<P>
	First, to be informed of their rights at every stage of the process, 
including being made aware of available victim services. In regard 
to section 745 we found that many victims, the surviving families 
of murdered people, had no idea that this vicious murderer would 
be allowed to apply for early release after 15 years. So that is an 
important one.
<P>
	Second, the victim should be informed of the offender's status 
throughout the process, including but not restricted to plans to 
release the offender from custody.
<P>
<B>(1300 )</B>
<P>
	Third, choose between giving oral and/or written victim impact 
statements at parole hearings before sentencing and at judicial 
reviews. Give the victims a say in sentencing throughout the 
process.
<P>
	Fourth, to know why charges are not laid if that is the decision of 
the crown or the police. It seems absurd to most Canadians to know 
that in many cases the victims  are not even given any notice. The 
other important points and rights that we would give to the victims 
to help balance this justice system are written in the member's 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8821"> 8821 </A></B>
<P>
victims bill of rights which has received second reading support 
from all parties in the House.
<P>
	The solicitor general cannot lay the blame entirely on the Bloc 
for the failure to amend section 745 in time to prevent Clifford 
Olson from receiving these hearings. It is so important to rebalance 
the justice system where the citizenry and the victims can have a 
place of higher priority.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gordon Kirkby (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Justice and Attorney General of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
listen to the Reform Party members with interest as they make the 
assertion over and over again that if section 745 were repealed 
today, individuals who have lost loved ones through brutal and 
tragic acts would somehow be spared the pain of section 745 
applications.
<P>
	It is the correct and predominant view of the law that even if 
section 745 were repealed today it would not prevent people from 
applying for a section 745 hearing. All the people currently in the 
system would have that right which cannot be taken away.
<P>
	Why do Reform members keep insisting and telling people that 
somehow their pain will be spared when it will not be? Why do 
they keep using victims in this shameless manner?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Benoit:</B> Mr. Speaker, I have a different solution for not 
having this thing brought up again and again so the victims, 
members of the surviving families of murder victims, do not have 
to feel the pain as deeply again and again. I am in favour of capital 
punishment. I believe that for premeditated first degree murder we 
should have capital punishment reinstated. That is the first thing. I 
believe that would help to some degree, but nothing is going to ease 
the pain.
<P>
	This member who is a lawyer talks about the law as though the 
law cannot be changed. The government seems to forget and to 
hide behind the current law. It forgets that this House is exactly the 
Chamber that can change the law. It astounds me that we hear again 
and again that the common view of the law is this or that. We can 
change the law in this House, which is exactly what should have 
happened with regard to section 745. We should have changed the 
law. We had the chance. The government still has the chance to do 
that if it wants before the election is called. It should do that or 
Canadians will make it pay the price.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bill Graham (Rosedale, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I hesitate to 
say that I agree with the member for Vegreville on very many 
occasions but I certainly agree with his opening sentiment that he 
did not really wish to be participating in this debate. I think many 
of us in the House share that preoccupation. This is not a debate we  
wish to participate in. It is a debate, however, that has been brought 
by his party and it is incumbent on us to challenge and at least look 
at the real reasons behind this motion and what we should be doing 
as responsible parliamentarians about it. Let me take the last matter 
first.
<P>
<B>(1305)</B>
<P>
	Many members have expressed a deep desire to see a proper 
balance in criminal law, as the hon. member for Vegreville said. We 
all must achieve that balance.
<P>
	I am not a criminal lawyer but I had the opportunity to study 
criminal law many years ago. I remember being taught that the 
purpose of criminal law was threefold. First was to punish, not with 
a view to punishing for the sake of punishment but with a view to 
deterring crimes for the protection of society. Second was to serve 
as an example. This too was for the protection of society so that 
others would not follow a bad example. Third, equally important in 
any civilized system, was that of rehabilitation, to rehabilitate 
those people who had committed crimes. This too is in the long 
term interest of society. Criminals should be rehabilitated and not 
incarcerated forever at a cost to society.
<P>
	The hon. member for Vegreville brought up a new preoccupation 
in criminal law and one equally worthy of weight. What about the 
interests of those who are victims, those who must suffer as a result 
of terrible crimes such as those committed by Clifford Olson? We 
owe to those people the best concern we can develop in the context 
of creating a system that has integrity and guarantees a stable 
criminal justice system which will achieve all the objectives I set 
out at the beginning.
<P>
	If we look at the history of this matter we can see that 745 was 
designed to do that. Until 1976 Canada had the death penalty for 
first degree murder. In 1976 Parliament abolished capital 
punishment and replaced it with mandatory life sentences for high 
treason, first degree murder and second degree murder. Parole 
ineligibility periods were established at the same time. They were 
25 years for high treason and first degree murder and 10 years for 
second degree murder, with the judge having the power, after 
considering any recommendation from the jury, to increase the 
period up to 25 years.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Why did Parliament consider it was necessary to provide for a 
reduction in the ineligibility period in certain circumstances? The 
first reason given was that at the time the minimum sentence of 25 
years was longer, and I stress the word longer, than the average 
prison sentence served by murderers whose death sentence had 
been commuted to life.
<P>
	Until 1976, the average sentence served by these offenders 
before parole was about 13 years. For non-capital murder, it was 
seven years. Parliament was also aware that in other countries with 
values similar to  ours, the average time served before parole was 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8822"> 8822 </A></B>
<P>
15 years. Even in the United States, individuals convicted of 
murder who were not executed served an average of 18 years.
<P>
	Subsequently, to make the law more balanced, last January we 
adopted Bill C-45. Until this bill came into force, an offender 
convicted of murder could apply to the chief justice of the Superior 
Court of the province in which he was convicted for a review of the 
parole ineligibility period. The odious nature of the crime, the 
anti-social behaviour of the murderer in prison, the fact that he was 
practically certain that the period would not be reviewed, all this 
did not exempt the chief justice from the obligation to empanel a 
jury to hear the application.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	It was exactly for that reason that the Minister of Justice 
introduced Bill C-45 in June of 1996. The solicitor general 
discussed with the House the background of Bill C-45 and its 
important provisions. I would like to just very quickly speak to 
those issues as well, to remind the House that Bill C-45, which we 
recently adopted, has tightened the process in three important 
ways. It has denied the application of section 745 to multiple 
murderers, it has added a screening process before a convicted 
murderer is allowed to apply to the chief justice for judicial review 
of the ineligibility period, and it has substituted the rule of 
unanimity for the rule of two-thirds decision by the jury.
<P>
<B>(1310)</B>
<P>
	In all three areas, multiple murderers will no longer have the 
benefit of this early release or even to apply for it. A screening 
process for all section 745.6 applications means that before 
proceeding to a hearing before a section 745.6 jury, applicants will 
be required to persuade a superior court judge to whom the 
application is made that the application has a reasonable prospect 
of success. The screening is conducted on the basis of written 
materials only in order to spare the victims' families the ordeal of 
testifying in cases that are manifestly undeserving. I will come 
back to that because I think that point is capital in the debate that 
we are having before the House today.
<P>
	Both the crown and the applicant are allowed to submit evidence 
by affidavit. Where the applicant is screened out the judge may 
decide whether and when the applicant may apply again but it can 
never be before two years. Any subsequent application will be 
again subject to the screening process.
<P>
	The third point is all members of the jury must be unanimous in 
their decision. Obviously a unanimous decision is much more 
difficult to obtain and where the application is denied the jury may 
decide if and when the applicant can apply again but under no 
circumstances would an applicant be allowed to apply within two 
years of the application.
<P>
	Clearly it will be much more difficult to meet the requirements 
of the new section 745.6 than it was before Bill C-45. It will be 
more difficult to get a hearing. The hearing will be much less likely 
to be successful. As a result, only successful applicants will have a 
public hearing and at that point the unanimity rule will apply.
<P>
	The member for Crowfoot specifically said that the reason the 
hearing for Mr. Olson tomorrow is being held is precisely that Bill 
C-45 did not get through this House in time to deny that hearing. 
He laid the fault of that at the foot of the Bloc. That is all very well 
for him to say but what he forgot was that he is basically 
undermining the whole purpose of what he is standing up here 
today to say. He admitted clearly before the Canadian public that in 
fact if we had been able to get Bill C-45 through in time Mr. Olson 
would not be having his hearing tomorrow and we would not be 
having this debate.
<P>
	This brings me to my question of the leaders in the Reform Party. 
Why are we having this debate today? We are not having this 
debate today because I, as the member for Crowfoot suggested 
when he introduce his motion, when I asked him a question, was 
somehow duplicitous, not interested in the true justice system and I 
was some sort of evil person trying to benefit from victims. That 
would be totally ridiculous.
<P>
	The real people who are calling this debate today are Reformers 
who clearly by the debate have demonstrated that they know that 
now under Bill C-45 a type of hearing such as Mr. Olson will have 
will never be held again because of the changes that have been 
made. Yet they persist on crying across the House suggesting that 
we are culpable and guilty of some conspiracy to do exactly what 
they are doing today, which is to stir up people's emotions and 
create grief for the victims.
<P>
	The real crime of today's debate is that it is being held on the 
backs of the victims of people like Clifford Olson to give the 
Reform Party some political credo for the next election. That is the 
real reason for this debate today.
<P>
	It has nothing to do with the reform of the criminal justice 
system. The criminal justice system has been reformed by Bill 
C-45. It has been reformed by this government. It would render any 
such application of Mr. Olson's tomorrow absolutely impossible. 
Reformers have admitted that in the House today. Yet they chose to 
bring this debate. Why did they choose to bring the debate? They 
chose to bring this debate because they wish to profit from the 
suffering of families of innocent victims of Clifford Olson. That 
upsets me a great deal. I am shocked that is the reason for it.
<P>
<B>(1315 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Leon E. Benoit (Vegreville, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I heard 
what the hon. member opposite said. I really find it offensive that 
he is suggesting that Reform is trying to make political hay with 
this issue. If he would look at  what Reform has done and what it 
has proposed on this issue since coming to Ottawa and since this 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8823"> 8823 </A></B>
<P>
party was started in 1987, he would see its members have pushed 
criminal justice issues. We have pushed this issue specifically. We 
have made our position clear.
<P>
	The government has refused to take the tough stand that would 
have prevented Clifford Olson from having his hearing tomorrow. 
We are going to use that date and that event to try to force the 
government to take the action it should have taken from the start. 
We are using that event to help focus on this change that should 
have been made. We are trying to have the change made.
<P>
	I would like to ask the hon. member a question and I would like a 
direct answer if I could possibly get one on this issue. In all of the 
changes his government has made, has it made it so that the 
families whose children have been murdered will not have to once 
again deal with all of their feelings because of an event that is 
allowing Clifford Olson to apply for early release? Have any of the 
changes done that?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Graham:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thought I made it clear in my 
remarks that is precisely the purpose of Bill C-45. I thought that the 
member for Crowfoot made it very clear in his remarks. I am sure 
the member for Vegreville would agree that if Bill C-45 were 
applied in this case, Mr. Olson would have applied to a judge. I 
cannot believe that a judge would have granted the success of such 
a hearing and of course this would not have had the terrible impact 
that it is having on the victims and the families of the victims of 
Clifford Olson.
<P>
	I have no sympathy for Clifford Olson whatsoever. He is 
repugnant in every way. I have every sympathy with the families of 
his victims. I understand the terrible turmoil they are going 
through. We have tried to adjust the criminal justice system in a 
way to take into account that which represents the integrity of the 
whole criminal justice system.
<P>
	In answer to the member's question: Will the members of the 
families of Clifford Olson's victims never again be troubled by this 
matter? That is something that is outside of the power of the state. 
It is a terrible thing for people to live through. Any of us who have 
had to deal with people who have had to live through these sorts of 
tragedies know there is no end to the pain and suffering one suffers 
as a result of this situation.
<P>
	The criminal justice system has been mended in a way to ensure 
that the best possible protection for families of victims in these 
circumstances. I genuinely believe that Bill C-45 does precisely 
address that. We will work on it to make sure that it does address it 
and it addresses it in humane and proper ways.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Benoit:</B> Mr. Speaker, the hon. member did not answer the 
question. The solicitor general earlier in response to my question 
acknowledged that he had wanted to make the change that would 
have prevented  this hearing from ever happening. If he had wanted 
it badly enough we know that he could have made it happen. The 
government has forced changes through the House completely 
against the will of the Bloc and Reform opposition many times. 
The government could have made the changes.
<P>
	Again I ask the hon. member, why did it not?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Graham:</B> Mr. Speaker, is the member from the Reform 
Party asking me why the government did not apply time allocation 
to this bill?
<P>
<B>(1320 )</B>
<P>
	I do not know that, but I find it singularly reprehensible on 
behalf of the member for the Reform Party, who screams about the 
use of time allocation when it is used by the government, to be 
encouraging its use at this time. It reminds me of the member's 
statement when he was talking about the gun control bill.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Reg Alcock (Winnipeg South, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am not 
certain that I take any pleasure in joining in today's debate because 
the only person being served today is Clifford Olson and I am 
deeply saddened about that.
<P>
	I am a father. I come to this point in life somewhat later than 
most. My children are four and two. I cannot find within myself the 
ability to imagine how I would feel if my children suffered what 
some of the families of the victims of Clifford Olson and some of 
the others have suffered. I cannot imagine the visceral pain and 
rage I would feel having been a victim to that. However, I want to 
ask the members of the Reform Party to stop and think a little bit 
about what they are doing.
<P>
	Some years ago I was involved in a survey in the area that I now 
represent, just talking about issues that were important to people, 
how they felt about their community and things like that. One of 
the things we noticed early on was that elderly people, particularly 
elderly women, and young women, felt unsafe walking the streets. 
They identified a fear of going out after dark. This surprised us 
because the area that I represent and live in is a very comfortable, 
respectable and quite a decent community with a very low crime 
rate.
<P>
	After I became the member for the area, we repeated some of 
this survey just to see what was happening. We found that it had 
gone up. Women were locked in their houses because they were 
afraid to walk down the street in what, by any standard, is one of 
the nicest residential communities in this country.
<P>
	A little while ago I had dinner with the new police chief in 
Winnipeg. I was talking to him about this. He pointed out that in 
the last few years crime in Canada, certainly in my community, has 
gone down. Instead of there being an increased reason for people to 
feel unsafe in their communities there was a reduced reason.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8824"> 8824 </A></B>
<P>
	When we got into this and looked at what was happening at 
home and on the streets in the southern part of Winnipeg, we found 
that there was no evidence at all to support the kind of outrageous 
allegations that the Reform Party brings to the House on a daily 
and weekly basis. However, the people in the riding feel fear 
because the chamber that they look to for some leadership or some 
sense of what is happening in the country is seized ever so often 
by the members of the third party talking about the most 
gruesome, horrible, nasty, violent events that they can possibly 
bring here, giving an illusion or a sense that we are awash in 
crime.
<P>
	The situation with Clifford Olson is a serious and despicable 
one. I think the member for Vegreville put it very succinctly when 
he made his comments to the member for Rosedale. He said: ``We 
are going to use that event. We are going to attempt to profit from 
the pain, the suffering and emotional feelings that circle around 
someone's killing of children''. I personally feel that is wrong.
<P>
	There has been a debate. A great deal of work has been done and 
a great many changes made. The members know that they cannot 
have the change that they want.
<P>
<B>(1325 )</B>
<P>
	It is not that members do not want to have it happen but because 
it requires a constitutional change. Despite this, the day before a 
day when we will be one more time forced to be dragged through 
the most unfortunate point in our history, the members choose to do 
everything they can not to soften the impact on the victims but to 
heighten it. It is time that we reflected on what we are here for.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Leon E. Benoit (Vegreville, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I feel I 
must respond to the accusations made by the hon. member who has 
just spoken. He accused me, first of all, of saying that we would use 
this event tomorrow, that of Clifford Olson applying for an early 
release hearing, to profit. Personally, I did not say that.
<P>
	I said that we would use that event to try to get this law changed 
so that victims do not have to suffer through reliving crimes, these 
terrible events again and again. That is what I said.
<P>
	I do not think Canadians will tolerate that kind of misleading 
representation. It is not something we must have. We should stick 
to open, honest debate on the issues. The member has chosen not to 
and that is a sad moment.
<P>
	Second, the hon. member said that it would require a 
constitutional change to prevent Clifford Olson from receiving his 
hearing. That is a debatable point. It is not clear one way or the 
other. The government, to which the hon. member is a part, has 
passed legislation many times where there is real question whether 
it would fit within the Constitution or not. Those members have 
chosen in those cases to go ahead with the legislation anyway.
<P>
	I wish the members in the House would stick to open and honest 
debate. The Reform Party, in all good faith, is honestly trying to get 
a change to the law that it feels should be made. Reformers feel 
very strongly. We have called for that again and again in every way 
we can. This is one more way.
<P>
	We will keep calling for that change until the government either 
makes it or until we become government and we make it. It is a 
change that has to be made. I want to make those comments. I 
really do not think there was anything in the member's comments 
that warrants a question.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Alcock:</B> Mr. Speaker, I wrote down the quote as the member 
was speaking when he was asking the question of the member for 
Rosedale. He said: ``We are going to use this event''. He said it 
two, three times. The whip for his party talked about how they were 
going to take advantage of this event because of what was going to 
happen tomorrow and the fact that this was going to be front page, 
tomorrow.
<P>
	There are lots of times when a party can bring forward issues to 
debate, but to choose to do it at this time serves only one purpose. It 
is a rather shabby, thinly disguised attempt to grab headlines and 
further create fear in the community in the hopes of furthering their 
own political objectives. This is not the kind of issue from which 
anyone should profit.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Benoit:</B> Mr. Speaker, once again we have the accusation that 
we are doing this for political reasons. How could the member say 
that when we made clear in our speeches the change we want to 
have made.
<P>
	He knows well that ever since we have been here, and for years 
before, we have been pushing for changes along these lines and for 
this specific change which would have prevented Clifford Olson 
from ever having this hearing.
<P>
	The reason we want this change is exactly so that the families of 
the children who Clifford Olson so viciously killed, and the 
families of other victims of other murderers, will not have to suffer 
through reliving the events again and again. The families will bear 
that pain as long as they live, but at least we could try to change 
things so that it will not be brought to the forefront again and again.
<P>
<B>(1330)</B>
<P>
	The hon. member should acknowledge that is the reason for the 
debate today.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Duncan (North Island-Powell River, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, we have certainly generated some debate in the House. It 
occurs to me that some of the debate among members is quite 
different from what victims often look for when they look to the 
House. They are looking for a voice to represent their concerns. 
Today we are trying to offer our voices because victims feel that  
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8825"> 8825 </A></B>
<P>
very often the government does not represent their points of view, 
certainly not on a priority basis.
<P>
	We had a good description this morning of Reform's concerns. 
The victims bill of rights went through the House and we have yet 
to see it come back as substantive legislation. It is unlikely to 
happen before an election despite a moral obligation on the part of 
government to do exactly that.
<P>
	We are talking about section 745 today. A private member's bill 
was put before the House by a Liberal member who is now an 
Independent member of the House. That bill was to repeal section 
745. It went through. Legal counsel of the day did not advise the 
member that the bill was somehow out of order because it would be 
unconstitutional. Nor did I hear much in the way of debate that the 
bill would be unconstitutional at the time. All this argument has 
come up because we put a motion before the House today. This is 
valuable debate.
<P>
	If this is really the way members of the government feel, why did 
they not say so earlier? The reason is that the government does not 
believe the concerns of victims should overwhelm the concerns of 
an intellectual elite who believes it knows better what is good for 
the public.
<P>
	I an not a lawyer but I understand legalese reasonably well. I am 
appalled by some of the comments I heard this morning from 
members of the House. An earlier comment was made about the 
rights of prisoners under section 745 and how they should not be 
taken away retroactively.
<P>
	What are we talking about? It is the same type of thinking where 
prisoners were given the vote. The government does not have the 
jam to appeal the decision of the court on the rights of prisoners 
under the charter. If that is the case and the public does not buy it, 
there is an obligation on the part of the government to try to change 
it.
<P>
	Then there is the argument that even if section 745 were repealed 
today somehow things would be different. What took the Liberals 
so long? Reform has been asking for this piece of legislation since 
1994. Why did it take so long?
<P>
<B>(1335)</B>
<P>
	Other legislation has been brought forward in this Parliament. 
We had Bill C-55 concerning high risk offenders. The Reform 
Party warned that if conditional sentencing were allowed under 
dangerous offender legislation, which means they would not serve 
one day in jail, it could be a real door opener for violent offenders.
<P>
	Our words had no effect in this place. They certainly had an 
effect in the courts of the land. The message sent to a rapist in 
Abbotsford, British Columbia, because of that bill was that the first 
one was free and there would be no jail time.
<P>
	We also heard the solicitor general blame the Bloc this morning 
for the loss of retroactivity on the bill as it affects Clifford Olson. 
First there is an argument about retroactivity. To blame it on the 
Bloc is nothing less than intellectually cute. The minister waited 
too long and did not make it retroactive.
<P>
	It is a moot point to talk about closure in the House of Commons. 
I do not believe this type of hearing in the Clifford Olson case will 
not happen again. There are other applicants in the pipeline and 
there will be for some time.
<P>
	Some of the tinkering done by Bill C-45 that amended section 
745 made things worse than they previously were. Under the rule 
changes, at the preliminary stage a supreme justice or his or her 
designate decides whether an application can proceed to a jury 
based on expectation of success. What message does that send to 
the families if it goes to a jury? The expectation is even greater that 
it will succeed. What a travesty.
<P>
	We would not be dealing with this despicable section if in 1976 
the Liberal government and an out-of-touch solicitor general had 
listened to reason when they were told of the havoc it would wreak 
on the families of victims. The Liberal government then did not 
care and the Liberal government now does not really care about all 
this. Their track record on high risk offenders, as I described, is 
testimony to their bizarre view of compassion and fairness.
<P>
	On the eve of the processing of the application for early release 
of Canada's most horrendous dirt bag, Clifford Robert Olson, the 
families of the innocent victims he savaged are sick to their 
stomachs. Mr. Olson, from his condo at Prince Albert penitentiary, 
is having another laugh at the expense of the victims and their 
families. It is a constant reminder of the naivety of Canada when it 
comes to rights of prisoners.
<P>
	The Reform Party, the Canadian Police Association, parents, 
victims and millions of Canadians have begged this complacent 
and insensitive Liberal government to repeal section 745. It is as 
simple as that. The minister's response has been insulting.
<P>
	Over the next decade and a half we will have 600 similar killers 
who will presumably be eligible for judicial review which will 
once again expose their victims to the horrors they try to forget.
<P>
	The Reform Party and sensitive, fair-minded Canadians are not 
mute. We will fight for the repeal of section 745 for as long as it 
takes. It not only applies to Olson. It also applies to all of Canada's 
worst killers, no matter whom they killed, how they killed or how 
many times they killed.
<P>
	As of 1994 there were 60 hearings of the kind that will take place 
tomorrow at the Vancouver court house. With the rules of evidence 
set up as they are now, 43 of the 60 hearings have given killers a 
chance to get out early. That  is a 72 per cent success rate from the 
killers' point of view. The rules of evidence at these hearings are 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8826"> 8826 </A></B>
<P>
harebrained. Do we really think that Clifford Olson is not 
laughing?
<P>
<B>(1340)</B>
<P>
	As hard as this is to believe, at these 15-year review hearings 
victims are not allowed to give evidence. Correctional Service 
Canada is selective about information it gives the crown and the 
jury about the inmate. Unlike the trial, the verdict at the hearing 
only needs to be two-thirds in favour and the Clifford Olsons of the 
world win and walk.
<P>
	We have heard a lot of talk about unanimity, that unanimity is 
talking about the future. Mr. Olson is still two-thirds as are others 
in the pipeline. Only in Canada they say. According to the 
Canadian Police Association, to date the experience of these 
hearings indicates that Correctional Service Canada is not exactly 
forthcoming about what evidence it hands over, especially if it is 
negative toward the killer. It is double jeopardy. This has the effect 
of ganging up on the families of victims one more time. Will it 
never end?
<P>
	The Canadian Police Association confirms the unbalanced 
nature of the hearings to date, pointing out four major unfair 
elements. First, there is no oral testimony evidence of the offence. 
Instead it is done by agreed on facts. Yet the offender is allowed 
oral testimony regarding his or her rehabilitation. Which kind of 
testimony has a greater impact?
<P>
	Second, no victim or surviving family evidence is allowed. It is 
deemed irrelevant. Are we getting the picture?
<P>
	Third, Correctional Service of Canada supplies one person of its 
choosing to present what it chooses to release to the crown and to 
highlight for the jury. In the experience of the Canadian Police 
Association in one case this produced grossly unreliable, 
unjustified and on occasion wrong factual conclusions on the part 
of the Correctional Service of Canada.
<P>
	Fourth, if the list were not already stacked enough, Correctional 
Service of Canada currently invokes the federal Privacy Act to 
disallow crown access to what it deems to be privacy matters. As 
the Canadian Police Association indicates in one case the originally 
concealed material turned out to contain information that this 
``model prisoner'' inmate was a member of a lifer's group in prison 
known as the controllers that ran drugs, muscle and extortion in 
prison. This only came out when the judge ordered it released and 
admitted into evidence.
<P>
	On more than one occasion privacy information has turned out to 
be ongoing criminal activity of the inmate while in prison. While 
CSC is no doubt embarrassed by this it does not justify concealing 
the truth, especially considering what is at stake.
<P>
	The son of one of my constituents, Marjean Fichtenberg, was 
killed by Paul Butler. Paul Butler was on parole although he had 
committed 40 wrongdoings in prison which included a stabbing. 
That is the record of our parole board. The principle of section 745 
may be out of touch but the process is an outright sham.
<P>
	Let me add further insult to injury. In 1981 Clifford Olson 
pleaded guilty to the murder of 11 children. He received one life 
sentence for 11 murders. However a life sentence does not mean 
that a person will spend the rest of his or her life in jail as it would 
imply. A life sentence equals 25 years in prison, but 25 years in 
prison does not really mean that the offender will spend 25 years in 
prison. It means that he or she might only spend 15 years in prison. 
It is very confusing and misleading to say that a person receives a 
life sentence when it might only be a 15-year sentence. That is how 
the Canadian legal system works. Fifteen years for the taking of a 
human life, is that justice? In the end if Olson did get out in 15 
years, which is unlikely but not impossible, he would have served 
1.1 years for every child he was convicted of murdering. The only 
change in this travesty known as section 745 was the September 
1996 amendment which excludes first and second degree 
murderers who are multiple murderers, but only for those who 
commit after the amendment was enacted in January. That still 
leaves the group of 600 on the path to parole.
<P>
<B>(1345)</B>
<P>
	In 1976 the then solicitor general for the Liberal government of 
day, Warren Allmand, felt that keeping an offender in prison for 25 
years was the waste of a person's life and that it cost the taxpayers 
too much. Really, what about the 11 plus lives Olson took? Since 
when have Liberals become so conscious of taxpayer dollars?
<P>
	The same solicitor general, Warren Allmand, argued in the same 
year that a person who commits a crime in the heat of the moment 
would not have to spend 25 years in jail because they probably 
would not commit another crime again. As of April 1994, 43 
murderers had applied for early release under this section. Fifteen 
received immediate parole, 18 had their minimum terms reduced 
and 7 were denied early release. The rest are able to reapply in 
three or four years.
<P>
	Over 70 per cent of these killers have been successful in 
obtaining early release at their hearings. Hearings in Quebec have 
had a high rate of release; in B.C., Manitoba and Saskatchewan, 
moderate release rates; in Alberta and Ontario, low release rates.
<P>
	A report put out in 1991 by Correctional Services Canada 
surveyed 495 offenders entitled to judicial reviews. It said that 
those offenders with sentences of 15 years or more committed 
crimes that ``involved extreme violence and were of a rather 
gruesome character''. So much for Allmand's concern over crimes 
of passion. The report went further, saying that the  treatment 
participation level as a whole for these kinds of offenders was low. 
More than 68 per cent never took part in any treatment programs. 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8827"> 8827 </A></B>
<P>
Less than 5 per cent participated in a program that specifically 
dealt with violent personalities. Over 65 per cent did not take part 
in any professional training while in prison.
<P>
	Yet despite the fact that very few violent offenders get any 
treatment, over 70 per cent have been successful so far at their 
judicial reviews.
<P>
	In Ontario over the next five years over 211 murderers will apply 
for early release. In Canada between 500 and 600 murderers could 
get early release and be walking Canada's streets.
<P>
	The Canadian Police Association has spearheaded debate on 
section 745 with the Reform Party and calls for its repeal. The 
association calls for this repeal based on five elements. The 
original sentence requires a discretionary parole system after a 
number of years set by a court, so why add a new discretionary step 
at all? Fifteen years is an insufficient specific or general deterrent 
for those most serious crimes. Fifteen years does not adequately 
express the principle of denunciation which these crimes merit. It 
is wrong to revictimize a victim's family by allowing these 
hearings where killers seek up to 40 per cent discounts off their 
court sentences. The preparation and hearing process is expensive 
and these dollars could be better put to use for public safety.
<P>
<B>(1350 )</B>
<P>
	I remember well remarks I made in October 1996 during debate 
on the high risk offenders bill surrounding a constituent of mine. I 
referred earlier to Mrs. Marjean Fichtenberg who lost her son 
Dennis to a career criminal. I would like the justice minister to face 
her, see her grief and explain why he sees this high risk offender 
and section 745 foolishness as being fair, responsible and 
compassionate to the victims and their families. Tell her the deck is 
not stacked and have her believe he is out to prevent crime.
<P>
	Since we struck down capital punishment, Canadians believed 
life imprisonment meant a minimum of 25 years at the state 
country club. They were deceived. A human life is worth more than 
15 years. There is no parole or judicial review for murder victims 
and their families.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Osvaldo Nunez (Bourassa, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like 
to react to the Reform Party's exaggerated stance. The motion 
before us is typical of the Reform Party, which wants to reinstate 
capital punishment in Canada. They take isolated pitiful cases in an 
effort to have section 745 of the Criminal Code on parole repealed. 
They want excessive repression to be used in our society against 
offenders. They do not consider that offenders can be rehabilitated.
<P>
	I would like to ask the member if we could not go after the 
causes of crime, which, I would point out, is on the decrease in 
Canada, and fight poverty and unemployment instead of going after 
section 745 of the Criminal Code?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Duncan:</B> Mr. Speaker, there are a couple of preliminary 
things here. We are not out to establish or re-establish capital 
punishment in this country. We are out to create a binding 
referendum whereby the public would decide whether that is 
appropriate for Canada in today's world. We think the public 
should be the determining factor on that very divisive question.
<P>
	In terms of the broader question dealing with causes of 
criminality, I agree there are some very substantive things we can 
do to go after root causes of criminality. However, we do have to 
look at something under 10 per cent of our criminal population who 
are violent offenders. That is what we are dealing with in this bill. 
We want to deal very harshly with that small percentage of the 
criminal population which wreaks so much havoc in our society.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
happy to have an opportunity to also add my concern that this 
motion has come before the House. It saddens me when a party will 
cloak itself in the grief of families of victims for political 
opportunism. It is shameful. It saddens all Canadians.
<P>
	The Reform Party continues to say that what it is trying to do is 
eliminate the grief for the families of victims so they do not have to 
go through this over and over again. However, the fact remains that 
again today the Reform Party has invoked all the pain and suffering 
of those families by somehow suggesting that the Reform Party can 
make it all go away simply by a little motion in the House of 
Commons. The member will know that the changes to section 745 
provide for an initial review by a judge. It does provide for a 
unanimous requirement from a jury and then parole.
<P>
<B>(1355)</B>
<P>
	The member has also not been totally factual with the Canadian 
public when he implied that section 745 is an automatic 15 years 
when in fact the members knows it is after 15 years. It may be 20 
years or 25 years. Does he really believe that the pain and anguish 
of the families of victims will go away simply by eliminating 
section 745?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Duncan:</B> Mr. Speaker, I am not a lawyer and I do not want to 
put a fine point on some technical items. This victims bill of rights 
is there. The Liberals can do themselves a great favour by doing 
something with it.
<P>
	In terms of being proactive on making our streets safe again, we 
have done a lot in this area. We would like to enact a victims bill of 
rights that puts their rights ahead of those of criminals. It is very 
basic. We want to reform the parole system so that violent 
offenders serve their full  sentence. We would like to eliminate the 
Young Offenders Act and replace it with laws making juvenile 
offenders accountable for their actions.

	<B>Mr. Roger Gallaway (Sarnia-Lambton, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the Internet is the system linking computers all over the world, 
allowing the free flow of information. Now the new chair of the 
CRTC, Madam Bertrand, has stated that her commission intends to 
regulate the Internet to ensure adequate levels of Canadian content. 
If information is flowing freely how and why is Madam Bertrand 
going to measure its Canadiana?
<P>
	Rather than spend our money in such a fashion perhaps a 
suggestion of redirecting her cash to libraries, book publishing or 
literary programs would be infinitely more meaningful. Regulating 
the flow of information is in a historical sense an extraordinarily 
dangerous step. I would suggest that regulating the flow of 
information is in fact censorship.
<P>

about the grain transportation disaster on the prairies. It was so 
arrogant, reminiscent of Pierre Trudeau when he gave farmers the

<P>
	Thanks to major financial commitments by a number of partners 
in Laval, such as CIMA+, the Dessau group, Gendron-Lefebvre

of the Cosmodome's revival. The National Bank, another major 
participant in this salvage operation, has agreed to forgive a $4 
million debt.
<P>
	I would like to draw attention to the important role played by 
Alain Contant, the chairman of the Conseil de développement

the Cosmodome. A hard driving manager, he proved that the

the news that the federal Liberals are giving the railways the right 
to charge more for hauling grain by increasing the cost of capital

let farmers' grain accumulate into an unprecedented backlog 
costing farmers $65 million.
<P>
	The Prime Minister said last Friday that his government would 
not force the railways to speed up the movement of grain. Instead 
of holding the railways accountable for poor performance, the 
Liberals have the gall to reward the railways with a raise of $15

subscribers are currently being ripped off by large cable companies 
with negative option billing. Right now, the cable monopolies are 
adding new specialty channels to existing services with a big price 
hike. The problem is that consumers do not have a choice in the 
matter. This is wrong.
<P>
	I would like to congratulate the hon. member for 
Sarnia-Lambton for getting Bill C-216 passed in the House of 
Commons. This bill prohibits the crime of negative option billing 
by cable companies and defends the rights of Canadian consumers. 
The great cable revolt is still going on and the citizens of Kent and 
across the country are sick of being cheated by the cable 
companies.
<P>
	As this bill sits in the unelected Senate, I would hope all sides of 
the House strongly encourage senators to get this important bill

<P>
	As a government, we have supported and continue to support the 
principle of pay equity. I understand that currently the issue is 
before the Human Rights Tribunal and, as such, the government 
cannot interfere. The dispute is not on the principle of pay equity 
but on the methodology of calculating the amount of pay equity.

<P>
	In the latest study by the Interparliamentary Union about men 
and women in politics and ``unfinished democracy'', we read that 
women today have only 11.7 per cent of the seats in parliaments

women in politics, a situation that is one of the most serious flaws 
of our modern democracies.

<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="JOBCREATION">JOB CREATION</A></H3>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, this government got elected by making Canadians believe 
that its priority was job creation. However, since the beginning of 
1996, the unemployment rate has gone up instead of down, 
although there was a significant drop in the number of unemployed 
who said they were seeking employment.
<P>
	Would the Minister of Finance confirm what was said by 
economist John Lester of Wood Gundy, who indicated that if the 
labour force participation rate of Canadians were the same as it was 
in 1989, the current unemployment rate in this country would be 14 
per cent?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
there is no doubt there is a connection between the participation 
rate and the unemployment levels reported by Statistics Canada.
<P>
	This is why we talked mainly about job creation. The Prime 
Minister has said many times, and so have I, that since we came to 
power, we have created more than 790,000 jobs in the private 
sector alone, the vast majority of which were full-time jobs.
<P>
	Even with last Friday's figures, if we consider the past five 
months, we created more than 70,000 jobs, most of them in the 
private sector, and these are full-time jobs, precisely for the reason 
mentioned by the hon. member. We must mention job creation, 
because the unemployment levels only tell us part of the story.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8832"> 8832 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, 14 per cent unemployment based on the 1989 
participation rate is hardly something for the Minister of Finance 
to be proud of. The government has certainly nothing to be proud 
of. And if it does not mean a thing to the Minister of Finance, 
it has a particularly cruel meaning for the families of those who 
are looking for work.
<P>
	The Minister of Finance bragged about creating full-time jobs. 
How can he brag about full-time jobs when, according to Statistics 
Canada, 40 per cent of the new jobs created in the last 12 months 
are part-time jobs?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, 
the hon. member knows perfectly well that figures are very 
volatile, that the situation changes from month to month, and that 
since we came to power, the vast majority of jobs have been 
full-time jobs. In fact, if we consider the five past months, that is 
what the situation is.
<P>
	The hon. member would probably be able to find another period 
with figures to suit him. However, when we look at the indicators, 
we see that consumer spending increased 5.6 per cent during the 
fourth quarter, that investment in housing is rising. In January, 
housing resales rose 3.8 per cent. In February-and this is very 
important because of the multiplying effect-housing starts 
reached their highest level in two and a half years. Fixed 
investment by business rose to 23 per cent.
<P>
	My point is, yes, we are concerned about the employment 
situation, and yes, we are concerned about the job situation for 
young people, but when we consider Canada's financial situation at 
the very beginning and the improvement in the employment 
situation since we came to power, the indicators show that Canada, 
despite its shortcomings, has one of the strongest job creation rates 
of any industrialized country. There has indeed been tremendous 
progress.
<P>
<B>(1420)</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the Minister of Finance made a number of appalling 
statements that deserve some comments at the very least.
<P>
	He said that I could always find figures to suit my purposes. We 
know he specializes in finding figures to suit him over the short 
term, to try and justify the government's poor performance. He also 
said that figures were volatile. Well, I would say it is not the figures 
but the jobs that are volatile.
<P>
	What justification does he have for the fact that, always 
according to Statistics Canada, between February 1996 and 
February 1997, young Canadians lost 64,000 jobs?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
we are of course concerned about the  employment situation among 
young people. In fact, less than a month ago, the Minister of 
Human Resources Development announced a very detailed 
program to help young people, a summer job program, a program 
creating internships with large corporations. That is why the 
government also encouraged the private sector to make the 
announcement they made last week about creating internships for 
young people.
<P>
	It would also be very helpful if the Bloc Quebecois voted with 
the government. The Leader of the Opposition seems to object 
when I quote economic indicators. But I can him that the economy 
is recovering, and the broad indicators show that we are already 
seeing the results of our policies. Retail sales are reaching record 
highs, exports are picking up, manufacturers' deliveries are 
resuming and interest rates have dropped. So all the conditions are 
there, and next year we can expect an economic upswing.
<P>

<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="EMPLOYMENTINSURANCE">EMPLOYMENT INSURANCE</A></H3>
	<B>Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the Minister of Human Resources Development.
<P>
	Not only is there reason to despair at the low number of jobs 
created in Canada, the increasingly low quality of jobs created 
moreover, but also the unemployed have had increasingly less 
access to unemployment insurance since this government came 
into power.
<P>
	How can the minister explain that, when the Liberals came in, 60 
per cent of the unemployed were drawing unemployment insurance 
while, according to Statistics Canada, in 1996 the figure for the 
percentage drawing benefits was no longer 60 per cent, but only 
41? How does he explain this?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources 
Development, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, the hon. member for Mercier is 
drawing to our attention a problem that is of concern to the 
government, and it is true that the number of people who can make 
use of the employment insurance system has dropped.
<P>
	I do, however, question the figure the hon. member for Mercier 
is giving out. Unfortunately-or fortunately, I should say-that 
figure excludes people who are in the EI system and who can work, 
which was not the case until now. This raises the numbers 
considerably, when those who are working for a time as well as 
drawing EI are included.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8833"> 8833 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, for the 
past six months the employment insurance figure has been, not 
41 per cent, but 36 per cent. If the minister is satisfied, I do not 
know what he can be satisfied with.
<P>
	Leaving fine speeches aside, will the minister admit that, in fact, 
the true impact of the reform is not that it makes it possible for 
Canadians to get back to work, as the minister has tried so often to 
tell us, but rather that it condemns them to falling back onto 
welfare, a provincial responsibility?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources 
Development, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, I am delighted to see the hon. 
member for Mercier concerned with what is going on at the 
provincial level as well. I have noted recently that she has been 
keeping an eye, not only on our government and its ideology, but 
also on the Government of Quebec, and that she is beginning to be 
concerned about certain decisions that have been taken by it.
<P>
	I would like to reassure the hon. member for Mercier, in the 
enthusiasm she is manifesting once again, that where employment 
insurance is concerned, we have, as a government, acted with a 
great sense of responsibility.
<P>
<B>(1425)</B>
<P>
	This is the greatest reform in 25 years, one with which we 
wanted to help Canadians break out of the cycle of dependency into 
which too many of them had fallen. We wanted to create conditions 
that would help them break out of the cycle of dependency while 
continuing to provide assistance with their income, so we created a 
transitional fund in order to create jobs, and wage subsidies in 
order to help people set up their own businesses.
<P>
	We have brought about a major reform and are most pleased with 
it, because we are helping first and foremost with current 
conditions.

<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="SOMALIAINQUIRY">SOMALIA INQUIRY</A></H3>
	<B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley East, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
over the weekend we learned of a defence department memo that 
advised the minister to shut down the Somalia inquiry because it 
was not in the national interest to investigate allegations of a high 
level military cover-up. It is no surprise that defence headquarters 
would think it is not in the national interest to investigate defence 
headquarters. What is a surprise is that the minister accepted this 
very biased piece of advice and shut down the inquiry.
<P>
	My question is to the minister of defence. Why is it not in the 
national interest to get to the bottom of a high level military 
cover-up?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of National Defence and 
Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, one of the 
things that is a requirement for the minister of defence as well as 
for any other minister who is involved in serious problems that 
confront the government and the nation is to take advice from as 
many sources as possible.
<P>
	It was not very long ago that the hon. leader of the third party 
was asking the Prime Minister of Canada to guarantee that the 
commission of inquiry on Somalia end its work before the next 
federal election.
<P>
	I have tried to take advice from as many sources as possible, but 
in the final analysis the Government of Canada made the decision 
to extend the Somalia commission of inquiry for a third time and to 
ask it to please report by the end of June, which would be in excess 
of two years after it began an inquiry that was scheduled to finish in 
December 1995.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley East, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, one 
of the sources the minister could have listened to was the 
commissioners themselves who said that shutting down the inquiry 
early amounted to a cover-up and a whitewash. He could have 
listened to them.
<P>
	The national interest is not the reason the Somalia inquiry is 
being shut down. It is being shut down because of political 
interests. It is not in the Liberal interest to have inquiry 
commissioners look into allegations of cover-up that occurred 
under this Liberal government.
<P>
	Again, why does the minister not want Canadians to know the 
truth about a high level cover-up that occurred under this Liberal 
government?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of National Defence and 
Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, to find out as 
much as possible is in everyone's best interests as long as the 
information available is of some contemporary utility.
<P>
	As recently as September of last year the hon. leader of the third 
party felt it was appropriate to try to get to the recommendations of 
the commission of inquiry before a federal election. As a 
government we have extended for the third time the mandate of this 
commission. We recognize that not everyone is satisfied with that 
decision.
<P>
	The hon. member speaks about the recommendations of the 
commissioners of inquiry. I recall there were three 
recommendations in the last letter. As I remember the text of the 
letter, one recommendation clearly indicated that the ultimate 
scenario would be that the commission would not finish its work 
until at the earliest the end of 1998. At some point you have to 
decide what you think is in the best interest.
<P>
	If the hon. member would check with members of the Canadian 
forces and with most of the people who have been observing the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8834"> 8834 </A></B>
<P>
work of the commission of inquiry, he  would find there is a fair 
amount of support for the decision the government took.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley East, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
today at the Somalia inquiry Major Vincent Buonamici raised 
further questions about a cover-up at the highest levels of national 
defence. On Sunday it was revealed that the former defence 
minister's office participated in a departmental smear campaign to 
discredit Dr. Barry Armstrong. A lot of people seem to be working 
very hard to ensure Canadians do not get the truth about what 
happened in Somalia and in the subsequent events.
<P>
	Why does the minister not want Canadians to know the truth and 
does the minister really believe that hiding the truth will bring a 
just resolution to what happened in Somalia and the subsequent 
events?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of National Defence and 
Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the need to 
determine what happened and why it happened in Somalia and 
what occurred subsequent to the very unfortunate events in 
Somalia is obviously very important.
<P>
	What I think is of equal importance and what Canadians have 
come to accept as being absolutely essential is what we are going to 
do to ensure that the kinds of situations that occurred in Somalia do 
not reoccur and that what happened after those incidents occurred 
be an appropriate response to those kinds of incidents.
<P>
<B>(1430)</B>
<P>
	Obviously the hon. member and members of his party have not 
yet decided how they want to address matters relating to the 
Canadian forces because, as the hon. member would know, by the 
end of this month we will be reporting to the Prime Minister, to the 
government and to the people of Canada on what we think should 
be done with the Canadian forces. We have yet to hear from the 
Reform Party.

	<B>Mrs. Monique Guay (Laurentides, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the Minister of Human Resources Development.
<P>
	The opposition has joined with demonstrators in the maritimes 
and Quebec criticizing the new employment insurance plan, which 
clearly, makes no sense. The program has barely been implemented 
and already the minister is having to rush in and make adjustments, 
because things are not working, and this morning once again, the 
Minister of National Defence was taken to task in Tracadie.
<P>
	How can the minister justify the fact that the new measures 
apply to only certain regions-primarily those that fought his 
reform the strongest-other than for electoral purposes?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources 
Development, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, the question is quite simple: we 
obviously brought the solution to where the problem existed.
<P>
	These are the regions that demonstrated the most clearly and 
drew our attention to the importance of changing the system.
<P>
	My two predecessors, now the Minister of Foreign Affairs and 
the Minister of National Defence-my immediate 
predecessor-and I have always recognized, in undertaking a 
reform as enormous as the one involving unemployment insurance, 
which is 25 years old, that we would monitor the transition and 
implementation of the new system very carefully.
<P>
	We knew that inevitably minor adjustments would be required 
here and there. My attention was drawn in the Atlantic caucus to an 
anomaly in the system relating to short weeks. The Government of 
Canada worked hard to correct the situation satisfactorily for the 
location where the problem arose.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Monique Guay (Laurentides, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, how can 
the minister justify choosing the criterion of 10 per cent 
unemployment, when it will mean that the people of Westmount 
will be entitled to the new measure and the people of 
Saint-Hyacinthe will not?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources 
Development, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, I recognize the demagoguery of 
those opposite. No doubt they are talking about the committee-
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Tremblay:</B> You are not allowed to say that.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> I would ask the hon. minister to withdraw the 
word ``demagoguery''.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Pettigrew:</B> Mr. Speaker, if the hon. member was referring to 
Saint-Henri, is she-
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> I ask the hon. minister to withdraw the word 
``demagoguery''.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Pettigrew:</B> Mr. Speaker, I withdraw the word 
``demagoguery'', but I would say with pleasure that we worked 
hard to solve the problems brought to our attention. Where 
unemployment is at 10 per cent, there is less likelihood of finding 
work that would give people longer weeks. The aim of our system 
is precisely to encourage people to accept as much work as 
possible.
<P>
	So, in Saint-Henri, where unemployment is above 10 per cent, 
the situation is remedied. Where unemployment is less, people are 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8835"> 8835 </A></B>

more likely to work a full week. That  is the logic and that is the

like the Canadian public, I found it extremely difficult to know 
exactly what went on Somalia and even more to know what has 
gone on here in Ottawa with regard to the events in Somalia.
<P>
	The minister of defence made it quite clear from his first day as 
minister that he wanted to get the inquiry over as quickly as 
possible.
<P>
	Why did he want it over last September and now why does he 
want it over? Is it for the good of the armed forces? Is it for the 
good of the country or is for the good of the Liberal Party?
<P>
<B>(1435 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of National Defence and

events and much of what took place around the situation the hon. 
member refers to occurred under the watch of the previous 
administration.
<P>
	To the hon. member, because of his background and his respect 
for the Canadian forces, in direct response to his question, he has 
finally recognized on behalf of his party that I indicated 
immediately upon coming to my position as Minister of National 
Defence that it was my fervent hope and the government's that the 
commission of inquiry would end its work as scheduled in March.
<P>
	When he asks why I felt it should be ended in March, although 
we have subsequently extended it to the end of June, it is because 
everywhere I have gone in Canada and abroad, speaking but mainly 
listening to members of the Canadian forces, I can tell the hon. 
member that if he spoke with many of his former colleagues he 
would know that in great part it was time to turn the corner and 
there is no question that the decision in part was because it is in the 
best interests of the Canadian forces.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bob Ringma (Nanaimo-Cowichan, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
certainly share with the minister the interest of the Canadian 
forces.
<P>
	As a former member, I have really looked on with a lot of 
anguish. I have seen members of the airborne regiment, especially 
the junior ranks, persecuted, prosecuted and otherwise vilified. So I 
agree with the minister, at least let us clear the air.
<P>
	But how can we clear the air if the full testimony of the likes of 
Kim Campbell's staff, Bob Fowler, Major Buonamici and Major 
Armstrong is not out? What will the minister do specifically to 
clear the air and get those unanswered questions answered?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of National Defence and 
Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the hon. 
member was a valued member of the Canadian forces for many 
years and I understand his anguish.
<P>
	I have never commented, nor will I, on the roster of witnesses or 
how the commission of inquiry conducted its work. It was entirely 
within its prerogative to set out its work schedule the way it wanted 
to. It has done that for over two years.
<P>
	The hon. member has asked a very pertinent question. He has 
asked how we intend to move on and how to clear the air. I have 
undertaken to submit to the Prime Minister, to the government, to 
the people of Canada and to the Canadian forces by the end of this 
month a very comprehensive and substantial set of 
recommendations on the future of the Canadian forces. We have 
sought and received the input of literally hundreds of Canadians

victims will not have to relive their pain and agony over and over 
again?
<P>

perhaps the member would ask a more general question. However 
it deals directly with what we are discussing today, that is section

	If the member can rephrase the question so that it is acceptable, I 
will permit it.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ramsay:</B> Mr. Speaker, I do not know whether or not I can do 
that. Therefore I will withdraw my question.
<P>

horrible crime imaginable-
<P>

<P>

is fair and just to innocent victims, parents, relatives and friends for 
murderers to be allowed to plead for early release after serving only 
15 years of their sentence?

Development.
<P>
	On February 14, the Quebec finance minister wrote the Minister 
of Human Resources Development, seeking financial support from 
the federal government for UBI SOFT, a multimedia product 
project. Although time is of the essence in this matter, the minister 
still has not written back.
<P>
	Could the Minister of Human Resources Development tell us 
whether or not his government plans to financially support UBI 
SOFT, an innovative project that could generate more than 550 
high technology jobs in the Montreal area?

<P>
	<B>Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry, Minister for the 
Atlantic Canada Opportunities Agency, Minister of Western

Speaker, the hon. member may or may not be aware of the fact that 
there have been discussions between FORD-Q, Human Resources 
Development Canada and Quebec government officials regarding 
UBI SOFT.
<P>
	Before getting involved in this project, we must determine 
whether it is worthwhile and whether the jobs that will be created 
are long term jobs and justify the request submitted to both 
governments. I think that even the Government of Quebec would 
want to know that much.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Témiscouata, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I thank the minister for his answer, but while the letter 
from the Quebec minister was sent to the Minister of Human 
Resources Development and our question was directed to the 
Minister of Human Resources Development, we have the Minister 
of Industry answering.
<P>
	Given how important this matter is, the number of jobs at stake 
in Quebec, and the fact that UBI SOFT is growing impatient and 
thinking of setting up operations  in China if Canada does not show 
interest, could the minister give us the assurance that there is 
someone, somewhere, in his government who will at least indicate 
<P>

When a project deals with industrial matters, it is only natural that 
the Minister of Industry offer his views.
<P>
	Since one aspect of this matter is of interest to the Department of 
Human Resources Development, and considering that I indeed 
received a letter from the Government of Quebec, we did act with 
due diligence.

long ago the Prime Minister told the Toronto <I>Star</I> that he wanted to 
run in the next election on his jobs record. Friday's job numbers 
should give him pause. There were 38,000 fewer jobs than in the 
previous month; 44,000 women lost their jobs; and for 77 months 
in a row unemployment was over 9 per cent.
<P>
	Does the Prime Minister really have the nerve to run on his jobs 
record?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, let 
us take a look at the situation in 1993 when we took office. Taxes 
were rising. The deficit was increasing. Interest rates were on the 
increase. Total insecurity was reigning throughout the land.
<P>
	Let us take a look at the situation today. The deficit is down. 
Interest rates are down. There have been no personal tax increases 
in the last budget and $2 billion worth of selective tax decreases.
<P>
	We see a set of economic indicators that can match those of 
anybody in the world. We see that virtually every economist in the 
country is predicting 300,000 new jobs will be created this year.
<P>
	No other country can ascertain that record and the fact is that 
will happen.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, that 
may go over well down at the yacht club, but for a guy who does 
not have a job on Main Street it is pretty hard to swallow. There are 
1.5 million unemployed Canadians, two million to three million 
underemployed and 800,000 who are moonlighting just to make 
ends meet. That is the Liberal job record.
<P>
<B>(1450)</B>
<P>
	What is the Liberals' answer to this crisis? It is a 73 per cent hike 
in payroll taxes that their own bureaucrats say will kill jobs.
<P>
	With an unemployment rate of 9.7 per cent and with 1.5 million 
people unemployed, why is the government hiking a guaranteed 
job killer by 73 per cent?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, if 
anybody wants to take a look at the debates in the House over the 
last three years, when the government has been bringing in job 
programs, whether it be cleaning up the nation's finances, short 
term job programs such as the infrastructure or longer term 
programs such as investing in education and R and D, they will see 
one thing, that the Reform Party has opposed every job creation 
measure brought in by the government.
<P>
	If the member is sincere in his statement that he does not want to 
see the 9.9 per cent increase in Canada pension plan premiums, 
why has he brought forth a  proposal that would increase those

	<B>Mr. Jean-Guy Chrétien (Frontenac, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the Minister of Agriculture.
<P>
	For a little over two years now, in a relentless effort to abide by 
the new rules of the WTO, the federal government has been 
slashing its various farm support programs. For instance, dairy 
subsidies will be completely abolished as of August 1, 1997, 
without any financial compensation.
<P>
	Can the minister tell us how our farmers will benefit from the 
fact that the U.S. government is planning to cut its overall farm 
support by 23 per cent over a period of seven years, while Canada 
will cut its support by 21 per cent but over only three years?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Ralph E. Goodale (Minister of Agriculture and 
Agri-Food, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the hon. gentleman's preface made 
reference to the implications of world trade agreements with 
respect to Canadian dairy policy. While there are some 
implications of world trade agreements for Canadian dairy policy, 
the particular connection that he draws in terms of the dairy 
subsidy is not a connection at all.
<P>
	The reductions in the dairy subsidy that have been announced are 
taking place over a seven-year period, two years of which have 
already gone by and five years of which are yet to come. We 
consulted with the dairy industry very closely in terms of the best 
possible way in which to manage the issue. The phase down 
approach we have adopted is quite consistent with the advice we 
received.
<P>
	As the dairy industry deals with the reductions in subsidies I am 
hopeful there will be good co-operation between the producers and 
the processors in terms of how pricing issues and a variety of other 
issues are handled within the framework of a long term dairy 
policy.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean-Guy Chrétien (Frontenac, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I will 
remind the Minister of Agriculture that we are talking here about 
the total reductions expected. Overall, Canada will reduce its 
subsidies by 21 per cent over three years, while our neighbours 
south of the border will take almost twice as long, seven years in 
fact, to cut their subsidies by 23 per cent.
<P>
	Since the level of farm support in Canada is now among the 
lowest in the world, except for Australia and New Zealand, can the 
minister at least approve the dairy  producers' request to postpone 
the next reduction in dairy subsidies from August 1, 1997 until 
February 1, 1998, as this would give them another six months to 
adjust to the austerity measures taken by the Liberal government?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Ralph E. Goodale (Minister of Agriculture and 
Agri-Food, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, there are two aspects to that 
question. The latter point was about a change in the timing for the 
period during which the phase down of the dairy subsidy would 
occur.
<P>
<B>(1455 )</B>
<P>
	That request was put to me a number of weeks ago by the dairy 
farmers of Canada, I understand with the support of the National 
Dairy Council. That request is under active consideration as we 
speak. I hope to be in a position to respond to the dairy industry 
within the next short while.
<P>
	On the other point, the comparison between the Canadian 
situation and the American situation, I point out to the hon. 
member one fundamental distinction. In the United States there is 
essentially an open market system with respect to the dairy 
industry. In Canada we have a supply management system which 
was instituted by a Liberal government and not three months ago 
was thoroughly, totally and successfully defended by the 
government before the NAFTA commission.

	<B>Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George-Peace River, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, all Canadians are now facing a 73 per cent tax hike 
because of the government's decision to double CPP premiums, all 
Canadians that is except federal public servants. Due to the 
government's delay in amending the public service pension plan 
they are exempt from this huge tax grab.

at ways to amend it. A way to amend it to deal with the increase in

concluded within the next few months.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George-Peace River, Ref.):</B> Mr.

<P>
	The government just like its Tory predecessors has been talking

benefiting from using the $24 billion surplus presently in the 
account?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Marcel Massé (President of the Treasury Board and 
Minister responsible for Infrastructure, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
way in which the pension plan is accounted for is according to the 
rules of the Canadian chamber of actuaries and accountants.

serious abuses of child labour worldwide.
<P>
	Canada, along with the Dutch government, the International 
Labour Organization and other members of the international

work including military service, the sexual exploitation of 
children, and the exploitation of children when they work in 
indentured and slave labour.

which would make it possible for Canada to bring to court 
Canadian citizens involved in sexual tourism abroad to face the

	<B>Mr. John Solomon (Regina-Lumsden, NDP):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
my question is for the acting Prime Minister.
<P>
	On Friday the secretary of state responsible for women's issues 
said the Liberal government had over three and a half years 
strengthened employment equity for women by targeting women as 
a key group for employment, creating opportunities for women in 
construction and addressing women's jobs in a comprehensive and 
holistic way.
<P>
<B>(1500 )</B>
<P>
	Today the Minister of Finance says he is proud of his jobs' 
record as it pertains to women. How does the Acting Prime 
Minister explain the so-called economic priorities to employ more 
women with the fact that 44,000 women saw their full time jobs 
disappear last month?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Marcel Massé (President of the Treasury Board and 
Minister responsible for Infrastructure, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, in 
terms of the public service, it is incorrect to say that women are 
being discriminated against in terms of numbers. The percentage of 
availability of women in the workforce is 47 per cent. For this year 
our report indicates that women make up 48.7 per cent of the public 
service, more than their actual number in the labour force.
<P>
	In the public service in the last few years of downsizing we have 
been careful to maintain the number of women to at least what they 
were as a percentage of the total labour force and we have more 
than succeeded.

	<B>Mr. Ray Speaker (Lethbridge, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise on a 
point of order with regard to the hopefully raised questions of my 
hon. colleagues from Crowfoot and Calgary North. The point of 
order I want to raise is with regard to consistency in judging how 
questions can be asked and what the content of those questions can 
be.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> I explained to the hon. member for Crowfoot the 
decisions that were taken today and the dilemma I was having 
because of the specific nature of his question. At that point-
<P>
	<B>Mr. Benoit:</B> What about the tobacco bill? What about that? 
What about fairness?
<P>
<B>(1505 )</B>

	<B>The Speaker:</B> I hope I did not hear the words ``what about 
fairness'' because if I did, and if they were directed to me, then that 
is another matter altogether. However, I am going to let that pass.
<P>
	I permitted the hon. member to rephrase his question and he 
withdrew. He decided not to go on with his question. I proceeded to 
another member from the same party. I thought the preamble to the 
question was going down the same road, but I permitted the 
question to go ahead. I thought the question was marginal but 
permissible. But then I got into the answer and the  answer dealt 
directly with that subject matter which is going on today.
<P>
	I want to give members as much room as I possibly can in 
formulating questions at all times and I want to give the 
government as much room as possible to answer the questions that 
are put because I think they are important.
<P>
	However, if we are dealing with that precise subject matter and it 
is not general enough, in my view, then I would hope that members 
in turn would be fair enough to accept my decision that the question 
is out of order. I judged the questions to be out of order and that 
decision stands.

<P>
	<B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley East, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, in 
trying to formulate when an answer from the government side 
makes us out of order, you can see the dilemma this places us in.
<P>
	When we were discussing the tobacco bill last week, the 
government answered in terms of amendments proposed for the bill 
being discussed that day in the House, specific amendments, and 
that was okay. But now when we have asked questions and the 
answer comes back in such a manner that you, Mr. Speaker, 
consider that answer out of order, then it rules everything we are 
doing out of-

because if the question-

increasingly through the Internet, we in the Commonwealth have 
advanced the causes of democracy and human rights and the fight 
against poverty and injustice that are extremely important to us.
<P>
	Last year was an important year for the Commonwealth. Canada 
played an active role in the Commonwealth Ministerial Action 
Group on the Harare Declaration, CMAG, which has met seven 
times in the last 15 months to discuss serious and persistent 
violations of the Harare declaration.
<P>
	CMAG was created as a result of the last Commonwealth heads 
of government meeting in New Zealand in 1995 to study the 
situations in Nigeria, the Gambia and Sierra Leone. This was part 
of a wide ranging plan adopted by leaders for increased action to 
promote democracy, development and consensus building.
<P>
	The action group will be presenting its report to the heads of 
government in Edinburgh in October. At the Edinburgh meeting the 
Harare declaration will be consolidated and strengthened as we 
revisit the issues of democratic development in our member states. 
In addition, for the first time, the broader economic issues of trade, 
investment and development among our member states will be a 
major focus of our discussions. A  non-governmental organization 
forum and a business forum will be held in conjunction with the 
governmental meeting, which will draw together the vitality of the 
private and public spheres.
<P>
	The Commonwealth is much more than governments and 
officials. It is also a vibrant and growing association of ordinary 
people in every part of the globe. Thousands of Canadians are 
active in the professional, development and service associations 
which are the strength of the Commonwealth. The relationships 
built between Canadians and individuals through these 
organizations are an important force in developing international 
understanding.
<P>
	This year we went one step further by looking beyond 
governmental meetings to actively consult with both the private 
sector and the Commonwealth NGO community on how 
government can best promote and preserve democratization and 
human rights. The round table sessions were successful and several 
good initiatives are being developed as a result. We look forward to 
more consultative sessions in the future.
<P>
	The Commonwealth is a force in the world for the values 
Canadians cherish, and I urge all members to join me today in 
saluting the Commonwealth.
<P>

<P>
	<B>Mr. Philippe Paré (Louis-Hébert, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is 
impossible not to notice the paradox between this theme, 
communication, and the lack of transparency and information that 
characterizes this government.
<P>
	Why is it so difficult if not impossible for members of 
Parliament, who are the elected representatives of the people, to 
obtain the right to take part, even if only as observers, in 
consultations with various groups in our society? Why is it that the 
government, which is constantly promoting communication, 
especially through the Internet, has cut subsidies to the NGOs 
responsible for making the Canadian public aware of the 
importance of development? We know that the key to gaining 
support for our efforts toward sustainable human development 
depends mainly on raising public awareness in donor countries.
<P>
	Why is silence the only response we get when we try to find out 
what is happening within the ministerial action group since the 
disguised failure of the special mission sent to Nigeria to examine 
the situation with regard to democracy and human rights?
<P>
<B>(1515)</B>
<P>
	In the meantime, General Abacha's regime continues to hold 
sway with complete impunity. The Commonwealth is even 
considering welcoming that country back as a member although the 
situation has not improved in any way since the execution of Ken 
Saro Wiwa and eight other Ogoni political opponents.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8842"> 8842 </A></B>
<P>
	The Commonwealth is indeed a valuable forum to discuss 
important issues as long as the political will is there. Canada has 
succeeded in distinguishing itself in the past when it fought against 
apartheid in South Africa. Despite this positive example, which 
shows that communication is possible, it remains extremely 
difficult to reach a consensus when it comes to democracy and 
human rights, even within a group as limited as the ministerial 
action group.
<P>
	Canada can and must exercise strong leadership within the 
Commonwealth in order to promote democracy and human rights. 
There are signs of a tendency to use all multilateral forums, 
including the Commonwealth, to deal with trade issues as 
separately as possible from human rights and democracy.
<P>
	In these times of increasing globalization, there is a great risk 
that vital questions will be overlooked. Canada must not give in to 
this tendency and must continue to defend human rights and 
democracy, as it began to do in the case of Nigeria, with the support 
of Parliament and of the people of Quebec and of Canada.
<P>
	That having been said, I would also call on the government, next 
year and in subsequent years, to implement one of the unanimous 
recommendations of the report by the Sub-Committee on 
Sustainable Human Development. The committee recommended 
that the Canadian government play a leadership role within the 
Commonwealth and elsewhere, in order to raise the issue of child 
labour and to bring about concrete solutions.
<P>
	Given that the problem of the exploitation of child labour is one 
that affects a number of Commonwealth countries, including India, 
Canada must seize the opportunity provided by this multilateral 
forum to help move the cause of children throughout the world 
significantly forward.
<P>
	In this regard, the Bloc Quebecois intends to keep an eye on the 
results of the next meeting of Commonwealth heads of 
government, scheduled to take place in Edinburgh next October 24 
to 27.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ray Speaker (Lethbridge, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is 
certainly a pleasure to respond to this noble day called 
Commonwealth Day and the remarks that have been made in the 
House.
<P>
	I have listened to what the minister and the member from the 
loyal opposition said. I take note of the fact that one of the 
messages trying to be transmitted throughout the Commonwealth 
at this point is talking to one another. That is certainly a good 
message, very idealistic and is an attempt to bring these countries 
that form the Commonwealth together so that they can have some 
common aim or purpose. I think we should have that.
<P>
	However, as a nation and a participant in the Commonwealth, 
one of the responsibilities we have when  we are talking to one 
another is to make sure we are not just talking about things that are 
politically correct and somewhat acceptable. There are times when 
we must talk about human rights and the actions taken by some of 
our fellow countries in the Commonwealth that are not appropriate 
as such, and if they are not appropriate we should clearly say that in 
the most positive critical to bring them to task to live up to the 
expectations that we have in Canada where human rights is 
certainly an item of top priority.
<P>
	I would think, in speaking with regard to this more noble idea of 
countries in the Commonwealth talking to one another, that the 
same thing should apply in this assembly where we talk to one 
another in an open and fair manner, where we have the opportunity 
to speak on behalf of western Canadians, central Canadians and 
eastern Canadians equally and where it is heard. Sometimes we 
forget that in this major partisanship forum, as is the case today. 
Question period today was no exception.
<P>
<B>(1520)</B>
<P>
	Certainly the noble cause to talk to one another in the world is 
good. To keep peace and harmony in the world is good. However, 
let us remember the lesson right at home as well.

(protection of those who purchase products from vertically 
integrated suppliers who compete with them at retail).
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The evolution of this bill follows the recognition that small

there is certainly ample evidence of abuse of dominant predatory 
pricing going on in this country but we seem to have a lack therein 
or a shortage of legislative levers in order to address this reality, 
particularly in the oil industry.
<P>
	This enactment will give a basis for the enforcement of fair 
pricing for a manufacturer who sells a product at retail, either 
directly or through an affiliate, and also supplies the product to a 
consumer who competes with the supplier at the retail level in 
order to give the customer a fair opportunity to make a similar 
profit.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	As I indicated, other provinces, such as Quebec, are proposing 
the same bill in their jurisdiction. The text also states that a supplier 
forcing or trying to force a client to establish a retail pricing policy

practice.

<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Could the Minister of Health indicate what will happen to the existing national

trials network?</BLOCKQUOTE>
	<B>Hon. David Dingwall (Minister of Health, Lib.):</B> Health 
Canada remains committed under phase 2 of the national AIDS 
strategy to support the infrastructure of the Canadian HIV trials 
network (CTN). The decision regarding future funding of the CTN 
and the appropriate  level and distribution of funds will be made 
following the completion of the evaluation of the CTN, which will

with the CTN to support opportunities for Canadians to participate 
in collaborative research on a national international basis.

	AIDS will continue to be a critical public health issue in Canada 
and the world for some time to come. A future national strategy 
will require the co-operation of other governments,

	The House resumed consideration of the motion and of the 
amendment.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The hon. member for North 
Island-Powell River has four minutes in questions and comments.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ted McWhinney (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister 
of Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, in questioning the 
hon. member, may I say as a preface that I became acquainted with 
these cases 15 years ago when one of the victim's families asked 
for my advice on constitutional issues relating to the ability of the 
attorney general of B.C. to renege on the so-called ``blood money'' 
contract paid for information leading to solution of that case.
<P>
	I have followed with great interest the development of the debate 
and his own valuable intervention. However, I would ask him 
whether he has considered the impact of section 11 of the charter of 
rights, particularly subsections (g), (h) and (i) on retroactivity and 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8845"> 8845 </A></B>
<P>
in particular section 11(i). Does he not consider it creates major 
constitutional difficulties for the establishment  retroactively and 
the denial to persons like Olson, already convicted, of the right to 
proceed under existing provisions?
<P>
	Would he not be better advised to direct his feelings about the 
obscenity of the particular person concerned-which I think are 
shared-and suggest closer attention by the tribunal hearing the 
matter to abusive or frivolous use of a device, the existence of 
which on most constitutional authority cannot be retroactively 
taken away?
<P>
	I ask that question seriously because I think there is room for 
representations to be made in the tribunal hearings.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Duncan:</B> Mr. Speaker, we dance around these questions a 
lot. We make presumptions about whether something will be 
acceptable under the charter or not.
<P>
	I mentioned something very basic in my earlier response about 
whether prisoners have the right to vote or not. My memory is that 
was not challenged at the federal level. When the decision was 
made that prisoners have the right to vote, as a federal presence we 
chose not to appeal the decision. Why would we do that? Is it 
because we agreed that prisoners should have the right to vote? I 
would go so far as to say that the vast majority of the population 
does not think so.
<P>
	When it comes to the constitutional difficulties the member for 
Vancouver Quadra mentioned, yes there will be difficulties. Does 
that mean we create convoluted legislation that does not address 
the nub of the problem or do we go for the nub of the problem and 
then deal with the fallout on the constitutional end? We have 
mechanisms such as notwithstanding clauses.
<P>
	Are we ever going to deal with the problems in some of these 
documents, particularly the charter of rights which has its own 
baggage? It has been in place for some time now and we know 
there are inherent problems in it. Are we ever going to deal with the 
problems if we continue to dance around them? I do not think so. I 
think we have to do the right thing and hope the right answer comes 
out of it.
<P>
<B>(1535 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Roger Gallaway (Sarnia-Lambton, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
will be splitting my time with the member for Burlington.
<P>
	To restart this debate, members opposite from the third party 
have called on the government to apologize to families of murder 
victims. One cannot appreciate nor can one understand what sort of 
grief and suffering the families of those who have been murdered 
go through.
<P>
	At the same time it is a sad commentary if this debate has been 
raised today simply on the basis of scoring some political points if 
that is the only motive. There is no reason for this government to 
apologize. And I do not think there is any reason why the 
government would  want to get involved in all of this to make these 
people, the families, political pawns.
<P>
	We know from earlier debate raised by my friend from Rosedale 
that criminal law is not there just to punish. Punishment is part and 
parcel of the criminal law but it is not the sole factor. Punishment 
does not bring back victims. Locking up offenders is not the sole 
answer and there is a cost factor attached to it. We also believe that 
while people are incarcerated we should look at rehabilitation with 
a view that some of these people may be put back into society.
<P>
	The law requires that those who are convicted of first degree 
murder must serve a minimum of 15 years. We also know that most 
people convicted of first degree murder serve a full life sentence. 
We do know that after 15 years release is only possible after a very 
thorough review process. This is not just a review by the Minister 
of Justice or by the courts. Ordinary Canadians have a say as well.
<P>
	The Criminal Code requires that offenders must serve their full 
25 year sentence unless a jury decides that they should be allowed 
to apply for parole. First they have to serve at least 15 years of their 
sentence. Then they must go to the jury and if and only if that jury 
approves can they apply to the parole board in the same way as 
other inmates. This is not a green light from the beginning and this 
is not an easy process.
<P>
	We on this side of the House believe that Canadians are best 
served by a complete criminal justice system, not by a system that 
says the only factor in sentencing is punishment. The criminal law 
has greater width than that and the ultimate purpose of criminal law 
is to make Canada a safer place.
<P>
	We have talked about punishment and we have heard about 
deterrence but we also believe that we are here to protect Canadians 
from violence and by preventing violence. Every murder that we 
can prevent means that one less family is victimized. A criminal 
justice system is not just about deterrence and incarceration. 
Everything possible must be done to prevent crimes from 
happening in the first place and to deal with those who commit 
them so they will not reoffend again.
<P>
	The safety of Canadians requires that offenders be rehabilitated 
if possible and if it is not possible then they will not be released. 
The possibility of release after 15 years instead 25 years is a part of 
rehabilitation. It offers a reward to those who modify their 
behaviour. The strict review process ensures that those who do not 
change will serve out their sentences.
<P>
	The interests of all Canadians are better served by preventing 
crime than simply by punishing people. That is why we have 
brought in legislation to prevent murder and other violent crime.
<P>
	In Canada one-third of all homicides are committed with 
firearms. In recent years more Canadians have been  killed with a 
gun than any other type of weapon. We listened to the families of 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8846"> 8846 </A></B>
<P>
young women killed at the Montreal University Ecole 
Polytechnique in 1989 and the families of victims of firearms 
violence all across Canada. We believe that the families of these 
victims want more than anything to see that it does not happen to 
someone else.
<P>
	That is why the government has enacted new gun control 
legislation. If someone is shot the whole family is victimized but 
Canadians are also victimized.
<P>
<B>(1540 )</B>
<P>
	Unfortunately the new decorum in the House means they keep 
talking but we have to keep the killer in jail. It also costs about 
$50,000 a year which is over $1 million for every offender. If 
murders can be prevented from happening everyone benefits. Sadly 
the members opposite disagree. They voted against gun control. 
They would rather lock up murderers than prevent people from 
being killed in the first place.
<P>
	I ask: who voted against measures that would allow us to identify 
illegal firearms so that the guns could be seized and those who 
import and sell them to Canadian criminals could be prosecuted? 
Who voted against measures that would ensure that police officers 
could find out whether a gun is in the house before they knock on 
the door? Who voted against laws that would control imports to 
ensure that guns that enter Canada are sold only to those who have 
been screened and have been issued a permit for them? Who voted 
against measures that would make sure that only those who owned 
their guns legally and had them registered could go into a store and 
buy ammunition for them? Where do the members opposite stand?
<P>
	Earlier in debate today, members talked about accountability. 
Earlier today they talked about how they stand in solidarity on this 
issue. Yet they also talked about accountability. We also heard the 
talk, and it is only talk, of how they are accountable and how they 
go out, in this infinite wisdom of theirs, and discern how people 
feel.
<P>
	However, members opposite know that three of their members 
voted for the gun legislation. They spent taxpayers' money to do a 
poll in their ridings. They knew all along that this was a way of 
preventing victims, of protecting families and of preventing 
murder.
<P>
	Does the hon. member and his colleagues opposite, with the 
three exceptions who spent the money to do a poll, oppose all of 
these things because they think it will cost too much money? It is 
okay if it is out of the member's budget. They want to spend money 
on prisons but not on preventing crime. They are not willing to 
spend money on saving lives. They also oppose it because it is 
inconvenient for their supporters. They oppose holding gun owners 
responsible for gun storage  requirements that would help keep 
guns from being stolen and keep them out of the hands of children.
<P>
	Some of their supporters object to registering their firearms. 
They object to the idea that they should have to keep their guns 
locked up. They think that they should all be allowed to have 
assault rifles and machine guns. They think they should have the 
right to have any kind of gun. They would like to see everyone with 
a loaded gun to protect themselves from criminals. They have 
adopted the American principle of the right to bear arms. Those are 
simplistic and unrealistic policies.
<P>
	The hon. member and his colleagues do not seem to be very 
concerned that we would also have the kind of homicide rates that 
would inevitably result from their policies. They would like to 
repeal gun laws. They say they would do it all if elected. They say 
they care about the families of those who were shot yesterday but 
they do not seem to care very much about the families of 
tomorrow's victims.
<P>
	One-third of Canadian homicides are committed with guns. That 
means that one-third of the families about whom the hon. members 
opposite are so concerned lost their loved ones to gunshot injuries. 
However, they do not worry about that as long as the killer spends 
25 years in jail. In that way their consciences are clear and their 
supporters are happy. What about the families? They are still 
victims. Their loved ones are still dead and their lives are still 
devastated.
<P>
	I would suggest that the shame is on that side. They should be 
embarrassed for calling on the government, which is trying to 
prevent similar killings in the future, to apologize fully to the 
families of the victims. If anyone should apologize it is those on the 
other side of the House, not here.
<P>
<B>(1545 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
hon. member talked at length about previous legislation the House 
had dealt with such as gun control. He correctly pointed out that 
two-thirds of all homicides were caused other than by firearms. I 
am thankful he pointed that out.
<P>
	My question for the hon. member for Sarnia-Lambton concerns 
the subject of the debate today, the whole issue surrounding section 
745 and whether or not scum like Clifford Olson should have the 
right to come before the public and revictimize the families of the 
children whom he slew. My question also concerns how his own 
constituents feel about the issue.
<P>
	He mentioned that some of the Reform Party members in the 
past went to their constituents on extremely important issues. He is 
right. We certainly have. We have a duty to represent our 
constituents on very important issues.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8847"> 8847 </A></B>
<P>
	Dealing with Clifford Olson, somebody who slew 11 children, 
could he tell me that his constituents support his stand to allow 
such people to come in front of the public again and revictimize 
the families of the children whom he killed?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gallaway:</B> Mr. Speaker, there is a really interesting 
philosophy going on here. They take one issue and stake their lives 
on it. I was elected in the riding of Sarnia-Lambton because 
people knew what I stood for and what I could do. People also 
knew what the government stood for on a whole range of issues.
<P>
	Members opposite love to talk about how they have the only 
method known to mankind of consulting with their constituents. I 
will put my method of consulting with constituents against theirs 
any day.
<P>
	In any event, let us examine the way they consulted with their 
constituents on gun control. Their method of consulting was to 
have their constituents fill out a questionnaire they received in their 
mailboxes and send it in to them. I am certain there were little clubs 
and groups who were Xeroxing these, stuffing them in envelopes 
and mailing them off to their local Reform member of Parliament. 
Of course it can be sent free, without any charge.
<P>
	From the mailbag they said they learned how their constituents 
felt. A bunch of anonymous people had mailed in forms. It was like 
clipping coupons from a newspaper. This was supposed to be a very 
scientific process. It was the way the Reform Party discerns how 
their constituents feel.
<P>
	Out of that came a policy they said represented the views of their 
constituents. Yet, three of their members dared to go into the 
communities and say they wanted to engage a professional polling 
firm. They wanted to find out exactly what the people in their 
ridings were saying. They did not want a bunch of anonymous 
people mailing in clippings and flyers. They wanted to know what 
the people in their ridings truly felt. They were willing to spend 
2,000 or 3,000 bucks of Government of Canada money to find out 
the people of Canada supported Bill C-68.
<P>
	They are using the same kind of logic in the most wondrous 
fashion to tell us that Canadians are opposed to section 745 and 
therefore it must be repealed. Let us have a little clipping service. 
Let us have a discount. Let us find out what those nameless people 
who are responding to the Reform polls are saying.
<P>
	It is nonsense to discern or gauge public opinion that way. They 
do not have a stand. They are like willow trees. They blow with the 
prevailing wind, and the prevailing wind comes from the little 
coupons people clip and mail to them.
<P>
	That indicates why they are sitting where they are in the polls. 
They are devoid of any opinion other than what is in their mailbags. 
It is an indication of how special  interest groups seize such minds 
and propel what they discern to be public opinion. I do not agree.
<P>
<B>(1550)</B>
<P>
	<B>Ms. Mary Clancy (Halifax, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, judging by the 
wording of the motion I get the impression the Reform Party is 
accusing the government of being insensitive to the concerns of 
victims regarding section 745.6 of the Criminal Code. Let me 
assure hon. members of the House that nothing could be further 
from the truth.
<P>
	In developing the amendments to section 745.6 which were 
recently passed by the House the government had the concerns and 
perspective of victims squarely in mind. I am referring to the 
amendments introduced in the House on June 11, 1996 as Bill 
C-45, an act to amend the Criminal Code (judicial review of parole 
ineligibility) and another act, now S.C. 1996, chapter 34. These 
amendments received royal assent on December 18, 1996 and were 
brought into force on January 9, 1997.
<P>
	Turning to the substance of those amendments I note for hon. 
members that as of January 9, 1997 any person who commits 
multiple murders will no longer be entitled to bring an application 
under section 745.6. Judicial review of the parole ineligibility 
period will simply not be an option for anyone who commits more 
than one murder. This would include those offenders, fortunately 
few in number, who have become known in the popular media as 
serial killers.
<P>
	In these cases the offender will be required to serve the full 25 
years with no eligibility for parole and no chance under section 
745.6 to review that ineligibility period. This means that for future 
cases of this nature victims' families will not be forced to face the 
prospect of a section 745.6 review.
<P>
	The second point I note about the amendment is the introduction 
of a mechanism to screen out applications that have no merit. As of 
January 9, 1997 any application brought under the section 
regardless of when the offence was committed will be submitted to 
a superior court judge for a paper review of the case to see if the 
case has a reasonable prospect of success.
<P>
	During the paper review the judge will consider written 
materials presented by the crown and by the offender. If the 
offender cannot show that his or her application has a reasonable 
chance of success-and the legislation places the onus on the 
offender to prove this point-the application will be stopped there. 
It will not be permitted to proceed to a hearing before the jury.
<P>
	The amendment will prevent the type of revictimization the 
Reform Party motion refers to in any case where the application 
has no reasonable prospect of success. These applications will be 
screened out at any early stage. They will not be allowed to proceed 
to a full and public hearing before a judge and jury.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8848"> 8848 </A></B>
<P>
	The third point to note about the amendments is that a 
significant change has been made concerning the number of jury 
members that must be convinced before an offender can obtain 
a reduction in the parole ineligibility period. Before these 
amendments were passed an offender only had to convince 
two-thirds of the jury or eight members out of twelve. As a result 
of Bill C-45 an offender will now have to convince each and every 
member of the jury to get any reduction at all in the parole 
ineligibility period.
<P>
	To recap the effect of these important changes to this section and 
to the review process, as of January 9, 1997 no person who 
commits multiple murders will be allowed to apply for a review 
under section 745.6 of the Criminal Code. All applications brought 
after this date, whether the crimes were committed before or after 
January 9, 1997, will be subjected to a paper review by a superior 
court judge and may well be screened out if the offender cannot 
show a reasonable chance of success. For those applications that do 
not get screened out, the offender will have to convince all 12 
members of the jury to get any reduction in the parole ineligibility 
period, not merely eight members of the jury as was previously 
legislated.
<P>
<B>(1555)</B>
<P>
	The government listened. It listened long and hard to the 
concerns of victims before and during the development of these 
amendments and during their passage through both Houses of 
Parliament.
<P>
	During this process it became apparent that one of the reasons 
for the concern about section 745.6 was that until recently many 
people were unaware of the existence of this provision. For 
example, the families of murder victims often find out about 
section 745.6 through the media many years after the trial and 
conviction of the offender. This late discovery leads to a sense of 
surprise and betrayal. It reopens old wounds.
<P>
	The sense of surprise and betrayal was evident in the testimony 
of many of the victims who appeared before the House of 
Commons Standing Committee on Justice and Legal Affairs and 
the Standing Senate Committee on Legal and Constitutional 
Affairs when these committees considered Bill C-45.
<P>
	As a result of listening to this concern, on February 27, 1997 the 
Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada announced that 
he had written to his colleagues, the provincial attorneys general, to 
ask them to issue instructions to their crown attorneys that the 
families of victims were to be advised of the existence and the 
effect of section 745.6 at the time of sentencing in all appropriate 
murder cases.
<P>
	By implementing this simple and practical procedure we can 
ensure the families of victims are never caught by surprise by the 
existence of section 745.6 again.
<P>
	Sadly there are people sitting in the House who would rather 
muddy the waters with half-truths than come out with what exactly 
happened in the amendment of the legislation.
<P>
	I am delighted the hon. member for Sarnia-Lambton was here 
at the beginning of this afternoon's debate to set the record straight.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jack Ramsay (Crowfoot, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I listened to 
the brief comments of the member opposite. She referred to the 
reasonable prospect of success. That is rather an ambiguous term 
which has not be defined.
<P>
	It reminds me a little of the relativity of medical and other 
information as contained in Bill C-46 wherein sexual assault 
victims will now be protected. Any information they might have 
granted or given to a doctor, a counsellor or whomever will be 
protected and will be denied to defence counsel unless the relativity 
of the evidence is established in the mind of the court.
<P>
	Professional witnesses appeared and told us that the courts, 
without any question, were considering the relativity of 
information. They are not willing to leave out any information so 
relativity is a matter of speculation from their point of view.
<P>
	We are faced with the same thing. What judge would say 
whether or not there is a reasonable prospect of success? All the 
applicant has to do is create a doubt in the mind of the judge as to 
whether or not there is a reasonable prospect of success. We will 
have as many different definitions of that as we have judges sitting 
on the cases.
<P>
	Does Clifford Olson have a reasonable prospect of success? I do 
not know. There are some judges who might say yes to that. He 
would not have in my mind. He would not have in the mind of the 
victims. He very well may find judges who will not take the onus of 
responsibility but will leave it to a judge and jury to hear the whole 
of the evidence and view it from stem to stern.
<P>
	By relying on the second level or another level of appeal in Bill 
C-45 is unproven. It is untested.
<P>
<B>(1600 )</B>
<P>
	Perhaps the hon. member would like to comment on that, 
bearing in mind the evidence that was submitted before the 
standing committee on Bill C-46 with respect to the judges simply 
saying any evidence might be relative to the defence.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Clancy:</B> Mr. Speaker, I am of course to delighted comment 
on the hon. member's comment.
<P>
	I would first like to say that I was slightly confused by his 
comments at the beginning with respect to the theory of relativity, 
but realizing that the hon. member is not Einstein I was soon 
reassured. I suspect he meant relevance, but we will see.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8849"> 8849 </A></B>
<P>
	As to his worry about the judges of the various courts across 
this land being loath to make decisions, I can only say that 
certainly has not been my experience. I would go to my colleague, 
the hon. member for Sarnia-Lambton, and suggest that probably 
is not his experience either. Judges, when they are put on the 
bench, wish to make decisions based upon their considerable 
knowledge and ability, which is the reason they were put on the 
bench in the first place.
<P>
	If the hon. member has no faith in judges, if he clearly has no 
faith in governments, if he has no faith in anyone, why is he here? 
Why bother to take part in a process that he thinks is totally 
irrelevant, or should I say irrelative?
<P>
	I have come forward to attempt to allay some of the wilder 
theories about this legislation. I think I have done so. I know that 
the hon. member for Sarnia-Lambton has done so. I would 
suggest that comments such as the ones we have just been 
subjected to come more under the heading of sour grapes than they 
do the theory of relativity.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. François Langlois (Bellechasse, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to also speak to an issue that has been dealt with widely and 
at length during the 35th Parliament, that is section 745 of the 
Criminal Code, and I would say, the Criminal Code in general, 
because this Parliament will go down in history as one of those that 
legislated the most with regard to criminal law.
<P>
	We may have opposite views on section 745, as did my 
honourable friend from Charlevoix, who voted in favour of Bill 
C-234 that was introduced by our colleague from 
York-South-Weston and that called for the repeal of section 745, 
while others voted against it. I will come back later to the bill 
introduced by the hon. member for York-South-Weston.
<P>
	I must first give some historical background to show how section 
745 is neither fish nor fowl. These things sometimes happen in the 
Criminal Code. As we pointed out when Bill C-45 was introduced, 
this provision is somewhat peculiar.
<P>
	Let us go back to 1967, 30 years ago. Since you were a young 
attorney at the time, you probably recall, Mr. Speaker, that the 
Criminal Code of Canada provided that capital murder was 
punishable by death. As a matter of fact, there had been no 
execution in Canada since December 6, 1962.
<P>
	Using the royal prerogative, the government had systematically 
commuted the death sentences, the hanging sentences, one of the 
most infamous being that of Wilbert Coffin, in Quebec, who had 
been sentenced to death for murders committed in the 
Murdochville area, in the Gaspé region, after a trial that had left 
people with a bitter taste. At the time, people were not quite sure if 
Wilbert Coffin was really guilty.
<P>
	I would say that Wilbert Coffin's execution in 1956 triggered the 
abolition of the death penalty in Canada, since it was one of the last 
times a person was sentenced to death and executed in Canada after 
a superior court trial that was never reviewed on its own merits by a 
court of appeal or by the Supreme Court of Canada.
<P>
<B>(1605)</B>
<P>
	It is somewhat disquieting to see a man deprived of the most 
basic right he possesses, the right to live, by the judgment of a 
single court, under circumstances that are a matter of concern, to 
say the very least.
<P>
	In 1967, the federal lawmakers intervened in order to 
temporarily abolish the death penalty, for five years. There was no 
longer any need to use the royal prerogative, which had already 
been used an nauseam, to commute sentences.
<P>
	People of my generation will recall the Léopold Dion case in the 
early 1960s. He was found guilty of the murder of a young child, 
and was apparently guilty of three other child murders as well, but 
the death penalty was not applied. It thus became unthinkable for 
that penalty to be applied to lesser cases in future.
<P>
	The government of the day introduced a bill to suspend the death 
penalty for five years. Theoretically, it was revived briefly for a 
few months after that, until the House passed another bill, again for 
a five year moratorium, if I can use that word in this context.
<P>
	This brings us up to the spring of 1976. The Trudeau government 
did promote certain human values. On constitutional issues, there 
is nearly universal agreement that his administration was a failure 
and a similar argument could be made in other areas as well, but in 
criminal matters or matters of criminal law, it certainly did 
promote such values. That must be said, all partisan considerations 
aside. Let us think, for example, of the reforms that abolished 
whipping, the reforms that enabled people taken into custody who 
were without assets to be released without having to post a cash 
bond, as they had had to in the past. Between 1970 and 1980, 
persons under the jurisdiction of the courts-in other words, all of 
us-saw their rights improved as far as criminal law was 
concerned.
<P>
	Another Liberal government, the one we have during this 35th 
Parliament, has succeeded in virtually undoing everything the 
previous government had accomplished. We have seen the hon. 
member for Notre-Dame-de-Grâce, a former Liberal cabinet 
member, vote against this legislation, as very few others did. I 
believe that the hon. member for Kingston and the Islands also did, 
a few times, even on section 745, the object of today's motion 
before the House.
<P>
	To put ourselves back in context, here we are in the spring of 
1976, and the government is introducing a bill to definitively-I 
nearly said <I>sine die</I>-abolish the death penalty in Canada. Howev-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8850"> 8850 </A></B>
<P>
er, the government realized it  did not have the majority it needed in 
the House to pass the bill. It was supposedly a free vote, although 
members of cabinet were expected to toe the government line, but 
it seems they were short five or six votes. Not all historians agree, 
but it was less than ten votes.
<P>
	That is when the Trudeau government, which had not included 
section 745 in its initial bill, negotiated an unlikely compromise. 
To buy, or should I say obtain, the consent of some reluctant 
members, who with a little arm twisting could be persuaded to 
adjust their consciences accordingly, the government moved an 
amendment.
<P>
	The amendment provided a minimum prison sentence of 25 
years for a person sentenced to the maximum for first degree 
murder-in other words, life-before becoming eligible for parole. 
For second degree murder, the offender had to serve a minimum of 
ten years, depending on the court's decision.
<P>
	However, since this was a concession to the hard liners, the 
government added a sweetener elsewhere for in the bill. The 
sweetener was section 745, which allowed offenders sentenced to 
more than 15 years imprisonment-which means all those who are 
convicted of first degree murder and second degree murder and 
have to serve a minimum of 15 years-to apply, after 15 years, to a 
judge of the Superior Court of a province, not just any judge but the 
chief justice, asking him to empanel a jury.
<P>
<B>(1610)</B>
<P>
	The judge has no choice, he has to empanel a jury, two thirds of 
which make a recommendation. No decision is even made. Before 
being amended by Bill C-45 in this legislature, section 745 
provided that two thirds of the jury made a recommendation.
<P>
	If the jury recommended parole, the inmate was not 
automatically freed, he could simply apply to the Parole Board. It 
was a stage allowing him to go to another door, and, with the time it 
takes in our legal system, the inmate could spend several months 
behind bars before being denied parole.
<P>
	And then we had in this legislature Bill C-234, introduced by the 
hon. member for York-South-Weston, which proposed the 
repeal of section 745 of the Criminal Code. Everyone in opposition 
supported a review of section 745, given the circumstances of its 
creation and the fact that it had been in effect for 20 years. This is 
why we agreed to its review.
<P>
	We did not agree to much else. Bill C-234, however, was clear at 
least; section 745 would be removed from the Criminal Code. You 
could agree or disagree. It was a free vote, because it was a private 
member's bill. In our party, most of the members were opposed. As 
I mentioned earlier, our colleague from Charlevoix voted for Bill 
C-234. Whether we agree with it or not, Bill C-234 takes an honest 
approach in that it is unequivocal: either section 745 goes or it 
stays.
<P>
	At second reading, the government let the House vote 
overwhelmingly for Bill C-234 to go forward, only to let it get 
buried and die in committee as most private member's bills do. The 
government itself came back with Bill C-45.
<P>
	To all intents and purposes, Bill C-45 repeals section 745 of the 
Criminal Code. Why? Because the criteria set in 1976 would now 
be much more difficult to meet, because they have been changed 
and the mark is definitely set much higher.
<P>
	From now on, any inmate who wants to apply for early release 
under section 745 of the Criminal Code after serving 15 years, 
inasmuch as 15 years can be considered as early, will be required to 
first apply to a superior court judge, a modern day judge as 
appointed under the Constitution, and satisfy the judge that, at least 
on the face of it, there is a reasonable chance for his application to 
successfully be submitted to a jury.
<P>
	Before, all inmates had to do was to apply to the chief justice of 
the province's superior court or supreme court and a jury had to be 
empanelled. Now, a judge designated by the superior court must at 
least consider written evidence. Because the common law is quite 
liberal in that regard, the judge may decide to hold a hearing if the 
court so pleases.
<P>
	How much of an onus of proof will be borne by inmates? We 
cannot tell yet, because this particular provision has not really been 
challenged in court. We do not have jurisprudence to guide us in 
this matter; time will tell how much evidence our courts will 
require.
<P>
	As I pointed out repeatedly at the Standing Committee on Justice 
and Legal Affairs, I fear this legislation might be applied 
differently in different regions of this country, depending on 
whether, where the judge is from, people do not put much faith in 
rehab or whether the circumstances of the crime for which the 
inmate is doing time are particularly aggravating, the judge could 
be tempted not to allow the case to proceed in the first instance.
<P>
<B>(1615)</B>
<P>
	It is also more difficult to get a recommendation under section 
745, since each and every member of the jury must now be 
convinced, as opposed to only two thirds of them. This unanimity 
rule works well, for the purpose of determining guilt, when it is 
used in conjunction with the notion of reasonable doubt. Under our 
legal system, guilt must be proven beyond a reasonable doubt. This 
is why a jury's guilty verdict must be unanimous.
<P>
	In our provincial courts, which deal with civil matters, it is not 
necessary to prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. There must 
merely be a preponderance of evidence, and a jury is not required 
to make a unanimous decision. Generally speaking, civil courts use 
the two thirds rule, as it was applied in Quebec until 1976, when 
civil trials by jury were abolished. Under that rule, it is  enough to 
get four out of six jury members to agree. In a civil trial, it is 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8851"> 8851 </A></B>
<P>
money, not the life or the freedom of a person, that is at stake, and 
the burden of proof is different.
<P>
	But here the more strict criterion is used, the one that usually 
applies to the determination of guilt, and only for the purpose of a 
recommendation. This is wrong. Using the two thirds rule seemed 
quite appropriate and did not appear to pose any problems. We 
made a strong plea in committee to allow the victims, or those who 
represent them, to be heard when an application is made either 
before the jury, or before the National Parole Board, so that the 
board or jury members can have all the available information, 
including the views of the victims and their families and how they 
were affected.
<P>
	The hon. member for Crowfoot explained on several occasions 
in this House that he has confidence in the jury system, provided 
members of the jury have all the facts. I agree with him. Jury 
members must have all the facts so they can render a fair and 
logical decision.
<P>
	The bill that was passed, C-45, does not, in my opinion, allow 
enough information to be made available to the jury making the 
decision, to the judge authorizing procedures, or to the National 
Parole Board.
<P>
	Finally, an additional condition Bill C-45 imposed that did not 
exist before is that, in the case of multiple murders, an offender is 
not eligible to apply under section 745.
<P>
	At first blush, one might say this was a good change, because 
section 745 is not for serial killers. But someone who has 
committed more than one murder is not necessarily a serial killer, 
someone who enjoys killing for money or some other form of 
remuneration. It could be someone who has held up a bank and 
killed two people while doing so. Such an individual is no longer 
eligible for parole; he must serve his 25 years.
<P>
	I think that Bill C-45 was an awkward attempt by the 
government to keep everyone happy by telling hardliners: ``You 
see, we have, to all intents and purposes, repealed the provisions 
regarding release after 15 years'', while saying to those who are 
more liberal, with a capital L: ``Look, we believe in rehabilitating 
offenders, because we are still letting them apply after 15 years, if 
their behaviour has been good''.
<P>
<B>(1620)</B>
<P>
	What I say is that a law that does not apply in the same way in 
Vancouver, Edmonton, Quebec City and Halifax is a bad law. For 
once, we have the jurisdiction to take action; nobody is questioning 
the jurisdiction of the federal Parliament over criminal law. It 
would be interesting not to have to speak about the Constitution 
today, because it is clear in our law, in section 91 of the Canadian 
Constitution, 1867, that criminal law is a federal responsibility. I 
say that the federal Parliament should have given more thought to 
the equality of  application of the new section 745 as amended by 
Bill C-45.
<P>
	There may be recourse under the equality provisions of section 
15 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms if someone is 
treated differently, if statistics show that people in Quebec are 
systematically released after 15 years, while those in Edmonton are 
not. Is there inequality? I think they have opened a Pandora's box 
of challenges, constitutional challenges.
<P>
	But I would rather have seen them go with the vote on Bill 
C-234. That bill was clear and we would not have been in the 
convoluted situation we are in now.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I want 
to thank the member for his thoughtful comments on the motion. It 
demonstrates how there are real issues to be discussed and 
dimensions and complexities which have to be looked at very 
carefully.
<P>
	Clearly the position of the law prior to the amendments under 
745, which only required two-thirds of a review panel to provide 
for consideration for early parole, was dealt with in the revisions. 
Now, as the member well knows, there is a provision for the judge 
to stop the process even before it gets to that review panel. Now it 
requires the unanimous consent of the 12 member panel before an 
application can be made to the parole board.
<P>
	I just want to thank the member, although I do not agree with all 
of his points, for being thoughtful and constructive and not pulling 
the same kind of approach that others might have chosen.
<P>
	The question I have for the member has to do with the 
description and insinuation the member made that somehow at the 
end of 15 years the prisoner can get out. I think the member will 
know, as he has probably done his homework, that 15 years is the 
point at which one can apply but the reality is that the time at which 
a person might get out under the provisions could be as late as in 
the 22nd or 23rd year of their sentence.
<P>
	Would the member please confirm and not leave the impression 
that it is 15 years and a person is out and that there really is a period 
during which consideration might be given to some measure of 
control.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Langlois:</B> Mr. Speaker, the hon. member for Mississauga 
South has touched on an important point.
<P>
	He will allow me to point out that in 1976, when section 745 was 
adopted, the average length of detention for capital murder in 
Canada was 13.2 years. The penalty for what was later to be called 
first degree murder had, therefore, been made far more severe.
<P>
	In my opinion, then, those trying to prove that sentences have 
got lighter are barking up the wrong tree,  or else I have a poor 
understanding of the history of our Criminal Code. Perhaps I need 
someone else to explain it to me, but since 1976 sentences have 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8852"> 8852 </A></B>
<P>
become harsher, given that there has been no death penalty since 
1962.
<P>
	From 1962 to 1976, however, the length of time a person was 
imprisoned for capital murder, premeditated murder, or murder in 
the first degree, was barely over 13 years.
<P>
<B>(1625)</B>
<P>
	We now have a formal guarantee that the minimum is 15 years. I 
am convinced that, with the present wording of section 745, it will 
be much more, in the order of 20 or 25 years. So people must stop 
circulating this false idea that sentences are getting lighter.
<P>
	Personally, I am an abolitionist, having assumed in my own life, 
as well as in the lives of those I have had a hand in educating, that 
killing someone to teach him that murder was unacceptable was no 
way to teach anyone anything. A second execution, even in the 
name of the state, makes no positive contribution. More people are 
left to mourn, more wounds are opened, and I cannot morally 
support the way things were done in the past.
<P>
	Times have changed, and fortunately things are different today. 
But we are still faced with the problem of section 745, because this 
is what today's motion is about. It is not settled. This debate will 
probably turn into an endless one, to be started up again every time 
it is necessary.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jack Ramsay (Crowfoot, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like 
to thank our colleague from the Bloc for his comments. He is a 
member of the justice committee and I have always appreciated his 
participation on that committee.
<P>
	Very quickly, the question for the hon. member is when will the 
families of the victims ever have peace of mind? The first shock 
comes when they lose a child. The second shock comes during the 
lengthy court hearing. And 15 years later all that is reawakened 
with the third shock.
<P>
	Following that, if the application is not successful, the shocks 
can come in rapid succession every two or three years or whenever. 
When are the families entitled to peace of mind?
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Langlois:</B> Mr. Speaker, the hon. member for Crowfoot 
asked a perfectly legitimate question which, to all intents and 
purposes, I answered in my 20-minute speech just now when I said 
victims must be heard.
<P>
	The problem today is, when are the victims included in the 
process? At the trial, when the evidence is heard and they are asked 
to testify, but afterwards they are dropped,  just when they need the 
support of society. They have suffered the loss of a dear one who is 
irreplaceable.
<P>
	Of course, just attending the hearing provided under section 745 
may be stressful. I realize that, and you may rest assured I have 
every sympathy for the victims.
<P>
	However, after hearing the victims and giving them the broadest 
possible hearing and every facility for making themselves heard, 
both by the jury and the National Parole Board-that is where the 
problem is, in my opinion-when the process is finished, we must 
rely on an impartial body, in my opinion the jury, and ultimately 
the National Parole Board, to determine whether or not the offender 
should be released.
<P>
	Notwithstanding the grief and pain of the victims and their right 
to show that pain and to be heard, the decision is not up to them. 
They cannot distance themselves. They are too involved 
emotionally. But as long as we do not give victims and their 
families a better chance to be heard and to explain their personal 
grief and that of their family and their friends, and how this has 
affected their lives, to be heard by the National Parole Board and 
the juries empanelled under section 745, we will not be on the right 
track, because these people will be frustrated, and rightly so, 
because of what can happen to them under the present rule of law.
<P>
	That is why I say the Bill C-45 has solved nothing and we must 
keep fighting for victims' right to be heard.
<P>
<B>(1630)</B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George-Peace River, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, very quickly so that the hon. member from the Bloc will 
have a chance to respond, the point that we are trying to make here 
today is that we are dealing here with first degree, premeditated, 
cold blooded, planned murder. That is what we are dealing with.
<P>
	We are saying that those types of criminals do not deserve to 
have any hope of getting out of jail before 25 years. If we look at 
Olson's crimes, they were certainly first degree murder. I would 
question anybody who could dispute that.
<P>
	In light of that, why is section 745 still in place to give those 
types of criminals the hope of early parole?
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Langlois:</B> Mr. Speaker, I think the member for Prince 
George-Peace River is asking the right question. Our answers 
would be different. I say that there will always be an exception. If 
the law does not provide for an exception, there should be recourse 
to royal prerogative to allow people to go free, as had to be done in 
Quebec City.
<P>
	A 62-year-old was sentenced for first degree murder-a crime of 
passion obviously. The jury, however, felt that there was enough 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8853"> 8853 </A></B>
<P>
vidence for a sentence of first degree  murder, with the individual 
having to remain in prison until the age of 89, before release. The 
individual was released through royal prerogative.
<P>
	There will always be an exception. If there were only to be a few 
exceptions, our laws should provide for certain release 
mechanisms.
<P>
	Obviously, in cases like those cited by the hon. member, where 
the evidence speaks for itself, there would simply be no parole. 
And I have every confidence in the jury system and in the 
procedure in place to ensure this never happens.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Ms. Paddy Torsney (Burlington, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, we have a 
fine tradition that usually when members rise on a bill they say it is 
their pleasure to rise. It is with great sadness that I rise today to 
respond to this motion urging the government to apologize to the 
families of murder victims for not repealing section 745.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ramsay:</B> Why?
<P>
	<B>Ms. Torsney:</B> Thank you, Mr. Ramsay. My sadness is-
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Will all hon. members please refer to 
each other by the names of their ridings rather than by their last 
names, first names or middle names.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Torsney:</B> Mr. Speaker, duly chastised. To the member for 
Crowfoot I was going to explain why I have sadness. It is actually 
on three points. It is with great sadness for the victims, for the 
families of the victims who have experienced pain in the past. It is 
with great sadness that the Reform Party has given a media 
platform to Mr. Olson, which is something I am sure he is very 
happy to have.
<P>
	I speak with great sadness because the opposition parties are 
exploiting the pain and suffering, knowing full well that legislation 
could not have stopped this hearing from happening this week, that 
no one can go back in time and change the rules under which 
somebody was convicted. I have great sympathy for the families of 
the murder victims. No one in our society should suffer such 
violent and tragic loss.
<P>
	It is interesting that today we are debating a piece of legislation 
that only affects those who are victims of murder and yet when the 
Reform Party is called on to enact other legislation it votes against 
it, legislation which would be hate crimes prosecuted with a 
heavier length of sentence, measures like gun control, something 
that was asked for by victims.
<P>
	Section 745, unfortunately one of the members opposite 
misunderstood, also affects those who are convicted of second 
degree murder and had a lengthier sentence imposed on them.
<P>
	Section 745 will not address the loss that the victims are feeling. 
We have taken appropriate measures to address the issue. In all our 
considerations we have been  made aware that victims must be 
included in the process, that we cannot exacerbate the pain and 
indeed our awareness of victims' concerns has prompted action on 
many concerns. As I have already mentioned, Bill C-45 affects not 
just the victims of that crime but all the people who are victims 
around that crime.
<P>
	This government has done a great deal to address the concerns of 
victims of crime and to facilitate their participation in the criminal 
justice system. Government has responded and will continue to 
respond to a trend to be more responsive to victims. It did not start 
with the Reform Party's coming to this House. It has come up many 
times before. Almost a year ago the government and all its 
members responded with overwhelming support to a motion to ask 
the Standing Committee on Justice and Legal Affairs to consider 
the issues of national legislation to provide for victims' rights.
<P>
<B>(1635)</B>
<P>
	In lending support to a national bill, which I assume suggests 
some federal legislation, we must be careful not to prescribe rights 
which the federal government has no jurisdiction over and no 
authority to enforce. Our actions speak louder than words. Setting 
out principles and calling them rights which could not be 
effectively enforced would be pointless and likely more frustrating 
than beneficial for victims. Rather, we should direct our energy at 
addressing specific issues we have the power to address.
<P>
	Colleagues and viewers should know that recommendations for a 
victims bill of rights are not novel. This debate has been ongoing 
since the mid-1980s. Ever since the American Congress passed a 
federal victims bill of rights, many Canadians have advocated that 
we follow suit. It is difficult to disagree with a victims bill of 
rights, but we should ensure the victims of crime will benefit from 
such a bill before we enact it.
<P>
	We have had this discussion at the federal level and at the 
provincial level. In a report to the ministers of justice of the 
federal-provincial task force on justice for victims of crime in 
1983, the federal government, the provinces and the territories 
engaged in ongoing consultation. They have continued consult with 
regard to improvements to the criminal justice system that would 
benefit victims of crime within their respective areas of 
responsibility. These consultations have squarely addressed the 
enactment of a victims bill of rights. However, the time has come 
to revisit the issue.
<P>
	Much has happened in the last 10 years to improve the victim's 
role in the criminal justice system. In 1985, as many will know, 
Canada co-sponsored the United Nations statement on basic 
principles of justice for victims of crime. Canadian listeners can be 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8854"> 8854 </A></B>
<P>
proud that Canada's justice system already reflected those 
principles in 1985 and will continue to do so into the 21st century.
<P>
	In any event, the UN declaration prompted the federal and 
provincial governments to re-examine the issue of a victims bill of 
rights. While all the provinces and the federal government were 
sincerely committed to making changes to the justice system, it 
was recognized that certain concerns could only be addressed by 
provincial legislation and that other concerns could be addressed 
by federal legislation. The majority of the concerns cannot be 
addressed in legislation at all but by changing attitudes about the 
role of the victim in the process and about the basic human values 
of dignity and respect.
<P>
	When we consider the role of victims in the justice system we 
also have to think about a meaningful mechanism to enforce their 
rights. Rights without remedies cannot truly be said to be rights. 
For instance, if a bill of rights states that victims have the right to 
receive timely information about the status of an investigation or 
about the prosecution of an offender, what is the remedy if they feel 
they have not received timely information? Who is responsible? 
Likely the police and/or the crown, but is it reasonable to expect 
that a single piece of legislation can assign obligations to different 
participants in the justice system that play distinct roles and are 
employed by separate ministries? Moreover, what is the remedy? 
Should the prosecution be called off because the victim did not get 
their information?
<P>
	What we can do is prescribe in our justice system a set of 
principles to guide the players. We can continue to encourage them 
to adhere to those principles of our criminal justice system that 
deserve the utmost consideration at all stages of the process.
<P>
	The federal government is responsible for the enacting of 
criminal law while the provinces are generally responsible for the 
enforcement of the law, the prosecution of the offences and the 
administration of justice in the province. We opted among 
ourselves for a statement of principles to recognize the need for 
joint action and co-operation.
<P>
	In 1988 the federal and provincial governments at a meeting of 
justice ministers endorsed the Canadian statement of basic 
principles of justice for victims of crime. The notion of a statement 
rather than a bill of rights addressed both the jurisdictional and 
practical concerns. All jurisdictions would ensure that whatever 
initiatives they pursued would reflect these principles, whether in 
policy or in legislation.
<P>
	Since 1988, all provinces and both territories have enacted 
victim legislation which does refer to these principles. I will not go 
through all the principles as I am sharing my time with the member 
for Simcoe North. It is important today for us to reflect on the 
changes to section 745 and how victims will be brought into that 
process.
<P>
<B>(1640)</B>
<P>
	It is important to know that Bill C-45 has changed the judicial 
review process. It established a judicial review so that it will 
eliminate frivolous cases. It also went further. If you do go before a 
judge and jury there must be a unanimous jury decision and if more 
than one individual has been killed there will be no process for you.
<P>
	The provincial attorneys general have been communicated with 
and have been instructed to ensure that upon application, a notice 
will go out to all the victims and they will be called on to attend so 
that they are not surprised, as some members opposite have 
suggested. These are exceptional cases and I think we need to be 
aware of the issues.
<P>
	It was raised earlier that the faint hope clause was a sure thing 
and that everybody gets out in 15 years. I thought it might be 
helpful to have some information from one of the practitioners in 
our criminal law system, someone who has been on both sides, the 
crown and defence, my constituent, Mr. Geoffrey Manishen, with 
the firm of Ross, McBride and Hamilton.
<P>
	When he came to committee he said: ``Practically speaking, you 
cannot start the process until the criminal has done 15 years. In 
most jurisdictions by the time he goes through his application there 
is a judge appointed, they have the preliminary inquiry, they have 
the day scheduled for the hearing and they have a hearing with the 
parole eligibility report prepared along the way. It is not 15 years 
but now that whole process is 16 years. Even if the parole 
eligibility was reduced right to 16 years, and it is not, we would go 
through at least 2 to 3 years of graduated release from unescorted 
temporary absences to day parole before ultimately getting full 
parole''.
<P>
	It is also important that when the people came before our 
committee to testify on Bill C-45 they described another factor 
which the party opposite has refused to discuss. It is selective in its 
choice of victims. The victims who want this section repealed, it is 
willing to talk about; the victims who want gun control, for some 
reason it was not able to address their concerns. Maybe there needs 
to be some reminder about the other victims who are out there.
<P>
	Mr. Partington, who has worked in correctional services for a 
number of years and has done section 745 applications, said: 
``When you sit in a courtroom trial, on one side you have the 
victim's family, the deceased's family, and on the other side you 
have the offender's family who has spent 15 or 16 years as victims 
of the same offence, I suppose the forgotten victims. Their 
perspective is somewhat different. They still have a son or a 
daughter to visit with, to celebrate birthdays and so on. Yes, they 
still have him alive but they are as victimized in some ways as the 
deceased. I think it is important to keep the balance''.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8855"> 8855 </A></B>
<P>
	To members opposite, we have to make some changes that go 
forward. We now have victim impact statements in our legislation 
for sentencing and those are considered. Members need to realize 
that if that is what victims want, to stop at that process and not 
come back to a hearing 15 or 20 years later, and in some cases 
like the Olson case that would not occur, those statements will 
serve in the consideration and that if the victims do not want to 
testify, they do not have to come forward. Their statements will 
stand.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jack Ramsay (Crowfoot, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I appreciate 
the energy my hon. colleague across the way always devotes to her 
efforts. I find that she does not support our proposal or our position 
that we want to eliminate section 745 completely from the 
Criminal Code and yet she stood in this House and voted to do that 
very thing when the private member's bill submitted by the 
member for York South-Weston was voted on.
<P>
	Over 70 members of the Liberal Party joined Reformers in 
support of that bill. She has made a turnabout and she is quite 
satisfied now with something that is much less, something that is 
watered down and something that has allowed and will continue to 
allow the families to suffer and have their agony relived over and 
over again. She might want to comment on that turnabout.
<P>
	I was surprised and pleased when I saw her and her colleagues 
standing and voting for what I think they know the vast majority of 
Canadians support and would like to see brought forward. I am sure 
that the discipline within her party has simply caused her to vote 
along party lines and reject the private member's bill that she 
originally supported. She might want to comment on that and give 
the people of her riding and the people of Canada an explanation 
why she did that.
<P>
<B>(1645)</B>
<P>
	She criticized the Reform Party for bringing the Olson disgrace 
to a public forum. I suppose she would have the same criticism for 
Mike Duffy of CTV television who devoted almost his program 
yesterday airing this very issue, the absurdity of the Olson 
application. People like Michael Harris appeared on that program 
to express their dismay and outrage over this kind of an application 
being allowed to proceed under the law. She might like to consider 
that as well.
<P>
	We are providing a platform for public debate, representing the 
views and concerns of the victims and their families. The Liberals 
have provided a platform for Clifford Olson. They have provided 
the platform based in law where he can bring those families back 
into court, cross-examine them and put them through the hell they 
suffered when their children were kidnapped, raped and murdered 
one more time. I would like her to comment on that.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Torsney:</B> Mr. Speaker, I would be happy to comment on 
that.
<P>
	As the member for Crowfoot has quite rightly recognized, I did 
vote for a bill to go to committee and be heard at committee 
because there has been so much misinformation on this section of 
the Criminal Code that I thought it needed to be properly aired.
<P>
	It was not to give Clifford Olson more publicity, not to give the 
multiple killer more publicity as the Reform Party has done by 
choosing today, of all days, to debate this. I did it to make sure that 
the facts get on the record so that people will recognize it is not a 
sure thing and that it is a faint hope and the facts about what time 
people get out of our jails do get out of our jails.
<P>
	It is absolutely paramount that all of the legislation I have been 
involved with has been trying to ensure that more people are not 
victimized. We must work on high risk offender legislation. We 
must work to prevent more people from being victimized in our 
communities. That is my number one goal.
<P>
	I was not here 15 years ago when this legislation was enacted. I 
am not responsible for it. I have worked to change it by voting for 
Bill C-45 and by making sure that when this issue came to 
committee it had a full and fair hearing and a reasonable approach 
was found.
<P>
	I am trying to ensure, in those cases where somebody does not 
need to be in a maximum penitentiary, we can devote those 
resources to crime prevention rather than waste them needlessly.
<P>
	I am concerned that there remains an opportunity for people like 
Leo Rocha. His family had a victim and the family members said: 
``No, we think he should get out at this point''. It was their sister 
who was killed by their father. It is important that we recognize 
they are victims too.
<P>
	If there is a potential for someone to be rehabilitated we should 
not waste resources when those resources could be working to 
ensure crime prevention. We must ensure there are not more 
victims in our communities. That is what I am trying to do.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul DeVillers (Parliamentary Secretary to President of 
the Queen's Privy Council for Canada and Minister of 
Intergovernmental Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the Reform Party 
motion implies that the government has not paid attention to the 
needs of victims of crime and that it has been generally so 
negligent and insensitive that it should formally apologize to the 
families of victims, presumably for its inaction. This criticism is 
unjustified.
<P>
	There are two kinds of actions a government can take to help 
unfortunate victims of crime and their families. First, it can 
implement laws, policies and programs which are directly focused 
on the needs of the families and the victims themselves, for 
example, by giving them information, by allowing them to partici-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8856"> 8856 </A></B>
<P>
pate in the prosecution of offenders through victim impact 
statements, et cetera.
<P>
	The second way a government can show solidarity for crime 
victims is by enacting laws that prevent crimes in the first place, 
that deter criminality and, when crimes do occur, impose tough 
sentences of imprisonment that will keep chronic offenders away 
from potential future victims.
<P>
<B>(1650)</B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Some colleagues talked about murderers, their eligibility for 
parole and the legislation recently passed by this Parliament, but it 
seems to me that today's motion gives us an opportunity to address 
another government bill, which is before us, since it recently came 
back from the Standing Committee on Justice and Legal Affairs. I 
am referring to Bill C-55, concerning high risk offenders, and the 
tools it provides to fight the most serious and violent crimes 
provided for in the Criminal Code after murder.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Bill C-55 is responsive to the demands of victims' rights 
organizations for tough measures. Let me briefly touch on the 
highlights of the bill because it is proof that there is no need for the 
government to apologize to anyone for its anti-crime strategies.
<P>
	The legislation will create a new sentencing category to be called 
the long term offender. This measure targets sex offenders. It will 
allow courts to impose a regular penitentiary sentence on those sex 
offenders. Then if the judge decides to designate the offender as a 
long term offender, he can add up to 10 years of supervision to the 
sentence.
<P>
	I ask colleagues to think about this. Someone who commits the 
offence of sexual assault causing bodily harm might normally 
receive a sentence of say 10 years, but under Bill C-55 the court 
could find him to a long term offender and add 10 more years of 
intensive supervision, thus effectively doubling the period of 
control over the offender by the correctional system.
<P>
	This period of supervision will only begin when the offender has 
completed his full prison sentence. This long term supervision 
period has teeth. It will have conditions attached to it similar to 
parole conditions. These could include, for example, staying away 
from specific past victims and staying away from potential victims 
such as children. They can include a range of reporting and 
treatment requirements, all of which will allow authorities to keep 
very close tabs on the long term offender while hopefully 
encouraging his rehabilitation.
<P>
	Moreover, Bill C-55 creates a new offence of breach of a long 
term supervision order. If the offender breaches one of the 
conditions, the supervisor can bring him into custody and bring 
charges for the new offence.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Some may argue that criminals should be locked up indefinitely. 
In some cases, this can be done. There has been a dangerous 
offender provision in Canadian law since 1976.
<P>
	Since then, this provision was used approximately 186 times and 
it still is successfully used to deal with about 15 new cases every 
year, where offenders are found to be dangerous offenders. 
Dangerous offenders are covered by part XXIV of the Criminal 
Code, which contains a special procedure whereby individuals 
sentenced for a serious personal injury offence, who have 
previously committed similar offences and are likely to reoffend, 
may be locked up indefinitely.
<P>
	This extremely severe sentence is justified not only by the past 
actions of the offender, but also by an observation made at a special 
hearing that the offender poses a constant threat to the community.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	I would also point out that a recent study revealed that 90 per 
cent of the successful dangerous offender applications involve sex 
offenders, those who prey on women and children. The dangerous 
offender law certainly is severe but the Supreme Court of Canada 
has upheld it as a well crafted, legitimate form of sentencing. Bill 
C-55 does not tamper with the core concepts of the dangerous 
offender procedure but it does strengthen it with a few strategic 
amendments.
<P>
	As the law presently stands, a judge who finds the offender to be 
a dangerous offender would normally hand down an indeterminate 
sentence, in effect indefinite confinement, but he can in 
exceptional circumstances impose a sentence for a definite term. A 
federal-provincial task force which reviewed the law concluded 
that it makes little sense for the crown and the court to go through 
the special lengthy dangerous offender process only to obtain the 
same kind of sentence that would have resulted from a normal 
prosecution.
<P>
	Bill C-55 will require the court to impose an indeterminate 
sentence in every instance. This will ensure that these very serious, 
high risk offenders are detained indefinitely.
<P>
<B>(1655)</B>
<P>
	Although these offenders fall into a high risk category, it is still 
important that they receive periodic parole reviews. The current 
law provides for the initial parole review of a dangerous offender to 
occur at the three year point of the sentence with subsequent

<P>
	Bill C-55 will change that initial period review to the seventh 
year. An offender who is sentenced to indeterminate detention 
because of his ongoing dangerousness is unlikely to achieve parole 
after only three years. In fact, the average parole release date for 
dangerous offenders is closer to 14 years.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The new provision regarding long term offenders and the 
improvements to the dangerous offenders legislation will provide 
invaluable tools against violent offenders. We also introduced a 
provision dealing with sexual offenders, as victims rights groups 
had been demanding for a long time.
<P>
	I should point out that the expression ``dangerous or violent 
offender'' includes those who commit crimes of a sexual nature. 
Indeed, sexual crimes are among the crimes for which someone 
may be designated as a violent or dangerous offender. Bill C-55 
provides not only that a person convicted of a sexual crime may be 
designated as a dangerous or violent offender, but also that, if there 
are no reasonable grounds to believe that the offender might be 
found to be a dangerous offender, the court may still designate that 
person as a long term offender.
<P>
	What do victims rights groups have to say about Bill C-55? 
During consideration of Bill C-55 by the Standing Committee on 
Justice, the Canadian Resource Centre for Victims of Crime 
commended the government for its initiatives.
<P>
	As for Victims of Violence, it was pleased by the proposed 
amendments to the legislation on dangerous offenders. This group 
also commended the minister and the government for their 
proposed changes.
<P>
	Jim and Anna Stephenson, whose son was murdered, are well 
aware of the needs of victims' families. They stated that the 
amendments to the existing provisions on dangerous offenders and 
the creation of a long term offender category, as proposed in Bill 
C-55, are major government initiatives. According to them, these 
initiatives will fill significant gaps in the current legislation, thus 
reducing the potential threat posed by violent sexual offenders.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	These are examples of what the government has been doing. I 
reiterate that there is certainly no reason for the government to 
apologize for its crime policies.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jack Ramsay (Crowfoot, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I listened to 
our colleague across the way. When the families of victims 
appeared before the standing committee on Bill C-45 none of them 
agreed in testimony with the position of the government. I am sure 
my hon. colleague who just spoke knows that.
<P>
	When the member makes statements such as those he has made 
today, that the government is doing a good job in this area, the 
question is for whom? Certainly none of  the mothers, who lost 
their children and grandchildren to murderers and who appeared 
before the committee, thought the government was doing a good 
job. None of the hundreds of thousands of people who have written 
and signed petitions opposed to section 745, think the government 
is doing a good job.
<P>
<B>(1700 )</B>
<P>
	Inasmuch as my hon. colleagues have attacked the Reform Party 
for exploiting emotional issues surrounding the issue they are 
mocking, scorning and insulting the victims, the family members, 
the mothers, grandmothers, fathers, aunts and uncles. They are not 
represented by the government side. I have not hear a speaker from 
the government side represent the victims, the families.
<P>
	In view of the concerns and in the view of the opposition, those 
who were able to appear before the justice committee and the 
people of Canada who wrote to us and signed petitions that were 
tabled in the House, how could the member honestly state the 
government is doing a good job in this area?
<P>
	<B>Mr. DeVillers:</B> Madam Speaker, it is very clear the government 
has made the proper amendments to section 745 by the screening 
process and by making it not apply to multiple murders such as Mr. 
Olson who has caused the debate today and by requiring unanimity 
of the jury.
<P>
	Up until now under section 745 it only took two-thirds of the 
jury to allow a reduction in the ineligibility of parole. The 
amendments deal with those three items. They would cover each 
and every one of the situations the Reform Party is complaining 
about today.
<P>
	Reform members complain about a lack of respect. I have a great 
deal of respect for our judicial system. Even more important, I have 
respect for the Canadians who sit on juries and hear the full 
evidence in those cases. As has been pointed out, approximately 78 
per cent of the cases before the court on 745 application receive 
some reduction-they are not all released on to the streets-in their 
ineligibility for parole.
<P>
	I have faith in the Canadian people, something I do not think my 
friends in the Reform Party share.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Leon E. Benoit (Vegreville, Ref.):</B> Madam Speaker, why 
did the solicitor general, earlier in response to a question from me, 
say that he would have made the changes we were pushing for 
except the Bloc prevented it from happening? The solicitor general 
said he was in favour of the changes we are talking about.
<P>
	Does the hon. member opposite support the position of the 
solicitor general on this issue?
<P>
	<B>Mr. DeVillers:</B> Madam Speaker, I am at a disadvantage. I did not 
hear the comments of the solicitor general. I doubt very strongly 
that he said he agreed with the position of the Reform Party.
<P>
	He was likely indicating the amendments to section 745 would 
have been through the House to preclude Mr.  Olson from making 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8858"> 8858 </A></B>
<P>
the application that will be dealt with shortly except that we did not 
receive the co-operation of the Bloc.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George-Peace River, Ref.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, at the outset I would like to say I am splitting my time 
with the hon. member for Comox-Alberni.
<P>
	I thank the hon. member for Crowfoot for bringing forward the 
motion. Unlike the Liberals opposite, I do not believe this is a sad 
day or that the Reform Party is somehow a villain for bringing 
forward the motion. Rather, I believe tomorrow will be a sad day, a 
day of national disgrace for which the Liberal government will be 
held accountable in the next election.
<P>
<B>(1705)</B>
<P>
	We are debating the following motion put forward by my hon. 
colleague from Crowfoot:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That this House recognize that the families of murder victims are subjected to 
reliving the pain and fear of their experience as a result of the potential release of the 
victims' murderers allowed under section 745 of the Criminal Code, and as a 
consequence, this House urge the Liberal Government to formally apologize to those 
families for repeatedly refusing to repeal section 745 of the Criminal Code.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	I wish the Liberal government had paid the attention to the rights 
of victims and to repealing this offensive section of the Criminal 
Code that it has paid to going after legitimate firearms owners. If it 
had put in that type of effort this clause would no longer be there 
for the use of people like Clifford Olson.
<P>
	I quote from an article in yesterday's Vancouver <I>Province</I>. I do 
not think it can be said any better than an unnamed staff reporter 
wrote in yesterday's paper:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Gary and Sharon Rosenfeldt cannot celebrate their wedding anniversary. 
Christmas dinner with the family ends in tears. Their life is a quiet struggle with no 
nights out for movies or dinners. They go to bed thinking how it would be if their 
son, Daryn, was around. Daryn was only 16 when Canada's worst mass murderer 
claimed him as a victim 15 years ago.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>On Tuesday, from the recesses of Canada's most secure prison in Prince Albert, 
Saskatchewan, Clifford Olson will begin a process to say he is a changed man and 
deserves the right of parole.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The Rosenfeldt's know that he will be lying. On their wedding anniversary several 
years ago the mailman delivered a letter to them from their son's killer. It detailed the 
killing and Daryn's last words snuffing out what little joy the Rosenfeldt's had left in 
their lives.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>``We go to bed at night every night thinking about Tuesday's hearing'', says Gary 
Rosenfeldt. ``It takes us back 15 years. It is as simple as that''.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	The article went on further:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Olson, sentenced to life in jail with no hope of parole for 25 years for his killing 
spree, has exercised his right to move his parole hearing forward by 10 years. The 
murderer is owed his  early hearing under section 745 of the Criminal Code, commonly 
known as the faint hope clause.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The Rosenfeldts, along with those families who have chosen to bear witness for 
their children at this week's hearing, will appear at a painful press conference 
tomorrow to remind the world there is not a faint hope in hell that their lives will 
ever be the same.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	As I said at the outset, I do not think it could be said much better 
than that staff reporter in the Vancouver <I>Province</I> said it. As a 
parent of three children I cannot imagine the horror of having to go 
through something like that, of losing a child to someone like 
Clifford Olson. I cannot even begin to comprehend what those 
families have gone through.
<P>
	To have those families relive that horror tomorrow is a national 
disgrace. This psychopath is a man that rehabilitation cannot even 
touch. He cannot be salvaged. He can never live in the community 
again.
<P>
	The chance of Olson getting early parole is about as good as the 
proverbial snowball's chance in hell. In my opinion that is where 
this man belongs. The point is that there is something very wrong 
with the Canadian justice system when a man like Clifford Olson is 
allowed to waste Canadian taxpayers' money strutting his stuff in 
the courtroom.
<P>
	Make no mistake, that is what will happen if he is successful 
tomorrow and is granted a hearing later this summer. The very 
thought of it is an offence to the memory of his victims. They did 
not even get the opportunity to really live. Clifford Olson took that 
away from them.
<P>
	We are talking about a cold-blooded killer who is living in a 
federal institution with more perks than many Canadians have in 
their homes, including 24-hour access to cable TV in his cell.
<P>
<B>(1710)</B>
<P>
	Section 745 has a shady past. It was quietly slipped by Canadians 
in 1976 without any real discussion. The existence of the provision 
is linked to what I would describe as one of the greatest political 
scams of all time. In July 1976, in a fit of political correctness, the 
Liberal government of the day abolished capital punishment 
despite the fact that the majority of Canadians supported the death 
penalty.
<P>
	It was abolished by a margin of only six votes. The trade-off 
offered to Canadians was so-called life in prison. Canadians were 
told that even though murderers would now be allowed to live they 
would at least be put away for 25 years. Then section 745 was 
quietly slipped in and the effect of section 745 gave a new meaning 
to the word life: 15 years. It is a mere drop in the bucket in terms of 
an average person's life. All this was done quietly in the hopes that 
Canadians would not notice that convicted killers were being let 
out of jail after only 15 years.
<P>
	There is more than just a moral issue here. Tied to that is the 
financial issue. The procedure involved in applying for early parole 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8859"> 8859 </A></B>
<P>
is a costly three-stage process. First a judge screens the application. 
Then a jury hears the application. If a jury decides that early parole 
is appropriate the offender can apply to the National Parole Board 
for early release.
<P>
	The jury is not even given the whole story about the crime. All it 
hears is an agreed upon statement of facts. To top it all off, the jury 
makes its decisions based on a lower burden proof than is used in 
criminal trials. There is no need to find beyond a reasonable doubt 
that the offender is not a risk to the community.
<P>
	It is truly disturbing to think of all the financial and human 
resources that go into this joke of a process. Section 745 is called 
the faint hope clause, but when we look at the figures it is not such 
a faint hope after all. As of March 1996 figures show that 78 per 
cent of murderers applying under section 745 had success in either 
getting early parole or having their sentences reduced. That is quite 
a success rate. Even if it is truly only a faint hope provision it is a 
lot more than Clifford Olson ever gave any of his victims.
<P>
	It terrifies Canadians to realize that in the next five years 
between 500 and 600 murderers could get early release and be out 
and about in their communities even with the new changes. If the 
minister really wanted to send a message to multiple murderers 
maybe he should have proposed consecutive sentencing instead of 
the minor changes he made in Bill C-45. At least this would have 
put a value on each and every human life that has been taken.
<P>
	To make matters even more offensive Bill C-45 only applies to 
applications made after September 1996. It is ironic that these 
amendments were only two days late in stopping Clifford Olson 
from applying for early parole. I see my time is up. I could go on 
and on.
<P>
	Let me close by saying that most Canadians, myself included, 
believe that breathing is too good for the likes of Clifford Olson, let 
alone the chance to get out after 15 years.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bill Gilmour (Comox-Alberni, Ref.):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
am pleased to address the Reform motion which proposes:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That this House recognize that the families of murder victims are subjected to 
reliving the pain and fear of their experience as a result of the potential release of the 
victims' murderers allowed under section 745 of the Criminal Code, and as a 
consequence, this House urge the Liberal government to formally apologize to those 
families for repeatedly refusing to repeal section 745 of the Criminal Code.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Section 745 implemented by the Liberal government in 1976 
deals with parole for convicted killers. It provides the notorious 
faint hope clause which enables murderers to apply for a judicial 
review of their case and the option of early parole after completing 
only 15 years of their sentence. Section 745 allows murderers like 
Clifford Olson, who molested and murdered at least 11 innocent  
children, to apply for early parole in only 15 years. Madam 
Speaker, you will notice that a number of my colleagues are 
wearing this ribbon today. On this ribbon are the names of the 11 
victims of Clifford Olson.
<P>
<B>(1715)</B>
<P>
	This week section 745 will be seen in action when the Vancouver 
courthouse initiates the process of Olson's application for early 
release from his life sentence in prison. This is the Liberals' idea of 
justice. It is an absolute travesty. Murderers like Clifford Olson and 
others who have committed horrendous crimes should not be 
allowed to make a mockery of justice.
<P>
	Let me describe Clifford Olson. He is a predatory vulture, a 
slime bag, a scum bag of the lowest order. Look at what he is 
getting through the system. The system is allowing him to come 
forward and have his parole heard.
<P>
	The Liberals have accused us of using this as a media platform. 
We are responding to the platform. That platform was given to 
Olson by the Liberals and the social workers in the system. They 
are defending Clifford Olson. Who is defending the victims, the 
parents of the sons and daughters?
<P>
	Just imagine, Madam Speaker, that you are in a court house. You 
have got Olson standing in front of you and he is cross-examining 
you. What is wrong with that picture? It is absolutely wrong.
<P>
	The majority of Canadians, supported by the Canadian Police 
Association and Victims of Violence all support the elimination of 
section 745. Do not massage it, as the Liberals have done. Get rid 
of it.
<P>
	However, this has fallen on deaf ears. The only change that the 
government has made is to deny multiple murderers section 745. 
What does that say? That means it is okay to kill once. That is just 
sort of a trial. Is this what it is? Give us a break. What has happened 
to our justice system?
<P>
	First degree murderers can still appeal their parole ineligibility 
and apply for parole after serving 15 years of a life sentence with 
no parole for 25 years. Under the absurd law of our land Olson, 
convicted in 1981, still has the government guaranteed right to 
apply for early parole. This is absolutely beyond reason.
<P>
	Why should Olson be given this platform? It is absolutely 
ludicrous. Why should taxpayers have to shell out hundreds of 
thousands of dollars to get him from Saskatchewan to Vancouver, 
to pay for the process? Why should the families of the victims be 
forced to relive their pain?
<P>
	The noon news today had some of those families. The anguish 
and the agony that they have to go through is absolutely wrong. 
What is wrong with our system? That is what we are talking about. 
Olson is the trigger, but the system is what is at fault here. That is 
what has to be  addressed. It is not being addressed by the Liberals 
across the way. They tinker with it but they are not addressing the 
actual problem. It is an absolute public outrage. It it is a public 
disgrace.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8860"> 8860 </A></B>
<P>
	When Clifford Olson was convicted of the murder of 11 children 
he received only one life sentence of 25 years. What happened to 
concurrent sentencing? Eleven victims at 25 years is 275 years. 
What it means, Madam Speaker, is whether you kill one or eleven it 
makes no difference in our system. This is absolute lunacy. Yet this 
is what is going on.
<P>
	Clifford Olson will receive, if he gets out, 1.1 years for each life 
he took. I ask the members across the way, is 1.1 years for every 
child he killed justice? That is a disgrace.
<P>
<B>(1720)</B>
<P>
	The previous speaker said that section 745 was brought in 15 
years ago and it was not her responsibility. Whose responsibility is 
it? She is a member of the government. It was brought in by a 
Liberal government. For God's sake, fix it.
<P>
	The Liberal members, as part of the government, are here to 
change the law of the land. They are not changing it and yet the 
member stood up and said that it was not her responsibility. I ask 
again: Whose is it?
<P>
	First and foremost the goal of sentencing should be the 
protection of the public. That is not happening. It goes back to the 
bill of rights. In this case it could be called the bill of wrongs. That 
is what the bill of rights has done to us. The rights of the criminals 
are addressed but not the rights of the victims, the parents, the 
grandparents, the brothers or the sisters who have to go through the 
anguish time and time again. What is wrong with the laws of this 
land?
<P>
	At present there are about 2,100 killers serving life sentences in 
Canada, which is about 15 per cent of the nation's prison 
population. As of September 1996, 63 cases were heard to reduce 
the term of the sentence. Fifty of the 63 were successful. Fifty of 
the 63 killers had their sentences reduced. What is wrong with this 
picture? Of those 50, two reoffended within a mere nine months.
<P>
	What are we looking at? Is Olson going to be out on the streets? 
Can you imagine that?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> He won't.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilmour:</B> Members opposite are saying that he will not get 
out. That is what the solicitor general said. That is what the 
Minister of Justice said. He should not get out. There should not 
even be an opportunity for him to get out.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Cannis:</B> Nobody believes you any more. Be honest.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilmour:</B> They are sitting there whining and moaning. They 
are trying to defend a law that is not defendable. Fix it. That is why 
we are here today.  Tomorrow this whole platform will move 
forward. It will be an absolute disgrace to Liberals and to 
Canadians.
<P>
	My final words to the Liberals are: Fix it or the Reform Party 
will fix it during the next election.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, as 
this debate winds down things are becoming very clear. I do not 
think anybody in this place does not share the grief and the sorrow 
of the families of victims.
<P>
	I want to tell the truth about a couple of issues which people 
should understand.
<P>
	Number one, under section 745 Clifford Olson could not apply 
today. Members opposite know that, but in the speeches we have 
heard they continue to talk about Clifford Olson. They are cloaking 
themselves in the grief of the victims.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ramsay:</B> Tomorrow he is applying. Tell that to the people of 
Canada.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Harvard:</B> Order. There are a bunch of animals in the House.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Ringuette-Maltais):</B> Can we have a 
little bit of order?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Szabo:</B> Madam Speaker, you can see that when we tell the 
truth it tends to upset the Reform Party.
<P>
	I want to quote from the speech made by the hon. member. He 
wanted to know why we are ``forcing the families of victims to 
relive their pain''.
<P>
<B>(1725 )</B>
<P>
	I do not think anybody here honestly believes the grief and the 
pain that one feels for the loss of the family member is something 
that can be turned on and off. It cannot be turned on and off. There 
is no way that grief can be legislated away. The Reform Party is 
saying to Canadians, here is simple solution to the grief of families 
of victims.
<P>
	I ask the member to be honest with Canadians and to say whether 
he believes that Parliament can legislate away the grief of families 
or whether he would not agree that we have to work to make sure 
we have a strong and safe society, safe homes and safe streets, so 
this grief will not occur in the first instance.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilmour:</B> Madam Speaker, we are talking about honesty 
and grief. The member says that grief cannot be turned on and off. 
That is exactly what this legislation has done. It has dragged the 
whole thing forward 15 years for these families. They are trying to 
put it behind them. They cannot do that because the legislation the 
Liberals now have in place allows for this animal to come forward 
15 years later to make them relive the whole situation. Not only 
that, but Olson gets to cross-examine these people. He gets to 
question them. This is absolute lunacy and it is just inhuman.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8861"> 8861 </A></B>
<P>
	The member said that under the new legislation Olson could 
not apply, which is fine. We asked the members during 
consideration of the legislation to make it retroactive. They knew 
Olson was coming up. The justice minister knew that Olson was 
coming up within a year yet he would not make it retroactive. The 
Liberals are saying that they cannot do it. These are the people 
who make the laws and now they are saying that they cannot do 
it. It is a very selective set of laws.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gordon Kirkby (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Justice and Attorney General of Canada, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, 
the hon. member makes reference to honesty. I want to know when 
it is the correct and predominant view with respect to the law that 
you cannot change section 745 to give it retroactive, retrospective 
effect. After somebody is already in prison you cannot take away 
the right to apply for a section 745 review. Even if we were to 
repeal section 745 today, anybody who is now be in prison at the 
date of the repeal could apply for a hearing. Why does the Reform 
Party not tell this to the victims of crime instead of letting them 
think that if we were to repeal it, it would stop the hearing process 
today?
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Ringuette-Maltais):</B> Resuming 
debate, the hon. member for Saskatoon-Dundurn.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Morris Bodnar (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Industry, Minister for the Atlantic Canada Opportunities 
Agency and Minister of Western Economic Diversification, 
Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, this is a subject that is rather sensitive for 
members of the Reform Party who are so concerned about victims. 
I find it rather interesting that the last member to speak, the 
member for Comox-Alberni, said that section 745-
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilmour:</B> Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of order. My 
understanding of the rules is that when I am asked a question I 
should have the opportunity to respond.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Ringuette-Maltais):</B> The time for 
questions and answers had expired. We now continue on to debate.
<P>
<B>(1730 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hermanson:</B> Madam Speaker, I would like a clarification 
from the Chair. Previously, Speakers have indicated how much 
time the questioner has to make his questions or comments and has 
indicated that the time must be shared evenly between the person 
who has questions or comments and the person who has made the 
speech so that they have equal time to answer the question. That 
did not occur in the case of my colleague from Comox-Alberni. I 
would like to understand why the rules were not followed in this 
instance.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Ringuette-Maltais):</B> The rules of 
this House are always followed by the Chair. The rules have been 
followed and there is no written rule  concerning what you have 
just raised. We are now resuming debate.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bodnar:</B> Madam Speaker, as I was saying when I began 
speaking, the hon. member for Comox-Alberni had indicated that 
section 745 allows Clifford Olson to apply for early parole. He said 
that a few times in his speech but it is absolutely not true. That is 
the misrepresentation that we are getting from the Reform Party. It 
is absolutely not true. It allows him to apply so that he can become 
eligible to apply. There is a big difference. It is not a parole 
application.
<P>
	However, that is too much for the members of the Reform Party 
to comprehend. They have never decided to deal with reason. Of 
course Reform Party members claim to act on behalf of victims. 
They claim they deal with the victims. Do they not realize that 
Clifford Olson after 25 years can still apply for parole? They do not 
seem to realize that.
<P>
	There is room to manoeuvre in this whole area of dealing with 
section 745. Unfortunately it is quite difficult for the members of 
the Reform Party to deal with this area.
<P>
	Let me suggest a solution to this whole matter. Unfortunately it 
appears that many of them will not be listening. That is fine, they 
can read it in <I>Hansard</I> some other day. Section 745 perhaps should 
be abolished in the future. It is something we should look at. I 
suggest that we take a serious look at abolishing section 745. The 
amendments that were made by the hon. Minister of Justice were 
good amendments and a good first step that we had to take.
<P>
	However, getting rid of 745 does not end the whole matter. There 
has to be a step that takes place at the same time with the abolition 
of 745, returning discretion to the judges. We have to return 
discretion to the judges in the sentencing process. If we do not 
return discretion injustices occur. I will use a couple of examples to 
illustrate the problems that result.
<P>
	Most recently there was a case in Saskatchewan, which I am sure 
hon. members are all aware of, in which a person was convicted of 
murder for having put his daughter to death because of his belief in 
her suffering as a result of illness. The judge in the case should 
have had the discretion to determine whether that individual would 
be eligible for parole on a second degree charge in 10 years time, 
for a first degree murder charge in 25 years, or whether he should 
reduce it. Maybe he should reduce it to two years, three years or 
four years, but he should have the discretion to vary from those 
numbers because we could have an injustice occur. All fact 
situations are not the same in murder cases.
<P>
	Heaven forbid that they reoccur, but they seem to, in cases like 
Olson and Bernardo, the judge should have been able to say ``I 
sentence you to life imprisonment  with no parole for life''. There 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8862"> 8862 </A></B>
<P>
is no application for parole and no parole application can ever be 
made.
<P>
	Reform members never suggest this. They simply tell us to get 
rid of section 745. They never mention this second step. That is 
what we need. We need this second step. They will probably leave 
the House and try to take credit for such an idea. Unfortunately 
some of the ideas that come from the other side of the House are 
only rehashed ideas they get from this side of the House.
<P>
<B>(1735)</B>
<P>
	Someone like Bernardo should have been dealt with at the trial 
process by the trial judge. He should have had the discretion to say 
no parole or no parole for 250 years. Outlive that, Bernardo. Or no 
parole for 500 years or whatever figure. He should have had that 
discretion. Unfortunately the Criminal Code does not allow him 
that discretion.
<P>
	Another situation similar to this occurred well in excess of 20 
years ago in the city of Saskatoon where an individual was 
convicted of killing four children, David Threinen. He had killed 
four children and plead guilty to second degree murder. The very 
well respected judge in the system in Saskatchewan, Justice Ian 
Hughes, who had to sentence him, subsequently left Saskatchewan 
and went to British Columbia.
<P>
	At the sentencing he increased the parole eligibility to the 
maximum he could at that time which was 20 years for second 
degree murder. He made a recommendation that this individual 
never be paroled. That should not have been something he had to 
do. He should not have been obliged to do this. He should have had 
the discretion to be able to make that order at the time of 
sentencing, not left to the parole board, 20 years plus to be dealt 
with again. He should have been able to deal with it then.
<P>
	These are the types of cases where there are injustices, when the 
judges should go lower in ordering parole eligibility or go 
substantially higher in ordering non-eligibility for parole. It deals 
with the whole matter. However, the amendments that have been 
proposed to Bill C-45 are good amendments. They have changed 
matters. It has been made such that an initial step has to be taken.
<P>
	Why would the Reform Party ever vote against such a 
requirement when it makes it tougher for someone who is serving 
time for first degree murder in excess of 15 years to get parole 
eligibility? Why would Reform members, who claim to represent 
victims, vote against the bill? They claim to represent victims and 
yet they vote against anything that helps victims. That seems 
strange. Favour victims, vote against victims; favour victims, vote 
against victims. That is the Reform policy.
<P>
	Recently I received a document from the Church council on 
justice and corrections, a coalition of 11 churches, Roman 
Catholic, Anglican, United,  Presbyterian, Batiste, Evangelical, 
Lutheran, Salvation Army, the Quaker, Mennonite, Christian 
Reform and Disciplines of Christ. In that document they indicated 
they favour judicial reviews. They indicate judicial reviews are 
working reasonably well in the country. More than half the 
offenders eligible for a judicial review are not even applying for 
one, they indicated, often because they either know they do not 
stand a chance or feel they are not ready.
<P>
	Then they come out with this statement: ``None who has been 
released into the community has murdered again''. None. We are 
getting a lot of fearmongering from the Reform Party, saying that 
Canadians are terrified that murders will be released into their 
community. Of those who have been successful in their application 
under section 745, none released into the community has murdered 
again. So why this fearmongering by the Reform Party if not to 
make this a political issue when it is not a political issue?
<P>
	With that we proceed to other matters. The Reform Party claims 
that this a joke of the judicial process.
<P>
<B>(1740)</B>
<P>
	The hon. member for Prince George-Peace River indicated it is 
a joke of the process. Where is the joke? We have people charged 
with murder. There is evidence. They are convicted of murder. 
They are sent to jail for life. The question is one of parole 
eligibility. Where is the joke in this system?
<P>
	People are consistently convicted in courts for the offence of 
murder. Is this a joke? If this is a joke, I cannot understand what the 
Reform Party would want in its place. Would it prefer trial by 
ordeal? Would it prefer-
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> What about cross-examination of victims?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bodnar:</B> There are no victims who can be cross-examined 
on a murder trial, and that is what I am discussing now. It is 
unfortunate but that is the position. There are victims in cases but 
they had better realize what is being talked about in the speech. 
This is how the Reform Party deals with this matter. It treats it as a 
complete political matter. It is not concerned about victims of any 
sort in the process.
<P>
	It is important to get rid of section 745 at some time in the future 
and replace it with what I have suggested. Prisoners want finality in 
sentencing as well. When they have been convicted, they want to 
know exactly where they stand. There is no reason for them to put 
on false pretences to prison guards in wanting to be treated better or 
have a favourable report in 15 years.
<P>
	They should have finality planned for that period of time and 
deal with rehabilitation rather than trying to impress authorities.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8863"> 8863 </A></B>
<P>
	The comment by the hon. member for Comox-Alberni that it 
is 1.1 years for every child he has killed in referring to Olson is 
absolutely ludicrous. His suggesting that Olson will only serve 1.1 
years for every child he has killed is simply trying to inflame the 
public when what is being said is completely and absolutely 
inaccurate because he has not been granted parole.
<P>
	Everybody knows he will not be granted parole, yet a comment 
like that is made. It is inflammatory to the ultimate degree. That is 
Reform policy. Its members not only deal with inconsistencies, 
what is inaccurate, but they show their extremist qualities 
throughout and continuously. Desperation is written all over the 
Reform Party.
<P>
	On Bill C-45 the Reform Party, in its fresh start campaign 
platform, should realize that most of us did not need a fresh start 
part way through this Parliament because we had a good start when 
we started in 1993. We do not have to restart.
<P>
	In their fresh start Reformers say that section 745 should be 
repealed and they do not deal with a situation like another Olson 
applying for parole after 25 years. Give the judges the discretion. 
Let them deal with situations like this. Unfortunately it is never 
dealt with.
<P>
	Of course, they try to show how crime is increasing, it is really 
bad. It is not true. Crime is falling. The national crime rate has been 
falling for the fourth year in a row.
<P>
	All we have to do is look at the Reform documentation. One can 
see what Reformers are saying, fearmongering with respect to the 
public. They are trying to show to the public that the justice system 
does not work. Everything is getting worse. It is absolutely not 
true.
<P>
	The crime rate is dropping.
<P>
<B>(1745 )</B>
<P>
	The crime rate has decreased for a fourth year in a row. Violent 
crime also fell last year. Does it not hurt their policy when the facts 
do not support them? How do they back out of it? They cannot. 
They cannot back out of it. They are stuck with fearmongering and 
alteration of the facts in matters such as this one. That is what we 
have seen in debates and written articles about crime control by 
Reform members.
<P>
	I simply ask Reformers to take a look at my suggestion today. It 
is not a new one. It made it to the Police Association of Canada. 
Section 745 should be abolished, giving back discretion to judges 
to deviate from the mandatory sentences in exceptional cases upon 
giving reasons. I have indicated that to the association. It is very 
interested in looking at that suggestion to see whether or not to 
support it. I am waiting to hear what it has to say.
<P>
	I am not about to say that we should not parole people forever or 
if a criminal is convicted put him away for 25 years with no 
discretion for judges. I have a lot more  faith in the judicial system 
than I do in the wisdom of the party across from me, the third party. 
Its ability to deal with section 745 has been most lacking.
<P>
	We must have constructive debate rather than the Reformers 
continuously trying to insinuate that we are not dealing with the 
rights of victims. We cannot have good debate with them. I am 
putting out a suggestion for them to consider. Perhaps there are 
problems in my suggestion but I would like to hear what those 
problems may be.
<P>
	I do not want to be called names. I heard one from the member 
for Swift Current-Maple Creek-Assiniboia. I do not want to 
hear that. I prefer getting into constructive debate rather than being 
called names. It is irresponsible. They will pay the price in the next 
election. In the province of Saskatchewan there will be no 
Reformers re-elected, none. We will see to it.
<P>
	This is not the time for name calling in such a discussion. This is 
a time to deal with alternatives. Unfortunately that is not on the 
agenda of the Reform Party. Alternatives are not on its agenda 
because it deals with alternatives on a different fact basis, facts that 
are not there.
<P>
	We cannot deal with alternatives like those. I simply ask that all 
members to consider the alternatives I have put before the House 
today.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Elwin Hermanson (Kindersley-Lloydminster, Ref.):</B> 
Madam Speaker, I just heard a disappointing speech from the 
member for Saskatoon-Dundurn. He epitomizes-and he was 
very pitiful in doing it-everything we find wrong with the justice 
system.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hermanson:</B> They are heckling and jeering after their 
member talked about name calling. To hear all the names they have 
been calling us all day puts him in a very tenuous position, to say 
the least.
<P>
	The member for Saskatoon-Dundurn talked about crime rates 
going down. Actually, if we look at the long term trend over the last 
20 years, crime rates in Canada have been on a steady increase. 
Like all charts they bump up and down but overall they are on an 
increase.
<P>
<B>(1750)</B>
<P>
	I was talking to some social workers in the member's riding, 
people the work at the Friendship Inn. He knows very well where it 
is. They are the experts in this field. It is one of the most difficult 
areas in the province of Saskatchewan. It happens to be Premier 
Romanow's riding as a matter of fact and the hon. member for 
Saskatoon-Dundurn is the Liberal representative for that riding.
<P>
	I asked them about the crime situation there. I asked if it was as 
bad as a lot of people thought and if it was getting better or worse. I 
am sure they were honest. They work there every day. They care for 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8864"> 8864 </A></B>
<P>
these people. They  are concerned about their well-being. They said 
that without a doubt things were getting worse in Saskatoon.
<P>
	Crime is increasing. There is solvent and substance abuse, break 
and enter, robbery and prostitution. Young offenders are a big 
problem in that part of the city in Saskatoon.
<P>
	The hon. member does not even know there is a crime problem 
in his own riding. Yet he stands and has the nerve to say it is no big 
deal that Reformers are concerned about section 745 of the 
Criminal Code. All the members over here have been making 
apologies all day for Clifford Olson and hundreds of murderers like 
him who will get their day in court, who will be able to stand and 
plead for mercy after the despicable things they have done.
<P>
	I have been in the House most of the day listening to the 
Liberals. A number of them over there have defended Clifford 
Robert Olson and section 745 of the Criminal Code. They are glad 
he will have his day tomorrow. They are trying to point the finger at 
us and say that we are in the wrong because we brought it to the 
attention of the House. All of Canada knows what is going on. All 
of Canada is upset. Yet these Liberals in their little cocoon are 
complaining because the Reform raised the issue for debate in the 
House.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Cannis:</B> Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of order. I have 
been following the debate throughout the day. There has not been a 
member from either side of the House rise to defend this criminal. 
They talked about the process and the system and how they unfold.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hermanson:</B> Madam Speaker, I have listened to members 
on the other side defend the process. They have defended section 
745 of the Criminal Code even though many of them voted for 
rescinding that section when their former colleague put forward a 
private member's bill to do so. Now they have flip flopped and are 
defending section 745 of the Criminal Code.
<P>
	One of those members is the member for Oshawa. Can we 
imagine what his constituents would think if they heard him in the 
House? I hope some of them did, although most of his comments 
were heckling rather than intelligent ones.
<P>
	The member for Rosedale was also doing the same thing. He was 
supporting section 745 of the Criminal Code. I wonder what those 
constituents think of their member.
<P>
	Right beside the member for Rosedale was the member for 
Sarnia-Lambton. He rose to make a speech. All he did was rail 
against Reform because Reformers are concerned about victims.
<P>
	The hon. member for Saskatoon-Dundurn had the gall to say 
that family members of the murder victims are not victims. I could 
not believe that he would be so insensitive and non-compassionate 
to suggest that family  members of murder victims were not 
victims. I could not believe he would make such an atrocious 
statement in the House.
<P>
	The member for Scarborough Centre yelled insults at Reformers 
and he was defending section 745 of the Criminal Code. I believe I 
even heard a way off in the corner the member for 
Victoria-Haliburton defend this awful section of the Criminal 
Code which Canadians from one end of the country to the other 
want to see rescinded.
<P>
	The hon. member for Halton-Peel serves with me on the 
agriculture committee. I thought he would be concerned about 
Canadians and their concerns over section 745 of the Criminal 
Code, but no way. He was heckling as well.
<P>
	In front of him was the hon. member for Prince 
Albert-Churchill River, the Parliamentary Secretary to the 
Minister of Justice. He has been involved with the issue. He 
heckled Reform because we brought the issue before the House. He 
belittled the importance of repealing or rescinding section 745. He 
said that it could not be done retroactively. However they could 
retroactively do away with the Pearson airport deal. We know what 
a Reform government could do in a retroactive way.
<P>
<B>(1755)</B>
<P>
	They will push the most regressive legislation through the 
House. They will use closure. They will use time allocation. 
However when it came to a bill to deal with section 745 of the 
Criminal Code they could not do it because the Bloc did not like it.
<P>
	Can we imagine those poor, helpless, majority government 
Liberals not being able to make changes to our legal system 
because the Bloc did not want them to do it? They had to bow to the 
separatists. They could not do the right thing. The member for 
Prince Albert-Churchill River justified that action. I find it 
incomprehensible.
<P>
	The member for Dauphin-Swan River heckled Reformers. She 
said it was just awful that we were bringing the issue before 
Canadians. The member for Winnipeg St. James was his usual self. 
He is always yelling at us in the House. He is very unkind and very 
undiplomatic. He was doing his usual routine. The member for 
Halifax was babbling about Reformers and calling us names. I am 
sure you could not hear her, Madam Speaker, but that is the usual 
spiel we get from that member as well.
<P>
	The member for Mississauga South also said some very unkind 
things about Reformers. He said we had no right to bring the issue 
to the floor of the House. Can we imagine that? We are the people's 
elected representatives in the Parliament of Canada. On a serious 
issue like section 745 of the Criminal Code he thinks it is wrong for 
us to bring it before the House of Commons. He  would rather have 
it debated in the papers. He would rather have it debated on talk 
shows across Canada-
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8865"> 8865 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Szabo:</B> Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of order. With due 
respect, the member is attributing to me things which I did not say 
in the House. I would like to refute them and I would like the 
member either to withdraw the allegation-
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hill (Prince George-Peace River):</B> That is debate.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Szabo:</B> He has attributed to me things I did not say in the 
House.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hermanson:</B> Madam Speaker, the hon. member for 
Mississauga South certainly made some comments. He thought it 
was very inappropriate for Reformers to bring this issue for debate 
in the House of Commons today, the day before Clifford Olson had 
his day in court.
<P>
	We could always check <I>Hansard</I> to find out what the hon. 
member said. He thought it was opportunistic. I cannot remember 
exactly what he said as there have been so many members who 
have spoken along the same line. However that was the gist of what 
he said. I may not be quoting him word for word but that was the 
gist of the message that he was trying to get across.
<P>
	The member for Burlington spoke in the same vein. She 
criticized Reformers. She did not think this was an issue that was 
important to Canadians. She obviously has not been listening to her 
constituents.
<P>
	Then, my dear friend, the member for Vancouver Quadra, got 
into the act. Why he would do that I do not know. Perhaps he has 
been a constitutional expert for too long and is out of touch with 
how Canadians feel and what is in their hearts. They still believe in 
decency. They still believe in justice. They still believe that when 
somebody ruthlessly takes another human being's life there should 
be severe consequences that will last for more than just a few years.
<P>
	I have taken almost all the time available to me in questions and 
comments. In closing, I wish Liberal members would set aside 
their partisanship and come to their senses. I wish they would start 
to listen to Canadians.
<P>
	I cannot believe that the member for Prince Albert-Churchill 
River and the member for Saskatoon-Dundurn would show such 
insensitivity to the concerns of Canadians who see people brutally 
murdered. Then the justice system protects, cares and pampers the 
murderers while the victims continue to suffer. It is wrong and I 
bring that to the attention of the House.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bodnar:</B> Madam Speaker, unfortunately the hon. member 
did not hear the speech I made. I never referred to other members 
of the family as not being victims of the crime.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Benoit:</B> Yes, you did. Check <I>Hansard</I>.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bodnar:</B> Unfortunately they are not telling the truth at this 
time.
<P>
<B>(1800 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hill (Prince George-Peace River):</B> Check the tape.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bodnar:</B> Certainly.
<P>
	As a further matter, with respect to crime in my riding, it is 
interesting that he is busy campaigning in my part of the riding and 
the election has not even been called.
<P>
	Madam Speaker, I have had information passed on to me that 
during my speech the hon. member for Swift Current-Maple 
Creek-Assiniboia uttered the word ``asshole''. I am asking that 
this be withdrawn at this time.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Ringuette-Maltais):</B> On the point of 
order, the Chair did not hear that but we will certainly review the 
blues.
<P>
	We are now resuming debate.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bob Ringma (Nanaimo-Cowichan, Ref.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I guess we are going to be a little short of time, but I 
would like to advise the House that I will be sharing my time with 
my colleague, the member for Cariboo-Chilcotin.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Kirkby:</B> Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of order. It was 
my understanding that the hon. member for Saskatoon-Dundurn 
was sharing his time with me.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Ringuette-Maltais):</B> No, he was 
not.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ringma:</B> Madam Speaker, I would like to reiterate the 
motion that we are supposedly debating today proposed by my 
colleague from Crowfoot. It reads:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That this House recognize that the families of murder victims are subjected to 
reliving the pain and fear of their experience as a result of the potential release of the 
victims' murderers allowed under section 745 of the Criminal Code, and as a 
consequence, this House urge the Liberal government to formally apologize to those 
families for repeatedly refusing to repeal section 745 of the Criminal Code.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	That is what we are about today. I am disappointed that we had 
this misunderstanding of what the member for Mississauga South 
said or did not say. I would like to tell the House what I heard him 
say. He said: ``There is no way that you can legislate away grief''. I 
have to disagree with him. If we were to change the legislation, we 
could prevent the family from going through the grief that they 
have to go through.
<P>
	I am going to cite a specific case of a constituent family of mine 
whose daughter was a murder victim. The family members are now 
victims themselves of the murderer and of the whole flawed 
judicial process. The family's name is Clausen. Svend and Inge 
Clausen live in Duncan. Their 15-year-old daughter was murdered 
in  1981. Because of section 745, since August 1996 the Clausens 
have had to be on the edge of theirs chair asking: ``Will that 
murderer now appeal in order to get his reprieve after 15 years?'' It 
has not happened yet but day by day this family is living through 
this misery of having the whole thing come to life again.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8866"> 8866 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1805)</B>
<P>
	This came to my attention in part because the Clausen's sent me 
a copy of their letter to the current Minister of Justice. Because of 
that I asked if they minded if I used their name in the House, if I 
talked about their case. I asked if it would bring back the horror for 
them. They replied, ``no Bob, it won't do that because we live with 
the horror every day, and because of section 745 we will be living it 
every day for the next 10 years. We don't know when this maniac 
who murdered our daughter will put his name forward and say that 
it is his right to appeal''.
<P>
	With that I will quote from the Clausen's letter to the Minister of 
Justice:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>I am the mother of Lise Clausen who was abducted, sexually assaulted and 
murdered on August 2, 1981 by Paul Kocurek, a convicted sex offender free on 
mandatory supervision. I am writing this letter on behalf of my family.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Kocurek had borrowed a car from a friend and was cruising the quiet roads of our 
neighbourhood looking for prey. He came well prepared [in other words 
premeditated] with a starter gun and handcuffs ready in the car. He spotted Lise who 
was out for a quick afternoon run before dinner, found a suitable place to park, 
opened the hood of his car pretending to have car trouble. When she came close and 
asked if he needed help, she found herself staring at the gun. He pushed her into the 
car, handcuffed her and then drove past our driveway and up the mountain behind 
our property. By the time she was located the next day it was all over. Her life, her 
future, her dreams were all taken from her. Our lives were changed forever.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>This was the third offence committed by this unbalanced, perverted individual 
who consequently was found guilty of first degree murder and sentenced to life in 
prison with no parole for 25 years. According to our justice system the ultimate 
punishment for the ultimate crime. However, we soon realized that ``life'' does not 
mean life and later we found that 25 years with no parole does not apply either-due 
to a little known section in the Criminal Code, namely section 745''.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>We learned that in 1976 the Solicitor General of the day, Warren Allmand, 
publicly stated that: ``To keep them in [jail] for 25 years in my view is a waste of 
resources, a waste for a person's life''. At the time Allmand was fighting to get the 
minimum life sentence for first degree murderers set at 15 years. When he failed, he 
introduced a loophole dubbed the faint hope clause, namely section 745.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>This clause is an insult to all victims and their families. We are talking about the worst 
kind of killers here. First degree murder is a planned cold-blooded killing, but section 
745 is being used as a sneaky back-door route to freedom for these murderers so that 
they can have the opportunity to kill again. For you and your government to condone 
this defies common sense, and we are at a loss to understand why this government is so 
eager to help such killers on to our streets long before the sentence  imposed on them by 
the judge has been served. Victims, past, present and future should be so lucky to have 
such advocates for their concerns.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Most citizens were led to believe that the safety of society was important to you. 
Did we misunderstand? If we didn't, then please explain why you are doing 
everything possible to help convicted killers to get out. So that they can assault 
and/or kill more innocent people?</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>We are well aware of the arguments put forth by your ministry. Points like ``there 
has to be a light at the end of the tunnel,'' and ``if we repeal the section we would 
close the door for people who are in no danger of reoffending, such as those who 
killed an abusive partner''.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The answer to point one is straight forward-there is a light at the end of the 
tunnel-at 25 years. The answer to point number two is that very, very seldom will 
the killing of a partner result in a first degree murder charge, most likely 
manslaughter, for which the sentence is much less.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>In Canada today we continue to see a miscarriage of justice. As a matter of fact 
most feel that we do not have a justice system. We have a legal system.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>(1810)</B>
<P>
	My time is running out so I will finish. Section 745 demeans the 
value of life and the balance is again swinging in favour of 
convicted killers.
<P>
	I do not have the time to finish Ms. Clausen's letter to the 
Minister of Justice, but I think it speaks reams. The victims of 
murderers are families such as this who have to relive it, not just 
their daughter. Section 745 by being there as a hope which 
murderers such as this one and Olson and Bernardo can invoke at 
any time keeps them in agony from here on in. That is not justice.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier-Montcalm, BQ):</B> 
Madam Speaker, had I, instead of the Reform Party member or the 
Minister of Justice, received such a letter, I would have tried to 
reassure the family by telling them about the existing legislation. I 
would certainly not have added fuel to the fire as the Reform Party 
members have been doing since this morning. The question of 
parole is perhaps not without problems, but neither is it 
unremittingly bleak, as the members of the Reform Party have been 
saying since the beginning of this debate.
<P>
	I would have told this family that I fully understood their 
sadness, what they are going through, and that I hope never to have 
to live through anything like it myself. But I would remind them 
that there are provisions for dangerous offenders. I would explain 
to them the definition of ``dangerous offender'' and how the system 
can designate murderers as ``dangerous offenders'' not eligible for 
parole under section 745. I would take the time to explain that to 
them.
<P>
	I would also take the time to explain the parole system. I would 
give them statistics. When you are involved in such a case and you 
yourself become a statistic, it is, of course, a sad thing. But I would 
use statistics to show  them that the system is not as bad as all that. 
Some things could be improved, I agree.
<P>
	As I said this morning, one repeat offender is already too many, 
in the case of murderers like those we are considering. I would try 
to reassure this family by telling them that the ideal solution we are 
seeking is the one that ultimately eliminates repeat offences.
<P>
	If I were to do anything, it would be to seek a way to eliminate 
this kind of criminal in our society. Perhaps we should pay more 
attention to education, invest more in our young people. But one 
thing I would not do is add fuel to the fire as the Reform Party 
member and his colleagues have been doing since this morning.
<P>
	I would like to put a question to the Reform Party member who 
just spoke. We have seen with Bill C-45 that the government has 
changed the rules for obtaining parole under section 745. It has 
become section 745.6. There are extremely specific criteria, one in 
particular. We have been hearing about the Clifford Olson case 
since this morning. I do not always agree with the Liberal 
government, but when they do something good from time to time, 
they deserve credit.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>

<B><A NAME="8867"> 8867 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1815)</B>
<P>
	Could the Reformers tell me whether, under section 745.6 an 
application for parole from someone like Clifford Olson would 
simply be blocked?
<P>
	So, after hearing everything they said since this morning I think 
things could be discussed more calmly if they were aware of the 
provisions already in the Criminal Code and if they did not invent 
things to make political points, which in the West, it appears, is the 
way things are done.
<P>
	I was listening to the Liberals and the Reformers earlier. This 
subject requires calm and very careful examination, because not 
only does it cost a lot to imprison murderers, but it costs a lot to 
rehabilitate them and reintegrate them-something we have to 
think about eventually.
<P>
	I therefore ask the Reform member whether he thinks that, with 
the amendments to section 745.6, someone like Clifford Olson or 
Joe Blow would have a hard time getting paroled. Did he take the 
time to look at the amendments and apply them to a specific case, 
as he seems interested in doing?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ringma:</B> Mr. Speaker, it is probable that Clifford Olson will 
not be granted parole. However, the answer to my hon. friend from 
the Bloc is that just the possibility of it makes the family live in 
trepidation.
<P>
	I am sorry the member does not care to hear my answer. Let us 
forget about answering if it means that little.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Philip Mayfield (Cariboo-Chilcotin, Ref.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, shortly after coming to Ottawa, there was a comment in 
the paper by a woman who said that she had been picked up along 
the highway by Clifford Olson and raped.
<P>
	Following that, a media reporter asked for a comment from me. I 
simply said that if that is the case, it should be investigated and that 
if he is convicted, add it to his sentence.
<P>
	I received a personal letter from Mr. Olson after that. I am not 
proud to have received it. It was a letter that showed no remorse. It 
showed contempt for the justice system and contempt for everyone 
involved with him.
<P>
	This is the man we are dealing with. Where is this government's 
compassion when I think of the victims and their families?
<P>
	Tomorrow on March 11 child killer Clifford Olson will begin his 
appeal for early parole under section 745 of the Criminal Code, the 
so-called faint hope clause. This government could have stopped 
Olson's appeal but it chose not to. Therefore tomorrow, March 11, 
will be recognized as one of the saddest and most disgraceful days 
in the history of our justice system because it does not carry justice.
<P>
	It is tomorrow that the families of Olson's victims will relive the 
horror, the suffering and the pain of what this child killer did to 
their loved ones in the most brutal and gruesome way imaginable.
<P>
	To bring some conciliation to these hurting people, I exhort the 
House today to recognize that the families of murder victims are 
subjected to reliving the pain and fear of their experience as a result 
of the potential release of the victims' murderers allowed under 
section 745 of the Criminal Code.
<P>
	To give some justice to these hurting people, I exhort the House 
to urge the Liberal government to formally apologize to the murder 
victims' families for repeatedly refusing to repeal section 745 of 
the Criminal Code.
<P>
	I participate in this debate today and I want to argue two points. 
First, the families of murder victims needlessly are made to suffer 
more when murderers make appeals or applications for early 
release under the so-called faint hope clause.
<P>
	Liberal members talk about respecting the justice system. If 
there is so much respect for the justice system, why is the decision 
of the court which tried, convicted and sentenced Clifford Olson 
now being questioned using different standards of evidence and a 
different standard of reasonable doubt? If we have such respect for 
the justice system why are we revisiting this and trying to redecide 
what was decided 15 years ago?
<P>
<B>(1820)</B>
<P>
	Second, the government had an opportunity to repeal section 
745. It refused to do so and for this hurtful and  neglectful action 
the Liberals must formally apologize to murder victims' families 
for their unnecessary pain and suffering. These are the people who 
are having their wounds reopened and their suffering and loss 
reimposed on them. This is unjust and this is cruelty.
<P>
	I want to outline for the House what a Reform government would 
do to protect the rights of murder victims' families. Before I do let 
me give some historical background to provide a context for 
today's debate.
<P>
	Section 745 dates back to 1976 when Parliament abolished 
capital punishment with the passing of Bill C-84. Included in Bill 
C-84 was the mandatory sentencing clause which gave anyone 
convicted of first degree murder a minimum 25 year sentence 
before parole eligibility. The mandatory sentencing clause also 
included section 745, the so-called faint hope clause. It gave every 
first and second degree murderer the right to apply for early parole 
after they served 15 years of a 25 year life sentence.
<P>
	Fifteen years after the passage of Bill C-84 the families of 
murder victims started to discover for the first time that section 745 
existed. This is when they realized that the murderers of their sons, 
daughters, brothers and sisters were getting out of prison on early 
parole.
<P>
	To the end of 1995, 50 of 63 first degree murderers who applied 
under section 745, a shocking 79, per cent were recommended for 
some form of early release. In Quebec, which accounted for 60 per 
cent of all recommendations for early release, not a single 
applicant was turned down. Quite clearly the faint hope clause has 
become the sure bet clause.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="8868"> 8868 </A></B>
<P>
	Section 745 appeals and hearings have traumatized the friends 
and families of murder victims for too long. These are the people 
who go home every night to an empty house or an empty bed and 
who live out every day with grief, sorrow and pain knowing that the 
one they love is not coming back. These families would find out 
that the one who murdered their loved one is applying for or 
already has a hearing for early parole. After this happens they 
would discover that the criminal who inflicted so much pain on 
them has been released early from prison. There was no honesty in 
the sentence that was provided.
<P>
	I am always amazed when we talk about serious things like this 
at the levity that takes place on the government benches. This is no 
joke. These are suffering people. I have listened to some of the 
people who have gone through this experience and it is heart 
wrenching to say the least. No one can understand the shock, the 
horror and the pain that these victims endure when the person who 
murdered their loved one has been let out of prison early or is being 
considered for such a privilege. These victims relive the suffering 
and pain of their loved one's death. They too are victims. They hurt 
day after day for the rest of their lives.
<P>
	Let me read to the House some personal testimonies of people 
who have been revictimized because of section 745 of the Criminal 
Code. Mrs. Rose Onofrey, whose son Dennis was murdered, said: 
``Is that all my son's life was worth, 15 years? Why do I have to be 
victimized again and again? Dorothy Malette, a convicted 
murderer who received early parole under section 745, wants to 
visit her children. I have to go to the cemetery to visit my son''.
<P>
	Willa Olson, whose brother was murdered in 1978, said of 
section 745 hearings: ``It is so hard on the family. You think you 
have forgotten some of it and then you are reminded all over 
again''.
<P>
	Sharon Rosenfeldt, whose son Daryn was killed by Olson, said 
this of section 745 last year: ``I can only hope to God that it will be 
repealed before August so that our families and the 10 other 
families will not have to go through this whole nightmare again''.
<P>
	The Liberal government had an opportunity to stop the suffering. 
I have just described the opportunity. But it chose not to. Instead, it 
decided to tinker with the faint hope clause by amending it under 
last year's Bill C-45. The inadequacies of Bill C-45 I would like to 
bring to the House's attention but I lack the time to do that.
<P>
	I conclude by simply reminding the House of what a Reform 
government would do to protect the families and friends of murder 
victims. First, there would be no parole application for early 
release for Olson or any other killer. A Reform government would 
repeal section 745 of the Criminal Code and bring back truth in 
sentencing. This means the sentences given would be the sentences 
served by all offenders.
<P>
	Second, a Reform government would enact a victims bill of 
rights that would put the rights of law-abiding Canadians ahead of 
those of criminals.
<P>
	A Reform government would make compassion and caring for 
victims the centrepiece of its justice policies. Where there is a 
choice to be made between the rights of victims and the rights of 
convicted criminals, victim rights would always come first.
<P>
	Reform would make sure that child killers like Clifford Olson 
are never given a cruel weapon like section 745 again to impose on 
and further hurt and damage the lives of many innocent people.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Ringuette-Maltais):</B> It being 6.25 
p.m., it is my duty to interrupt the proceedings and put forthwith 
every question necessary to dispose of the business of supply.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The question is on the amendment. Is it the pleasure of the House 
to adopt the amendment?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> No.

<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Yea.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Ringuette-Maltais):</B> All those 
opposed will please say nay.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Nay.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Ringuette-Maltais):</B> In my opinion 
the nays have it.
<P>
	<I>And more than five members having risen:</I>
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Ringuette-Maltais):</B> Call in the 
members.
<P>
	<I>And the division bells having rung:</I>
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Ringuette-Maltais):</B> The division 
on the question now before the House stands deferred until 
tomorrow at the end of government orders, at which time the bells 
to call in the members will be sounded for not more than15 minutes.
<P>
	It being 6.30 p.m., the House stands adjourned until tomorrow at 
10 a.m., pursuant to Standing Order 24(1).
<P>
