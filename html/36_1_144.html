hard work and perseverance can achieve.  Canada is proud of her. 
I wish her luck in her next event.

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>CANADIAN FARMERS 
</H3><P align=left>

<P><A NAME="LINK5"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Leon E. Benoit (Lakeland, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, many 
farmers across this country, especially in western Canada, are 
facing an income crisis.  This is through no fault of their own. 
The Asian economic situation is part of the cause, but government 
inaction, unreasonable user fees and tax increases over the past 
five years are the unforgivable causes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unreasonable fees have been charged through so-called cost 
recovery programs.  Tax increases on fuel and other inputs have 
squeezed farmers too hard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Farmers do not want handouts.  All they want is fair treatment. 
That is why back in the 1993 election campaign and during 
discussion on the elimination of the Crow subsidy Reform MPs 
called for the government to put at least part of the value of 
the Crow into its trade distribution adjustment program.  This 
fund would, as I speak, be paying money to farmers to help 
compensate for low prices caused by unfair trade practices in 
other countries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But did this government listen?  No.  This government abandoned 
Canadian farmers.  Now what is this government going to do?

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>NATIONAL SLEEP AWARENESS WEEK 
</H3><P align=left>

<P><A NAME="LINK7"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Elinor Caplan (Thornhill, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased 
to draw the attention of the House to the fact that the week of 
October 19 to 25 has been designated National Sleep Awareness 
Week. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This week, which coincides with the changing of the clocks, 
reminds us how important sleep is to our everyday lives.  Over 
two million Canadians suffer from sleep disorders such as 
insomnia and sleep apnea during which breathing actually stops. 
Sleep disorders affect the quality of life by decreasing 
alertness and performance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Sleep/Wake Disorders Canada, a national voluntary health 
organization with chapters across the country, recruits and 
trains volunteer leaders who help people suffering from sleep 
disorders to improve the quality of their lives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Please join me in supporting the work of Sleep/Wake Disorders 
Canada and in wishing them a successful national sleep awareness 
week. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also like to take this opportunity to inform the House 
that today my granddaughters and my grandson, Findlay, Tillie and 
Max—

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>RADIO NORD 
</H3><P align=left>

<P><A NAME="LINK9"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Guy St-Julien (Abitibi—Baie-James—Nunavik, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
Radio Nord has asked the federal labour minister to give 
mediator Jacques Lessard the power to decide the 85 employees' 
future terms and conditions of employment. What Radio Nord is 
asking for represents an abuse of power. The minister is not 
authorized under the Canada Labour Code to impose terms and 
conditions of employment on the employees of Radio Nord. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact, according to the union, it is contrary to the spirit of 
the code, because section 107 provides at most that the minister 
may do such things as to him seem likely to maintain or secure 
industrial peace and to promote conditions favourable to the 
settlement of industrial differences. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Radio Nord is basically asking that the right to free collective 
bargaining and, where legitimate, to go on strike to advance 
their demands be taken away from the employees. In addition, the 
employer abolished a dozen or so positions during the 
conciliation process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The union believes that a negotiated solution is the preferred 
option for the employees and for the people of 
Abitibi-Témiscamingue, who complain about the fact that Radio 
Nord has been cutting back services for several years.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mac Harb (Ottawa Centre, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I would 
like to pay tribute to this year's recipient of the Commonwealth 
Jewish Council and Trust Award. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He is one of the finest public servants this country has ever 
known.  For over 30 years before and after his election to 
parliament he has consistently been a champion of justice, an 
advocate of fairness, a visionary and a compassionate friend of 
the people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Commonwealth Jewish Council and Trust Award is given to 
those who have gone beyond the call of duty to help their fellow 
human beings and whose contribution has been truly outstanding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Other Canadians who have received the awards are Judge Maxwell 
Cohen and Mrs. Dorothy Reitman. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I join all my colleagues and all Canadians in congratulating our 
Deputy Prime Minister, the hon. member for Windsor West, on this 
latest addition to his many achievements.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Myron Thompson (Wild Rose, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, last 
week Judge Tom Goodson, an aboriginal member of the provincial 
court of Alberta, was appointed to conduct a fatality inquiry 
into the shooting of Connie and Ty Jacobs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope that Judge Goodson will follow in the footsteps of Judge 
Reilly and investigate this case as broadly as possible.  He 
would be doing all aboriginals a great service if he were to 
investigate the social conditions, accountability of band leaders 
and financial mismanagement on this reserve. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would hope he would consider looking into why Connie was 
living in a condemned house and why there is a chronic housing 
shortage on a reserve that received over $20 million last year, 
or why these people in August took over deserted army barracks on 
the reserve in the hope of better housing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why do these people continue to live in poverty and ill health, 
plagued by violence and unemployment despite the billions of 
dollars of public money reserves receive each year? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This inquiry cannot assign blame, but Judge Goodson can make 
many recommendations on how to prevent such an incident from 
happening again and subsequently change the quality of life for 
all aboriginals across Canada.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bernard Patry (Pierrefonds—Dollard, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, last 
Friday, the Canadian government announced $10.5 million in 
comprehensive financial assistance to implement approximately 20 
projects related to new information technologies and new media 
in the greater Montreal area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A first financial contribution was made to Behaviour 
Communications Inc. This $9 million contribution will generate 
investments totaling $30 million and the creation of 200 new 
jobs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Eighteen businesses sponsored by the multimedia consortium CESAM 
were granted $1.5 million out of the multimedia experimentation 
fund. 
This government support is provided as seed money for new 
businesses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It goes without saying that governments and their private sector 
partners must work together to create conditions conducive to 
attracting highly skilled labour to Montreal and curbing the 
drain of talents and skilled resources. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian government encourages Quebec initiatives and 
ensures that our businesses can assume their rightful place.

riding of Renfrew—Nipissing—Pembroke. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Rostad said “I have been aware of a very special quality 
that this region holds for people.  There is a real spirit of 
neighbourliness.  There is a sense of community.  There is magic 
in the hills of Wilno.” 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Rostad visited the famous Wilno Tavern on Tuesday blues 
night where he met many of the local musicians, artists and 
colourful characters who make Wilno and area such an incredibly 
diverse community.  One of those artists is marionette maker Alex

</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1997, children's aid societies in Ontario conducted 96,039 
investigations into suspected cases of child abuse and neglect. 
This includes 634 cases investigated by the Children's Aid 
Society of the Region of Peel.  It is one of a number of child 
welfare agencies holding purple ribbon campaigns in October to 
educate, advocate and generally raise awareness about child 
abuse.  Up to 12,000 ribbons will be distributed in the Peel 
region. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While child abuse prevention month and the purple ribbon 
campaign end this Saturday, I wish to remind Canadians that every 
person who has reason to suspect that a child is being abused or 
may have suffered from abuse must report that suspicion to a 
Children's Aid Society.

Agreement with much fanfare and hype.

agreement, is now spending millions of taxpayers' dollars in a 
paid campaign reminiscent of the Charlottetown accord. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Once again all of the talking heads who told us why 
Charlottetown was the only hope for Canada are trotted out to 
tell us why we must have the Nisga'a agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The parallels are striking.  An agreement is crafted behind 
closed doors by an elite group of politicians and intellectuals. 
The public is told in no uncertain terms that the agreement 
cannot be changed and must be accepted to save the country.  The 
intelligentsia lauds the agreement in glowing terms without 
hesitation or reservation and those who express concern or 
opposition are labelled the “enemies of Canada” in the case of 
the Charlottetown accord or the “forces of darkness” in the 
case of the Nisga'a agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are all clear indications of governments which are morally 
adrift, intellectually bankrupt and distrusting of their public.

unseen, or at least hiding, in the form of the federal Liberal 
government which has knowingly created the conditions that may 
allow the enemies of medicare to succeed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Tommy's warning in his final years about medicare was “Don't

implement a 911 emergency system in rural areas, so everyone 
agreed.

Post is telling its customers that if they want to receive mail 
they must first pay a $34 change of address fee.  Businesses and 
non-profit organizations such as the Volunteer Family Services 
Food Bank must pay an exorbitant $150 fee because Canada Post 
unilaterally changed their address.

Speaker, my question is for the Prime Minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last week it was reported the number of middle class Canadians 
has dropped by 16% in the last two decades.  The wealthiest 10% 
of families now make 314 times more than the poorest 10%.  This 
is not a surprise. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since taking office this government has cut social programs, 
broken its promise on child care and gutted unemployment 
insurance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When will this government stop pursuing policies that continue 
to widen the gap between the rich and the poor? 
<P><A NAME="LINK107"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, the figures on the widening gap between the rich and the 
poor are obviously a concern in every industrial country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada suffered a very deep and profound recession in the period 
1989 to 1992 which certainly traumatized a series of Canadian 
families.  That is what we are in the process of seeing.  That is 
why when this government took office not only did it proceed to 
eliminate the deficit but it brought in the national child tax 
benefit and put another $1.8 billion into it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why we put a series of measures into helping mothers go 
back to school. That is why we put in a series of measures 
helping the working poor. It is why we dealt with education.  It 
is in fact— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  The hon. member for Dartmouth. 
<P><A NAME="LINK108"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Wendy Lill (Dartmouth, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I do not 
think the minister understands the gravity of the situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Children are sleeping in overcrowded shelters, on hot air grates 
and in abandoned cars and it is starting to get cold. Today the 
city of Toronto passed a motion by a vote of 53 to 1 calling on 
the federal government to declare homelessness a national 
disaster. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Will the federal government take emergency action and use its 
resources now and open armouries and surplus office space to give 
shelter to the 200,000 homeless across Canada before winter sets 
in? 
<P><A NAME="LINK109"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, in 1997 for the first time in over 15 years the standard 
of living of Canadians began to increase.  For the previous 15 
years it had been decreasing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is a very important.  It is only by an increasing standard 
of living, by putting more Canadians back to work, over a million 
since we took office, it is only by giving Canadians skills, only 
by understanding that the purpose of government is not simply to 
help the rich, which the Reform Party would focus on, but the 
least fortunate, that we will be able to deal with our very real 
and serious problems.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Why in the Conservative platform in the 1997 election did he say 
his government would continue to expand the practice of cost 
recovery in areas of food inspection and regulatory oversight, 
speed up the elimination of subsidies and take more than $600 
million out of the agriculture and agri-food industry?

<P><A NAME="LINK113"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rick Borotsik (Brandon—Souris, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
the minister by that answer is obviously not aware that there is 
a serious farm crisis right now.  This minister keeps hiding 
behind NISA but NISA is not enough.  Perhaps this minister should 
take some lessons from the minister of fisheries.  He seems to 
find money for his industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When it comes to agriculture their pockets are empty.  Is this 
because there is no political will from the minister of 
agriculture? 
<P><A NAME="LINK114"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lyle Vanclief (Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food,

which is not cutting.  We have one of the strongest safety net 
systems in the world.  We are reviewing that at the present time 
in co-operation with all the players in the industry.  We will 
continue to do that in order to continue strengthening our 
agri-food industry which I will agree is in a serious situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I look forward to the member's constructive offers of help in

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Sarkis Assadourian (Brampton Centre, Lib.):</B>  Mr.

Aleksander Nikitin, a nuclear engineer and former captain in the 
Russian navy, is now facing execution.  His crime is using 
information to focus full attention on deplorable environmental 
hazards posed by the aging fleet of Russian nuclear submarines. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What steps has the Government of Canada taken to work toward the

<P><A NAME="LINK117"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, we certainly share the member's concern.  In the 
past the Prime Minister has raised the matter directly with his 
counterpart.  I have asked our embassy officials to be in 
attendance at the trial because there is a clear question of due 
process and an application of laws.  In about two weeks I intend 
to be meeting with the foreign minister of Russia and I will 
attempt to take it up directly with him at that time.

Canadians are also concerned about the possibility of hostages

all remember what happened in Bosnia.   We had a total of 55 
Canadians taken hostage.  Will any of us forget Patrick Riechner 
chained to a post as a human shield?  Canadians do not want that

Mr. Speaker, as the hon. member well knows, last week at the OSCE

verification team.  There are several things in place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, the UN security council has passed a resolution that 
authorizes emergency protection for the verification team. 
Second, NATO has maintained its activation orders so it is on

with the Milosevic government. Fourth, we are in a position where 
we are seeing the adherence to the guidelines that set by NATO.

and percentages, but of sharing the cost among regions.  That is 
the real problem.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. David Anderson (Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, the rate scale, the scale was established by a

that is, Ontario and Quebec.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Harbance Singh Dhaliwal (Minister of National Revenue,

The distribution of petroleum products to various provinces and 
territories occurs after the excise taxes have been levied. 
Consequently, no figures are available showing excise taxes 
collected in each province and territory.  Moreover, excise tax 
licensees may report the excise taxes as a consolidated amount 
for all their Canadian production instead of by province of 
manufacture or production site.  Therefore, Revenue Canada 
neither requests nor captures excise fuel taxes data by province. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have, however, included the total excise fuel taxes collected 
for the fiscal years 1993-94 to 1997-98, broken down by revenue

and gasoline; and excise tax on aviation gas and diesel fuel.

</H3><P align=left>

<A NAME="LINK190">&nbsp;</A>
<P><A NAME="LINK191"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lucienne Robillard (for the Minister of Justice)</B> 
moved that Bill C-57, an act to amend the Nunavut Act with 
respect to the Nunavut Court of Justice and to amend other acts 
in consequence, be read the second time and referred to a 
committee. 
<P><A NAME="LINK192"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Nancy Karetak-Lindell (Nunavut, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I am very pleased to be able to introduce the debate on the 
motion for second reading of Bill C-57, an act to amend the 
Nunavut Act with respect to the Nunavut court of justice and to 
amend other acts in consequence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today we stand at the crossroads of a very important time in 
Canadian history.  On April 1, 1999, which is less than six 
months from now, the new territory of Nunavut will come into 
existence.  The creation of the new territory in the eastern 
Arctic is a realization of a long held dream of Inuit people. 
The realization of this dream is one to which we look forward to 
with great anticipation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As people of Nunavut we will have our own government and, as a 
result of Bill C-57, we will have our own unique court system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to emphasize that a new court structure will only become 
a reality for Nunavut if Bill C-57 is passed by the House by 
April 1, 1999.  I therefore hope that members will give this bill 
their utmost and urgent attention. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The original Nunavut bill, passed in 1993, contemplated a 
two-level trial court structure.  Members will recall that 
earlier this spring Bill C-39, an act to amend the Nunavut Act 
and the Constitution Act, 1867, included a number of amendments 
to clarify the operation of the two-level trial court system in 
Nunavut.  This two-level trial court structure is the default 
option if Bill C-57 is not passed before April 1, 1999. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When Bill C-39 was introduced the Minister of Indian Affairs and 
Northern Development indicated that a subsequent bill would be 
introduced later in the year to deal with court structure issues. 
Bill C-57 is the bill in question.  It is the last major piece of 
legislative structuring which the federal government has 
undertaken with regard to Nunavut. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-57 proposes changes to the Nunavut Act and other federal 
statues, including the Criminal Code, the Judges Act and the 
Young Offenders Act.  Amendments to the Nunavut Act are proposed 
to ensure that a single level trial court structure established 
at the superior court level is in place and that transitional 
cases are adequately dealt with. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Department of Justice worked closely with government 
officials in the Northwest Territories, as well as with Nunavut 
representatives to ensure that the appropriate territorial 
legislation will be passed before April 1, 1999 to provide for 
the operation of a single level trial court system in Nunavut. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Criminal Code amendments make the changes needed to 
accommodate a single level trial court structure within a 
criminal justice framework which is premised on two levels of 
trial court. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members may ask themselves what precisely is a single level 
trial court.  Let me answer that question as follows.  The single 
level trial court will combine into one court all of the duties, 
powers and functions performed elsewhere in Canada by two levels 
of court.  For constitutional reasons, the Nunavut court of 
justice will be established at the superior court level.  Its 
judges will be appointed by the federal government.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the people of Nunavut it will mean that all criminal, civil 
and family law matters will be dealt with by one court.  That 
court will be called the Nunavut court of justice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition to creating a new and innovative court system for 
Nunavut, Bill C-57 is also significant from another perspective. 
It represents another successful example of co-operative 
federalism. The development of the legislation in Bill C-57 
represents a high degree of co-operation between the federal 
government, the territorial government of the Northwest 
Territories and political leaders representing Nunavut. The 
interim commissioner of Nunavut and the parties to the Nunavut 
political accord formally asked the Minister of Justice to 
develop a single level trial court system for Nunavut. Bill C-57 
is the result of those efforts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am very pleased to say that throughout the process of 
developing the legislation, officials from the justice department 
worked very closely with northern leaders and the members of the 
northern legal community to ensure that the legislation was 
responsive to the needs of the Nunavut people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think it would be helpful for me to indicate some of the 
particular difficulties with the delivery of justice services 
identified by the residents of eastern Arctic as a prelude to 
explaining how the single level court structure is expected to 
bring improvements. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those members familiar with the delivery of justice in the 
eastern Arctic will know that with the exception of Iqaluit, 
court parties must fly into various communities of the eastern 
Arctic in order to deal with trial matters. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Currently there are two separate circuits, one for the 
territorial court and one for the supreme court.  Neither of 
these two courts will hear all matters arising in a particular 
community. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On average each of the courts visits a particular community only 
three or four times a year.  As a result there can be significant 
delays between the laying of a charge and the final determination 
of guilt or innocence, or in family law matters, resolution of 
custody issues for example. This can have a devastating effect on 
the parties and can lead to division within the community until 
the matter is resolved.  I can give some examples of what we have 
to go through with these court procedures. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Currently a court party will fly into a community. The lawyer 
arrives on the same plane with the court party.  In some cases 
the accused spends 15 minutes with the lawyer before the case is 
heard, because the lawyer has just arrived in that community. The 
accused has 15 minutes to talk with the lawyer. The future of the 
accused is to be determined in that little time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are also suicides directly related to people waiting for 
the dates of their court cases. I personally know of a young 
family where the husband took his life, leaving a wife and two 
children, because of the stress involved with waiting for a court 
case to come around. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The long waits between cases is just not healthy for anyone. All 
the communities are small and the accused and the victim have to 
live in the same community.  Consequently they have to see each 
other in the store and the community hall. They are forced to 
live near each other which is very stressful for both. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is also a strong desire in the north for more matters to 
be diverted from the formal justice system, or in criminal 
matters if charges are laid, to have the court cases heard by 
local justices of the peace.  Having matters dealt with in the 
community rather than by the circuit court enhances access to 
justice by removing time and distance barriers between the 
parties involved and the decision maker.  This would help address 
those situations which I just gave examples of.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The single level trial court structure has been designed with 
the expectation that with proper training a local justice of the 
peace will be able to conduct uncomplicated preliminary inquiries 
and summary conviction trials. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to give another example. The people of Nunavut are 
already preparing for this.  I recently attended a justice 
retreat in Rankin Inlet that identified priorities to be pursued. 
Training of justices of the peace was a very crucial priority. 
They are capable and will be more capable after the training they 
receive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would now like to describe in more detail some of the main 
features of the single level trial court.  They are expected to 
enhance both the accessibility and efficiency of the justice 
system in the eastern Arctic. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-57 makes changes to the Nunavut Act which will establish 
one trial court for Nunavut at the superior court level.  Whereas 
superior court judges currently fly in to the eastern Arctic from 
the western Arctic, changes to the Judges Act will provide for up 
to three full time superior court judge residents in Nunavut. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Nunavut Act and the Criminal Code will clearly provide that 
judges of the Nunavut court of justice will be superior court 
judges in all respects and will have all the inherent and 
statutory powers of the superior court judges. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Criminal Code will expressly give the judges of the Nunavut 
court of justice all the powers to deal with all criminal 
matters, even those normally performed elsewhere in Canada by 
officials or judges who are not superior court judges. Amendments 
to the Criminal Code will make clear, however, that when judges 
perform these duties or functions, they do not lose their status 
as superior court judges. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The practical benefit of this measure to the people of Nunavut 
will be that a single judge of the Nunavut court of justice will 
be able to deal with all matters on the court docket when he or 
she holds court in a particular community. It is anticipated that 
delay in the resolution of matters will be reduced and 
improvements in the efficiency of the court system will be 
achieved. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Justices of the peace will continue to do most of the pretrial 
matters. With the appropriate training they are expected to 
gradually assume more responsibility for conducting some 
preliminary inquiries and minor criminal trials. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the present time the Alberta Court of Appeal serves as the 
core of the court of appeal for the Northwest Territories.  This 
arrangement has worked very well. I am grateful that the judges 
of the Alberta Court of Appeal have agreed to continue their 
excellent work and their dedicated efforts in Nunavut. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Because of the need to assess the workload of the court of 
appeal in Nunavut sometime after the territory is established, we 
have decided that the Alberta Court of Appeal will act as the 
core of the court of appeal for Nunavut.  I expect that it will 
be assisted in its workload by resident northern superior court 
judges sitting as judges of the court of appeal. When the Nunavut 
government is in a position to do so, it may wish to consider 
other models for its court of appeal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The amendments in Bill C-57 relating to the summary conviction 
appeals reflect the fact that the trial function performed by two 
levels of court elsewhere in Canada will be combined into one 
court in Nunavut. In order to retain substantially equivalent 
rights of appeal, it was necessary to create an intermediate 
level of appeal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Where the Nunavut court of justice conducts a trial in respect 
of a summary conviction matter, an appeal will lie to a single 
judge of the court of appeal of Nunavut on the same grounds that 
apply in all summary conviction matters elsewhere in Canada. 
Appeals in respect of indictable matters will remain unchanged.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The policy behind the appeal structure regarding summary 
conviction appeals is to provide parties in Nunavut with 
substantive and procedural rights equivalent to those available 
to other parties elsewhere in Canada. It might be argued that 
this approach undermines the status of judges of the Nunavut 
court of justice as superior court judges. I think it is more 
important to characterize this feature as a necessary choice 
resulting from a desire to protect the rights of parties before 
the court within a Criminal Code structure that is designed for a 
two level rather than a single level trial court. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Just as in the case of all other jurisdictions in Canada, a 
secondary level of appeal on much more restricted grounds will be 
available to a three person panel of the court of appeal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-57 will provide that decisions in summary conviction 
trials conducted in the community before a justice of the peace 
can be appealed to a judge of the Nunavut court of justice and 
then on further appeal to a three person panel of the court of 
appeal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition to appeal rights, a statutory review measure has 
been designed to serve as a faster, interim, error correcting 
mechanism with respect to key decisions which may be made by 
judges of the Nunavut court of justice.  I must again emphasize 
that in formulating this statutory form of review, our goal has 
been to provide substantially the same kind of relief that is 
available to parties to criminal proceedings elsewhere in Canada 
through prerogative writ review. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-57 will provide a new form of statutory review that is 
limited in scope to key decision points in the criminal justice 
process where an expeditious form of review is essential. The 
review will lie to a single judge of the court of appeal of 
Nunavut. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Prerogative writ review as embodied in the Criminal Code and in 
the common law will continue to apply to the decisions of 
justices of the peace and other inferior officials in Nunavut. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Changes to the Young Offenders Act made in Bill C-57 are not of 
a policy nature but are restricted to those which are necessary 
to accommodate the operation of a single level trial court in 
Nunavut. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, Bill C-57 makes changes to the Young Offenders Act 
to provide an appeal scheme which parallels that available for 
adults in Nunavut.  This is in respect of the summary conviction 
matters heard by the Nunavut court of justice sitting as a youth 
court.  As in the adult system, these appeals will be heard by a 
single judge of the court of appeal for Nunavut with a secondary 
right of appeal on more restricted grounds to a three person 
panel of the court of appeal for Nunavut. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-57 also adapts the elections provisions in the Young 
Offenders Act to reflect the fact that for murder trials held in 
youth court in Nunavut, the choice for youth will be the Nunavut 
court of justice sitting as a youth court either alone or with a 
jury. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Amendments to the Judges Act will provide for three superior 
court judges on the Nunavut court of justice all of whom will be 
resident in Nunavut.  Bill C-57 will also amend the Judges Act to 
provide for full membership in the Canadian Judicial Council for 
the senior judge of each of the three territories. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At this point I should add that Bill C-57 also makes various 
consequential amendments to three other federal statutes to 
ensure that they accommodate a single level trial court structure 
in Nunavut.  In many instances these changes amount to simply 
changing the name of the relevant court or judge in definition 
sections of the act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am very pleased to be able to say that the amendments in Bill 
C-57 to establish a single level trial court structure for 
Nunavut are entirely consistent with the recommendations of the 
Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples.  Establishing the Nunavut 
court of justice reflects the longstanding desire of the people 
and leaders of Nunavut to create a new institution which is more 
suited to our unique traditions, culture and needs.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This court reform reflects the desire of the Nunavut people to 
have an accessible and integrated justice system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Nunavut court of justice will have the authority to hear all 
criminal, civil and family matters.  It is expected to work in 
harmony with justices of the peace who will have an important and 
perhaps growing role in providing speedy and culturally sensitive 
responses to crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government's response to the recommendations of the royal 
commission on aboriginal people called for a new partnership with 
aboriginal people.  The consultative manner in which the single 
level trial court structure was designed is an example of such a 
partnership. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am confident that the future direction in justice reform in 
Nunavut will evolve in the continued spirit of this equal 
partnership and will become increasingly responsive to the unique 
needs of this new territory. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I call on all members in the House to support Bill C-57 to 
establish this very innovative court structure for the new 
territory of Nunavut. It would also help if the justice committee 
could have the hearings in my riding so it can hear directly from 
the people and see the beautiful riding of Nunavut. 
<P><A NAME="LINK193"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Reynolds (West Vancouver—Sunshine Coast, Ref.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the comments by the member for 
Nunavut.  I know the comments about the beauty of the riding are 
very accurate, as I have been there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member started off by saying the bill must be passed by 
April 1, 1999.  I can assure the member that we are not going to 
do much on this side of the House to speed up any dates but the 
member's government brings in closure so often it will make sure 
it gets whatever it wants by that date. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This takes me back to when this legislation first came to this 
House in 1993 at the end of the time of the previous Tory 
government.  The member for Edmonton North will recall it very 
well because she was in the House at that time, a lone Reformer, 
and tried to stop the bill at that time because she wanted to 
have a look at it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill was nearly 300 pages and parliamentarians had one week 
to look at the bill.  The member for Edmonton North who was back 
in the corner kept yelling no to unanimous consent but was 
ignored by the Chair and was told later on she was not a party so 
it did not matter anyway. That bill was railroaded through the 
House. I think it was a sad day for democracy in the way it was 
handled by that government in 1993. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was reminded of this when the member talked about having this 
bill by April 1 of next year.  The member does not have to worry 
because her government will do what it has to do to get this 
legislation through. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I congratulate also the local officials in Nunavut.  They have 
done a great job in getting this government to put up a lot of 
money.  I look at this bill and three superior court judges for 
the Nunavut court of justice.  As the member says, it creates a 
single level trial court system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why is this different from the rest of Canada?  The rest of 
Canada has a different system.  Why are we giving a part of our 
country a different system of justice? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>People might say it is the Northwest Territories.  It is a big 
area.  It is widespread.  I remind people that other provinces, 
Quebec and British Columbia to name just two, have asked for 
changes to our constitution.  These provinces do not get these 
changes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What this government is doing with this legislation is creating 
another province.  It is still called a territory but this 
government has given it all the powers of a province. This 
government knows it could not have passed it if it tried to get 
it through as a province because it needs the agreement of seven 
provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What really disturbs me is when we have special treatment for 
one area of Canada, an area with 26,000 people, a long way from 
Ottawa.  We have a lot of people in British Columbia a long way 
from Ottawa and a long way from parts of civilization.

<A HREF="#LINKT22"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill talks about 26,000 people and 350,000 square 
kilometres.  That is a large area.  I wonder how many people in 
the House know that the four northern ridings in British Columbia 
are double that size, 700,000 square kilometres.  The Skeena 
riding is 244,569 square kilometres itself.  It is two-thirds the 
size.  The Prince George—Peace River riding is 217,188 square 
kilometres. Caribou—Chilcotin is 120,000 square kilometres. 
Prince George—Bulkley Valley is 100,000 square kilometres. Those 
people would like the same things that are happening there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Go to the north of British Columbia.  People have to go all the 
way to Vancouver to go to court.  There are the same concerns 
that member had. “I saw my lawyer only for a few minutes.  I 
need more time”.  Why are we allowing this area of the country 
to get special treatment?  We should use the same law system we 
have for the rest of Canada.  There should be not difference just 
because it is in the far north of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federally appointed judges are going to make $180,000 a 
year.  The releases from the government showed a much lower 
figure but did not include the raises these judges are going to 
get.  It also includes expenses which I will go into in a minute. 
They are all appointed at the federal level.  That is a scary 
thought in itself.  There is no input at the local level. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Do we need this kind of expensive court?  There will be three 
judges at $180,000 a year plus their expenses.  They will get up 
to $300,000 or $400,000 each to operate.  It will be well over a 
$1 million.  There will be three expensive supreme court judges 
who will sit on cases like dog-napping.  That is not what we need 
in this country.  It is not good legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are many questions we want to ask about those areas when 
we get into committee.  I am looking forward to getting this bill 
into committee so we can some answers as to why the government 
made some of these decisions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The legislation calls for one senior judge and two other judges. 
As I said earlier, the salaries are very misleading.  They do not 
take into case the new salary increases and also further 
increases.  They will also receive an unaccountable yearly 
allowance of $6,000. They also get their regular expenses.  The 
senior judge from the court of the Yukon territory, the senior 
judge from the court of the Northwest Territories and the senior 
judge from the Nunavut court of justice will each receive an 
additional $5,000 per year.  That is $11,000 per year in 
unaccountable expenses.  That brings the cost of the senior judge 
to close to $200,000.  It seems that is an awful lot of money to 
have a judge for a territory that has 26,000 people and will have 
a workload that is nowhere near the workload we have in large 
cities like Montreal, Toronto and Vancouver.  I know the workload 
those judges have. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know in the north they have to travel.  But we also have that 
in the rest of Canada.  We cannot get to Atlin, B.C. from British 
Columbia.  We have to fly in from Yukon or Alaska. They are not 
alone in the Northwest Territories or Nunavut in having these 
problems.  We have them in British Columbia.  We have them other 
parts of Canada like northern Quebec.  Yet we have not made 
special cases and set up a separate law system to satisfy those 
needs let alone given these provinces what they have asked for in 
changes to the Constitution.  That seems rather strange to me. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Quebec and British Columbia have had a lot of complaints about 
how the federal government runs things.  We represent a major 
portion of Canada yet we have not been able to convince this 
government to do any where near what it is doing for a territory 
with 26,000 people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am sure my constituents have some sympathy for the fact that 
areas in the north have big territories.  But they would wonder 
why we have one member of parliament from Nunavut representing 
26,000 people.  Four members of parliament from British Columbia 
represent an area of 700,000 square kilometres. There are four 
million people in British Columbia.  It is not fair.  This is not 
one person equal representation.  We have gone out of our way to 
set things aside. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I understand that some of the things are fair.  They need to 
happen because of where it is.

<A HREF="#LINKT23"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is going a little overboard setting up a separate and very 
expensive justice system and an unneeded justice system.   There 
are probably better ways of doing this.  In New Zealand, for 
instance, appointed people work at the local level with not only 
the victims but with the criminals for the good of the community 
concerning small and non-violent crimes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We certainly do not need three $200,000 a year judges to be 
looking into this type of thing in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The budget for this is going to come out of the yearly allocated 
budget for Nunavut's implementation which is $32 million. This is 
not a small amount of money.  This account is to run until the 
year 2008, at a total estimated operating cost of $520 million. 
That is roughly $20,000 for every man, woman and child there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wonder who has made those decisions.  Were those decisions 
thought out back in 1993 when this bill was railroaded through 
this House? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is another account for advising on the creation of Nunavut 
to the Nunavut implementation commission.  This account is set at 
$2.3 million for 1997-98 up from $1.9 million last year.  I 
wonder how high that is going to go up every year.  When do all 
these costs stop?  When does somebody stand on his or her own two 
feet and continue operating on without taking from the rest of 
Canada? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Land claims are one thing but creating a new province or 
territory is another.  When this legislation was presented they 
should have gone all the way and said that if they were going to 
do it they should make it a province, as we should make the 
Northwest Territories and Yukon a province.  Let it go before the 
people of Canada, according to our Constitution, where all the 
provinces get a vote on it, and let us solve the issue once and 
for all instead of going through these expensive processes which 
also create problems in other parts of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am sure the member from that area likes what has happened.  I 
am sure I also would if I were their member of parliament also. 
However, it gets more difficult to explain to other Canadians who 
are paying the tax bills when they see the cost per person of 
doing what we are doing and the continuing costs and where they 
are going to end. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also suspect, and it is so obvious because we see it happen so 
often in this House, that when one bill comes in one has to 
wonder how many bills are down the road because the first bill 
was not done properly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If this bill had been thought out properly in 1993 we would not 
have it now being rushed through the House, being given one week 
to look at a major change to our country and then to have closure 
brought in.  They now call it time allocation but I was around 
when they did not use that term.  Just the word closure meant 
something.  Only if debates were taking a really long time, maybe 
a month or two, would the government bring in closure.  Today 
this government brings it in regularly to run the House of 
Commons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can go back and quote many times when the government House 
leader on the other side yelled and screamed in this House when 
he was in opposition and the Tory government was bringing in 
closure.  They are the ones who changed this rule.  It was a sad 
day for Canada when they did it.  Debates used to take place in 
the House of Commons, every member had an opportunity to speak on 
every bill and the speeches were longer.  Some people might have 
thought it was a waste of time but democracy is not a waste of 
time.  It may be inconvenient to the government of the day but it 
is not a waste of time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why this bill is not one that we can say it is just a 
very simple thing adding on to a major bill that passed in this 
House.  We accept the fact that it passed.  The one member from 
the Reform Party who was here at that time voted against it. We 
can tell it was wrong when it was done because now we have this 
legislation coming along.  The government even says there might 
be even more bills coming out of the enabling variety which will 
be very expensive to the people of Canada.  That is what concerns 
my party and that is why we cannot support this bill in its 
present stage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When this bill gets to committee we will have a lot of questions 
that we know the people of Canada would like answered.  We hope 
the government will be prepared to answer those questions at 
committee.  We hope government members will be able to tell us 
why they can do that in this part of Canada when they cannot do 
things in other parts of Canada. I am sure a lot of my colleagues 
over the next few days in this debate will be asking those 
questions.

questions.  We will work with them in committee to make the 
changes that are necessary so the people of Canada can better

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ghislain Fournier (Manicouagan, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, as a 
member of the Standing Committee on Aboriginal Affairs and 
Northern Development for the Bloc Quebecois, I am pleased to 
rise today and speak to Bill C-57, an act to amend the Nunavut 
Act with respect to the Nunavut Court of Justice and to amend 
other Acts in consequence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The purpose of this bill is to amend the Criminal Code so that 
it reflects the realities of the new territory of Nunavut and to 
make it possible to establish an operational government before 
April 1, 1999, the territory's official launch date. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-57 is part of the process that began in 1992 with the 
territorial land agreement setting out the legal and political 
framework of the new territory of Nunavut.  Approved in June 
1993, the creation of Nunavut is a result of passage of Bill 
C-39, which we debated in the House last year and which provides 
for the holding of a legislative election, while facilitating 
the transition and legitimizing the process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill before us this afternoon is part of this ongoing 
process. It is the last building block, as it were, in the 
political and legal structure that will allow the inhabitants of 
this territory to at last be ready for April 1999 and the 
challenges then to follow. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can only express my satisfaction that legislation is being 
introduced in order to give the inhabitants of Nunavut all the 
political, and more particularly in the case before us today, 
all the legislative instruments they will need. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This will enable them to have a court that meets their needs and 
that is closer to them. We know that the establishment of 
institutions of law is vital to government autonomy.  Bill C-57 
will permit this to happen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Everything indicates that the creation of Nunavut set for April 
1, 1999 is well on its way.  I recall that Bill C-39 on Nunavut 
and the Constitution Act of 1867 passed at third reading in 
June, changes the map of Canada's north with the creation of 
this immense territory. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since Newfoundland joined Confederation in 1949, Canada's 
borders have not been changed.  This indicates clearly just what 
a historic moment the creation of Nunavut represents and also 
explains the importance of its creation to the people living 
there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Northwest Territories will therefore, with the creation of 
this territory, be divided into two separate entities.  Nunavut 
includes the lands in the centre and east of the Northwest 
Territories, above the 60th parallel.  It therefore covers some 
2 million square kilometres, one fifth of Canada's land mass.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This immense territory is divided into three regions and 
includes 28 communities.  The most southeasterly point of 
Nunavut meets northern Labrador.  Nunavut is also bordered by 
water.  Its most northerly part touches the shores of the Arctic 
Ocean.  On the east, Baffin Bay divides Nunavut.  In the south, 
Nunavut joins the waters of Hudson's Bay and Ungava Bay. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Eighty per cent of the population of Nunavut is Inuit, that is, 
some 17,500 persons of the 22,000 total population.  So the 
Inuit are in the majority.  In fact, the word Nunavut means our 
land in Inuktitut, the language of the Inuit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before I go any further, I want to say that the Bloc Quebecois 
is in favour of the principle of Bill C-57, which takes 
thousands of aboriginal people one step closer to strong, viable 
self-government. To put this bill into perspective, let me 
outline a number of element of Bill C-39 passed last year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-39 enables the Inuit in the Nunavut to administer 1,9 
million kilometres of their land through a legislative assembly 
elected by universal suffrage. It amends the Nunavut Act passed 
by Parliament in 1993. It provides for a transition period and 
for the powers of the federal and territorial governments to be 
devolved to the Nunavut territorial government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This legislation provides, by amending the Constitutional Act, 
1867, that the people of this territory will be represented in 
the House of Commons and the Senate. 
The primary purpose of Bill C-39 was to allow elections to be 
held so that the Nunavut Legislative Assembly would be 
established before April 1, 1999, so that representatives of the 
Inuit of Nunavut could to serve their constituents in an 
operational legislature when their territory was officially 
created. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, Bill C-39 amends the Constitutional Act, 1867, to 
ensure Nunavut is represented in the House of Commons and the 
Senate, as are the Yukon and the Northwest Territories. It also 
authorises the transfer of governmental services from the 
Northwest Territories and Ottawa to Nunavut during the 
transition period. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The transfer of services and programs in culture, health and 
public housing should be completed by the year 2009. As members 
can imagine, much work has to be done by April 1, 1999. 
That is why I am pleased to notice that Bill C-57 is the final 
element in the legal and administrative component of the 
establishment of the Inuit territory of Nunavut. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A brief reminder before getting into Bill C-57: the Bloc 
Quebecois did not oppose Bill C-39. In fact, we voted for this 
bill, which was the outcome of years of negotiations in which 
the organization representing the Inuit of Canada, Inuit 
Tapirisat of Canada, took part. This organization has been 
involved in the negotiation process since the 1970s.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would point out that it took two referendums—in 1982 and in 
1992—to establish the boundaries of the territory and for all 
to agree on them.  The Bloc Quebecois did not oppose legislation 
that gives substance to over 25 years of negotiation and that 
permits the Inuit, one of Canada's great peoples, to assume its 
rightful place on this continent and to take its destiny in 
hand. In becoming masters of their own house, the Inuit will 
have all the political, economic and legal tools they need to 
grow and govern themselves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In June, my colleague, the Bloc Quebecois critic on native 
affairs said in this House “Thanks to Bill C-39, the Inuit will 
be in control and they will have all the necessary economic, 
political, social and cultural levers to look after their 
development and government on their own. This way, they will be 
able to act in their own best interest, for the good of their 
community, ensuring the harmonious development of their 
territory”.  I support and share these remarks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We did however raise a cautionary note in June, that of Nunavut 
representation in the Senate.  The Bloc Quebecois has nothing 
against that fact that the Inuit want representation.  However, 
in the preceding parliament, we in the Bloc took steps to 
abolish this outdated and ineffective institution known as the 
Senate.  It is needlessly costly to Quebeckers and Canadians. 
It is archaic.  The Senate functions thanks to political 
paybacks.  Political appointments take away all the credibility 
and objectivity need in the processes of legislating and 
sanctioning legislation. 
This objectivity is vital.  However, despite these reservations, 
we proposed no amendment, unlike the Reformers, who tried to get 
a Senate reform through an amendment to this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I might mention another point we raised last year, which 
continues to concern me.  It involves the coastal islands in 
James Bay, at the southern end of Hudson's Bay and north of 
Nunavik, Quebec.  Since 1977, the James Bay Cree and the Nunavik 
Inuit have been wanting to negotiate with Indian and Northern 
Affairs Canada the recognition of their rights over the waters, 
the surrounding ice and resources. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Negotiations were broken off in 1977.  It appears this was 
because of a dispute concerning compensation and the status of 
the regions. 
With the creation of Nunavut in the works, the Crees and Inuit 
of northern Quebec would like to resume their dialogue with the 
Department of Indian and Northern Affairs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The September 24 announcement by the Department of Indian and 
Northern Affairs that a chief federal negotiator had been 
appointed to deal with the offshore claims of the Grand Council 
of the Crees of Quebec is a good sign.  Let us hope that 
negotiations will indeed resume and that, this time, they will 
lead to constructive decisions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Representatives of the Grand Council of the Crees of Quebec 
appeared before the Standing Committee on Aboriginal Affairs and 
Northern Development last spring, during consideration of the 
Nunavut bill.  They expressed their concerns regarding this 
bill, as it affected their own claims. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although they say they support the creation of Nunavut, they 
would like the Indian Affairs minister to demonstrate a serious 
commitment to the resumption of negotiations designed to 
recognize their rights within the boundaries of the new 
territory.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I therefore hope that this appointment represents a clear 
undertaking by the Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern 
Development and her officials to negotiate with the Crees of 
Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us now return more specifically to Bill C-57.  In order to be 
ready by April 1999, Nunavut must have at its disposal all the 
necessary legislative instruments now.  This is what Bill C-57 
is all about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The transfer of certain jurisdictions of territorial and federal 
governments to Nunavut is not a simple matter.  This transfer is 
nonetheless vital and responds to the needs of the far north. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Indeed, Bill C-57 responds to a request made to the Minister of 
Justice by those who worked to ensure self-government, with the 
support of Inuit organizations in Nunavut. The bill establishes 
a single-level trial court system for the territory of Nunavut. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This tribunal, to be known as the Nunavut Court of Justice, is 
created to provide an efficient and accessible court structure 
capable of responding to the unique needs of Nunavut while, at 
the same time, maintaining rights equivalent to those enjoyed 
elsewhere in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So, we will have the Nunavut Court of Justice in the new Nunavut 
territory. This tribunal will replace the existing Supreme Court 
of the Northwest Territories as the superior court, and the 
territorial court as the lower court. 
Bill C-57 amends once again the Nunavut Act, which was passed in 
1993, under the Progressive Conservative government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill also amends the Judges Act to provide for three 
superior court judges on the Nunavut Court of Justice and also 
to provide for full membership in the Canadian Judicial Council 
for the senior judge of each of the territories. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Indeed, given the expanded jurisdiction of that tribunal, it is 
important to make sure that the judges will be competent to hear 
cases from the lower and superior courts, with the exception of 
those cases that come under the jurisdiction of specialized and 
administrative tribunals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill also amends the Criminal Code to provide for new 
structures and procedures for the Nunavut Court of Justice in 
the following areas: jurisdiction of the judges; summary 
conviction appeals; a new statutory form of review; judicial 
interim release; and elections as to mode of trial. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-57 also amends the Young Offenders Act to ensure adequate 
structures and procedures for a single-level trial court, 
consistent with those in the Criminal Code and with various 
other federal statutes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The creation of this court of justice will ensure a flexible and 
efficient legal process for the whole territory of Nunavut. By 
making the court competent to hear any case, whether it involves 
a minor wrongdoing or a serious criminal offence, we give the 
people of the territory access to a service that is more 
consistent with its reality. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>From now on, when a judge travels to some small community in 
Nunavut, he will have broader powers. 
It must be understood that the multiplicity of jurisdictions, in 
other words a multi-faceted court system, useful in high density 
urban centres, is not necessarily useful in the proper 
administration of justice in a territory such as Nunavut.

<A HREF="#LINKT28"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is why legislation must be passed on this issue and to 
permit the necessary changes to be made to the various laws 
that, up to now, have granted various jurisdictions authority to 
hear various cases.  Bill C-57 provides the changes needed for 
the establishment and operation of this court of justice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The structure of the court reflects the peculiarities of the 
eastern Arctic.  The judges of the Nunavut Court of Justice will 
therefore be able to hear all criminal, family and civil cases. 
In other words, this new court structure is simpler and better 
suits the needs of the people of the new territory. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In closing, I would like to add that we will, in the coming 
weeks, study in greater depth this bill, which appeared suddenly 
on the legislative menu.  A meeting with the officials of the 
Department of Justice would be most appreciated once we have 
started the process of examining the bill.  It would enable us 
to better target the issues in this legislation and the many 
implications for existing legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We would be further enlightened by meetings with the principle 
stakeholders. 
The law establishing Nunavut and subsequent legislation 
permitting good political, administrative and legal management 
of the territory, are the product of 25 years of effort and 
struggle by the Inuit to regain control over their land. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can only praise these efforts, and like my colleague who is 
the Bloc Quebecois critic in this area, I wish them success in 
meeting the challenges that they will face. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, I repeat that we support this bill and that we 
will continue to support the principle of action that, like Bill 
C-57, enables peoples to acquire what they need to enable their 
identity to grow to its fullest.

<P><A NAME="LINK195"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Louise Hardy (Yukon, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the first 
thing I saw about Bill C-57 was the newspaper headline “Nunavut 
gets unique court system, single level of justice seen as ideal 
for the vast territories”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is important because it is true and it sets an incredibly 
high standard for the north.  The Yukon Territory and the 
Northwest Territories are going to want to match this standard of 
justice.  Where Nunavut goes, the others are sure to follow. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In speaking of the high standard, Nunavut is really to be 
envied. It is a territory that is able to start from scratch. It 
is creating a justice system that is going to suit the people, 
that is going to be accountable to them, that is going to respond 
to them.  Because Nunavut has an official language, a First 
Nations language, the court will now have to respond to people in 
their own language. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Justice is an expression of our sovereignty.  Even though there 
are only 26,000 people in Nunavut, only so many people in the 
Northwest Territories and only so many people in Yukon, does that 
mean they are not entitled to justice?  Does it mean that because 
it costs too much we cannot have justice?  Does it mean we can 
only have a court once a year because we are just too far away, 
or do we just scoop everyone up and send them somewhere else to 
have justice administered to them? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill is important because it is very clear in the 
parameters of what our country is and should be.  Even if a 
person lives in some nook, cranny or frozen place, justice 
belongs to them as it does to everyone else in this country.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the north, justice is often like a big woolly mammoth that 
has come trundling into town trampling all over everything. It 
leaves behind this big mess and a community in disarray. People 
from that community are sent off to a federal penitentiary 
thousands of miles away.  If they have to serve anything more 
than two years less a day, they are out of their territory. 
There is no community support.  It is absolutely devastating to 
try to reintegrate back into the community after that time.  The 
Judges Act will deal in part with some of those issues because it 
would bring justice closer to the people of the north. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I recently held a town hall in the north on justice issues and 
the discussion paper the justice minister put out on the defences 
of provocation, self-defence and defence of property.  People did 
not necessarily want to talk about just those issues.  They 
wanted to discuss the broader topic of justice and how people 
felt so alienated from it, that justice did not belong to them. 
The legal system really has nothing to do with anybody. This 
justice system and the single level of court will allow people to 
feel a part of a justice system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>People in the north have always been pushing for change to make 
a more accountable system, something that does not just put 
people away without any recourse.  In fact they have been 
pioneers in community justice in developing circle sentencing. I 
sat in on one of the first circle sentencings and others in 
subsequent years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Circle sentencing is not an easy or a light process.  It demands 
an incredible amount of dedication from the communities involved. 
We can compare it to putting someone in custody where usually two 
or three shifts of people, including cooks and cleaners, look 
after those in custody.  In circle sentencing, if one person 
agrees to look after someone who has been sentenced, it means 
they have only the resources of themselves and the community to 
keep an eye on and to help encourage and push that person toward 
a better way of life.  It is a huge undertaking. Any community or 
individual that is willing to go through circle sentencing 
deserves a lot of recognition for the work they do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When it comes to justice for First Nations people, and there are 
a lot of First Nations people in the north, everyone knows they 
are poor.  They live in third world conditions.  They fill most 
of the prisons across this country and are overrepresented. Their 
cultures are not taken into account.  Their social condition is 
reprehensible. It is not right to send everybody off to federal 
penitentiaries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Jumping to the meat and bones of the bill, it creates a single 
level court system for the territory.  It will maintain the 
substantive and procedural rights equivalent to those enjoyed 
elsewhere in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A single level court system may not have too much meaning for 
those who have not been involved in justice in the territories. 
Generally there is the federal level.  A crown prosecutor is 
appointed and an accused may go in front of this judge or may 
wait until a particular level of court is available to hear the 
accused. The federal appointment comes from Ottawa.  Therefore, 
it is not necessary that they respond to the community they serve 
because it is not their boss by any stretch of the imagination. 
This certainly makes them less responsive to community demands. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The single level trial system will have regular and more 
frequent resolution of cases.  This is critical in small northern 
communities as the isolation can be quite unbearable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill amends the Criminal Code to provide for new structures 
and procedures for the Nunavut court of justice in the following 
areas:  the jurisdiction of judges; the summary conviction 
appeals; a new statutory form of review; judicial interim 
release; and elections as to mode of trial.  Again one of the 
official languages is First Nations and so the court will have to 
respond to that as well. The legislation has some unique parts. I 
will read amended subsection 35(1) of the Nunavut Act: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>A judge of the Nunavut Court of Justice has and may exercise and 
perform, anywhere in Canada, all the powers, duties and functions 
of the Court with respect to any criminal offence committed or 
charged to have been committed in Nunavut. 
</UL>
<This is consistent with some of the First Nations that have 
implemented self-government in the Yukon and are developing their 
own laws.  Some First Nations communities believe that the law of 
a First Nations community should follow its members.  They cannot 
escape the set of standards or moral framework within which they 
live just by leaving their band.  That certainly extends 
accountability.  It is interesting that it is in the bill to 
establish the court system.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have one main reservation with this bill which concerns the 
appointment of judges.  There is no screening process in 
parliament for federal judge appointments.  Candidates do not 
come before the parliamentary committees for justice or 
aboriginal affairs.  We cannot expect the same level of 
responsiveness and accountability that would be there if the 
territory itself were nominating and screening the judges they 
want for their courts.  That is a big concern because it echoes 
what is going on here already.  That is one thing we should not 
carry forward in creating the new system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The NDP will be supporting this bill, with some reservations.  I 
look forward to considering it in committee. 
<P><A NAME="LINK196"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Werner Schmidt (Kelowna, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I found 
that statement extremely interesting.  It had a lot of 
compassion.  I certainly support it.  The need for justice to be 
delivered in Canada or anywhere else is very important.  I 
appreciate very much the hon. member's plea to have justice given 
to these people.  I could not agree more.  There should be just 
sentencing that should take into account all of the things that 
matter.  It should be as close to the people as possible.  It 
should be swift.  Those are all extremely useful kinds of 
situations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also share the member's reservations about the appointment of 
judges. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, why would we support a different kind of justice 
structure?  I support the principles the hon. member supports, 
but why would we have a different system?  Why would she support 
a different system for one part of Canada, a system that does not 
exist in other parts of Canada?  Is there a particular reason 
that justice in the Nunavut territory should be administered 
differently than it is administered in other parts of Canada?  I 
fail to see it.  It seems that by definition justice has some 
kind of standard component.  Justice, after all, is justice.  We 
want to be treated fairly and equally before the law.  Why should 
we have a different system in one part of Canada than we have in 
another? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Louise Hardy:</B>  Mr. Speaker, according to my way of 
thinking, justice is responsive to those who it serves.  That 
does not mean the laws change, it just means that the way we 
handle the situation changes.  Because the justice system is not 
working in the rest of Canada does not mean that Nunavut should 
not take the step to make its justice system work for it by 
having the courts there more regularly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those who live in a large centre have a court.  They know they 
will be able to access that court, but that is not the case for 
people living in the north.  They have to wait until the circuit 
comes to them.  This sort of nomadic court system is a strain on 
those people who always have to be travelling, but they are 
willing to undertake that to make sure justice is swift and 
accessible— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Werner Schmidt:</B>  But that is not what we are talking 
about.  We are taking about a single level of courts here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Louise Hardy:</B>  That is important.  That is a good 
change.  That is what they need, that is what they want and that 
is what they have defined. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Werner Schmidt:</B>  Why should they do that?  That is the 
question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Louise Hardy:</B>  One reason is that there will be less 
cost because there will only be one level of judges to pay. 
Nunavut will not be paying at the federal and territorial levels, 
but only at one level.  There will only be one circuit, not two 
or three.  It will go to the same community, but will deal with 
different issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe justice should be able to move forward and change. 
Laws should be alive.  They should not be dead issues.  If they 
were we would have a very hard time when a decision came out the 
other end because it would be so upsetting and we would not know 
how it happened.  If we as citizens were involved with our 
justice system, then we would not be shocked at discrepancies in 
sentencing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Who is this judge coming to my community?  They have no idea who 
they are.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Reed Elley (Nanaimo—Cowichan, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
appreciate the comment of my hon. colleague, saying that she 
feels justice should be responsive.  I certainly agree with that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we are trying to get at is the question of equality, not 
only equality before the law, but equality of access to services 
right across the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would my colleague be in favour of us taking a look at this kind 
of system working in the vast territories of northern B.C. where 
there are huge areas that are even larger than Nunavut?  The same 
kinds of problems and the same kinds of concerns are faced by 
people in northern B.C. as in Nunavut about getting access to the 
legal system and having to travel long distances. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Sometimes concerns are generated by the people of northern B.C. 
native communities who have to go all the way to Vancouver for 
trials and that sort of thing.  Would the member be open to 
seeing something like this work in northern B.C.? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Louise Hardy:</B>  Absolutely, Mr. Speaker.  It should be 
extended.  For example Atlin, B.C. is barely 100 miles from 
Whitehorse, Yukon.  It would make sense for those people to be 
able to access a justice system very close to them because that 
is where they travel to buy their groceries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We could look at a whole system for remote areas of the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-57 could set the precedent.  If people in Nunavut have 
it, do not other people in Canada deserve as much? 
<P><A NAME="LINK198"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Roy Bailey (Souris—Moose Mountain, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I agree with the hon. member for Yukon and my colleague 
in that people living in remote areas should be as close to the 
justice system as possible.  I believe that we owe that to the 
people in the remote areas of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But I have a concern.  Was the hon. member thinking that maybe 
decisions by the judges would be different in remote areas than 
they would be if the committing of a crime was 200 miles south? 
Is there a difference in the interpretation and in the punitive 
measures?  Is that what the member meant?  If not, then just 
count me wrong on that, but I kind of got that impression from 
what she was saying. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Louise Hardy:</B>  Mr. Speaker, no, that is not what I 
meant.  The laws of Canada are the laws of the territories.  It 
is just the method of making the courts and justice accessible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A lot of work is being done in the areas of circle sentencing 
and community justice initiatives.  That outcome might be 
different and I would hope we would move to more changes that 
way. 
<P><A NAME="LINK199"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Gouk (Kootenay—Boundary—Okanagan, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, there is something that gives me great concern.  Perhaps 
the hon. member, being from the territory, might have the answer 
because there are more horrors coming out of this bill every time 
I take a quick look at it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Right now in any province if a person commits a relatively minor 
offence they are convicted and if they appeal the decision it 
will go to the provincial appeals court.  In the Northwest 
Territories right now it is appealed to the provincial appeals 
court of Alberta.  However, under this proposed legislation 
persons will be convicted by a federal court judge. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to know what the appeal process is for that. 
Because a person has been convicted by a federal court judge, 
will that person be required to appeal it to the Supreme Court of 
Canada?  If that is so, the cost would be horrendous and I would 
suggest that the Supreme Court of Canada would refuse to hear 
appeals on dog-napping and relatively minor offences, as well it 
should.  But that means that the people of Nunavut will lose 
their right of appeal. 
They are not going to have the same access to justice as someone 
from the Northwest Territories, from Yukon or from the provinces 
of Canada.

Nunavut. 
<P><A NAME="LINK200"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gerald Keddy (South Shore, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is my 
pleasure to rise today to speak to Bill C-57, an act to amend the 
Nunavut Act with respect to the Nunavut court of justice and to 
amend other acts in consequence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to state that I will be sharing my time today with 
the member for Tobique—Mactaquac. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill amends the judicial system and the appointment of 
judges in the new territory of Nunavut which will be created on 
April 1, 1999. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This new territory is being created as part of the Nunavut land 
claim agreement, originally signed by the Progressive 
Conservative government in 1993. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will repeat this for the benefit of everyone in the House 
because I have heard several people state the size of the new 
territory and no one has been right yet.  For the record, the new 
territory will be 2,242,000 square kilometres, which is 
approximately one-fifth the size of Canada and 69% of the 
existing Northwest Territories. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important to ensure that a smooth transition occurs in 
April when Nunavut comes into effect.  Obviously it is imperative 
to have a judicial system in place and to have the necessary 
people appointed and in place to begin work on April 1, 1999. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The amendments put forward by this legislation are going to 
establish a unique court system in Canada.  Currently all 
Canadian jurisdictions operate with a two-court system where a 
provincial or a territorial court works in conjunction with a 
higher court, either a Queen's bench or a supreme court, 
depending on the terminology used.  This legislation will 
implement a one-court system unique to the eastern Arctic. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This legislation to amend the Nunavut Act is necessary because 
under the original act a two-level court system would be 
implemented in the new territory.  By amending the act the Inuit 
of Nunavut hope the judicial system will more accurately reflect 
their traditions.  Whether this will be the result remains 
questionable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the concerns of the Inuit is the location of prisons. 
Currently there is no federal facility in the north, so anyone 
serving a sentence of more than two years must go to a facility 
in the south.  The only other option is an exchange agreement 
whereby a regional facility would agree to house the inmate. 
This issue, however, while important to the Inuit, is separate 
from the judicial system and not addressed by this legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With these amendments there will be three judges appointed to 
travel to the various outlying communities in the new territory 
of Nunavut.  These three judges will preside over civil, criminal 
and family cases.  Currently the judge who presides over all of 
the cases in the eastern Arctic also follows this system for most 
civil and criminal cases.  She is based in Iqaluit and travels to 
the remote communities as required.  Cases dealing with issues 
such as divorce and adoption, however, are referred to the 
supreme court based in Yellowknife. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under this legislation the three judges appointed to hear cases 
in Nunavut will have the same power and authority to hear all 
cases without the need to refer to a higher court level.  At the 
same time, a court of appeal, about which I have heard a number 
of questions asked, will still exist should appeals be made, 
namely the Nunavut court of appeal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This legislation will allow a one-level court system to be 
introduced to the eastern Arctic.  The western region of the 
Northwest Territories, as well as the rest of Canada will closely 
watch this experimental system.  Should it be successful, I 
understand that the western region is considering adopting a 
similar approach for its own judicial system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have had the opportunity on a few occasions to travel to the 
western and eastern Arctic and I am looking forward to the 
creation of Nunavut on April 1.  Last year I had the opportunity 
to speak to other amendments to the Nunavut Act that will help to 
ensure that programs and procedures are in place and operational 
on April 1, 1999. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This legislation will also provide additional seats in this 
House, which will allow representation for both territories which 
are currently the Northwest Territories.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The PC Party was instrumental in establishing the basis for this 
new territory.  I am pleased to have had the opportunity to work 
on this piece of legislation, one that will ensure everything is 
in place and ready to go next April.  This will be an historic 
time for Canada and it provides an excellent opportunity to 
introduce a one court system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Whether the court system meets the high expectations of the 
Inuit remains to be seen, but it will be an opportunity to see 
how the justice system can be adapted to unique circumstances. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While a one court system has been discussed on different 
occasions as an alternative to the two court system, it has never 
been implemented.  Given the conditions existing in the eastern 
Arctic, it is an excellent opportunity to introduce such a 
system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is assumed that the one court system will have the advantage 
of being both cheaper to operate and more efficient with only one 
level of court to travel to the various communities instead of 
two.  This should reduce the operating costs, particularly since 
it is necessary to fly to the outlying communities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is especially relevant when one considers that the new 
territory of Nunavut consists of 26 communities with a total 
population of approximately 26,000 people.  This system may also 
improve efficiency since each judge will be able to preside over 
the various types of cases and it should reduce the scheduling 
program problems that the two court levels would entail. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the other hand, this means only one system is available for 
different types of offences combining territorial and federal 
issues and jurisdictions.  This may raise concerns about the 
fairness of a system that hears cases from all levels. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the same time, while there may be some adjustments to the new 
system and some minor hurdles to overcome, the system will be 
unique to the new territory and closely monitored by the 
Government of Canada, particularly the western portion of the 
current Northwest Territories. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The legislation is necessary to establish the judicial system as 
a one court system, another step in ensuring a smooth transition 
to the new territory on April 1, 1999. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Progressive Conservative Party has always supported the 
creation of Nunavut and the land claims settlement that set out 
the establishment of the new territory.  I am looking forward to 
the creation of Nunavut next year and will continue to support 
legislation that assists in this endeavour. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I welcome the opportunity to study the legislation at committee. 
<P><A NAME="LINK201"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. David Pratt (Nepean—Carleton, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
listened with interest to the hon. member for South Shore speak 
about the issue of incarceration.  I guess it will not have much 
effect in terms of incarceration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would interested in probing the member further on that subject 
given that it is obviously part of the justice system.  There 
will have to be agreements in place to house the inmates who are 
convicted for more than two years, hopefully as close as possible 
to their homes so that it will enhance the prospects for 
rehabilitation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Conservative Party certainly has a long history of building 
prisons.  The one that comes to mind right away is the one that 
the former Conservative prime minister from Quebec built in his 
riding.  I think it was the Port Cartier prison. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the hon. member have any other thoughts with respect to how 
incarceration issues will be dealt with?  He seems to have 
displayed some expertise on the subject given his comments this 
afternoon. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not know if the hon. member has the information available, 
but I would like to know the number of inmates we might be 
talking about that are generated from the actions of the court 
system.  If he could provide some information on that it would be 
helpful. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member also mentioned that if these amendments were 
successful in terms of the application of the one court system to 
the eastern Arctic the people in the western Arctic would be 
looking with interest at the experiment, if that is what we want 
to call it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the hon. member have any information with respect to what 
sort of political pressure is currently being exerted by the 
people in the western Arctic with respect to how quickly they 
would want such a system implemented?

</I></B></P><P align=left>I would appreciate if the hon. member for South Shore could 
enlighten the House with respect to those issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gerald Keddy:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the first issue is that 
prisons and museums tend to be the same in relation to the act 
before us and some of the justice applications the hon. member is 
discussing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not a legal professional.  Nor do I profess to be.  My 
party has looked at this issue and will be studying it in great 
detail in committee.  As the hon. member is aware, we have a 
golden opportunity to look at a trial case of implementing a one 
court system in northern Canada where there are huge amounts of 
territory, a duplication of task and an overlapping of 
jurisdiction.  If we can solve the problem with the one court 
system then we are in favour of it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the question of whether or not incarceration will take place 
in the north there is an agreement in place.  The details of that 
agreement after a two year sentence are unclear.  We will be 
looking at that in committee.  A number of questions with respect 
to the legislation have not yet been answered. It is important to 
remember that it is a trial case.  We have a perfect opportunity 
to introduce a one court system, to look at it and to study it 
further. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the third question of the western Arctic and the Yukon 
territory, they have been looking very closely at this system. It 
is something they would be very interested in.  They also have 
the opportunity to wait and see.  For them there is a benefit to 
be derived from that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the eastern Arctic there are 2.242 million square kilometres 
of territory and 26 villages.  It is a very difficult to wait and 
see if they need the single court system now. 
<P><A NAME="LINK202"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gilles Bernier (Tobique—Mactaquac, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I am pleased to speak today to Bill C-57, an act to amend the 
Nunavut Act with respect to the Nunavut Court of Justice and to 
amend other acts in consequence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I reiterate the remarks of my colleague from South Shore who has 
been a strong and vigorous spokesperson not only on behalf of his 
riding but on behalf of the Progressive Conservative Party of 
Canada in the Indian and northern affairs portfolio. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also commend the efforts of the hon. member for Nunavut. 
Although we do not share the same political affiliation, I know 
the member is deeply committed to achieving progress for her 
constituents as they enter the 21st century as residents of 
Canada's newest territory. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was unfortunate to witness the Leader of the Official 
Opposition cynically using the debate of the Nunavut Act in 
parliament earlier to promote his own partisan agenda with 
respect to Senate reform.  The Leader of the Official 
Opposition's lengthy diatribe against of the upper chamber, which 
at one time included his father, proved once again that while he 
can play opposition politics with the best of politicians he does 
not have the qualities to lead the country.  The people of 
Nunavut deserve better. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Fortunately Canada had a leader with the foresight and vision to 
pursue an aggressive activist agenda.  Canadians had the Right 
Hon. Brian Mulroney who set the wheels in motion to establish the 
Nunavut territory by signing the Nunavut land claim agreement in 
1992. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The creation of Nunavut is one more reason why Mr. Mulroney was 
named a Companion of the Order of Canada.  Furthermore, under the 
previous Conservative government and the former constitutional 
affairs minister Joe Clark, who is re-emerging on the national 
scene, aboriginal people were full participants at formal 
constitutional negotiations for the first time in Canadian 
history. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Brian Mulroney remains a convenient scapegoat who the Liberals 
are happy to blame and denigrate in compensation for their 
shortcomings.

<A HREF="#LINKT35"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Nonetheless it cannot be stressed enough that the previous 
Progressive Conservative government gave aboriginal peoples a 
voice at the constitutional table, a voice through the royal 
commission, a voice in the Corrections and Conditional Release 
Act, and a voice for Inuit people by signing the Nunavut land 
claim agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today we are debating yet another piece of legislation 
introduced by the government that is a proud legacy of the former 
Progressive Conservative government.  I am not concerned, 
however, with what will happen when the Liberals run out of the 
policies stolen from the previous government.  Canadians will 
simply turn to the Progressive Conservatives to achieve 
meaningful progressive change to improve the country.  Although 
our party's ambitious policies were unpopular at the time, 
history once again has shown that by and large Progressive 
Conservative policies are for the betterment of all Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-57 deals with providing the best possible court system 
for Nunavut.  There may be those who object to granting the 
people of Nunavut a single court system.  They may object on the 
basis of jurisdictional concerns that the bill would create an 
intrusive precedent.  They may object on the basis that the bill 
somehow violates the equality provisions of the Charter of Rights 
and Freedoms. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not share these objections.  Bill C-57 appears to recognize 
the unique circumstances in which the people of Nunavut live. 
First and foremost in this unique environment is that the Inuit 
people will also form a strong majority of Nunavut's population: 
17,000 of the 22,000 residents or 77%.  Nunavut's territory also 
represents approximately one-fifth of Canada's size.  Yet its 
total population is only 22,000 or less than one-quarter of 1% of 
the population of the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us compare Nunavut's size and population with other 
jurisdictions.  Nunavut's 1.9 million square kilometres fall just 
under the figure for Greenland.  Nunavut is five times the size 
of Germany, four times the size of Sweden, and one-fifth the size 
of China. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then we factor in population distribution.  Nunavut has only 
one-hundredth of one person for every square kilometre of 
physical territory.  Canada as a whole has nearly three people 
per square kilometre.  Ontario has 11 people per square 
kilometre.  China has 120 people per square kilometre while 
Germany has 220 people for every square kilometre. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Nunavut's main human and territorial characteristics are not 
only unique to Canada.  They are unique to the world.  For 
example, Nunavut has only 20 kilometres of highway.  Moreover, 
there is a disparity between communities.  The largest community 
is its future capital, Iqaluit.  More than 3,000 people call 
Iqaluit home.  The community is located approximately 2,000 
kilometres from Ottawa.  Its average temperatures range from 
-30°C in January to 15°C in July.  Iqaluit residents experience 
24 hours of daylight per day in June but find no more than six 
hours of daily sunlight in December. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the other hand, Grise Ford is Nunavut's most northern 
community, a full 2,700 kilometres from Ottawa.  Its population 
numbers around 130 people who experience an average temperature 
of -35° in January and 10° in July.  These hearty souls also live 
in 24 hours of daylight in June and around the clock darkness in 
December. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough has experienced 
numerous challenges practising law in the rural area he comes 
from. He told me it was difficult for home to conceive how court 
proceedings, be they related to criminal civil or family law, 
would occur effectively and efficiently in such a broad 
jurisdiction with such a small population, with such a diversity 
of communities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As has been already mentioned, Bill C-57 amends several existing 
federal statutes.  It amends the Nunavut Act to establish a 
single level trial court at the superior court level to be known 
as the Nunavut Court of Justice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It amends the Judges Act to provide for three superior court 
judges on the Nunavut Court of Justice and to provide for full 
membership in the Canadian Judicial Council for the senior judge 
of each of the territories. 
It amends the Criminal Code to provide the new structures and 
procedures for the Nunavut court of justice in the following 
areas: jurisdiction of the judges, summary conviction appeals, a 
mew statutory form of release, judicial interim release, and 
elections as to a mode of trial.

<A HREF="#LINKT36"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, Bill C-57 amends the Young Offenders Act to ensure that 
structures and procedures for single level trial court are 
consistent with the new structures and procedures in the Criminal 
Code. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I therefore welcome Bill C-57 as a positive measure that 
recognizes the unique conditions of the people of Nunavut.  I 
look forward to working with my caucus colleagues from South 
Shore, Nunavut and other members and, most important, the people 
of Nunavut to critically examine this legislation at the justice 
committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need to ensure that Bill C-57 accurately reflects both the 
needs of Nunavut and the obligation of the Government of Canada 
to protect the new course of justice.  Let us continue to build 
on the legacy for Inuit self-government left by the former 
Progressive Conservative government. 
<P><A NAME="LINK203"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. David Pratt (Nepean—Carleton, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
listened to the hon. member's comments with great interest.  It 
is interesting to know that he is a lawyer and perhaps brings a 
different perspective to this legislation than some of us who are 
not from the legal profession. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My question in terms of this new system to be applied to Nunavut 
is whether there will be flexibility within the system in terms 
of responding to the needs of aboriginal communities.  One of the 
things we have learned in this country is that there are some 
very different traditions as far as justice and the application 
of justice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Coming in this morning I heard on CBC radio the whole issue of 
adapting sentencing circles to southern communities like regional 
municipality of Ottawa-Carleton.  I am interested in knowing 
whether there is flexibility within the system, if the hon. 
member knows or has this information at his disposal.  I would 
like to know whether there is enough flexibility in the system to 
allow for those sorts of options in the north with this new 
legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Clearly some of the mechanisms we have in terms of the British 
tradition of justice differ greatly from the aboriginal system. 
I ask the hon. member if he has any information on that and 
whether we will be seeing more creative types of justice applied 
to northern communities that adapt more to the needs and the 
traditions of the people who live in those communities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gilles Bernier:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member 
for his question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Canada we have many provinces and territories. We have 
provincial and federal laws.  I am sure this new act will help 
the people of the north.  I assure the hon. member that what he 
just asked will be studied in committee in the near future. 
<P><A NAME="LINK204"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lorne Nystrom (Regina—Qu'Appelle, NDP):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I listened with great interest to the hon. member. He 
made a reference to the Senate and how the Reform Party has been 
too negative about the other place and all the wonderful senators 
and so on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I notice in the most recent polling that a growing number of 
people just want to abolish the Senate.  An Angus Reid poll a few 
months ago said 41% want to abolish it, 43% want to reform it. 
There was a Pollara poll in December of last year that said 34% 
want to abolish it and 33% want to reform it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wonder if he would join a drive that has been spearheaded by 
the hon. member for Sarnia and me to abolish the Senate as a 
project for the new millennium in terms of increasing democracy 
in this country.  It appears to be the wishes of the Canadian 
people. 
I know the Conservative Party has a very democratic leadership 
selection process in terms of being a grassroots party.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bob Kilger:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. I 
remind members we are discussing Bill C-57, an act to amend the 
Nunavut Act with respect to the Nunavut court of justice and to 
amend other acts in consequence.  Did we change?  Did I miss 
something? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  No, although there 
has been in debate the notion of changed representation and the 
question of the other place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gilles Bernier:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member 
from the NDP for his question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What I made reference to was that when we had such a debate in 
the House of Commons the Leader of the Opposition did not talk 
about that at the time.  He was more interesting in talking about 
the Senate.  That is what I was relating to. 
<P><A NAME="LINK205"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mike Scott (Skeena, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I begin by 
acknowledging clearly the contribution those people who live 
north of 60 make to Canada and the contribution they have made in 
the past.  Let me acknowledge for example that their presence has 
been extremely important for the maintenance of Canadian 
sovereignty in the high Arctic in the past. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These people live in an area of Canada that experiences a harsh 
climate.  It is a difficult lifestyle.  It is a difficult place 
to earn a living. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a member of parliament who represents a northern riding in 
British Columbia with many small and remote communities, I have 
some understanding of what it would be like to live north of 60, 
although obviously I do not understand it completely. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us examine what this bill is about and ask ourselves some 
very serious questions with regard to where we are headed.  To 
listen to some of the members in this place today we would think 
the people who currently live north of 60 do not have a justice 
system and have no access to justice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know that is not right.  We know these people have had access 
to justice since the inception of Canadian sovereignty in 1867. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we have come to understand, certainly from the Reform 
Party's point of view, is that this is another piece of 
legislation that is a furtherance to the whole concept of 
Nunavut.  Nunavut from the perspective of many people in the 
Reform Party is a very badly flawed and fiscally irresponsible 
idea which is bereft of intellectual discipline. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Acknowledging that people who live north of 60 live in a harsh 
climate and difficult circumstances does not mean that it is 
somehow a good idea to adopt the notion of Nunavut and then spend 
$300 million of taxpayer money just to implement it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the 25,000 or so people who live in this area to be covered 
under Nunavut, equivalent to a medium size town in rural Canada, 
these people are to receive an expenditure per capita of about 
$12,000. Let us not forget that about half these people are 
children below the age of majority.  It is not a very large 
population at all but it is a huge expenditure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In order to implement Nunavut the government now has to set up a 
judicial system, to set up a legislature, to set up a senate and 
all these trappings that go along with the concept of the 
territory of Nunavut. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Nunavut in the opinion of many, including some constitutional 
experts, people who were around the table in 1980-1981 when 
former Prime Minister Trudeau was in the process attempting to 
patriate the Constitution to Canada, is actually the creation of 
a province through the back door. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1710"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT38"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In strict terms, if the Government of Canada and the provinces 
were in agreement that a new province should be created there is 
a process that must be followed in order to effect the 
constitutional change required to see that come about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, the Government of Canada arbitrarily and in isolation 
has decided to create this new territory called Nunavut and it is 
a province in everything but name. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I suggest there will come a time when somebody, some province or 
some group will challenge the constitutionality of the 
legislation which brings Nunavut to life.  I suggest there is a 
good likelihood the challenge will succeed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the expenditure proposed, and the $300 million 
implementation cost is only a small part of the overall cost, we 
can only wonder what could have been achieved for the people who 
live north of 60 and what they are getting.  What they are 
getting is a huge bureaucracy.  Along with that the idea that 
large bureaucracies somehow increase people's standard of living 
and create wealth is being reinforced.  We know they do not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know that for many decades now both Liberal and Conservative 
administrations in Ottawa have attempted to practise this faulty 
fiscal policy and it has nearly bankrupted the country.  We now 
have, even among Liberals which is something I never thought I 
would see in my lifetime, the acknowledgement that we have to 
look at ways of increasing people's living standards and 
improving their lifestyles other than through government 
intervention. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is being proposed for Nunavut is a massive infusion of 
federal dollars to implement and on an ongoing basis maintain, 
which is somehow supposed to improve the standard of living of 
people in that area.  I suggest this is not about wealth creation 
but about an ongoing transfer of wealth from the rest of Canada 
to a very large geographical area, very sparsely populated.  I 
believe the thinking behind Nunavut is faulty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are a number of questions that come to my mind when I look 
at the bill before us.  What is missing?  How much will this 
piece of legislation cost?  How much is it going to cost to 
implement and maintain? Who is going to pay that? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not think 25,000 people in the high Arctic will be able to 
underwrite the cost of this on an ongoing basis through their tax 
base.  I just do not see that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we are saying in effect is that the Canadian government, 
i.e. Canadian taxpayers from coast to coast, is going to 
underwrite the costs of this new justice system in perpetuity.  I 
say there is something fundamentally wrong with that.  A justice 
system can be made available to people who live north of 60 and 
all the other departments of government available to most 
Canadians can be made available on a much more cost effective 
basis which would be much more fair to the taxpayers in the rest 
of Canada.

is at best faulty and which is at worst bankrupt.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The people who came up with this brainchild and passed it 
through the House of Commons in form of legislation continue to 
support it and to enact further legislation to effect the 
implementation of Nunavut.  They have not been honest with 
themselves or with the people north of 60 whom the legislation is 
supposed to benefit.  Nor have they been honest with the rest of 
Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are many parallels.  I know this is not a land treaty or a 
land claim agreement, but in the great deal of the thinking 
behind Nunavut and what has gone into supporting it is the notion 
that people north of 60, who are predominantly of aboriginal 
extraction, Inuit, should have a greater degree of say and 
control over their own lives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not think anyone in the House would disagree.  I do not 
think anyone wants to say that these people should be dictated to 
from Ottawa.  Lord knows that as a British Columbian growing up 
during the sixties and seventies I certainly got a bellyful of 
Ottawa dictating to British Columbia and to me as a citizen of 
British Columbia how I should live. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  They still do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mike Scott:</B>  Yes, they still want to dictate to us. 
That is why Reform is here.  That is why it is important that we 
do not abolish the Senate.  That is why it is important that we 
have an effective Senate, an elected Senate.  It is one way of 
assuring the regions of Canada, including the north of Canada, 
that there will be an opportunity for balancing the very strong 
representation by population that we have in the House of 
Commons.  This is the fallacy in the thinking of my friend who 
raised the issue a few minutes ago. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the surface it is immediately attractive but in the long run 
it will not serve the regions of Canada.  As a matter of fact it 
closes the door forever for them to have an opportunity of equal 
and effective representation based on a regional model rather 
than representation by population. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we abandon the idea of a triple E Senate we forever resign 
ourselves to having central Canada dictate to the rest of Canada 
and the regions how we will live our lives.  That lets down our 
constituents, particularly those of us who come from rural parts 
of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I see many parallels in the thinking that has gone into Nunavut, 
the institutions that are being created including the justice 
system, and the thinking that has gone into and is currently 
going into the treaty process in British Columbia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, in the Nisga'a agreement in British Columbia, the 
first land claim agreement to be resolved or supposedly to be 
resolved—it is not resolved yet—the government intends to 
create a separate justice system, exactly as it is attempting to 
do with the legislation on Nunavut.  This somehow leaves the 
impression that these people do not have access to justice at the 
present time, are being left out or being hard done by.  I simply 
argue that this is not the case. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not understand the justification for telling a group of 
people, whether it is on an ethnic basis as in the case of 
Nisga'a or on a geographical basis as in the case of Nunavut, 
that they are entitled to a separate justice system which will 
cost an extraordinary amount of money for the number of people it 
is designed to serve. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members on this side of the House have a great deal of 
difficulty with the lack of responsiveness in the justice system 
at the present time and the feeling that it is not achieving what 
it ought to achieve.  However it is still there for all 
Canadians. I do not see how members opposite can make a 
legitimate argument that somehow people are slipping through the 
cracks and need their own justice system to be better off.  I 
just do not understand that thinking at all.

Nunavut does not stand up to the light of day.  The legislation 
is in furtherance to that whole bad idea.  This is meant as no 
disrespect whatsoever to the people who live in the high Arctic 
but is simply a recognition of fact. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore I cannot support what is being proposed.  As much as I 
would like to recognize the contribution of people who live in 
the high Arctic, I will have to vote against the legislation when 
it comes before the House.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Werner Schmidt (Kelowna, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank 
my hon. colleague for the erudite and learned manner in which he 
exposed what happened in Nunavut, in the establishment of 
Nunavut, and with the legislation that came from the south.  He 
exposed some of the errors and shortsighted thinking that went 
into the initial legislation and recognized the contribution of 
these people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I pay tribute to my colleague from Yukon who compassionately 
indicated how necessary it was to provide justice for the people 
of that part of Canada.  My hon. colleague said that we all want 
justice, and I think we all want it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would my colleague subscribe to the notion that if there is to 
be justice it should be equal justice for all people in Canada? 
One element of an equal justice system is a system that is more 
or less parallel.  We have a situation where apparently justice 
is the issue.  Equality of citizens before and under the law is 
another issue and the object of a thorough and fair justice 
system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How will there be equality of justice in establishing a totally 
different kind of conceptually directed justice system in one 
part of Canada, in this case in Nunavut, as compared to the other 
provinces?  Why should there be a separate system in this part of 
Canada? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mike Scott:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague for his 
excellent question.  He has put his finger on a big part of the 
problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>According to the notions that were inculcated in me as I grew 
up, Canada was founded and based on the notion of civic 
nationalism.  That means our participation in this democracy does 
not depend on our gender, our colour, our language or our 
religion.  It does not depend on any identifying or 
distinguishing characteristic.  It depends on the fact that we 
are of the age of majority and we have one person, one vote.  We 
all have the rights and freedoms afforded to us under the Charter 
of Rights and Freedoms.  Before that rights were extended to us 
under the British North America Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The legislation is another indicator that we have to be on guard 
against a danger.  Canada is in danger of breaking away from the 
notion of civic nationalism into what I would consider to be a 
regressive and less attractive notion of ethnic nationalism.  We 
see this expressed in many areas.  We even see it expressed in 
the House.  I say that with the greatest of respect, because I do 
not want to unfairly or without warrant attack any other members 
of the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us consider the section of the Constitution that guarantees 
and spells out our rights and freedoms.  The next paragraph 
states that notwithstanding that we have these rights and 
freedoms, the government has the right to abrogate them when it 
feels it is in the best interest of the nation.  I do not see how 
any right thinking person could ever accept that somebody's 
rights would be taken away for any reason whatsoever. 
Those rights should be immutable.  They should be there as a 
pillar or a cornerstone never to be affected by any action that 
government may take.

</I></B></P><P align=left>What is being proposed under the whole concept of Nunavut gets 
dangerously close to breaking away from the notion of the 
equality of all Canadians before the law and the right of all 
Canadians to equal access to the institutions of government, 
including the institution of justice.  It falls perilously close 
to the notion of ethnic nationalism, which is something I could 
never support and I believe a majority of Canadians would never 
support. 
<P><A NAME="LINK207"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Roy Bailey (Souris—Moose Mountain, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I would like to ask a question regarding the judges 
system in the new territory. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 14 months we will be into a new millennium.  With the type of 
justice system the bill will bring in, what hope do these people 
have to have enshrined later on in the history of the new 
territory the same type of justice system the rest of Canadians 
enjoy? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mike Scott:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am not sure I fully 
understood the member's question, but I am reluctant to believe 
that the people who will be looking to justice under the bill we 
are debating will have the same access and the same disengaged 
treatment other Canadians expect from the system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is vitally important in a civilized nation such as Canada 
that all citizens fundamentally believe that the justice system 
is unbiased, disengaged and will render justice in an even-handed 
manner which takes into account no factors other than the facts 
of law any justice system should recognize. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I look at and contemplate the thinking behind the bill it 
causes me some concern.  It does not cause me as much concern as 
the whole concept of Nunavut in the first place, but I am 
certainly not embracing the notion that some Canadians by dint of 
their geographical location or other distinguishing reasons ought 
to have access to a different justice system with different rules 
and regulations and different protocols than the rest of Canada 
has access to. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not know if I have answered the member's question 
succinctly enough.  I hope I have.  It is the best I can do for 
the member. 
<P><A NAME="LINK208"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rob Anders (Calgary West, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, this 
amendment to the Nunavut Act gives rise to the question of 
whether or not it was properly thought out in the first place by 
the government.  It is talking about a different system of 
justice, something separate from what the rest of Canadians 
enjoy.  Certainly, then, there would have been room to go ahead 
with a different system for selecting people in the Senate.  They 
will have to make a new seat for this territory. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mike Scott:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I will make it short because 
I know you will not let me have it any other way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Obviously the government is cherry picking, to answer the 
member's question.  The government says “Heads I win, tails you 
lose”.  It will not allow any notion of Senate reform when it 
comes to Nunavut but it will embrace changes to the justice 
system if it deems that is what it would like to see happen.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  Is it the pleasure 
of the House to adopt the amendment? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Agreed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(Amendment agreed to) 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  Debate is on the 
motion as amended. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lorne Nystrom:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank the House for 
the unanimous consent to make that change which reflects a 
broader consensus in the country and in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The purpose for this private member's motion today, which is one 
of the few votable motions in the House, is to start a debate on 
a new idea which in many ways is an old idea.  It was first 
suggested by James Tobin, an economist who won the Nobel prize in 
1992.  He suggested in 1981 that in order to bring some 
regulation or order to the international financial marketplace in 
currency transactions there be enacted a very small foreign 
currency transaction tax.  This has to be done in concert with 
the world community.  One country by itself cannot do it.  This 
would bring some semblance of order to what we are seeing in the 
world today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The secondary purpose of the motion would be to use the funds to 
establish in part an international development fund which would 
be useful for many projects around the world.  I will get into 
that a little later on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The time has come when we have to start looking at new ideas as 
to how we work toward the common good not just in this country 
but around the world.  Dr. Tobin made the suggestion a number of 
years ago.  The idea is to impose a very small tax on foreign 
currency transactions.  The idea being talked about now by most 
people around the world is a tax of .1%.  In other words, one 
dollar on every thousand dollars of foreign currency 
transactions.  If we buy a condo for $100,000 that would be a 
$100 transaction tax. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to give the House some idea of the magnitude of what we 
are talking about.  In the 1970s the daily trading in the world 
in foreign currency was about $17 billion. Today it is about $1.3 
trillion.  It is a figure so large it is impossible to even 
imagine. 
To give a comparison the trade in goods and services around the 
world annually, 365 days of the year, of all countries is $4.3 
trillion and the currency exchange is $1.3 trillion a day.  That 
is a lot of money.

<A HREF="#LINKT43"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The consequences of this is that there is a feeling among a lot 
of people that nation states have given up a lot of sovereignty 
to what we sometimes call the boys in red suspenders as they 
speculate on currency around the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Talking about this at this time is really appropriate because 
much of the world is in recession and many people are predicting 
a worldwide depression.  We have seen the tremendous effect on 
currency around the world and the effect on Canadian currency. We 
have seen the problems in southeast Asia, in places like Thailand 
and which have spread to other countries in that part of the 
world, to Japan and Russia, which is now basically without a 
government and in total chaos. The problem is spreading into 
Brazil and parts of Latin America. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A large part of it is because of the rapid movement of short 
term capital seeking a place to maximize its return. This is 
being done at the flick of a computer key when billions are 
moved, as I said $1.3 trillion every day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Are we as a country powerless or do we want to assert our 
sovereignty and try with our fellow people around the world to 
come up with a method of bringing some order to the turmoil that 
exists today in terms of international currency markets?  I think 
the answer is yes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Governor of the Bank of Canada was before the finance 
committee last night. We have had the Minister of Finance before 
the finance committee last night.  They both talked about trying 
to bring some order to the currency markets around the world. 
This is one idea I think we should be looking at in terms of 
trying to bring some of that order. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the consequences of technological change and of 
globalization as we see it today has been the demise in the power 
of the nation state.  I do not thing there is any denying that. 
But that opens up new opportunities in terms of how we govern 
ourselves as the human race.  I believe that many of the things 
we used to do nationally as nation states and country by country 
we will have to in the future start doing internationally as the 
borders become more and more erased right around the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we look at the attack on social programs around the world, 
the environmental problems around the world, the lack of real 
sovereignty in terms of monetary policy country by country, I 
think we realize we have to do something about these in common 
cause with other people around the world.  That opens up an 
exciting vision of the world of tomorrow, a new vision where 
people regardless of the colour of their skin, regardless of 
where they live, work together toward a common cause and a common 
good. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One way of doing it is for the first time to have a small tax on 
financial transactions applicable around the world. That is one 
thing we should look at.  Private members' hour is the time to do 
this where we can all vote freely of our party whips and party 
discipline to say yes or no to the idea. This motion does not 
bind the government.  It says that in the opinion of this House, 
the government should show leadership and enact a tax on 
financial transactions in concert with the international 
community. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Finance has made public statements where he is 
interested in principle in the concept of a Tobin tax.  He looked 
at this very seriously in 1995 at the G-7 conference in Halifax. 
He had papers commissioned on the Tobin tax at that time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the reasons the Minister of Finance became rather 
pessimistic on this in the last year or so was that he did not 
think it would fly because of the government position in Britain 
and the government in Germany, two big countries in Europe. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the last year there has been a change in government in both 
those places.  In Britain it is now Tony Blair and the Labour 
Party and as of three weeks ago in Germany there was the election 
of Mr. Schroeder and the Social Democrats. In both cases they are 
governments open to examining the possibility of the Tobin tax to 
see whether we can work out some method of making this a feasible 
part of a new world order and new world vision.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It could be an exciting time for our country and our parliament. 
We should ask the Minister of Finance to take the lead on this 
very important issue for the world of tomorrow. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I said, this has been debated before.  It began with Mr. 
Tobin, the economist who won the Nobel prize.  It was talked 
about in October 1987 during the stock market crash around the 
world.  It was also debated in 1984 when the peso in Mexico 
collapsed, causing a tremendous exodus of capital from that 
country.  The result of that exodus of capital was a tremendous 
amount of hardship and poverty for the ordinary Mexican person. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The excess capital around the world seeking a safe haven and 
seeking to make money, although much of that money is going to 
the United States, has once again precipitated a debate.  This is 
another reason we should be looking at it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to give three examples of the so-called Tobin tax. First, 
I say to some of my friends who are concerned about tax issues 
that it is a very small tax; .1% is what is being talked about, 
maybe even less than that. This would have virtually no impact 
whatsoever on long term investment in the world, long term 
investment that is needed in developing and developed countries 
alike.  It would be so small that it would not affect long term 
investment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the other hand, it would deter short term speculation, money 
that moves into a market for a few minutes, a few hours or a few 
days and moves out of that market after it makes a short term 
amount of money on a small margin.  This money is sort of 
slushing back and forth around the world and is operating on very 
small margins.  The effect of this is that it creates great 
distortions in national economies like Mexico, Brazil or what is 
happening in Russia today.  It even affects us where our dollar 
is weaker than it should be because a lot of dollars are going to 
the United States to seek refuge. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It would not have an impact on long term investment but it would 
bring some semblance of order to the world community and to the 
boys in red suspenders who are trading currency back and forth 
like a gigantic casino around the world that affects working 
people in every country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It would bring more stability for exporters, importers, 
investors and the government in terms of planning budgets, public 
policies and monetary policies of nation states right around the 
world.  It would bring more stability because that great 
volatility of the casino economy would be tempered to a certain 
degree. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, as I said, it would reduce the power of the speculators 
and increase the power of national governments to do more things 
in their countries and to be able to share increased power 
through international bodies and organizations. That is the main 
reason for the so-called Tobin tax, the tax on international 
transactions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second reason for the motion is to raise revenue for worthy 
projects around the world.  This is the secondary objective but 
it is still a very important objective.  Many times we have world 
disasters and there is a great deal of difficulty trying to raise 
money for those world disasters.  The United States is now in a 
great debate in terms of what the Americans should pay in terms 
of a stipend to the United Nations to keep it going, a debate 
between the Republicans and the Democrats, between the office of 
the president and Congress. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remember the disaster in Chernobyl, the great disaster with 
the reactor in Ukraine and the time it took to get funding and 
money to help the victims and do the clean-up.  There are many 
purposes the money could be used for in terms of development 
around the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think of the whole issue of jobs, the economy and the millions 
of people being thrown out of work now because of what is 
happening in many parts of the world. 
Some money could be used for employment and jobs.  Some money 
could be used for peacekeeping, for the mines issue, for medical 
research and for environmental research and funding.  There are 
many uses for this money.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will give a few examples.  If there were a 0.1% Tobin tax on 
foreign currency transactions, that would raise, in 1995 dollars, 
$176 billion U.S.  That is a lot of money.  A Tobin tax of 0.003% 
would be enough money to fund United Nations peacekeeping around 
the world.  It could fund the project initiated in large part by 
our Minister of Foreign Affairs on land mines.  There are many 
worthy causes around the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the consequences would be the establishment of a global 
village which would have a common good amongst all nations of the 
world.  There would be a strengthening of international 
organizations.  The United Nations would become a meaningful 
world government and would share things with national governments 
around the world.  There could be permanent international 
peacekeeping forces.  There are many things that could be done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How would this be implemented?  There are a number of ways of 
doing it.  The International Monetary Fund could be reformed to 
do it or the World Bank could be reformed to do it.  My 
preference would be a new international financial agency to 
administer the Tobin tax. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Who would collect the tax?  National governments would collect 
the tax around the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The time has come for this country to consider taking leadership 
in a new idea, in a new vision that seeks to bring some order to 
the chaos we see around us every day.  This cuts across political 
lines.  I differ from time to time with colleagues in other 
parties, the Reform Party or the government.  However, I know 
from talking to people in the Reform Party, the Liberal Party the 
Bloc Quebecois and the Progressive Conservative Party that there 
is a great deal of concern in all of our constituencies.

not say that we should do this by ourselves.  Of course we cannot 
do this by ourselves.  It does not say that we should do it along 
with Zimbabwe and Peru and five or six small countries.  It says 
that we should do it in concert with the international community. 
To make it work the United States has to be there, the Republic 
of Germany has to be there, France has to be there, Britain and 
many of the bigger countries in the world that form the OECD or 
the G-7 have to be there.

this idea with the new governments in Europe and France.  In

Lionel Jospin of le Parti socialiste français.  There are new 
governments in France, Germany and Britain. 
With new governments around the world, perhaps we can make some 
headway.  If we do not do this we are going to continue becoming 
more and more impotent in terms of exercising the power and the 
sovereignty that people around the world should have.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I look forward to listening to the debate.  We should put aside 
party differences and get behind an idea whose time I think has 
come. 
<P><A NAME="LINK214"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Tony Valeri (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Finance, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, let me begin by saying that we 
share the hon. member's concern over the volatility that often 
occurs in financial markets and it is actually for this reason 
that we can support the motion put forward by the hon. member. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Certainly financial instability is a threat to global prosperity 
and I think it is incumbent on governments to examine all of the 
options to address the problem.  A Tobin tax is one such option. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But let us be clear.  Canada is already exercising international 
leadership as part of a broad strategy to attack the underlying 
causes of financial market volatility and we are enjoying 
considerable success in working with our partners on practical 
ways of improving the functioning of international markets and 
preventing and managing crises. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We would all prefer a world where markets always get things 
right, a world where exchange rates always behave in a way that 
we could clearly understand in the context of our economic 
circumstances and policies, a world where exchange rate movements 
were always helpful in promoting solid growth and job creation 
for our citizens.  But financial markets are not perfect 
institutions.  Clearly they do not always get it right.  They 
travel in herds.  They run on rumour.  They sometimes ignore 
fundamentals and all too often they overshoot. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Exchange rates can sometimes move erratically and these erratic 
movements can cause economic problems, affecting competitiveness 
or requiring authorities to take some actions to defend the 
currency that they might otherwise prefer not to do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The challenge that we face is to find the best way of dealing 
with these problems which economists call market imperfections. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Proponents of the Tobin tax argue that such a tax would put sand 
in the wheels of international finance by imposing a very small 
percentage tax on all foreign exchange trades.  So the argument 
goes that this would discourage speculation and stabilize 
financial markets without interfering unduly with longer term 
trade or investment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Others are attracted by the tax revenue that they believe the 
tax could raise and which they believe could finance many 
worthwhile programs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The arguments surrounding the merits of the Tobin tax are 
certainly interesting and have been debated for quite some time 
by economists and others.  I am sure that they will be debated 
for some time to come. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But the more important question from our perspective is not the 
theoretical benefits that might result from introducing such a 
tax, but the very practical question of whether this would be 
feasible.  Here it seems very unlikely that a Tobin tax could be 
imposed on a scale that would actually give rise to the benefits 
its supporters claim without penalizing some countries severely. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reason for this is that for the tax to be at all effective 
in stabilizing markets or raising revenue it would need to be 
applied globally, and given today's advanced communications and 
computing technology, transactions can be conducted anywhere in 
the world and can shift from one location to another in the blink 
of an eye.  If a Tobin tax were not universal in its coverage, 
transactions and the incomes and the employment they generate 
would simply shift to any jurisdiction that did not impose the 
tax. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada in fact explored the idea during the Halifax summit, at 
which time it became apparent that a number of G-7 countries were 
adamantly opposed to this idea.  Their positions have not 
changed, despite, as the hon. member has mentioned, some change 
in governments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But even agreements among the G-7 or all of the industrial 
countries would not be sufficient for the proposal to work.  All 
countries would have to agree.  There would always be an 
incentive for some group of countries to opt out, thereby 
establishing themselves as an off-shore financial centre.  I do 
not believe any member of the House would support a policy that 
merely encourages the growth of off-shore banking centres. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are other practical problems.  Enforcement of a Tobin tax 
would involve a constant cat and mouse game of closing loopholes 
discovered by market players. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So it is for these reasons that the Tobin tax has not attracted 
widespread support from other countries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not here today to tell the House that nothing can be done 
to address the question of volatility in international financial 
markets.  In fact, a great deal is being done on this front and 
Canada is exercising considerable leadership in these efforts.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our aim, working with our international partners, is to address 
the underlying causes of international crises such as the Asian 
crisis and to develop mechanisms to help manage them when they 
occur. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although the crisis in Asia had complex roots, it is clear the 
governments in the region contributed to the problem by allowing, 
and sometimes even encouraging, imprudent lending on the part of 
local financial institutions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Moreover, the promise of fixed exchange rates, a promise that 
ultimately proved hollow, encouraged local banks and companies to 
borrow huge amounts of foreign currency.  Financial turmoil was 
the inevitable result of these inappropriate policies and 
practices. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada has provided leadership to the international community on 
reforms that would address the underlying cause of financial 
crises and not just symptoms. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the spring meeting of the IMF and the World Bank our finance 
minister proposed measures to strengthen supervision and 
regulation of financial sectors including peer review.  Simply 
put, peer review would allow experts from Canada and other 
countries to share their expertise with their counterparts in 
emerging markets and ensure that best practices are being 
followed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am pleased to inform the House that our Canadian proposal was 
endorsed by the G-7 and the IMF at the annual meetings in 
Washington.  The IMF will begin to use peer review as a way of 
strengthening financial sector supervision and regulation 
starting next year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada has also proposed a mechanism to ensure that private 
sector investors such as banks will be involved in the resolution 
of international financial crises in a much more integrated way 
than has previously been the case. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Standard operating procedure today is for the IMF, the World 
Bank and national governments to put up money first.  The private 
sector gets involved only at the end, if at all.  Quite clearly 
that is not an equitable way to share the burden.  More to the 
point, it is no longer on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our finance minister proposed a mechanism that would allow for 
payment standstills during financial crises.  This would give 
hard-pressed countries the time needed to put economic reforms in 
place much as solvent but illiquid companies can be shielded from 
their creditors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A great deal has been accomplished on these concrete measures to 
address the volatility in international financial markets. 
Obviously there is still work that needs to be done on this 
subject. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada is determined to carry on its efforts toward leading the 
international community in its efforts to develop a more stable 
and prosperous world economy.  It is in this context that Canada 
could accept the imposition of a Tobin tax if the problems that 
we have outlined were resolved and if all—and I need to be very 
clear on this—other jurisdictions agreed.  Unfortunately those 
are very big ifs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our finance minister, the government and in fact the country, 
rather than sit back and wait for a Tobin tax or for some other 
option, acted in a way showing leadership.  We put forward a six 
point plan to attack the underlying causes of financial market 
volatility.  By putting forward that six point plan we have the 
support of the IMF and the support of the G-7 countries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have countries around the world looking to Canada for 
leadership on this issue.  The finance minister has demonstrated 
that leadership.  We will continue to do so as we continue to 
explore this issue with other major countries.  We will continue 
to show leadership on a much broader strategy to attack the 
underlying causes of financial market volatility. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I commend the hon. member for bringing the motion forward and 
for allowing the House an opportunity to debate an issue which 
has been debated for some time now and will continue to be 
debated.  It is an honourable thing to do, but there are flaws in 
this tax from the perspective that the one underlying principle 
which must be adhered to is that all countries must participate 
in a Tobin tax.  They must all do it at the same time so we do 
not create any offshore financial centres.  We can support this 
motion in principle.

at the IMF by adopting a strategy for addressing the broader

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Forseth (New Westminster—Coquitlam—Burnaby, 
Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, to put it directly, I oppose the Tobin 
tax because I care about the poor and I care about the average 
Canadian who might wind up paying the bill in the long run. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today we are really having a discussion about socialist myths. 
It is fine to have an academic debate for intellectual discourse 
but heaven help us if we ever allowed the world to slide into 
such a state where today's proposal would actually be realized. 
It would really hurt millions of people if the tax were ever 
large enough that it actually worked to its policy objectives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Regina—Qu'Appelle is urging the government to 
introduce a financial transaction tax, or the Tobin tax as it is 
known in the academic and university circles.  In plain terms a 
financial transaction tax can be any tax.  It can be any tax, fee 
or duty imposed by a government upon the sale, purchase, transfer 
or registration of a financial instrument.  It can be broadly 
based or it can exempt a variety of instruments.  It can be 
levied against transactions by Canadians or it can be levied 
against transactions in Canada, or both, cutting various ways 
across borders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think that I speak on behalf of Canadians when I say that 
taxes discourage positive activity, especially excessive taxes 
and disincentive penalty taxes.  A financial transaction tax 
would ultimately discourage financial transactions. This would 
not be good for our economy.  This idea responds to the symptoms 
rather than the causes of financial disorder. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Several weeks ago representatives from all opposition parties 
got together and in unison voiced a concern to decrease the 
premiums placed on employment insurance.  All opposition parties 
wanted a reduction in a specific tax.  What each party wanted to 
do with the surplus was rather different, but every party was at 
least against the increased levy because it hurt the employment 
rates we desire in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is obvious the financial transaction tax is not viewed in 
quite the same way as the employment insurance tax.  However my 
illustration was simply to show that people hate taxes, period, 
and in general they are hurtful if they are usurious. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why was it that Canadians were so opposed to the GST even though 
some prices on consumer goods were reduced as a result?  It is 
simply that new taxes are hard to sell to the public and they 
almost always create distortions in the market. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The NDP and socialists around the world want this tax to be 
implemented.  They see it as a way to raise money for social 
issues but often without practical political accountability.  One 
of the areas Professor James Tobin uses in selling his proposed 
tax to various countries around the world is that revenues could 
be used to finance the United Nations, or as others have 
suggested, to aid in various worldwide campaigns like that on 
land mines.  A nice result to help the medicine go down. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To the uninformed or the resentful the idea may sound good on 
paper but we need to examine it closely to see how the revenue is 
handled.  The main purpose of taxing something is for the revenue 
it brings.  The NDP can say what it wants about how this tax 
would straighten out the world markets, which it certainly would 
not, but the bottom line is its secondary agenda. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1995 a group of environmental NGOs got together to form the 
Halifax initiative.  Spearheaded by the Sierra Club of Canada the 
group urged for Canada to be a leader and initiate a financial 
transaction tax during the Halifax meeting of the G-7 leaders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the briefs put forward by the Halifax initiative stated: 
“There are two key political issues involved with putting such a 
tax in place. First, it would be necessary to forge agreement 
amongst the major countries to implement a uniform tax, and 
second, there would have to be agreement on the collection and 
distribution of the revenue”. Perhaps it should have added a 
third issue, for all countries to simply agree there also is a 
Santa Claus. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I could say that collection might theoretically be done but even 
that is the easier part.  The hard part is where does the money 
go?  If the proceeds are returned to various governments, what 
rules would determine which country gets what amount?  Whose 
money is it anyway?

</I></B></P><P align=left>Would redistribution favour countries that have important 
financial centres?  Would redistribution favour countries based 
on their voting shares, say in the International Monetary Fund? 
What about assigning revenues to global causes?  How could any 
international organization possibly get all the countries to 
agree?  The power struggle that would occur would be disastrous. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Proponents of the tax are suggesting that all countries in the 
G-7 get together to create this tax.  Perhaps these same 
proponents should look at what is happening with other countries 
that have had some experience with such types of disincentive 
taxes and how they hurt people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Japan has a financial transaction tax in a form and has had some 
considerable difficulty with it as the tax has had negative 
effects on the Japanese market.  The story is similar in the 
United Kingdom. It has raised some money but there is concern 
that much more could be achieved without the tax.  The U.K. is 
considering getting rid of the tax.  Sweden has also had bad 
experiences with the tax. Germany has decided that the costs and 
the problems of the tax far outweigh any benefits when we get 
into that kind of revenue generation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To get all countries onside appears to be an insurmountable 
task.  According to Tobin, “a transaction tax on purchases and 
sales of foreign exchange would have to be universal and uniform, 
would have to apply to all jurisdictions, and the rate would have 
to be equalized across all markets”. That is his criteria. 
Obviously that would be absolutely impossible to achieve. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are other reasons to oppose the financial transaction tax, 
one being to shift to other jurisdictions.  It is impossible that 
all jurisdictions will subscribe to the methods of the Tobin tax. 
Therefore, members of the financial community will simply use 
offshore tax havens in order to evade the tax. Complicated 
schemes will be developed to get around the tax. There is no end 
to it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1995 the IMF wrote a paper on financial transaction taxes. It 
spoke clearly about substitutions.  It is stated in the paper, 
“If transaction taxes applied to transactions only in domestic 
markets, investors could substitute foreign trading as a means to 
avoid the tax.  Shifting the location of trade in financial 
assets is relatively easy, with trade shifting to other countries 
or to locations with established financial markets. For instance, 
a considerable amount of trading in the equities of the United 
States takes place in London”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The stated goal of the tax is to slow the velocity of foreign 
exchange markets.  But once the tax was established, pressure 
would be there to continue to raise the tax until it actually 
began to work.  It would then become a very difficult 
disincentive for the overall world economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bottom line is that there are insurmountable loopholes 
through this idealistic scheme.  Financial markets contain 
numerous products that are close substitutes to other products. A 
government bond is a close substitute to a high quality corporate 
bond.  Bank deposits are substitutes for money market funds. If 
we tax one product, any investor is going to search out for a 
replacement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think my NDP friends would agree that even in a perfect world 
not every country would sign up to such a tax treaty as they are 
proposing.  Therefore, if a country refused to institute a 
financial transaction tax, it would essentially become a magnet 
for foreign exchange trading operations of major banks worldwide. 
This would be disastrous for countries that went ahead and 
implemented the tax.  It would be a disincentive for them.  It 
would be a competitive advantage for those countries that stayed 
out of the scheme. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The volatility of foreign exchange markets is a fact of life in 
the global economy.  My recommendation is for governments to 
pursue credible fiscal policy and encourage strong transparent 
financial sectors instead of punishing currency traders. Money 
moves when there is a failure to perform.  Accomplishments in a 
working market are rewarded.  Those who do not perform wither. 
Often the volatility of money in the world has to do with seeking 
higher performance.  That is the best kind of discipline wherein 
we all may be better off. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On paper the theory may be convincing to some, however in 
reality it simply would not work.  Therefore, I directly oppose 
the idea of a Tobin tax. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Within our purview, the government has much more pressing 
matters to deal with with respect to its financial house and 
getting our finances in order.  It is my hope the government will 
begin to diligently work at reducing the employment insurance 
premiums for example in order to rebuild the deteriorating 
confidence Canadians have shown in respect of our domestic 
financial markets. 
We need lower taxes.  For markets to work better, rather than 
have a bureaucrat deal with money, it is better to leave the 
money in the hands of a taxpayer, a consumer or an investor.

idea of presenting Motion M-239, as amended to read as follows: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That, in the opinion of this House, the government should show 
leadership and enact a tax on financial transactions in concert 
with the international community. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleagues in the Bloc Quebecois and I generally support in 
principle motions as presented. And my colleague from 
Lac-Saint-Jean clearly demonstrated this. 
Wholesale unregulated globalization is a little scary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So, as far as we are concerned, some regulating of international 
financial transactions, of shameless speculation, is good. 
Members will see why later in my remarks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The meaning of “financial transactions” in general ought to be 
specified. This may be a simplistic example, but let us say I 
have $100 Canadian changed for American money because I will be 
travelling to the U.S. tomorrow morning. Is this kind of 
financial transaction likely to affect the Canadian or American 
dollar? I think not. Should there be a tax on this simple 
transaction? Again, I think not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To sum up, yes, speculation should be taxed or regulated. 
Perhaps the meaning of the word “transaction” should be further 
defined, as we will see later. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Listening to the Reform member who spoke before me, it is clear 
that the Tobin tax can be interpreted any number of ways. People 
see what they want in it and it is blamed for many things. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When James Tobin—I want to make it clear that the premier of 
Newfoundland and former minister on the other side is not the 
one who came up with the idea of imposing such a tax, but rather 
an American economist named James Tobin—won the Nobel Prize in 
1972, I am sure no member of the Reform Party sat on the jury, 
otherwise he would probably never have received this well 
deserved award. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Just because an idea is difficult to implement does not mean it 
should automatically be rejected.  When my Reform Party 
colleague says it cannot be implemented and is unfeasible, and 
that a third issue could even be to consider reinventing Santa 
Claus, I think he is going a bit far. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When he says it is impossible to get all countries to agree to 
go along with a decision that would place legal limits on 
international financial speculation, he is perhaps forgetting 
that today, in 1998, we have the WTO, to which the very great 
majority of, if not all, countries belong.  Only a few are 
missing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Nonetheless, after several years of talks and 
negotiations—starting with the GATT, and moving on—we now have 
harmonized customs tariffs. Ten years before the first GATT 
rounds and before the WTO, various parliaments perhaps had 
debates in which they said that it would be impossible and 
unthinkably utopian to consider harmonizing customs tariffs 
internationally. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But this is what we have today.  Why?  Because countries 
realized that, if countries who engage in this sort of 
international trade wished to evolve in a constructive and 
secure manner, it would be a benefit to rich countries and poor 
countries alike to have a legal framework, a consensual 
framework for trade and tariffs, in order to increase 
international trade and revenues in countries that can benefit 
from such trade.

pound sterling drop and make a billion dollars in profit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The economic situation has evolved, why can our vision and our 
policies not do the same? Why stick to the idea—and I hope it is 
not shared by the majority—put forward by the Reform Party, that 
says “If it is too complicated, we give up and we will vote 
against it”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also have to use our head and say we sincerely do not believe 
that, with this tax, we want to tax everything. If I were to 
invest $1,000 on the stock market or put $1,000 in a mutual 
fund, I do not believe I would be a dangerous speculator with a 
lot of influence on the peso or the U.S. dollar. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, people are playing Russian roulette with foreign 
currencies. People in Thailand and Mexico know full well that 
sometimes, and more often than not, it has a direct impact on 
their currency and hence on their national economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me give you an example. In the last edition of <I>L'Actualité</I>, 
we can read that Bill Gates, whose assets total $51 billion, 
could in one day restore the Russian economy. In today's 
economy, there are some people, some consortiums, some 
investment groups who can at any time use their money to 
influence and destroy whole national economies, and this will 
then trickle down to the regions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This can have an impact at the international level. A few months 
or a few years down the road, unfortunately, Canada will be 
affected. 
In today's new economy, do we have to ask ourselves that 
question? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was listening to the parliamentary secretary and I was 
somewhat surprised. He also talked about the difficulties 
related to the implementation of such a tax. He made reference 
to the May 1995 report of the Standing Committee on Foreign 
Affairs entitled “From Bretton Woods to Halifax”. If I may, I 
will quote from page 57 of that report. It says: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>At this point, the Committee's view is that the feasibility of 
the concept has yet to be proved but that an attitude of 
openness is warranted. The objectives of a tax on currency 
speculation at least have sufficient merit and promise to 
deserve serious longer term examination within a G-7 context. We 
are aware of some research that has already been done, including 
within the Canada's Department of Finance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, ideas of this sort are still only in the very 
preliminary stages of investigation, much less deliberation. As 
even supporters of the concept willingly acknowledge: 
</UL><UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—an 
in-depth feasibility study is needed to analyse the highly 
complex mechanics of foreign exchange transactions. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That was written in 1995, three years ago, nearly four years 
ago. “An in-depth feasibility study is needed”. What did the 
government do with those recommendations? What did the 
government do since May 1995 with this idea of a study 
committee? We never saw such a committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In closing, I want to propose an amendment to Motion M-239. I 
move: 
<A NAME="LINK217">&nbsp;</A>
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That the motion be 
amended by removing the words “enact a tax on financial 
transactions” and replacing them with the following: 
</UL><UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>“promote the implementation of a tax aimed at discouraging 
speculation on fluctuations in the exchange rate” 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This amendment to Motion M-239 would stress the notion of 
transaction, as I pointed out at the beginning of my speech, and 
would make the motion consistent with the Tobin tax.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Scott Brison (Kings—Hants, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
commend my colleague in the New Democratic Party for having 
brought forward this issue to the House of Commons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When James Tobin introduced the concept of a Tobin tax 20 years 
ago it did not make much of a ripple, which were his words.  In 
fact, it sank like a rock.  Periodically we hear about a Tobin 
tax and the idea flares up again typically during times of 
economic turmoil. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the current context, with $1.3 trillion traded daily in 
global capital markets, it has raised its head again similar to 
the Loch Ness monster.  Periodically this monster pops up. Some 
people see it, typically during periods of 
turmoil. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think the hon. member has done us a service by bringing the 
issue forward so that we can debate and discuss the Tobin tax in 
the House.  I have significant concerns about the Tobin tax. Not 
that I do not recognize the importance of developing market 
controls or developing some way to effect the prevention of the 
types of financial disasters we have seen in Southeast Asia, 
prior to that in Mexico and with the Barings Bank and some of the 
spinoffs of that debacle, or BCNI.  These types of disasters have 
been very damaging to economies not only within the sovereign 
borders of those states where they emanated from but in a global 
sense. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do disagree with the concept of a Tobin tax.  I feel there is 
a certain amount of economic naivety that ignores some of the 
unintended consequences of this type of tax.  One of the 
important things we must seek to protect in a global knowledge 
based society is the efficiencies of our capital markets.  Those 
efficiencies can benefit in many ways as opposed to hurt. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In recent weeks and months we have seen the Asian crisis and the 
resulting difficulties.  We should not be asking whether Tobin 
taxes could have prevented the Asian crisis because arguably they 
could have or other arguments say they could not have, but we 
should be asking why currency speculators found an opportunity to 
begin with in those Asian countries.  The fact is governments in 
southeast Asia were operating fiscal policies inconsistent with 
their monetary policies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By global speculators seeing this inconsistency, finding an 
opportunity to make money and investing as such they corrected an 
inherent wrong in those economies much more quickly than would 
have occurred if we had a Tobin tax. 
It is kind of like would we prefer as a country with structural 
deficiencies in our economy either fiscal or monetary to sit on 
the curb bleeding to death or get hit by a bus and be taken to 
the hospital.  The fact is that currency speculators, and arguably 
they are like a bus, draw very quickly global attention on some 
of these hemorrhaging economies and cause us to fix them a lot 
faster with the types of tenable, long term, sustainable, market 
driven solutions which ultimately will prove to be the best.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Tobin referred to the tax initially as throwing sand in the 
wheels of international finance.  I suggest those people who 
believe we can through something like the Tobin tax throw sand in 
the wheels of international finance may have their heads in the 
sand.  It is a huge global enterprise that Canadians can 
participate in and one that Canadians can succeed in if we create 
the appropriate incentives and structural elements in the 
Canadian economy and efficiencies to do so.  The Tobin tax would 
work against us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The idea of imposing a tax on foreign exchange transactions 
sounds fairly innocent, making speculation more costly and in 
proposals supporters claim that would inhibit speculation. The 
question we have to ask ourselves is if speculation can cause 
corrections which ultimately eliminate government ability to make 
the wrong decisions and to create or to pursue fiscally 
profligate policies that are in the long term unsustainable, 
whether we really want to stop that. The idea of financial tax to 
rebuff financial markets pops up periodically and most economists 
reckon that a Tobin tax would not work nor would it be desirable. 
The main problem is enforceability. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even if we had each OECD country sign on, which would be a big 
step, trading would simply move off shore to Singapore or other 
countries such as the Cayman Islands or somewhere else which 
would see a tremendous opportunity.  The tax would have to cover 
a whole range of financial transactions, not just foreign 
exchange trading. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the most difficult financial transactions to actually 
track and one that would be almost impossible for a Tobin tax to 
effect would be derivatives.  Derivatives and other increasingly 
complex financial instruments are becoming increasingly prevalent 
in the global markets and the Tobin tax would not be able to 
effect change. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I could spend 20 minutes describing the Tobin tax and my 
difficulties with it.  The UN describes the Tobin tax as a sort 
of Luddite proposal in terms of its intention to reverse the 
general decline in the cost of international financial 
transactions. We should be looking at some of the things that we 
could do and I am glad this debate has come to the House.  Some 
of the things we should do is work with the IMF to improve 
reporting such that we see more quickly situations developing in 
countries.  We can improve the reporting of governments.  We can improve 
openness and transparency of government policies, directly 
inconsistent with what this government has done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we look at the dollar debacle of this summer when this 
government was blaming currency speculators, the Prime Minister 
was behaving similar to President Suharto. He was blaming 
currency speculators for the weakness in Canadian currency when 
the structural impediments to Canadian productivity in this 
economy are the real culprits. It is not the currency 
speculators.  It is governments that pursue economic policies 
that are unrealistic and governments that do not maintain the 
type of transparency and openness with the international markets 
to make them aware of the types of things they are doing that 
reduce their credibility and ultimately lead to issues like the 
systemic decline in the Canadian dollar or in issues in southeast 
Asia where monetary policy was inconsistent with the fiscal 
policy.
