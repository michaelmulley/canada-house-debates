	<B>Mr. John Finlay (Oxford, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, since being 
elected to this House in October 1993, I have worked to ensure that 
Canadian landowners can have their concerns heard and considered 
by the National Energy Board in hearings involving Canadian 
pipelines.
<P>
	I am happy to say that the Canadian Energy Pipeline 
Association, CEPA, has introduced changes to the way it 
communicates with landowners to allow landowner concerns to be 
heard. This enhanced process will include mediation, when 
necessary, to ensure that landowner concerns are not only being 
heard but investigated by independent experts.
<P>
	This could not have been accomplished without the tireless 
efforts of the Ontario Pipeline Landowners Association, which is 
centred in southwestern Ontario.
<P>
	I look forward to working with CEPA, the Minister of Natural 
Resources, the OPLA and other landowner groups across the 
country, and federal and provincial federations of agriculture to 
ensure that the enhanced process results in safer pipelines for all 
Canadians.

	<B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, <I>Le Courrier</I>, the Saint-Hyacinthe newspaper, is 
celebrating its 145th anniversary. Founded in 1853, it is  the oldest 
French newspaper in North America and a veritable institution.
<P>
	Throughout its history, <I>Le Courrier</I> has covered political news 
and the men and women that make it. Honoré Mercier served as 
editor of <I>Le Courrier</I>, then member for Saint-Hyacinthe and then 
premier of Quebec. Henri Bourassa and T.-D. Bouchard were both 
residents of Saint-Hyacinthe famous at different times nationally 
for their political activities.
<P>
<B>(1405)</B>
<P>
	Despite its venerable age, <I>Le Courrier</I> remains a quality and 
dynamic weekly respected even today by the weekly press, which 
awarded it three years running-1994, 1995, and 1996-the 
prestigious title of weekly of the year.
<P>
	I would therefore like to congratulate the current employees of 
<I>Le Courrier</I> of Saint-Hyacinthe and draw attention to the 
invaluable contribution made by this monument of the Quebec 
press.

<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="LIBERALPARTY">LIBERAL PARTY</A></H4>
	<B>Mr. Jim Gouk (Kootenay West-Revelstoke, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, we are only days away from the expected election call. 
The Liberals claim they will run on their record so let us take a look 
at that record.
<P>
	Bill C-33 provides the framework for further erosion of the 
definition of the family and yet more benefits for a special interest 
group.
<P>
	Bill C-68 cracks down on millions of law-abiding citizens but 
does nothing to the criminals of this country. The preservation of 
section 745 of the Criminal Code allows monsters like Clifford 
Olson and Paul Bernardo to apply for early release.
<P>
	Over $250 million is being spent to cover up the Liberals' 
Pearson scandal without creating a single job, in spite of false 
Liberal claims. The CPP payroll tax has been hiked 73 per cent. 
Social programs have been cut $7 billion. We have had the largest 
tax revenue increase in Canadian history. Parliament has had one

	<B>Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg Transcona, NDP):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
NDP welcomes the commemoration of the 50th anniversary of the 
repeal of the Chinese exclusion act, the discriminatory law that 
along with the Chinese head tax that proceeded it, imposed great 
hardship on Chinese Canadians.
<P>
	It is a reminder that Canadian governments have not always 
governed according to the highest standards of equality in 
democracy. One is reminded of the way Japanese and Italian 
Canadians were treated during the second world war, the way 
Ukrainian Canadians were treated during the first world war, the 
way the Jews fleeing Nazi Germany were not welcome in Canada 
or the way that so-called Orientals were denied the vote for years.
<P>
	It is important to remember and to say never again, but may I add 
that many of my NDP political predecessors in the CCF were 
politically courageous enough to condemn such things when they 
were actually happening and when it was not popular to do so. Part 
of remembering is remembering who was there when the going was 
tough.

	<B>Mrs. Elsie Wayne (Saint John, PC):</B> Mr. Speaker, Transport 
Canada recently privatized the ferry service between Saint John 
and Digby, Nova Scotia. I have spent the last few weeks trying to 
correct this deal gone bad for the former Marine Atlantic 
employees.
<P>
	The winning bidder, Bay Ferries, let all 230 Marine Atlantic 
employees go on privatization. They were told to go home and wait 
for a phone call. Many of the employees were not hired back, even 
though they were fully qualified with 20-plus years of service.
<P>
	I have tried unsuccessfully through the Department of Transport 
to get a copy of the final contract between Bay Ferries and the 
government. My access to information request was returned to me 
explaining that I needed to send an extra $100 because it would 
take the department 15 hours to find a copy of its own contract.
<P>
	This is a stalling tactic and tells me the Minister of Transport has 
something to hide. If the minister has nothing to hide, I ask that he 
live up to the government's promise of more open government and 
table a copy of the contract in this House immediately.

	<B>Mr. Tony Valeri (Lincoln, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, many of my 
constituents in Lincoln rely on herbal remedies for their health and 
wellness needs. Lately they have been concerned that their access 
to herbal and botanical preparations is being denied by the health 
protection branch.
<P>
	To their surprise, herbal remedies, many of which have been 
used for hundreds of years, are increasingly being classified as 
drugs, banned for regular use.
<P>
	Perhaps the time has come to create a new legislative regime 
which would respect the special role that herbal remedies play in 
the health industry. The benefits would be clear, more protection 
for consumers, stronger recognition of the importance of 
preventive medicine and an enhancement of the health and 
wellness of many Canadians.
<P>
	This new step can only be taken if the health protection branch 
and the natural medicine industry work closely together to define 
an approach to natural health products that will capture their unique 
uses and properties.

I rise in the House today to recognize national book day and to

economy.
<P>
	The advent of the printing press changed the face of the world. It 
advanced math, literacy and the spread of information, paving the 
way for modern democracy.
<P>
	In 1751 the first printing company opened in Canada and today 
most of us can name a friend or relative employed in this industry. 
The printing industry is primarily Canadian owned and employs 
more than 75,000 Canadians working in 3,200 establishments 
across the country. Another 85,000 are employed in the fine paper 
industry that supplies their presses. The printing industry is the 
fourth largest manufacturing employer in the nation, producing $8 
billion in shipments this year. Exports to the United States alone 
increased by 13 per cent.
<P>
<B>(1410)</B>
<P>
	Canada's commercial printing industry is dominated by small 
firms, with 82 per cent employing fewer than 20 persons. They also 
use some of the most advanced technologies available.
<P>
	We should be proud of this industry, one that continues to 
prosper, adding to a healthy Canadian economy.

made possible by generations of Chinese Canadians who 
surmounted great hardship and fought for equal opportunity to 
participate in and contribute to Canadian society. The Chinese 
Canadian community across the country is planning a series of 
events this year to pay tribute to those pioneers who paved the way 
for those who have followed.

	<B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, my question is for the Prime Minister.
<P>
	The Liberal government is going into an election without much 
to show in the way of jobs, According to the government's real 
record, it is still more than 900,000 jobs short of the prerecession 
job rate. Faced with the Liberal government's appalling inaction in 
this respect, thousands of discouraged workers have given up even 
looking for work.
<P>
	When the Prime Minister meets unemployed Quebecers on the 
hustings, what will he tell them? Will he repeat that jobs are on 
their way? Will he advise them to move if they are in a hurry to find 
a job? Or will he again say good luck?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I will tell voters, when we have an election, within the 
next 17 months-
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Ha, ha.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chrétien (Saint-Maurice):</B> -that when we started, 
unemployment was at 11.4 per cent and it is now at 9.3 per cent; 
that the Canadian economy created 757,000 new jobs during the 
past three years; that this morning, the International Monetary 
Fund stated that it expects Canada will have the highest economic 
growth rate of any G7 country for the year 1997-98; that the IMF 
expects unemployment to drop in 1997 and 1998 and that if 
Canadians show the necessary discipline, inflation will not be more 
than 2 per cent.
<P>
	I will also tell them that we have been able to reduce short term 
interest rates by more than 3 per cent, compared with the 
Americans. We offer better interest rates than the Americans, so 
that the Quebec government, for instance, can save $600 million on 
its interest payments.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the Prime Minister should tell voters during the election 
campaign that there are nearly 1.5 million people unemployed, five 
million living in poverty, fewer and fewer people eligible for 
unemployment insurance and an impressive number of discouraged 
workers. That is something the IMF did not mention. The IMF did 
not say that deficit reduction was achieved at the expense of the 
unemployed and the provinces.
<P>
	Will the Prime Minister admit he did not keep his promise of 
``jobs, jobs, jobs'', any more than he kept his promise to scrap the 
GST?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the Canadian economy has performed reasonably well, 
because 757,000 new jobs were created since we came to power. Of 
course we would have liked to have more. However, in the 
circumstances, it is a very good performance because, as I have 
said on several occasions, this is a problem facing countries 
throughout the world. In Canada we have created more jobs than 
Germany, Italy and France combined, although the population of 
each these countries is much larger than ours.
<P>
	We are not satisfied, however, and we feel we should keep 
working on it. However, we have put the government's financial 
house in order. The country's finances are in better shape than they 
have been for a long time. Our objective was to reduce the deficit to 
3 per cent of GDP, and we are more than a year ahead of schedule. 
That is why today, people throughout the world are saying that 
Canada's example is the one to follow.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the Prime Minister should realize that economic growth 
should mean more tax equity, more jobs, more humane policies for 
the unemployed and more social justice.
<P>
	Will the Prime Minister realize that economic growth should 
benefit the unemployed and not take place at their expense?
<P>
<B>(1425)</B>
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, that is exactly why in the last budget, for instance, we 
invested new money totalling $850 million in tax exemptions to 
fight child poverty, because we on this side of the House have a 
social conscience and we want to ensure that everyone benefits 
from the progress we have made.
<P>
	The first amounts that became available were applied to poverty. 
We then provided incentives for training people. We invested $800 
million in innovation, so Canada will be ready to compete in the 
21st century.
<P>
	Instead of being negative, we look positively to the future 
because we believe that Canada is the country that will be best 
equipped to enter the 21st century.

<P>
	<B>Mr. Loubier: </B>Let us talk GST, Mr. Speaker.
<P>
	Since April 1996, the Minister of Finance has defended the $1 
billion in compensation paid to the maritime provinces, through a 
pseudo-program of adaptation assistance, one which, when applied 
to Quebec, entitled it to no compensation whatsoever. Such was the 
minister's position for eight or ten months, the time Ottawa took to 
provide Quebec with the figures and information on how they were 
reached. Since then, Quebec has proven that the federal 
government cheated in its calculations and that, in reality, Ottawa 
owes it two billion dollars.
<P>
	My question is for the Minister of Finance. Can the Minister of 
Finance, who generally admits to his mistakes, tell us why he is not 
giving Quebec the compensation to which it is entitled?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the Minister of Finance has been very clear. The 
compensation program offered to provinces having harmonized 
their tax with the federal tax applies to all of the provinces.
<P>
	The provinces which lost money because of harmonization are 
entitled to compensation equivalent to half of the losses incurred. 
In the case of Quebec, it broadened their tax base since 
harmonization. For each of the past six years, it has collected more 
in sales tax than it did at the time of harmonization. Having lost 
nothing, therefore, it did not qualify for compensation.
<P>
	This has been stated clearly, moreover, by the person who was 
Minister of Finance at the time of harmonization, and is now the 
opposition finance critic. He stated clearly and honestly that, in 
fact, Quebec had gained rather than lost in this arrangement with 
the federal government.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I would invite the Prime Minister to read the ten pages of 
Mr. Landry's budget, and he will gain some understanding of the 
matter; at the moment, he understands absolutely nothing.
<P>
	I am now asking my question of the Minister of Finance. Will the 
Minister of Finance acknowledge this legitimate claim and 
reimburse Quebec?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the answer I have just given applies, because there was no 
loss for Quebec, there was a gain. That is clear, and easily verified.
<P>
	When people have nothing else to say, they refuse to look at the 
truth. I know very well that many Quebecers will recall that, a few 
years ago, employees were given pay raises before the referendum, 
and then, for the second time in Quebec history, those who received 
something before the referendum had their pockets picked by the 
Parti Quebecois after the elections.

only three and a half years in office, the earliest election call by a 
majority government in 50 years.
<P>
	Why is it that the government is going to the polls so early? Not 
because it has anything new to say on generating jobs. Not because 
it has anything new to say on its high record of taxation and debt. 
Not because it has anything new to say on national unity. The 
government is calling an early election because it has run out of

go to the people, now he is chickening out.
<P>
	We want to go to the people because of the work we have 
accomplished since the beginning of our term.
<P>
	We will say to the Canadian people that his party does not have a 
program any more. That party was always talking about the deficit. 
We solved the problem.
<P>
	We will go to the people of Canada and say that because of the 
good government we have provided we now have the lowest 
interest rates in 35 years. We will go to the people of Canada and 
tell them that because we had a good government their mortgage 
payments are about half of what they were six years ago. Now 
when people renew a $100,000 mortgage they have $6,000 or 
$7,000 more in their pockets each year, after tax.
<P>
	That is much better than the tax cuts which that party promised 
to give to the banks.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the Prime Minister must be joking if he thinks he can run 
on his record. He must be imagining things. He consulted JoJo the 
psychic who read his mind and went bankrupt shortly thereafter.
<P>
	The Prime Minister cannot run on his record because during the 
election he will be running away from it. The Prime Minister is 
going to be hiding from the 1.4 million unemployed. He is going to 
be hiding from the two to three million underemployed. He is going 
to be hiding from those millions and millions of taxpayers to whom 
he promised tax relief and then broke his promise.
<P>

help him to run away from his record, especially when he has 
nothing new, fresh or creative to say?

restored integrity in the public's eye. In the last four years there has 
not been a scandal on this side of the House. We have changed 
completely the mood of the country.
<P>
	Last month a poll was taken. Five years ago the same poll was 
taken. It surveyed 18 countries. At that time the confidence which 
Canadians had in their national government was at the bottom of 
the list. Only 15 per cent of Canadians had confidence in their 
national government. In the poll taken last month we were ahead of 
every other nation. In four years confidence rose from 15 per cent 
to 55 per cent. That is the best level of confidence of any of the 18

<P>
	The Prime Minister brings back the memory of Liberal Premier 
David Peterson who called an early election, could not explain it to 
the public and then played to protect the lead and lost the game.
<P>
	There are four things which the Prime Minister cannot escape 
through an early election call or through last minute deal making.
<P>
<B>(1435)</B>
<P>
	He cannot escape the worst record of unemployment numbers 
since the depression. He cannot escape the broken GST promise. 
None of them can escape the obscene MP pension plan. He cannot 
escape a pathetic national unity strategy that came within 50,000 
votes of destroying the federation.
<P>
	Since the government has a record like that and it has nothing 
new or creative to say to Canadians, why is the Prime Minister 
going to the polls after only three and a half years?

	<B>Mr. Pierre Brien (Témiscamingue, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the Minister of Finance.
<P>
	The Minister of Finance has nothing better than unconvincing 
sophistries to offer in response to the Quebec Minister of Finance, 
who reviewed his calculations and was able to provide evidence, in 
black and white, that Quebec is indeed entitled to $2 billion, and 
not to zilch, as maintained by the minister.
<P>
	Since it has been established that the minister's McKenna 
formula, when used properly, provides for $2 billion in 
compensation for Quebec, why is the minister not paying this $2 
billion to Quebec? Why is he stubbornly defending the 
indefensible?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Peters (Secretary of State (International 
Financial Institutions), Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, we talked to the 
Quebec government. The federal government held numerous 
discussions with the Quebec government on the calculation of the 
compensation for the GST and the QST.
<P>
	We continue to arrive at the conclusion that Quebec simply does 
not qualify for adjustment assistance. Quebec has not suffered 
losses to the harmonization of the QST and the GST, the public 
accounts of Quebec.
<P>
	I suggest the hon. member look at the public accounts. They 
show us that the annual revenues derived from the QST increased 
following the signature of the harmonization agreement. They went 
from $5.1 billion in 1988-89-90 to $5.4 billion. That is up. In 1991 
they went to $6.2 billion.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Pierre Brien (Témiscamingue, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, on 
March 19, the Minister of Finance himself compared the 
adjustment assistance paid to the maritimes for harmonizing their 
taxes to the financial support provided to the Saguenay flood 
victims and to equalization payments, as if this was just another 
federal assistance program for have-not regions. The minister 
finally admitted that his harmonization adjustment assistance 
formula was a front, a pretence to deny Quebec compensation.
<P>
	With his share of the $1 billion paid to the maritime provinces, 
Frank McKenna is wooing away our businesses with our own tax 
money. When will the minister put an end to this unfair 
competition? When will he pay Quebec the $2 billion it is entitled 
to?

<P>
	Canadians are still wondering what this government intends to 
run on. Maybe it is its job record: 1.4 million Canadians 
unemployed; 800,000 Canadians moonlighting; 78 months in a row 
of unemployment over 9 per cent; the worst jobs record since the 
Great Depression.
<P>
	Since the Liberal jobs, jobs, jobs record is in the tank, can the 
Prime Minister tell Canadians if this is the record his government 
plans to run on?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Peters (Secretary of State (International 
Financial Institutions), Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I suggest the hon. 
member look at the labour market statistics which are published 
each month. I suggest he look at the labour market statistics for 
October 1993: 11.2 per cent unemployment. That was at the time of 
the last election. Presently it is down almost 2 per cent to 9.3 per 
cent. That is a record.
<P>
	Today the IMF has come out with a new statement. The IMF says 
that this year and next year Canada will have the highest growth of 
the G7 countries, 3.4 per cent, which will bring the unemployment 
rate down even more.
<P>
	Of course that is not enough. Of course our unemployment rate 
is too high. We are working on it and are bringing down. That is the 
Liberal system.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
apparently there is still a little gas in the tank over there.
<P>
	If we add in all the people who have dropped out of the job force 
over the last couple of years, the real unemployment rate in Canada 
is over 12 per cent, more than double the American rate.
<P>
	If it is not the Liberal's jobs record, maybe the minister wants to 
run on their tax record or on their bankruptcy record. How about 
the $3,000 drop in disposable income Canadian families have 
suffered since this government came to power and the 37 tax 
increases? What about the record levels of bankruptcy, a record in 
1995, 1996 and 1997?
<P>
	Which one of these is the minister planning to run on, or do the 
Liberals plan to run on empty just like they have done for the last 
3.5 years?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Peters (Secretary of State (International 
Financial Institutions), Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, talk about a party 
running on empty, I wonder how many times the record shows that 
same question being asked by the Reform Party.
<P>
	Let us take a look at the Reform Party's taxpayer budget. What 
does it state in this taxpayer budget? It says it is going to do this 
and that but it will cause a little higher unemployment. If we want 
higher unemployment, we should go to the Reform Party.
<P>
	We are going to run on our record, and our record in deficit 
reduction is second to no government in the country. The <I>Globe

Canada's system: ``Canada's method, consisting of the adoption of

<P>

<P>

	<B>Mr. Chrétien (Saint-Maurice):</B> When there are openings we fill 
them with competent people. It so happens there are some Liberals

<P>
	<B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley East, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I

time I have heard about Liberal values being the patronage trough.
<P>
	Let us talk for a second about the Senate. There have been 20 
appointments over three and a half years, which is better than with 
Brian Mulroney.
<P>
	During the last campaign the Prime Minister talked about 
patronage when he said:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The people of Canada will see a big difference with the Liberals in power.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	If they did, the only difference I can see is that the appointees are 
now Liberal instead of Tory and there is more of them. Maybe that 
is the difference.

	In 1984 then Prime Minister Trudeau made 172 appointments in

the first time ever there have been more women named senators

	We on this side of the House supported the possibility of having 
elected senators. But what happened? Reformers voted against that. 
They wanted to have elected senators and we were for that, but they 
campaigned against changing the Constitution in a way that would 
have permitted the election of senators. Now we appoint senators

proud to be a Canadian, and I am proud that Young Canada Works, 
a national program, is there to provide work for young people.

if it takes young people to help us recognize our country, we say 
yes to Canada.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gaston Leroux (Richmond-Wolfe, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
think the parliamentary secretary was looking at the wrong page

that the use of the conditional sentence, properly applied by the

<P>
<B>(1455)</B>
<P>
	A problem that has been in place is that many violent and 
dangerous offenders are put in jail. The jails are often full of people 
who are not a danger to society. As a result of conditional 
sentences, those who are not a risk to society can be released to 
serve their sentence in the community, leaving more room in our

<P>
	On March 20, in reply to a question from the leader of the 
official opposition concerning the $4.8 million secretly paid by the 
federal government to Option Canada, the Minister of Canadian 
Heritage made comments which do not accurately reflect the 
reality. She said, and I quote:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Mr. Speaker, the member is certainly aware of the fact that the Government of 
Quebec-and I have in my hand a copy of the October 11 order in council-gave a 
total of $4.8 million to the Conseil de la souveraineté du Québec headed by Yves 
Duhaime, the great friend of the new leader of the official opposition.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	This statement aroused our interest, and I have here the October 
11 order in council to which the minister referred. If I can get the 
unanimous consent of the House, I will very pleased to table this 
document. The order in council reads: ``Whereas the government, 
through the August 16 order in council, has already authorized the 
payment of $2 million to the Conseil de la souveraineté, and 
whereas it is in order to pay an additional amount of $1.8 
million''-and a bit, but I believe this is the right 
amount-``therefore it is ordered, on the recommendation of-, to 
pay $1.8 million''.
<P>
	What confused the minister is the ``whereas'' providing that, in 
order to grant a subsidy of more than $1 million, the government's 
prior approval is required. The minister added $2 million, plus $1.8 
million, plus $1 million, for a total of $4.8 million, when in fact-
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> In my opinion, this is not a point of order, but I 
thank the hon. member for the information provided.
<P>
	Is there unanimous consent to have the document tabled?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> The hon. member may therefore table the 
document.

that, as part of developing an official quality assurance program, 
the department establish performance indicators to help determine 
the extent to which program objectives were achieved. These 
indicators are to be included in the department's April 1998 
progress report to the committee; second, that more information be

services and private insurance companies to increase the program's 
efficiency; and finally, that the department consider the possibility 
of intensifying its efforts with respect to rehabilitation to make the 
program more widely accessible.

majority report. However, we have some serious misgivings 
regarding this document. Unions  were not invited to take part in 
the consultations. In addition, the report does not pay enough 
attention to the astronomical unemployment rates in Canada and 
Quebec, especially among young people.
<P>
	We decry the fact that companies spend so little on manpower 
training. Moreover, companies should improve the work place 
environment, working conditions, and salaries to prevent highly 
skilled workers from leaving Canada for the United States. Finally, 
foreign workers should only be allowed in for a few years, not 
indefinitely. The regular immigration system should take care of 
the shortage of workers in the high tech industry.

<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That the third report of the Standing Committee on Public Accounts presented on 
Monday, October 28, 1996, be concurred in.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	He said: Mr. Speaker, I would first like to inform you that I will 
be sharing my time with a colleague and that my motion is 
supported by the hon. member for Laurentides.
<P>
	I am pleased to speak today to a theme that will play a major part 
in the next election campaign, that is, the integrity of this 
government.
<P>
	Speaking of which, the report we are discussing under this 
motion deals with the famous family trust scandal, as you may 
recall.
<P>
	What exactly was done in this matter? As chairman of the 
Standing Committee on Public Accounts, I must say that, 
unfortunately, our committee was not able to get to the bottom of 
what really happened.
<P>
<B>(1520)</B>
<P>
	Let us put the facts in their context. On December 23, 1991, a 
date that sets off an alarm as to how a taxpayer can get an advanced 
decision on December 23, 1991. It quickly raises a certain 
question. So, two taxpayers were able, with Revenue Canada's 
permission and blessing, after asking the advice of the finance 
department, to transfer $2 billion in family trusts to the United 
States.
<P>
	I said that this government would have to account for its 
morality or its integrity. We in the Standing Committee on Public 
Accounts wanted to shed some light on that issue. Since the very 
beginning, the Bloc members on this committee have asked that an 
independent inquiry be conducted so that Canadian taxpayers can 
find out what really happened on December 23, 1991.
<P>
	Even though, as representative of the official opposition, I chair 
the committee, it has to be explained to people watching our 
proceedings that the official opposition does not have a majority on 
the committee. The Liberal majority on the committee literally 
gagged the Bloc members.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, could you ask the chihuahua from Vaudreuil to go 
yap outside the House?
<P>
	The tabling of this new report by the Liberal majority on the 
public accounts committee about the family trust scandal is in 
keeping with the government's cover-up of a financial and tax 
scandal unprecedented in Canada.
<P>
	The Standing Committee on Public Accounts had to shed light 
on the nebulous events surrounding the advanced ruling delivered 
on December 23, 1991, leaving the finance committee to deal with 
the technical aspect, that is to say, the tax changes needed.
<P>
	Soon after that scandal was uncovered by the Bloc Quebecois, 
which followed up on the report of the Auditor General, which 
party raised that issue in the House of Commons? It was the Bloc 
Quebecois. This is a very good illustration of what we are going to 
tell Quebecers during the next election campaign: ``It was a good 
thing the Bloc Quebecois was there to uncover this scandal because 
if, instead of 54 members of the Bloc Quebecois, we had had 74 
Liberal members out of 75, as we did in the 1980s during the 
Trudeau era, this issue would never have been raised''.
<P>
	This is yet another good reason for Quebecers to elect a strong 
contingent of Bloc members to defend Quebec's interests and to 
point out inequalities and injustices in the Canadian federal system.
<P>
	The day after this scandal came to light, several Liberal 
members of the committee were outraged by the actions of 
Revenue Canada and the Department of Finance. These recalcitrant 
Liberals soon went back to the party line of doing everything 
possible to protect the interests of those in very, very high places.
<P>
	I ask those listening from the comfort of their homes to try to 
imagine, the day before they file their tax returns next May 1, that 
they have a way of hiding $2 billion. Are these ordinary taxpayers? 
Are these single mothers who are able to hide $2 billion tax free? 
No, these are not ordinary people.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> Not even $100.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Guimond:</B> Exactly, they would not even hide $100. For 
every hard won cent the average citizen earns, the government is 
right there grabbing half of it. The public will remember this during 
the next election, and the public knows that the Bloc Quebecois 
also defends the interests of the middle class and of disadvantaged 
members of our society.
<P>
<B>(1525)</B>
<P>
	To justify its ineptitude and its lack of courage, the Liberal 
majority maintains that the committee found no element for which 
to cast doubt on the integrity of bureaucrats involved in the making 
of this premature decision. This is incredible. This is extraordinary.
<P>
	Liberal MPs are being hypocritical and even naive in pretending 
to be able to pass judgement on the integrity of the bureaucrats 
involved. All of the Liberal MPs' actions during the committee 
meetings were a shameless attempt to bury the affair by trying to 
conceal the facts.
<P>
	Numerous other examples make the list of inconsistencies, 
inexactitudes, lapses and differing versions even longer. From the 
outset of the committee's  work, the Liberal majority, blatantly 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10126"> 10126 </A></B>
<P>
manipulated by the government, prevented the public accounts 
committee from shedding light on the entire family trusts scandal.
<P>
	The majority report is the crowning achievement in this blatant 
effort by the government to bury this scandal and to silence the 
truth in order to protect themselves. What we said during the 1993 
election campaign, and will repeat during the next one, is that the 
Liberals and the Conservatives are like Tweedledum and 
Tweedledee. Put them into a hat and pull one out, there is no way to 
tell them apart.
<P>
	Let us not forget that this family trust scandal happened in 1991, 
when the Conservatives were in power. Let us not forget that. We 
said to the Liberal majority: ``Why do you not let us bring this fully 
out into the light? You have nothing to gain, but do you have 
something to protect?'' Let us ask the question. Let us remember 
the 1993 election campaign, with its $1,000 parties at Senator 
Cogger's in Westmount, the fund raising parties attended by the 
present Prime Minister.
<P>
	That is why, when campaign contributions are being examined, 
we say ``Look at who is contributing to your campaign fund, and 
then you will know whom you are beholden to''. We in the Bloc 
will be collecting funds for the next election campaign from 
ordinary people, $2 here, $5, $10 or $20 there. Our election 
campaign will not be funded by big business. Whom will we be 
answerable to after the next election? To the ordinary people who 
contributed to our campaign fund. We owe nothing to big business. 
Look at who is behind the funding of the Liberals, of the 
Conservatives. They are no different one from the other.
<P>
	That is why with this dissenting opinion we, the Members of the 
Bloc Québécois, make the following recommendation, and I quote: 
``That a special commission of inquiry be set up, independent of 
the government, with the mandate to shed light on all of the events 
surrounding the December 23, 1991 decision and the subsequent 
use of this tax loophole by other rich Canadian families''. That is 
what the Bloc Quebecois thinks.
<P>
	To conclude, without a neutral investigation, free from all 
partisanship in the Liberal government, this scandal will never be 
brought out into the open. If the government has nothing to hide, no 
one to protect, nothing to feel guilty about, as it says, what is 
stopping it from putting such an commission of inquiry into place, 
one which will certainly absolve it of all blame? Or so the 
government has been telling us over and over for the past six 
months.
<P>
	Once again, I must conclude that, unfortunately, the Liberal 
majority has gagged us in the public accounts committee, and again 
here today we are unable to tell Quebecers and Canadians what 
actually happened in this family trust scandal, where two rich 
families were able to  transfer $2 billion to the United States 
without paying any income tax.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Réal Ménard (Hochelaga-Maisonneuve, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, first of all, I wish to pay a glowing tribute to my colleague 
because he worked so very hard. He is the fiscal conscience of this 
party. Unlike the hon. member for Vaudreuil, he will be able to rest 
easy tonight because he did his job.
<P>
<B>(1530)</B>
<P>
	The question I wish to put to my colleague is this: Could he 
explain, with his usual clarity and expertise, why the Liberals 
refused to shed more light on an appalling situation? Everyone in 
this House knows we are talking about the flight of capital, tax 
evasion and protection. Do members of parliamentary committees 
not have an obligation to report on these matters?
<P>
	I want to ask the hon. member how our Liberal colleagues could 
be so lacking in integrity, transparency and a sense of values?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Guimond:</B> Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the hon. member 
for Hochelaga-Maisonneuve for his very pertinent question.
<P>
	When answering this question, we should consider that the 
names of the two contributors to the campaign fund were never 
released. The <I>Globe and Mail</I> reported the story. I am not going to 
repeat what it said, because we have no evidence.
<P>
	However, we need only look at the main contributors to the 
Liberal and Tory campaign funds. When we see companies giving 
$500,000 and more, the reason is simple: you scratch my back and I 
will scratch yours. We always see the same donors, I agree, but 
these are people who are close to the Liberals.
<P>
	My second point is that senior officials who were there at the 
time, including Pierre Gravel, the Deputy Minister of National 
Revenue, who was there in 1991, continued to work under the 
Liberal government as well. This means that to repudiate the 
decision made by Mr. Gravel in 1991 would have been tantamount 
to admitting it was a sign of incompetence to have kept someone 
like Pierre Gravel since 1993, when the Liberals came to power.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean-Guy Chrétien (Frontenac, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 18 
months ago the member for Richelieu introduced a votable private 
member's bill providing a limit for contributions to campaign 
funds, knowing that certain individuals, groups or companies pour 
hundreds of thousands of dollars into a party'coffers or, not 
uncommonly, into two parties' coffers, to hedge their investment.
<P>
	I was listening very carefully earlier to my colleague for 
Beauport-Montmorency-Orléans talk of the two prominent 
families, obviously well known, that sent over $2 billion to the 
United States without paying a cent in income tax. I would ask the 
member for  Beauport-Montmorency-Orléans to take a few 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10127"> 10127 </A></B>
<P>
minutes to tell us in the Bloc about this transfer of $2 billion to the 
United States tax free.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Guimond:</B> Mr. Speaker, the question by my colleague from 
Frontenac is particularly relevant, but very complex. I will not be 
able in the next 45 seconds to provide an intelligent and 
comprehensible answer to this question. I make no claim to any 
expertise in taxation. So I think my answer would require a lot of 
details.
<P>
	What we can say is that the folks who manage to transfer $2 
billion worth of assets without paying taxes are not the folks who 
do their income tax at the kitchen table while they watch hockey. 
We are talking about billionaires who can afford the best tax 
lawyers in the country at $500 an hour. They are not ordinary folks 
who have a hard time and are fed up with paying income tax. 
Ordinary folks cannot afford a tax lawyer.
<P>
	So, to answer the question, what is involved is tricks, tax 
loopholes, always above board. However, we might well ask 
whether something like this, which is legal, is also moral. Let us 
have a look at the government's morality.
<P>
<B>(1535)</B>
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Resuming debate. With whom will you be 
sharing your time?

Quebec:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That you recognize the member for Berthier-Montcalm so that he may now be 
heard.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> As I was saying that the next speaker had 
to be designated, I noticed that the Bloc House Leader had risen. I 
thought she might indicate who had been chosen. She mentioned 
the member for Berthier-Montcalm, but I gave the floor to no 
one.
<P>
	Under such circumstances I believe it is right to give the floor to 
the member for Berthier-Montcalm.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier-Montcalm, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, thank you for recognizing me. I am certain the member 
for Saint-Hubert would have delivered an excellent speech. I will 
try to be just as good.
<P>
	A moment ago I heard some Liberal members tell the member 
for Beauport-Montmorency-Orléans that it was all the 
Conservatives' doing. I believe we should set the record straight. 
Family trusts are the creation, a great big Liberal baby, of the 
Liberals under Pierre Elliott Trudeau, in 1970.
<P>
	In 1970, Pierre Elliott Trudeau in his great wisdom created 
family trusts for 21 years to reward friends of the government, 
friends of the Liberal Party and other federal parties, since the main 
goal of family trusts is to avoid taxes and allow families to get 
richer.
<P>
	Therefore, in 1970, the Liberal government of Pierre Elliott 
Trudeau, of which the present Prime Minister was a member, since 
the member for Saint-Maurice was in Pierre Elliott Trudeau's 
cabinet in 1970, created family trusts for 21 years.
<P>
	What happened in 1991, 21 years later? The Tories, who were 
against family trusts in 1970, came into office with Mr. Mulroney 
as Prime Minister, and they decided to maintain the family trusts.
<P>
	Really, 1991 was an exceptional year. I think that our viewers 
should pay attention to what is going to be said next, if they ever 
had doubts about the efficacy of the public service. I will tell them 
what happened on December 23, 1991, Christmas Eve, at about 
11.30 p.m. Some public officials went in to work, to allow the 
Bronfman family, two wealthy families in fact, to transfer some $2 
billion to the United States.
<P>
<B>(1540)</B>
<P>
	The day before Christmas, some government employees came to 
Ottawa, went in to their offices at 11.30 p.m. and authorized 
multibillionaire families to transfer $2 billion to the United States 
without paying a single penny in taxes.
<P>
	Do you know what kind of Christmas gift that represented for 
those families in 1991? It meant approximately $500 million, an 
amount which the Canadian taxpayers paid, donated to those 
multibillionaire families. What did the Tory government and the 
Liberals do meanwhile? They turned a blind eye. Because, as we all 
know, these families give to Liberals and Tories alike.
<P>
	Fundamentally, these families are federalists. Whether the 
Liberal or Conservatives are in power is of no consequence to 
them. In any case, they manipulate them through their campaign 
fund. This is how they manipulate the big parties opposite, the 
parties that are funded by these big families. This is why the 
Liberal or Conservative government is so generous.
<P>
	Here we have the biggest scandal of the century breaking out. 
We learned about this scandal, $2 billion transferred from Canada 
to the United States without any tax being paid. What did the 
government do? What did the Bloc Quebecois do? The Bloc 
Quebecois immediately condemned this action, especially when 
we know that the Liberal government is attacking the poorest. It 
makes cuts to unemployment insurance, to transfer payments. 
What must the provinces do, then, if they are stuck with cuts of 
$4.5 billion, like this year? They have to cut welfare, health care. It 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10128"> 10128 </A></B>
<P>
is the federalists  opposite, the Liberals opposite, who are primarily 
responsible for that.
<P>
	We know that two families got $2 billion out of Canada. We 
know that the government seems to have trouble finding money for 
social programs. What did the Bloc do? It asked a parliamentary 
committee to examine the issue and to see whether or not the 
officials who met one Christmas eve to give a nice $500 million 
gift to two multimillionaire families in Canada, had not shown a 
lack of integrity.
<P>
	It is obvious that, at the time, Liberals sitting on the committee 
agreed with the Bloc Quebecois. They were really astounded by 
that announcement, by that scandal, and they seemed to want to get 
to the bottom of the issue. They seemed to want to co-operate with 
the Bloc Quebecois, the official opposition, to examine the issue, 
so this would not happen again.
<P>
	However, the members who had shown some resistance, who 
had dared voice their opinion before checking with the Prime 
Minister, fell back into line, saying there was no problem, 
everything was all right. But it is not all right to let this go on.
<P>
	The committee had to determine if there was any interference by 
officials. Did they or did they not show any lack of integrity? These 
are the big questions the committee had to ask and answer. Instead, 
all the Liberal members of the committee spent the whole time 
trying to sidestep the issue, to avoid shedding light on this 
extremely important matter.
<P>
	Did the committee have the power, the authority to shed light on 
this matter? Yes, it did. Had it made use of all its powers and all the 
parliamentary mechanisms available, it could indeed have shed 
light on the matter. Yes, it could definitely have pointed a finger at 
those responsible and provided a permanent solution to the 
problem.
<P>
	What did the Liberal majority in the committee do? What were 
they instructed to do by the Prime Minister of Canada? They 
started by preventing the committee from fulfilling its mandate. 
That is what they did. They refused to use the investigative powers 
available to them. They would not let the committee hear the 
testimony of all the officials involved. They did not want the 
committee to hold more than two meetings to consider this scandal.
<P>
<B>(1545)</B>
<P>
	It is the scandal of the century. Never before in Canadian history 
have such huge amounts been taken out of the country without the 
proper taxes being paid. The Liberal government across the way 
and its Prime Minister persist in wanting to protect the friends of 
the Liberal Party, those who put money into the party's campaign 
fund. I am sure that, on the eve of calling an election, the Prime 
Minister got on the phone to remind a few friends they had been 
spared in the family trust scandal, adding:  ``I hope you will 
remember how good the Liberal Party was to you, because there is 
an election coming''.
<P>
	That is how it works. They had all the facts, but chose not to act. 
They would rather let things be. They ran interference when Bloc 
members asked questions. Yet, $2 billion was taken out of the 
country. I would say that was pretty serious. What did the Bloc 
members on the committee do? They drafted a dissenting opinion 
to make it clear to the government they disagreed with the 
government's attitude on this issue.
<P>
	Quite frankly, with respect to this issue, given how much money 
is involved, I think it is fair to say, seriously and honestly, that the 
Bloc Quebecois took a very effective approach on the issue and 
acted with professionalism in immediately blowing the whistle on 
this scandal and seeking to correct the situation.
<P>
	There is no way that all aspects of an issue as important as this 
one can be considered in just two days. No way. This was not the 
first time that the Liberal government used such a tactic. The 
government did the same thing in the case of the Somalia inquiry. It 
did not give enough time to the commissioners and judges to get 
the real answers to the legitimate questions of Quebecers and 
Canadians.
<P>
	The same is true in the case of family trusts, this outrageous 
scandal. Some Canadians and Quebecers had legitimate questions, 
but the solutions and answers to these questions could not be found 
in two days.
<P>
	In a dissenting report, the Bloc Quebecois referred to some 
evidence and testimony before the committee. You cannot hear 
many witnesses in two days, but you can still take note of certain 
things.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, since my time is almost up, I would like to 
conclude by moving a motion.
<P>
	I move:

<P>
	<B>Mr. Bellehumeur:</B> Mr. Speaker, I will be pleased to use the time

<P>
	Earlier-I would appreciate it if hon. members would pay more 
attention-I was discussing the report of the public accounts 
committee and pointing out that my colleague did an excellent job. 
He looked at the inconsistency, the inaccuracy and the 
non-compliance of the committee in this-
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> I must tell the hon. member that there are 
five minutes left for questions and comments. It seems the hon. 
member is not the one who should have the floor. I now recognize 
the hon. member for Gaspé.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Yvan Bernier (Gaspé, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is true that it is 
hard to concentrate when the House has just held a vote. I would 
like to see colleagues in the House exercise a little restraint.
<P>
	For us in the Bloc Quebecois, it is very important just before an 
election is called that all Canadians and all members opposite, on 
the government side, feel directly  concerned. They will be 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10130"> 10130 </A></B>
<P>
accountable during the upcoming election campaign for having 
covered up the whole situation surrounding family trusts.
<P>
	I think my colleague, the chairman of the standing committee, 
the hon. member for Beauport-Montmorency-Orléans, showed 
this very well. It is one of the loveliest ridings in the Quebec City 
area. I think the committee's hearings showed that the Liberals 
tried to cover this up.
<P>
	I would like to ask a question of my colleague, who gave a 
brilliant speech. I would like him to explain again to the Liberals 
opposite the avarice behind what they were trying to hide.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bellehumeur:</B> Mr. Speaker, I am extremely pleased to reply 
to my colleague, the member for Gaspé, on this issue.
<P>
	On a number of occasions, the Liberals were heard telling us in 
the House that the whole issue of family trusts, the scandal of the 
century, was not their fault. They were not the ones who did it, it 
was the Conservatives. To help the Liberal members opposite, 
because they are going to be asked about this during the upcoming 
election campaign, I would like them to recall that it was in 1970, 
when Pierre Elliott Trudeau was in office, that 21 year family trusts 
were introduced.
<P>
	In 1991, the Conservatives took over. Having opposed the idea in 
1970, they simply continued the family trust system.
<P>
	What must be remembered is that, on December 23, 1991, the 
day before Christmas at approximately 11.30 in the evening, very 
industrious employees of the department headed up to Parliament 
Hill and went to their offices.
<P>
<B>(1640)</B>
<P>
	Why? So that two rich Canadian families could move $2 billion 
out of Canada without paying a cent in taxes. Do you know what 
kind of a present this represents for these multibillionaire families? 
It represents a minimum of $500 million that Canadian taxpayers, 
the unemployed, single parent families and fathers who have 
trouble making ends meet at the end of the week because of taxes 
and the way the Liberal government is spending public money, all 
had to make up through the taxes they paid.
<P>
	That is the scandal. And what have the Liberals done since 1993? 
They have covered it up. They have done everything to prevent us 
from finding out what really happened on December 23 at 11.30 in 
the evening. The Liberals took part in this cover up.
<P>
	We in the Bloc Quebecois, as the official opposition and as 
watchdogs, asked questions here in the House. We wanted to get to 
the bottom of the matter once and for all in committee, and the 
member for Beauport-Montmorency-Orléans did an excellent 
job  in this regard as chairman of this committee in really trying to 
get to the bottom of this cover-up by the Liberals, who did 
everything they could to prevent us from getting answers to 
legitimate questions everyone had about this scandal.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> It is my duty, pursuant to Standing Order 
38, to inform the House that the questions to be raised tonight at the 
time of adjournment are as follows: the hon. member for 
Shefford-Hyundai plant in Bromont; the hon. member for 
Brandon-Souris-Flooding.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Sue Barnes (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
National Revenue, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the members of the 
Bloc party opposite who called for an adjournment of this House. It 
gave us time to gather together to once again go over the same facts 
that we have already gone over in very public debates, not only 
here when debating a Bloc motion when we covered this ground, 
but also in a debate in the public accounts committee and a very 
public debate in the finance committee.
<P>
	Instead of talking about innuendo and speculation and the Bloc's 
idea of what they are looking for, which is a problem, let us deal 
with the facts the committees had to deal with. The fact is 
Canadians can see through the transparency of the political 
process. We had not just one process which is normally accorded to 
an issue, but two processes with two separate House committees 
both of which have membership from all parties across this floor.
<P>
	The primary spark of this debate was an issue and two rulings 
that came up when the Tory regime was in power, long before we 
were the government.
<P>
	The auditor general has to be given credit for bringing this to the 
attention of the House and not the Bloc, which they would like to 
argue. The auditor general, not the Bloc, is the watchdog. The 
auditor general deserves the credit for doing his job. That credit 
was given to the auditor general in the third report of the public 
accounts committee.
<P>
	The auditor general reviewed all the documents in the file. He 
witnessed this Liberal government's quick and decisive response to 
issues which originated out of a tax problem. Those were dealt with 
primarily by the expertise of the House finance committee and 
legislation was brought in to close any so-called loophole that 
could have existed.
<P>
	There was another process in the public accounts committee to 
go over the Revenue Canada side. Recommendations were issued 
in the report of the Standing Committee on Public Accounts. The 
recommendations were acted upon by the revenue department, but 
not when the report of the Standing Committee on Public Accounts 
asked under recommendations; in fact the public accounts report  
congratulated Revenue Canada for having acted immediately on 
the issue being brought to the attention of the House by the auditor 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10131"> 10131 </A></B>
<P>
general. We have a response. We have today an objective that is 
more political than substantial by the Bloc members of the House.
<P>
<B>(1645)</B>
<P>
	I quote what the auditor general said at the Standing Committee 
on Public Accounts. ``I take comfort in the fact that the problem we 
raised was debated openly by parliamentarians and other observers. 
And at the end of the day, the Minister of Finance chose to amend 
the act and to clarify certain points which had created problems for 
us. I therefore consider this matter closed''.
<P>
	Those are not the words of the government. Those are the words 
of the auditor general: ``I therefore consider this matter closed''.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Campbell:</B> But not for the Bloc.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Barnes:</B> But not for Bloc members. They know what is the 
business before the House today. They get the Order Paper. We are 
going to spend time debating the motion and so be it. They are 
technically within the rules and so we will answer.
<P>
	We acted quickly and thoroughly to ensure that events that 
occurred under the previous Tory government could not occur 
again. That is the basis. People in the country want good 
government. They do not want to hear about problems. They want 
to know what the solution is. Well, we have a solution.
<P>
	We in the government are solution and future oriented, not going 
back into history to find more and more grievances to air just 
because we can get some coverage.
<P>
	The official opposition heard the comments of the auditor 
general. Bloc members heard that he now considers the matter 
closed. They are now questioning the judgment of the auditor 
general, even though they went out of their way earlier in the 
debate and earlier in committee to praise the auditor general for 
raising the issue. They praise him when he raises the issue but 
question him when he says that the case is closed. That is the 
official opposition.
<P>
	The official opposition said that the auditor general is the watch 
dog. We concur. The auditor general has the responsibility to 
oversee all events that take place here. That is why auditor general 
reports not only come before the public accounts committee but 
many other committees when he reports on specific activities 
within the domain of those parliamentary committees.
<P>
	When we took power in 1993, the auditor general stated at that 
time there needed to be consistency of rules. We now have 
consistency of rules. We also agree that there has to be a 
transparency of process. What could be more transparent than two 
standing committee of the House holding public meetings with the 
press,  witnesses, experts and people who have an interest in the 
problems able to be there. We are talking about the taxation policy 
of the country and the rulings of departments.
<P>
	As taxation policies evolve, certain rules have been tightened, 
clarified and more and more consistency has been imposed. We 
now have a broad publication of rulings. All this was done before 
the age of everything being computerized and out in the public. Of 
utmost importance is the privacy of individual taxpayers. That is at 
the heart of the system of taxation which we know is the best in the 
world.
<P>
	Bloc members must understand that 96 per cent of Canadians 
report their income voluntarily and pay their taxes. We are in tax 
season now with a deadline of April 30. We have one of the best tax 
collection systems in the world. We have one of the best 
departments in the world. It seems the integrity of all the people 
who work in that department is always being raised as an issue. 
Integrity is definitely not the issue. After the issue was drawn to 
our attention, the assistant auditor general, the person who had 
primary control of this file, testified not only before public 
accounts committee but he also before the finance committee.
<P>
<B>(1650)</B>
<P>
	At the finance committee he said: ``We have seen no evidence of 
bad faith and we have seen no evidence of wrongdoing''. Before 
the public accounts committee the auditor general said on May 8, 
1996: ``I have never had the occasion or the need to ever question 
the integrity of the senior officials at Revenue Canada''.
<P>
	I go on to the Reform Party. Its members were on these 
committees. The Reform member for Capilano-Howe Sound said 
in the House: ``In spite of serious efforts on my part, in no case 
could I discover any evidence of wrongdoing''. The Reform Party, 
in the minority report that was tabled with part of the public 
accounts committee report, stated: ``We are in no way imputing 
motive and questioning the integrity of the officials involved''.
<P>
	The only ones perpetrating the myth of a scandal is the Bloc 
opposition. It has no evidence of back up allegations but it persists 
because it is looking for some issue for the campaign trail. Instead 
of dealing with the orders of the day we will deal, for partisan 
purposes, with the Bloc. The government is not afraid to deal with 
that issue because it is already dealt with. We dealt with it with 
legislation. We dealt with it in committees and we have tabled 
reports.
<P>
	What we have to do here is look at reality. Reality is that there 
was a taxable Canadian property definition. When people leave this 
country, what will they be taxed? It is a migrant taxation issue, 
which is a very technical area of the act. Decisions were made. 
Both reports stated that the decisions made were concurred in by 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10132"> 10132 </A></B>
<P>
experts in  the tax community. I will let the people in the finance 
committee deal with the process.
<P>
	Somebody is trying to use some nice catch phrases-maybe if 
we say family trust-we can scare up a few individuals. I used to 
practice law. Trusts were set up every time somebody died and had 
a will. That is a form of trust. Thousands and thousands of people 
have family trusts. They are not rich folk. They are ordinary 
Canadians. We can use the trigger words that Bloc members hope 
will catch on, or we can do something about what was a legal 
problem and clarify it.
<P>
	I do not know why we are talking about that because it is already 
done. We have already done our job. We know the system is now 
tighter. We know that Revenue Canada now publishes the rulings 
widely because of privacy concerns.
<P>
	I am not even sure if the Government of Quebec has done that. I 
am pretty sure that it has not, even though its members talked about 
it. They should be coming up to where we have the problem. That is 
another matter. I will let that jurisdiction take care of itself.
<P>
	The privacy concerns of taxpayers are something that the Bloc 
opposition at one point in the debate were not even concerned with 
because they wanted release of taxpayers' names. I can remember 
sitting in the public accounts committee and asking how Bloc 
members could do it, how they could go to the heart of the tax 
system wanting to release to the public names.
<P>
	It took quite a few meetings before they finally withdrew that 
Bloc motion, but finally they saw the damage they were doing. 
Maybe it finally clicked in their heads that it was their constituents 
too who could have had their taxpayer files open just because 
somebody told them that this information would be released. We 
know that is wrong. We know that is absolutely wrong. Not only 
that, but I cannot imagine it.
<P>
<B>(1655)</B>
<P>
	I read an article last week about tax cops in Russia who actually 
rap on people's doors. They do not have the good voluntary 
compliance within the tax system that we have. That could happen 
if we just throw out the rules. The Bloc's original motion asked us 
to release tax names, but the government stood very firmly and said 
that it would not do that, because it is not a permissible situation, 
nor is it in the Canadian public's interest.
<P>
	We have very specific rules. Revenue Canada publishes the 
rulings for the guidance of tax professionals who need that 
clarification. This allows for consistency, which was not there 
when this original problem came up. It is even done when 
interpretations and decisions are published so those within the 
department and tax practitioners across Canada can know what the 
department rules. Revenue Canada takes the special step of 
releasing that identifiable information. The amendment is 
necessary so the names cannot get out and  so identifying 
information cannot get into the public domain.
<P>
	The heart of the matter is that the Bloc members do not want to 
listen, they do not want to learn. They want scandal. They are not 
interested in good government. They are not interested in 
progressive legislation. They are not interested in the sanctity of 
the taxation system. They are interested in cheap partisan politics. 
This is not the first attempt but at least the third attempt. There will 
probably be more because they will compound this in whatever 
way it can be utilized.
<P>
	Perhaps the most important thing I could do today to assist us in 
this matter that has been raised by the Bloc is to move an 
amendment. I move:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That, the motion moved by the Bloc today be amended by deleting all of the 
words after the word ``be'', and by substituting therefor the words ``referred back to 
the said standing committee for reconsideration of the dissenting reports contained 
therein''.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	That is exactly what the Bloc members really want. They want 
an airing of their dissenting reports. We will comply.
<P>
	I thank the hon. Bloc members for giving me the opportunity to 
go over this very old ground and to make sure the Canadian public 
understands there is a difference between people who complain and 
people who act, between people who stand for good government 
and a fair, equitable and transparent tax system and the people who 
just want to use partisan politics to go over an issue that auditor 
general has on more than one occasion complained. Case closed.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Ringuette-Maltais):</B> The 
amendment is in order. We will be resuming-
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Tremblay:</B> Madam Speaker, we would like a copy of the 
motion in French, please.
<P>
<B>(1700)</B>
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Ringuette-Maltais):</B> All hon. 
members have the right to table, in one of the two official 
languages, an amendment or a document. I will read the motion as 
it was moved and the hon. members can use the interpretation 
services.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Guimond (Beauport-Montmorency-Orléans, 
BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I want to briefly point out four things to the 
Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of National Revenue.
<P>
	First of all, I would like to know if it is normal, or usual, for the 
employees of the revenue department to process in such a way the 
request of an ordinary taxpayer, an ordinary citizen, who wants to 
get some tax benefits. If a resident of mine, in the riding of 
Saint-Jean, Île d'Orléans, were to ask for an advance tax ruling, 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10133"> 10133 </A></B>
<P>
would an army of civil servants be asked to work on next  
December 22? Is that normal? Is that acceptable? Is it what the 
people who are listening to us can usually expect? This is what I 
want to find out. I would like the parliamentary secretary, who has 
some contacts in the revenue department, to tell me if it is possible, 
normal and usual.
<P>
	Second, I would like to know why the parliamentary secretary 
thought it appropriate to give us a lecture on ethics and 
transparency. I almost took out my handkerchief. She nearly made 
me cry. We are given lectures on transparency. I would like to know 
why, at the public accounts committee, the parliamentary secretary 
herself voted against the Bloc Quebecois proposal calling for an 
independent inquiry into the family trust scandal. Why did she, and 
not her neighbour, her grandfather or her grandmother, vote against 
this?
<P>
	I want to remind Quebecers that it is a good thing the Bloc 
Quebecois was there to ask for this independent inquiry. Had 
Quebec been represented by 75 Liberal members, as it used to be in 
the Trudeau years, instead of 54 Bloc members, there would never 
have been a request for an impartial, independent inquiry not 
controlled by the government. Thank goodness the Bloc Quebecois 
was there. That was my second point.
<P>
	The third point I want to make is a little more technical. The 
auditor general tells us that it is unusual for Revenue Canada to 
issue advance rulings on past transactions. Once again, if it is 
unusual, why was it done in this case? Why?
<P>
<B>(1705)</B>
<P>
	Are there two kinds of justice or two sets of rules? If you want to 
transfer $2 billion in family trusts, either you can do it as a private 
citizen and Revenue Canada will harass you afterwards or you 
cannot do it. Why did Revenue Canada make an exception and 
issue advance rulings on past transactions?
<P>
	Finally, I would like the parliamentary secretary to comment on 
the attitude of the Deputy Minister of Finance, David Dodge, who, 
after that meeting, chewed out the auditor general. It is another 
form of psychological torture. It is a way of criticizing him for 
unearthing this, for rocking the boat. What kind of attitude is that 
coming from one of the highest ranked government officials, 
Deputy Minister of Finance David Dodge, who literally lashed out 
at the auditor general in public, in front of private citizens and 
journalists.
<P>
	Unfortunately, good manners prevent me from repeating in this 
House the exact words that were used on that occasion. I would like 
the parliamentary secretary to tell us if she finds such behaviour 
normal and acceptable.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Barnes:</B> Madam Speaker, I would like to thank the hon. 
member for his question.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
It gives me an opportunity to say what a wonderful job he did 
chairing the public accounts committee during these debates. This 
is the gentleman, not the government, that controlled the 
committee. The questioner himself was the person who chaired the 
public accounts committee during the debate.
<P>
	I thank him because that is the only committee chaired by the 
official opposition. I agree with the fact the official opposition 
chairs the committee.
<P>
	The questioner is now saying his committee is not good enough 
and that there should be a public inquiry. He wants us to spend 
some more money and to forget we have had two public and 
transparent committees, one in the control of the hon. member 
asking the question. Again I thank him for the job he did chairing 
the committee.
<P>
	I want to answer him directly. He raised by innuendo some 
speculation that there is perhaps something funny about giving 
rulings in December or just before Christmas. The hon. member 
was in the room when the testimony was given at committee. He 
knows Revenue Canada statistics show that issuing a great number 
of rulings in December is the norm because it is the year end and 
the last date for cutoff.
<P>
	In past years we had floating years for corporations, but most 
business people in Canada understand that a great many 
corporations have January 31 as their cutoff for the year. It is 
changing in some respects, but it was the norm at the time these 
rulings were issued.
<P>
	I will deal specifically with the member's question. I will give an 
example. Nineteen rulings were issued in the last week of 
December 1991. In 1992, 33 rulings were issued in the same 
period. In 1993, 42 rulings. In each of 1994 and 1995, 28 rulings 
were issued in that week.
<P>
	In actual fact the bulk of of the rulings of Revenue Canada occur 
in the last quarter of the year. That is not unusual. To get to that 
point some work has to be done in advance.
<P>
	The Canadian public needs to know that Revenue Canada is in a 
service business. We have clients who pay us taxes so we can do the 
work of good government as the Government of Canada. We 
require the funds but we also have committed to advance rulings 
which are not very useful if they are given after the fact.
<P>
	When somebody comes to us with a problem and says ``here is 
what we need to do by this date so please give us an advanced 
ruling'', we work toward making sure we meet that deadline. That 
is common sense, that is good government and that is service.
<P>
	<B>Mr. George S. Baker (Gander-Grand Falls, Lib.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I congratulate the hon. member on the excellent speech 
she gave and want to ask her a question. Quel est le problème avec 
le Bloc?
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10134"> 10134 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1710)</B>
<P>
	Why would the Bloc totally confuse the situation? Why would 
the Bloc talk about 1971? The Liberals brought in the 21-year rule 
which stated that at the end of 21 years the rich would pay. The 
Tories extended the 21-year rule indefinitely when they came to 
power. When the Liberals came back into power they closed it off 
completely. To add further to the confusion, could it be that Bloc 
members are just as interested as the Tories were in giving tax 
breaks to the rich?
<P>
	Why would the Bloc on October 18, 1996 in the House of 
Commons refer to the tax agreement the Tories negotiated to 
change the estate tax and say that it supported a Senate bill? It 
supported entering into an agreement with the United States on 
estate taxes. It realized that some Americans were penalized by 
differences in legislation. It indicated that the bill did not specify 
how many millions or billions of dollars were at stake. It did not 
know which country, Canada or the U.S., would benefit the most 
from tax liberalization.
<P>
	Why would the Bloc be supporting tax breaks that the Tories 
negotiated for the rich?
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Why does the Bloc want to protect the rich? What is the problem 
with the Bloc?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Ringuette-Maltais):</B> The hon. 
parliamentary secretary has 30 seconds to answer.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Barnes:</B> Madam Speaker, with 30 seconds to answer I can 
only say I have no idea what is in the minds of Bloc members. I 
know what the government does and I can make that choice.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Silye (Calgary Centre, Ref.):</B> Madam Speaker, I am 
hearing some interesting comments being thrown back and forth. 
The last Liberal questioner just does not understand the objective 
of the Bloc. The Bloc is not out to give tax breaks to the rich. The 
Bloc is out to tax the rich. It is exactly the opposite. It is 
complaining that billions of dollars are disappearing because they 
are hidden in family trusts. It wants to tax those people. It wants its 
share of the revenues.
<P>
	How can a Liberal member who is listening to the debate say the 
Bloc wants to give tax breaks to the rich? This is what is wrong 
with the Liberal government. It is the spin it wants to give the 
thing. It is the perception it wants to create. Liberals are interested 
in perception, not reality. They are not listening to what the debate 
is all about.
<P>
	It is a shame that a gentleman who is as good at communication 
and can express himself so eloquently would waste those God 
given talents on distorting the truth and the facts.
<P>
	Nevertheless I am a member of the Standing Committee of 
Public Accounts. I was also present when the issue was debated 
there. As Reformers my colleague from the riding of St. Albert and 
I were very concerned about the issue. The Liberal spokesperson 
from public accounts who addressed the issue refuted what the 
Bloc members had to say. She did a reasonably good job of 
explaining the circumstances.
<P>
	I find interesting now that it is relatively over, so to speak, her 
recollection of the facts: the events are now wonderful. She praises 
the auditor general when the chairman of the Standing Committee 
of Finance, who was present in the House today, openly criticized 
the auditor general for having the audacity to question the transfer 
of these trusts to the United States. That is the reality. He criticized 
the auditor general and now the Liberal spokesperson is praising 
the auditor general.
<P>
<B>(1715)</B>
<P>
	Another fact conveniently distorted or interpreted different from 
the way I saw things happen was when this hit the newspapers and 
it was out there, the Bloc Quebecois did make a big issue out of this 
and raised family trusts. It was on family trusts from the very first 
meeting we had on the GST the first year it came here. It is an issue 
that it is very concerned about and very much interested in.
<P>
	This issue comes to the forefront and lo and behold, the finance 
minister tried to pre-empt the responsibilities of the public 
accounts committee and take away its right to review the situation. 
He shoved it off to the Standing Committee on Finance where it 
wanted to review all of this and not have it under public accounts.
<P>
	We know the public accounts committee is the one that is 
supposed to be looking at the comments of the auditor general and 
from that ask for witnesses and testimony. We felt that the Standing 
Committee on Finance could do what it wanted and we also looked 
into it.
<P>
	In pursuing the issue I have some other facts I would like to 
present. Looking into it, trying to get to the bottom of it, trying to 
find out whether there were some tax dollars that should have 
stayed in Canada that ended up not being collected, those are 
honourable and good questions.
<P>
	Imagine a system once they form the government in the new 
country of Quebec. They are going to publish names of taxpayers 
they are investigating. That is not right. That is not the kind of tax 
system I would like to have or a country I would like to be in. That 
is a private matter and is very confidential. On that issue I 
definitely disagree.
<P>
	The chairman of the Standing Committee on Public Accounts in 
one of his questions earlier today was concerned about what kind of 
system we have where somebody asks for an advance ruling. I 
think that is good  system. An advance tax ruling on a complicated 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10135"> 10135 </A></B>
<P>
issue is a service that Revenue Canada should provide. It is a 
service that is very valuable and is used very often.
<P>
	When some people are into very complicated financial 
transactions and the implications of moving funds around in trust 
to find out how the tax department would treat it, whether it would 
be taxed right away, deferred or not taxed at all, these are important 
elements to consider. Advance tax rulings are a process we in 
Canada, a lot of individuals and businesses, appreciate.
<P>
	The actions of Revenue Canada on this issue are suspect for the 
reason, as I recollect the facts, that on the second ruling the 
department in all its documentation, in everything that was in the 
files prior to the last meeting, indicated it was not going to give a 
favourable ruling. It was to rule against this movement of assets, 
taxable properties, within a family trust
<P>
	All of sudden it is reversed. Why? The purpose of the public 
accounts committee was to find out and ask witnesses. We still do 
not have a clear answer on that. We do not know why there was a 
reversal. Certainly it is its right to reverse it but when all the 
documentation, all the arguments and all the evidence as it builds a 
file and review a case are leading it in one direction, why all of a 
sudden is it changed?
<P>
	The Bloc is asking good questions. Why is there special 
treatment here? Was there special treatment? Was there 
favouritism? Was this an order by a cabinet minister who said 
reverse it? Was it politically motivated? We tried to get to the 
bottom and we could not. The Standing Committee on Finance then 
made some recommendations and it theoretically closed the 
loopholes.
<P>
<B>(1720)</B>
<P>
	What was happening that was wrong while the committee was 
doing this? While the Standing Committee on Finance was 
reviewing the issue, the Minister of National Revenue froze all 
other transactions of this nature, denying for six to seven months 
the rights of other Canadians to obtain advance tax rulings and to 
make transactions within trusts. It was done at the expense of other 
taxpayers.
<P>
	It was something the Minister of National Revenue should not 
have done. She should have allowed the process to continue 
because if the decision was a good decision and if the decision had 
the facts to support the action from a tax point of view, it should 
have been a precedent which would have been available for other 
Canadians. It seemed to us in committee that the government was 
trying to hide it, push it under the rug and not let us get to the 
bottom of it. It was frozen.
<P>
	Then the loophole was closed and we were told it is finished. 
However, like I say, there was a price to pay in doing that.
<P>
	I would like it to be known that this transaction had with it a tax 
liability. The trust went to the United States. It went to New York 
state. We found out that the way the deal was made, the way the 
ruling came down, this could be allowed to happen but only if 
during the next ten years, from 1991 to the year 2001, if any of 
those assets were cashed in, if any of it was liquidated, the tax 
liability would be owing to Canada and Canadians would receive 
that money. Theoretically, as we are debating this issue today, if 
those individuals were to do anything to liquidate certain assets 
within the trust, the moneys would be taxed and the tax would be 
owing to Canada.
<P>
	After the ten years the tax would be owing and payable in the 
United States, in New York state. However, these individuals did 
not do this to avoid paying tax. The tax liability is there. It is a 
question of whether it is payable to Canada or to the United States. 
Ten years from the date of the agreement the tax is owing to 
Canada.
<P>
	As well, the tax rate in New York state on this trust would have 
been higher than it is in Canada. Therefore to argue that these 
individuals were trying to avoid taxes or trying to pay lower taxes 
is not true. I would like to let it be known that these people were 
just looking for ways to get their trust moved around.
<P>
	Did this happen in such a way that there should have been an 
immediate tax liability on the assets payable to Canada? I do not 
know. I do not know the technicalities. I cannot say whether there 
should or should not have been. However, other Canadians should 
not have been denied the same rights while this was being looked 
at.
<P>
	The public accounts committee went as far as it could, with good 
intentions. We were not quite satisfied with all the answers. There 
were minority reports filed.
<P>
	With respect to the matters of tax liability, tax avoidance and tax 
concurrence there is an honour system in Canada. I am starting to 
get the sense that the government is becoming tougher and is not 
willing to trust Canadians. The government amended the Income 
Tax Act in the last budget, which is to come into force this year. 
Now we are going to be requested on our income tax forms to not 
only report our income, tax liability, how much was deducted at 
source and how much is still owing, but a year from now the 
government is going to ask all individuals to list their foreign 
assets. We will not only have to report our income and the liability 
on that income, we will have to report our foreign assets. Why? The 
government does not trust Canadians. It feels that some Canadians 
are hiding assets offshore and not paying tax on them when they are 
sold, not declaring their gain on the assets.
<P>
<B>(1725)</B>
<P>
	Our system in Canada hires a lot of people. Revenue Canada has 
a budget of $2.2 billion, 44,000 employees. There are some darned 
<P>

<B><A NAME="10136"> 10136 </A></B>
<P>
good auditors. Those auditors are  the ones who should be looking 
at who is and who is not paying taxes on offshore assets. Why not 
do that?
<P>
	If there is a problem with the business immigration plan and 
some immigrants are not following the system, audit more of them. 
We know that when a tax avoidance scheme or a tax shelter 
develops and the business community takes undue advantage of it, 
the auditors audit research and development grants until we find 
out what is legitimate and what is not and we find out that some 
people were cheating. That is how to solve it, not putting in the 
Income Tax that one must under penalty of imprisonment or under 
penalty of something else. That drawing and quartering is 
ridiculous. That is not the way we should be going.
<P>
	Today something happened in public accounts that is all related 
to what we do as a committee. A very important issue was raised 
about generally accepted accounting principles and how 
government commitments are booked; the $961 million transition 
payment to the three Atlantic provinces; the $800 million 
commitment for the foundation for innovation.
<P>
	Bloc members were ready to debate this. Reform was ready. The 
auditor general was at the committee along with the deputy 
minister. These people were kind enough to show up to discuss the 
issue so that I would either stop criticizing or continue to criticize 
the finance minister. There are seven Liberal members on that 
committee. Not one of them showed up and the chairman had to 
cancel the meeting. That is a shame and I do not think it is in order.
<P>
	I feel I have contributed as much as I can to shed light on what 
happened on this issue.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Peterson (Willowdale, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, I would 
like to put a question to the hon. member. The Bloc Quebecois has 
decried throughout Canada what they call the family trust scandal.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Nunez:</B> But it is true.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Peterson:</B> It is not true. Both the Standing Committee on 
Public Accounts and the Standing Committee on Finance have held 
public hearings on this issue. Tax experts who had conducted an 
extensive review of this case told us that our public officials were 
fair and had the right to give what is called an advanced tax ruling. 
According to these experts, who hail from the private sector and 
work in this complicated and difficult area, our employees had the 
right to act as they did.
<P>
	But despite all of this, I want to point out that, after being made 
aware of the situation, the government reacted very quickly. It 
agreed with the proposals made by the Standing Committee on 
Finance to create in Canada one of the toughest tax systems where 
immigration is concerned.
<P>
	We have heard a lot of lies in this House and everywhere else 
about family trusts. Let my give you an example of a lie I heard 
today. Someone said that it was the Liberal government under 
Pierre Elliott Trudeau, in 1970, that came up with the idea of 
family trusts. That is not true. Family trusts have existed since the 
17th century. They have always existed to help families, farmers, 
people-

<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="HYUNDAIPLANTINBROMONT">HYUNDAI PLANT IN BROMONT</A></H4>
	<B>Mr. Jean H. Leroux (Shefford, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, Hyundai 
has been in the news a great deal in our area since this firm closed 
its plant in Bromont.
<P>
	The former Bloc member for Brome-Missisquoi, Gaston 
Péloquin, had predicted during the last election campaign that the 
Hyundai plant in Bromont would close. Of course, everybody then 
believed that he was not telling the truth.
<P>
	After getting a $23 million loan from Ottawa and the same 
amount from Quebec, Hyundai set up its plant in Bromont with the 
objective of producing 100,000 cars a year. We know that this 
objective was never reached.
<P>
	When the closing of the plant was announced, Mr. Péloquin and I 
got together to try to find out more about the future of the Hyundai 
plant and the 800 jobs that would be lost. We are talking about 800 
direct jobs, 800 quality jobs, 800 well-paid jobs. These 800 direct 
jobs and the contracts that were awarded generated significant 
economic benefits throughout the Granby-Bromont region.
<P>
	These jobs were held by people between 25 and 30 on average. 
We know how difficult it is today for young people to find quality 
jobs. Our young people were hit hard.
<P>
	At that time, I urged the government, on behalf of the Bloc 
Quebecois, to act as quickly as possible to save these jobs and, 
more importantly, to ensure that this situation does not reoccur.
<P>
	The Prime Minister does not miss an opportunity to brag about 
job creation. In this case, the federal government failed miserably. I 
also attended a few meetings held by employees of the Federal 
Office of Regional Development for Quebec, in Montreal. Nothing 
could be done. The Liberal government across the way did nothing 
to save this plant other than take part in unsuccessful meetings.
<P>
	What we know now is that all the equipment was taken out of the 
plant and that the executive is challenging the City of Bromont's 
assessment roll to have their municipal taxes reduced.
<P>
<B>(1735)</B>
<P>
	Yet, the solution for the future is obvious. We must find another 
destination for this plant. We should find buyers, a company 
willing to acquire this infrastructure, a modern plant. We have to 
recognize that Hyundai will not change its decision. A responsible 
government claiming that it is stimulating employment should do 
its utmost to revive the plant.
<P>
	On April 16, I asked the Minister of Industry whether 
discussions had been initiated with his Quebec counterpart or any 
potential buyer who could take over this idle plant and get it 
running again. I was told that the  question would be taken under 
advisement. Can you imagine that. Not a very impressive answer.
<P>
	They claim they can run a country, and their stated objective was 
job creation. Remember: ``Jobs, jobs, jobs''? What did they do? 
Just about nothing. Of course, my Ottawa office has not had an 
answer yet, even though the parliamentary secretary undertook to 
give me one. We did not get anything, but it is not the first time, we 
are used to it. Liberals talk a lot and make lots of promises but, 
unfortunately, they do not deliver much.
<P>
	Therefore, I put my question again to the Minister of Industry or 
his department. Do they have solutions to propose to the people of 
my riding and the neighbouring riding of Brome-Missisquoi, 
which is not appear anywhere, on this issue. Are there talks 
between the government in Ottawa and the one in Quebec City to 
look for potential buyers who could get this idle plant running 
again?
<P>
	People in my riding have the right to know what the federal 
government is doing for them and I expect an answer on their 
behalf.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Karen Kraft Sloan (Parliamentary Secretary to 
Minister of the Environment, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, I am 
pleased the hon. member for Shefford has given me the opportunity 
to speak to the development of the Hyundai plant in Bromont, 
Quebec.
<P>
	As the Minister of Industry noted in the House previously, 
Hyundai informed the government of its intention to remove its 
equipment from the Bromont plant since its efforts to reopen the 
plant with partners or to attract investors had been fruitless.
<P>
	Having reimbursed all sums owed to both governments, Hyundai 
has no other formal obligations. The arrangement agreed to by 
Industry Canada, the Quebec industry department and Hyundai was 
that Hyundai would pay back the entire amount of the contributions 
it received, $46.4 million, under the Canada-Quebec industrial 
development agreement if it ceased production and was unable to 
introduce a new product or find an interested buyer for its Bromont 
plant.
<P>
	As neither of these conditions could be met, Hyundai has now 
returned the entire amount which will be used jointly by the federal 
and provincial governments under the entente to fund other 
worthwhile projects that will contribute to economic development 
in Quebec.
<P>
	The federal government continues to search for opportunities to 
create jobs and growth. Industry Canada now has a dedicated 
investment unit, which is a joint initiative with the Department of 
Foreign Affairs and International Trade, working on an 
international marketing campaign to increase international 
awareness of Canada's advantages as a location for investment.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="10138"> 10138 </A></B>
<P>
	Investment Partnerships Canada builds new federal, provincial, 
municipal and government-private sector partnerships to attract 
investment.
<P>
	I am confident of the work of Industry Canada. It will respond to 
any investor interest in the Bromont plant.
<P>

	<B>Mr. Glen McKinnon (Brandon-Souris, Lib.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I am here tonight to address once again what continues to 
be a worsening condition in my home province. The flood waters of 
the Red River are still on the rise. Yesterday Premier Filmon 
declared a provincial state of emergency.
<P>
	Our minister responsible for Emergency Planning Canada, the 
Minister of National Defence, was in southern Manitoba recently 
and attempted to meet with Mr. Filmon and to inspect the situation.
<P>
<B>(1740)</B>
<P>
	During yesterday's question period I had the opportunity to 
discuss the situation with the hon. minister. Given the time 
constraints, the minister was unable to address the specific 
measures the Government of Canada has taken and is willing to 
undertake in the future. Tonight I greatly appreciate the opportunity 
to further discuss the matter.
<P>
	I will put the present situation into a historical context. This is 
certainly not the first national disaster although it may be the worst 
flood the province has seen in 100 years. The memories of past 
floods are etched into the minds of those who suffered through 
them. We refer specifically to 1950, 1966, 1979 and 1996. In each 
of those years neighbours and communities pulled together to help 
each other.
<P>
	The province of Manitoba did its share to co-ordinate emergency 
efforts. Along with the Government of Canada it was there to 
provide strategic support and in the end financial assistance to help 
recover some costs associated with the disaster.
<P>
	When the incident is over the financial aspect bears some 
scrutiny and discussion. Financial assistance has been given 
according to a disaster assistance formula put in place back in the 
seventies. Since 1970 the federal government has paid over $53 
billion to the province, a substantially higher amount in proportion 
to other provinces of similar size. This is due through no small part 
to the severe and devastating floods that have occurred on a fairly 
regular and repetitive basis.
<P>
	Under the DFAA arrangements the federal government is 
permitted to assist provinces when the cost of responding to major 
emergencies such as the one we are facing now puts undue strain on 
the provincial economy. When this happens financial assistance is 
requested by the province of the federal government. The amount 
of federal assistance is in accordance with a cost sharing formula 
based on the provincial population and  eligible provincial 
expenses as spelled out under DFAA guidelines.
<P>
	The province receives invoices from the municipality, 
catalogues them and forwards them to the federal government for 
its scrutiny. The province may however provide more generous 
assistance than what the guidelines designed between the province 
and the federal government actually state. As a senior minister 
from Manitoba stated earlier today in a media interview, it is up to 
the province to develop and deliver its own program of assistance 
to victims of a disaster according to the nature of the disaster and 
the needs of the people deeply affected.
<P>
	Recently the Government of Canada committed to compensate 
the amount of $1.25 million for funds for Manitoba in 1993 and 
1995 regardless of what the disaster assistance guidelines clearly 
state. It is a one-time payment which does not set a precedent. It is 
a generous way of showing that the Government of Canada is 
committed to compensating equally and fairly all Canadians who 
have endured a natural disaster. It displays the level of generosity 
the federal government needs to express to those areas hit.
<P>
	We would ask the minister's representative to kindly clarify 
what measures the Liberal government is taking to ensure that in 
the middle of such confusion Manitobans can be assured of equal 
and good treatment in the future.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Harvard (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Public Works and Government Services, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, 
I thank the hon. member for Brandon-Souris for his question. I 
understand his concern for our fellow Manitobans.
<P>
	By all measures the flood waters that now threaten Manitobans 
are cause for great concern. While we cannot fully overcome the 
full force of Mother Nature, the local municipalities, the 
Government of Manitoba and the Government of Canada will 
endeavour to do everything within their powers to minimize the 
personal, social and economic dislocation that so often follow 
natural disasters of this magnitude.
<P>
	Already the federal government, working with Manitoba's 
emergency measures organization, has in place a number of 
initiatives aimed at helping Manitobans prepare for the impending 
floods. As of today more than 300 Canadian forces members are 
actively participating in sandbagging operations in southern 
Manitoba. An additional 1,400 CF members have been committed 
and are moving into the area. Many more CF members are on 
standby and ready to deploy at a moment's notice.
<P>
	A number of reservists from the Manitoba area are among those 
on standby, a wonderful example of how local support for the 
militia is often returned in kind to the community.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="10139"> 10139 </A></B>
<P>
	By Friday April 25, air command will have 10 helicopters in 
Winnipeg. Zodiac boats, heavy equipment and more personnel are 
being moved to the area as we speak. Resources such as these will 
prove to be vital in flood support operations such as evacuations 
and emergency situations.
<P>
	At the request of the Minister of Foreign Affairs and Manitoba's 
Liberal MPs, yesterday afternoon the Minister of National Defence 
toured by helicopter the area south of Winnipeg affected by 
flooding. The minister wanted to review the situation personally 
and ensure that all that can be done is being done to assist the 
Manitoba government and those people affected by this natural 
disaster.
<P>
	The Canadian forces however represent but one dimension of the 
federal government's response to this potential disaster.
<P>
	Human Resources Development Canada is arranging for 
expedited movement of pension and other such cheques.
<P>
	Indian and Northern Affairs Canada is in close communication 
with First Nations communities, including Dauphin River, that 
could be isolated by flood waters.
<P>
	The Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation has compiled an 
inventory of emergency housing if evacuees need to be relocated.
<P>
	Revenue Canada Customs has arranged to provide 24-hour 
service at other entry sites to expedite commercial truck traffic 
detoured from its usual port of entry.
<P>
	The Canadian Wheat Board has been moving grain out of 
threatened areas with the assistance of the railways.
<P>
	The Department of Fisheries and Oceans-Canadian Coast Guard 
in Manitoba has its fleet of small boats and equipment ready for use 
by municipalities if required. The coast guard has mobilized 
several large barges ready to transport livestock and other property 
if evacuation is necessary. Some cattle already have been 
evacuated in the St. Pierre-Joly area.
<P>
	The Prairie Farm Rehabilitation Administration has five fields 
ready for use as an emergency feedlot. Preparations are also being 
made to deal with an influx of animal carcasses in areas where 
evacuation of livestock may not have been completed.
<P>
	No one can fully mitigate the devastating effects caused by 
flooding. If our worst fears are met, challenging times surely will 
come in the wake of rising flood waters.
<P>
	While it is the human spirit which will ultimately ensure that the 
vitality of communities facing flood waters will remain intact, I 
can assure the citizens of Manitoba that the Government of Canada 
will do its part. Everyone from the Prime Minister on down is on 
alert  and everything possible will be done to help my fellow 
Manitobans.
<P>
	Finally, Manitoba is not facing its first nor likely its last natural 
disaster. The treatment of Manitobans by the Government of 
Canada however will be second to none.
<P>
