</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jeannot Castonguay (Madawaska—Restigouche, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
I would like to congratulate the Université de Moncton, which 
this past Monday inaugurated its master of forestry program at 
its Edmunston, New Brunswick, campus. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This long-awaited master's program will equip local young people, 
as well as students from elsewhere, to work in a field that is 
essential for the survival of our planet.  Forests are a 
resource that disappears if mismanaged, hence the importance of 
training in this field. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is more, this program represents a feather in the cap of 
the francophones of New Brunswick and of francophones throughout 
Canada. 
This young French language university, a mere 38 years old, and 
its 15 year old faculty of forestry have every reason to be 
proud of this accomplishment, and I congratulate them on it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To all those who had a hand in it, my congratulations, and to 
all the future graduates, my best wishes for success.

Mr. Speaker, House of Commons committees are already rolling and 
I would like to give one person's opinion of what committees are 
like: 
</I></B></P><P align=left>O give me some pity, I'm on a committee<BR> 
Which means that from morning to night<BR> 
We attend, and amend and contend and defend<BR> 
Without a conclusion in sight. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We confer and concur, we defer and demur<BR> 
And reiterate all of our thoughts<BR> 
We revise the agenda with frequent addenda<BR> 
And consider a load of reports. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We compose and propose, we suppose and oppose<BR> 
And the points of procedure are fun<BR> 
But though various notions are brought up as motions<BR> 
There's terribly little gets done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We resolve and absolve, but we never dissolve<BR> 
Since it's out of the question for us<BR> 
What a shattering pity to end our committee<BR> 
Where else could we make such a fuss?

<P><A NAME="LINK7"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Benoît Serré (Timiskaming—Cochrane, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I rise to pay tribute to a great Canadian scientist who 
was recently inducted into the Canadian Mining Hall of Fame. The 
late Dr. James Merritt Harrison was the former director of the 
Geological Survey of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During his 17 year tenure, this organization enjoyed one of the 
most successful periods of its venerable history.  Indeed, during 
this time many government programs were developed that helped 
make Canada a world leader in mineral exploration and resource 
development.  Later, as a senior officer with Natural Resources 
Canada, Dr. Harrison became a respected spokesman on mineral 
industry issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Dr. Harrison greatly deserves this prestigious honour and he 
deserves public recognition for his accomplishments in the mining 
industry.

<P><A NAME="LINK9"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Irwin Cotler (Mount Royal, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, if 
human security is an organizing principle of Canadian foreign 
policy, then it is human insecurity which is the most serious 
dimension of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict today including the 
fear and fact of terrorism and violence, the demonizing of the 
other, and the harm to children caught in vortex of conflict. 
Each side sees itself as victim and the other as victimizer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Accordingly what is required now is a parallel set of confidence 
building measures by each party for the Israelis to lift the 
closure, permit normalization of life and adhere to the 
strictures of the Oslo accord and the Sharm El Sheikh agreements; 
for the Palestinian authority to cease acts of incitement and 
violence, combat the terrorist infrastructure, and similarly 
adhere to the Oslo and Sharm El Sheikh agreements. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In a word, if there is one thing that both Israelis and 
Palestinians require today, and to which Canada can contribute, 
it is the restoration of a sense of human security as a prelude, 
if not condition, to a negotiated peace.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Joe McGuire (Egmont, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I send my 
sincere congratulations to one of my constituents, Shirley Buote. 
Shirley returned to Prince Edward Island on Monday night after an 
excellent performance at the International Special Olympic Winter 
Games in Anchorage, Alaska. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On Friday, Shirley put her best foot forward and secured a 
bronze medal in the 200 metre snowshoe competition with a time of 
1:24:67.  This is a sport, I may add, that I share her enjoyment 
of.  Shirley then joined three other Canadians to win a silver 
medal in the 4x100 metre relay event with a time of 1:55:11. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Shirley was the lone Islander competing for Canada at the winter 
games and she has made all Islanders proud.  I congratulate 
Shirley on a job well done.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Roy Bailey (Souris—Moose Mountain, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, today thousands of desperate farmers 
are demonstrating across Canada.  They are praying that the 
public will understand that the government's recent aid 
announcement fails to provide even short term relief. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadian farmers receive a mere 7% of their income in government 
subsidies.  Europe subsidizes its farmers by 65% and the U.S. 
subsidizes 34% of its grain farmers' income.  Many farms in 
Canada are subsidized only when both husband and wife leave the 
farm to provide their own income. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here are some basic questions facing Canadians.  First, do we 
want safe food?  Second, do we want an agriculture industry? 
Third, do we want a dependable supply of food? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians and their government are in danger of losing what we 
now enjoy with a safe, dependable and cheap supply of food.  We 
must address short term solutions before we can deal with any 
long term strategy.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mark Eyking (Sydney—Victoria, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it 
gives me great pleasure today to congratulate two fine ladies 
from Millville, Cape Breton.  Sister Mary MacIntosh and Annie 
MacAulay are turning 100 years of age this month.  As young 
girls, they both went to a one room schoolhouse in Millville. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Sister Mary MacIntosh became a Sister of Charity and worked in 
various convents and hospitals.  She enjoys doing counted cross 
stitch and always has one or two crochet projects in progress. 
Affectionately known as Sister Henry, she is still an active 
member of our community. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Annie MacAulay went on to become a teacher.  She married Dan 
Allen MacAulay.  They raised four children and have 16 
grandchildren and 24 great-grandchildren. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>She has a beautiful property on the Mill Pond Road overlooking

March 7, I sent a letter to all the members of this House on the 
need to develop a virtual parliament.  Subsequently, at the 
interparliamentary forum of the Americas, which was held here in 
Ottawa last week, we passed the following proposal:

</I></B></P><P align=left>Recognizing that co-operation among parliaments is essential and 
that globalization brings about issues that require debate and 
actions that go beyond national frontiers; 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Recognizing that we must participate in an active manner in 
those debates and that we must increase exchange and dialogue 
among parliament members from other countries, from the 
hemisphere and the world; 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Recognizing that a new formula, apart from occasional summits 
and gatherings, must be developed to increase the productivity 
of our work, in order to allow parliament members to exchange on 
a more regular basis; 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We, parliamentarians from the Americas, will acquire the proper 
and available telecommunications instruments that will allow us 
to hold virtual assemblies or committees between 
parliamentarians from the Americas.

calls by the reform alliance members for increased income support 
for our farmers borders on hypocrisy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is the party that wants to wipe out agricultural support 
programs.  Its policy book, passed at its convention just last 
year, says that the Alliance wants to force our farmers to be 
“self-reliant”.  It states that the Alliance members “support 
the phased reduction and elimination of all subsidies, support 
programs and trade restrictions”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is not a new stand for that party.  The policy book passed 
at the Reform Party's founding convention said “We advocate the 
removal of agricultural subsidies at home and abroad”.  Later, 
the party told us that “The Reform Party supports a shift from a 
government dominated and supported agricultural industry to an 
industry shaped by market forces”.

our government was failing to fully protect the Canadian 
livestock industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It would only take one person transferring the virus on their

prevent transmission of foot and mouth disease into Canada before

demonstration in Ottawa.  There were also thousands of farmers 
demonstrating in Regina, Saskatoon, Winnipeg, Swift Current, the 
Toronto area and right across the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They are doing so because farmers are in the biggest crisis they 
have seen since the 1930s and many are going bankrupt and being 
forced to leave the land.  In the prairies alone, between the 
fall of 1999 and the fall of 2000, 22,500 farmers left the land. 
It is hard to believe that so many have left the land.  The 
reason is that our federal government has not been supporting our 
farmers like governments have in other parts of the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Europe grain farmers get about 56 cents on the dollar from 
the European Community.  In the United States they get about 38 
cents on the dollar.  In this country it is only 11 cents on the 
dollar.

million dollars is not enough.  It has to be doubled to around $1 
billion in the short term, and in the long term we need a long

the commercial fisheries in the Great Lakes.  It appears that a 
small yet vitally important crustacean is disappearing from the 
lakes at an alarming rate.  This shrimp-like bottom feeder called 
the diporeia is the primary food source for numerous young fish 
species.  At this point the creature has not been seen in Lake

four lakes.

root problem of this situation is a biological foreign invader. I 
regret that control of a problem is needed because efforts to

Canadian Foundation for Innovation, nearly $50 million of new 
subsidies for the gun registry and a farm aid program that is so

bankruptcy.  No Prime Minister in 50 years has treated 
agriculture with more contempt or less priority than the Prime

there a deportation hearing?  Maybe she could clarify that.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us talk about those statistics from when the government 
first heard about the crisis.  In 1998 we put it forward in the

for farmers, and that was all they needed.

it was not too long ago that they changed their minds.  In the

would remove subsidies.  Finally they have seen the light.  I am 
sure Canadian farmers are pleased. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When they said there should be no support for farmers, we 
increased the support from $600 million a year to $1.1 billion a

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Howard Hilstrom (Selkirk—Interlake, Canadian

down to around $650 million when it should have been up to about 
$1.5 billion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The gap between Canada and the United States is big and the

year, the department of agriculture's budget has been reduced by 
$470 million from last year.  Two days after these numbers were 
released, the minister of agriculture announced $500 million in 
conditional disaster relief. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unless we use the Liberal new math, the additional money was 
only $30 million.  When I count on my fingers and toes what I get 
is that it is only 6% of the money the minister claims to be 
giving.  Does the minister of agriculture think that Canadian 
farmers cannot add?

support for the AIDA program for one year is there.  The 
liability was created for CFIP for the next year, and it was 
booked in the same year.  That shows there are two items booked 
in one year and not in the next year.  There is no change as far 
as the support at that time in agriculture.  Since then we have

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Miss Deborah Grey (Edmonton North, Canadian Alliance):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, there are some inconsistencies going on here.  The 
minister just replied to this question by saying that her 
department was informed at the end of January.  A couple of 
questions ago she announced that she was personally informed 
about the end of February. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are all kinds of dates and times going on here.  The 
Minister of Justice said that when it was appropriate and 
everything was positively identified the department of 
immigration was notified.  The problem is that since April 1999 
when the RCMP took photos of Mr. Amodeo the Italian authorities 
confirmed that.  It seems that everyone knew that but her. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why did she allow this person to stay in Canada and risk— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  The hon. the Minister of Citizenship and 
Immigration. 
<P><A NAME="LINK97"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Elinor Caplan (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration, 
Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I completely reject the premise of the 
member's question.  I will once again repeat for her that my 
department was notified by the RCMP that it had sufficient 
evidence so that we could proceed with deportation at the end of 
January. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was personally informed and briefed mid-February.  At that 
time the individual had been arrested.  He is in jail and he is 
awaiting a deportation hearing. 
<P><A NAME="LINK98"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Miss Deborah Grey (Edmonton North, Canadian Alliance):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, now it has gone from the end of January, to the end 
of February, to the middle of February.  The problem is that 
Amodeo and his wife ran a business in Canada.  They were very 
visible in Montreal since 1996.  They owned a home.  If Amodeo 
was hiding out it was in plain sight, yet the minister comes up 
with all kinds of fictional dates.  We need to get to the bottom 
of it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When did her department know—the Minister of Justice or the 
Solicitor General of Canada—that they were harbouring a criminal 
in Canada and why did they wait two full years until he was 
arrested? 
<P><A NAME="LINK99"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Elinor Caplan (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration, 
Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I have been very forthcoming.  I will 
repeat again for the House that at the end of January my 
department received information and evidence from the RCMP 
sufficient that it went out and arrested the individual.  He is 
in jail and awaiting a deportation hearing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was personally briefed about three weeks later, the middle to 
the end of February.  At that time he was in custody, awaiting a 
deportation hearing.  Those are the facts.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Vic Toews (Provencher, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I rise on a question of privilege in regard to the 
Department of Justice briefing the media on a bill intended for 
the House before and at the exclusion of members of parliament 
and their staff. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My question of privilege will argue that the Minister of Justice 
and her department are in contempt of parliament since they have 
brought the authority and dignity of the House into question. The 
government and her department made a mockery of the parliamentary 
system and members of parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Erskine May describes contempt as: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—any act or omission which obstructs or impedes either House of 
Parliament in the performance of its functions, or which 
obstructs or impedes any Member or officer of such House in the 
discharge of his duty, or which has a tendency, directly or 
indirectly, to produce such results may be treated as a contempt 
even though there is no precedent of the offence. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to tell the House what has happened.  The Liberal 
government and the Minister of Justice gave a briefing on an 
omnibus bill today at 11.45 am.  It is the bill that the Minister 
of Justice just introduced to the House.  I am bringing this 
motion at the quickest and most appropriate time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I received a copy of the bill when I came into question period 
today.  It is a bill that is 78 pages long.  The Liberal 
government gave a briefing and denied members of parliament and 
their staff access to the briefing.  The only ones allowed into 
the briefing session were members of the media. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is not simply a small bill.  It contains 78 pages. I had an 
opportunity to quickly glance through it when I came into the 
House.  I could not even tell members of the media who were 
calling my office what my reaction was to the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The issue is not the embarrassment it has caused to me or the 
members of the opposition, it is the embarrassment it has caused 
the House.  It is an embarrassment for the people of Canada who 
voted to send members to the House of Commons so they could be 
consulted and have an input.  We have been denied even a most 
basic briefing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>According to the minister it is not the opposition she has to 
convince, it is the media.  She gives the media the appropriate 
spin and we are left in the dark.  We have been embarrassed and 
the House has been embarrassed.  I am angered and disgusted by 
this process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am a novice in the House of parliament but I have also served 
in legislatures.  I was also a crown counsel for the Manitoba 
government for years.  I advised governments on matters.  I 
advised the premier of Manitoba in 1990 on the Meech Lake accord. 
I am not a novice when it comes to dealing with government 
matters and government issues and the basic respect that each 
member here deserves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We were shut out of a briefing and treated like beggars at the 
door waiting for leftovers.  We did not even get a news release. 
I do not know if members of the press got a news release.  I 
received 78 pages of a bill that is not just on one matter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the Liberal members across the way just asked me if I 
could read.  Let me say what the bill includes because it is 
important to all members of the House.  It says “secret until 
introduced in parliament”.  That secrecy seems to only apply to 
the people here. 
We are the ones who are being shrouded from the truth.  The 
secret is being kept from us.  The media were briefed and had 
full access to the bill.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Some may ask whether I can read.  Being a lawyer and having 
served government I should be able to easily and quickly read 78 
pages.  With all due respect, let me tell you, Mr. Speaker, 
members of the House and the people of Canada what the bill 
includes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>“This enactment amends the Criminal Code”.  This is the 
summary of what is printed in the bill so I assume it is the 
truth.  I do not know if it is the truth because I have not had a 
chance to read it.  However, let us assume it is the truth based 
on what the minister has put in the bill and what she has shared 
with the media but not with members of the House because it is a 
big secret from us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will begin again.  The summary states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The enactment amends the Criminal Code by 
(a) adding offences and other measures that provide additional 
protection to children from sexual exploitation, including sexual 
exploitation involving the use of the Internet; 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a huge issue.   However, before I attended the House, 
members of the press were asking me what I had to say about the 
issue.  I had nothing to say because it was a secret.  It was 
kept secret from everybody in the House.  All of Canada knows, 
the moment it is introduced the Liberal's spin on the document is 
already out on the airwaves through the media.  This is 
disgusting.  It is an absolute subordination of the powers of 
each member, as well as your powers, Mr. Speaker, and those of 
the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It does not end there.  The minister will say that we have been 
talking about this for a long time and that it was high time the 
legislation was introduced.  Absolutely, it is high time that it 
is introduced, but that is one issue.  The next issue is 
increasing the maximum penalty for criminal harassment.  If that 
is in fact what it says, I applaud that.  The Manitoba 
government, when I was a member, worked very hard to convince the 
Liberal government to take steps in that respect. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now we find out about it in a secret document that we cannot 
release until it is introduced in parliament.  Who knew about it 
before I did, before you did, Mr. Speaker, and before every 
member of the House?  It was the media, the new opposition.  The 
government does not care about the elected voices of people.  It 
has insulted every single member in the House, including 
government members on the opposite side.  We have all been 
insulted by this piece of trickery. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will continue on with what the bill contains.  It says: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>(c) Making home invasions in aggravating circumstances for 
sentencing purposes; 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yes, we did ask for this but can we not discuss it beforehand? 
Could we at least get a briefing two hours before?  Could we have 
the decency and the courtesy that was extended to members of the 
media but not to us? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  Order, please.  The hon. member has a point 
but I think going through every clause of the bill and telling us 
that the message is the same is perhaps unnecessary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member has a point and he has made his point.  If he has 
more to contribute on the question of privilege, I would like to 
hear him, but I would rather not hear about the contents of the 
bill, which, with great respect—and I think the hon. member 
would agree with me on this point—are irrelevant to whether or 
not the privileges of the House have been breached. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If I understood the member correctly, his point was whether the 
bill was released before its introduction in the House.  If he 
would stick to that point, I think it would be more helpful to 
the Chair. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Vic Toews:</B>  I appreciate the direction, Mr. Speaker, 
but I thought it was important not to quote the clauses of the 
bill but to give a brief summary of the bill. 
I was not quoting clause by clause.  I was trying to impress upon 
you, Mr. Speaker, that this is not a small bill, that this is not 
a housekeeping bill, that this is a substantive bill to which we, 
as members of parliament, were denied access.  We did not even 
have two hours.  We were not shown the courtesy that was given to 
the media.

</I></B></P><P align=left>However, Mr. Speaker, I appreciate your direction and I will 
move on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the last parliament, Speaker Parent issued a warning to this 
very same government for a similar offence.  The Minister of 
Justice was a member of the government and, despite the clear 
admonition from the Speaker, the same trick is being played again 
on members of the House.  On November 6, 1997, the Speaker said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Chair acknowledges that this matter is a matter of potential 
importance since it touches the role of members as legislators, a 
role which should not be trivialized. It is from this perspective 
that the actions of the Department are of some concern. The 
dismissive view of the legislative process, repeated often 
enough, makes a mockery of our parliamentary conventions and 
practices. I trust that today's decision at this early stage of 
the 36th Parliament will not be forgotten by the minister and his 
officials and that the department and agencies will be guided by 
it. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Despite the warning, the government went on to announce to the 
people of China that a Canada-China interparliamentary group had 
been created.  There was no such group created at the time.  The 
government briefed a foreign country before it briefed its own 
members. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The naming of the head of the Canadian millennium scholarship 
foundation before there was legislation setting up the foundation 
is another example.  There were many other cases in the last 
parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the House is to function with authority and dignity then it 
must be respected, especially by the executive.  Every elected 
member is not the servant of the executive.  The executive is the 
servant of each and every elected member.  When a member of the 
executive thwarts the parliamentary process they deny the rights 
and privileges of each member and destroy the authority of the 
House.  If the House is to function with authority and dignity 
then it must be respected, especially by the executive.  They are 
responsible to parliament, not to the media. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On page 63 of Erskine May it states that ministers have a duty 
to parliament to account, that ministers should be as open as 
possible with parliament.  Refusing to provide information and 
refusing to allow us to participate in the briefing when members 
of the media are present is not in the public interest.  The 
government has been warned enough.  It is time the House took 
action and protected itself from this happening again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, when you were elected these were the issues that 
were being discussed.  Members from both sides of the House voted 
for you.  There was a real recognition that the executive needed 
to understand that each and every backbencher and opposition 
member deserved respect.  Mr. Speaker, you were entrusted with 
our belief that you would carry out that obligation and restore 
the dignity that the House deserves.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The executive has not only slapped us in the face, but it has 
slapped you, Mr. Speaker, and the people of Canada in the face. I 
know that other members wish to speak on the matter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would ask you, Mr. Speaker, to rule the matter to be a prima 
facie question of privilege, at which time I would be prepared to 
move the appropriate motion. 
<P><A NAME="LINK139"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Don Boudria (Leader of the Government in the House of 
Commons, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, exaggerating points seldom make 
the argument any better.  What we have before us is, in large 
measure, two bills of the last session which have been made 
omnibus and tabled in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member went into a long diatribe that I listened to 
patiently even though there was plenty of reason to be impatient 
given the nonsense that we were hearing.  I wish the hon. member 
would take the time to listen to what I have to say, but 
obviously he does not intend to do so at this point. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill as presented today in the House is almost the same as 
two bills from the previous parliament.  Reciting the titles of 
every clause will not change anything. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Oh, oh. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  Order, please.  The House is entitled to 
hear the arguments on all sides.  I realize there is disagreement 
on the issue but the Chair would like to hear the different 
points of view. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important for all points of view to be heard on such a 
matter, and the Leader of the Government in the House of Commons 
has the floor. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Don Boudria:</B>  I think we heard the deputy House 
leader of the party across saying that the opposition has the 
right to speak but that the other side of the House has less 
rights.  I think we just heard the official position of that 
particular party in that regard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us correct the inaccuracies made in the House earlier. 
First, as far as I know and the Minister of Justice knows at this 
point, the media did not receive a copy of the bill prior to 
introduction.  The only people who received a copy of the bill 
before the introduction were opposition critics.  They received a 
copy an hour and fifteen minutes ahead of time for courtesy 
reasons.  The bill, as I said, was not released to anyone. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Chair will know that embargo briefings are not something 
that were recently invented.  Embargo briefings, without 
documents, have been held in the past on a number of issues.  It 
is true that an embargo briefing was provided to the media 
earlier today.  The information given to me was that no release 
of any document or any bill was given to anyone else.  Any 
briefing given to the media was under embargo.  No documents were 
given. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I said previously, the opposition critics were provided a 
copy of the bill one hour and fifteen minutes ahead of the 
introduction. Even though the rules of the House, and the Speaker 
knows them far better than I, do not require that such is done 
but it was done any way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not believe there was any attempt to breach anything.  If 
anyone has breached the embargo, I am willing to look into that. 
If that means that in the future when people do breach embargoes 
that it should be recognized in the way things are done around 
here, then we would be willing to look at that as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, that is not the same as to say that the Minister of 
Justice has committed an act of contempt or any other such issue 
against the House, nor does it mean that the hon. member across 
has a prima facie case of privilege against the House.  That is a 
different proposition altogether. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK140"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier—Montcalm, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to be able to speak on this matter, since this is not 
the first time the same thing has happened in the Justice 
Department. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister need not wonder why sometimes bills get off on the 
wrong foot.  That is the way things are done, even by the 
Minister of Justice. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1530"></A>

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>How do they justify, even if it was only a briefing, even if the 
government did not hand out the entire text to the 
journalists—which I doubt, and we will look into this—how is it 
that the journalists knew all the ins and outs of this bill 
before the parliamentarians, before those who are elected to 
represent the public? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Knowing the officials of the Department of Justice as I do, in 
the case of the Young Offenders Act, I question the accuracy of 
the information.  What the minister did today is very serious, 
and what she did in the past with other extremely important 
bills is also. 
It is not even a matter of finding out whether the bill is 
complex or not, because we can all read. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Justice was very kind.  She gave me the bill as 
she came into the House at 2.00 p.m. for Oral Question Period. 
It was as if I, a member of the opposition, did not have Oral 
Question Period, as if it was not important for me to follow 
what went on in it and I had to read between 79 and 85 pages of 
the minister's text to keep up with the journalists at 3.00 p.m. 
That makes no sense.  It is treating the opposition members, in 
fact all members with disdain. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B> And the House as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur:</B> And, as my colleague has said, treating 
the House with disdain as well. 
Mr. Speaker, you should intervene to put an end to the way the 
Department of Justice is operating. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a small example in the case of the Young Offenders Act 
worth recalling, where everything went off the rails following a 
briefing of journalists.  The officials had failed to give out 
the entire text of the Young Offenders Act.  The government 
talked about flexibility, when in fact there was none.  On that 
occasion, when the officials did not give journalists a copy of 
the text, how could the journalists leave with all the 
information?  They left with the information the Department of 
Justice wanted them to have. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As things stand, as a member of the opposition and critic for 
justice issues, I cannot even properly inform these journalists 
because the government did not give me the documents on time. 
What was so urgent? Perhaps there is an urgent matter. Why was 
the Minister of Justice in such a hurry to introduce this bill 
today, before members of parliament had a chance to look at it? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are well aware, and the Chair even more so, that there are 
days during the week when bills can be introduced, when the 
minister could introduce her bill, in the morning, around 10 
a.m., as she did today. She could also have met the media in the 
morning, at 11 a.m., like she did this morning. But why did she 
act differently? Perhaps it was to engage in politics, to catch 
the opposition with its pants down, or whatever. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps it was to not give the media the appropriate information 
at the appropriate time, so as to throw them off track. 
The minister need not wonder why her department is having 
problems. It is simply because her department's way of operating 
is not right and shows contempt for members of parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, in order to prevent another such mess, I am asking 
you very sincerely—because I know that you have great qualities 
and broad experience as a parliamentarian—to not let this 
practice go on at the Department of Justice or at any other 
department. You must take action because you care a lot about 
the work of the members of this House and you want to ensure 
that they have the necessary tools to carry out their duties as 
parliamentarians, properly and in a timely fashion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, I am asking you very sincerely to take action so 
that the Minister of Justice stops showing contempt for members 
and the House, as she has been doing since assuming her 
responsibilities. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK141"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg—Transcona, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
unfortunately this is the second day in a row on which we have 
had to rise on points of order or privilege having to do with 
ministers doing things outside the House that either should be 
done in here or should be done first in here. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1535"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT19"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I appeal to your sense of history, Mr. Speaker, and your place 
in it.  When the history of parliament is written, and when the 
history of this parliament is incorporated into that longer 
history of parliament, will this be the parliament in which the 
long, slow but steady decline of parliament is arrested?  Or, 
will it be just one more parliament in which there is a long, 
slow and steady decline of parliament into a more and more 
irrelevant chamber?  Will more and more things continue to happen 
outside parliament, either in the press gallery or in briefings 
that could not be attended by members of parliament or whatever 
the case may be? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government House leader did his best in a bad situation. 
Knowing what I think I know about him, I cannot believe he thinks 
this was the appropriate way to proceed.  It is his job to defend 
the indefensible on occasion, and I suppose he did the best with 
what he had at his disposal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Whether or not the bill represents an amalgamation of two bills 
that existed in the last parliament, even if they are identical 
the fact is that the media would come to know they were identical 
before we came to know they were identical.  They are not 
identical anyway because some new things have been added. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was a pretty pathetic defence of what went on.  The Minister 
of Justice indeed showed contempt for members by giving any kind 
of briefing.  It does not matter that it was an embargo briefing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us put on our imagination cap.  Let us imagine a political 
culture in which the House of Commons is the centre of the 
political life of a nation and a new piece of legislation in the 
justice area is coming forward.  Perhaps it is even an 
amalgamation of bills that died in the previous parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What would happen in that imaginary world?  The Minister of 
Justice would come into the House of Commons and table the bill. 
Members of parliament would be given a copy.  Perhaps the critics 
might be given a courtesy copy earlier, but that would not matter 
so much if parliament were getting the copy first. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The media might then have to actually listen to the debate in 
parliament about the bill.  What a novel idea.  They might have 
to say that if they are to find out what people think about the 
bill they will have to come into the House of Commons and listen 
to members of parliament.  God forbid they would not be spoon fed 
at secretive briefings by spin doctors in the minister's 
department.  Let us imagine the wonderful fantasy I have just 
laid out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At one time that was probably real life around here.  Now it is 
just a fading dream, a dream that gets more distant and more 
unreal from parliament to parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I appeal to you, Mr. Speaker.  Only you, by using the powers 
vested in you in the chair in terms of moral suasion, procedural 
decisions and procedural rulings, can stop this slide into total 
irrelevancy if you choose.  It is on occasions such as this one, 
by virtue of what you say, that you can either contribute to that 
or not.  I urge you to stop the slide. 
<P><A NAME="LINK142"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough, PC):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I would like to add my voice and my dismay to what 
has occurred here as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member for Provencher has outlined quite clearly what 
has happened but I would add something.  I believe it goes back 
even further than this morning's briefings.  I left the House of 
Commons yesterday after question period and was asked very 
specific questions about this omnibus legislation by a CBC 
reporter from Radio-Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This highlights again the absolute contempt and disregard the 
government has for this place as being the forum, the speaking 
point and the stepping off point from which legislation is 
announced.  Major announcements should be made in this chamber. 
As the hon. member for Winnipeg—Transcona has clearly set out, 
that should not be so unattainable.  That should not be so beyond 
the realm of possibility.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Opposition members in this parliament, the last parliament and 
the previous parliament have become all too familiar with 
receiving the back of the cabinet's hand, particularly from the 
Department of Justice which has an army of administrators and 
obviously some very effective spin doctors who like to float 
these ideas out to gauge public opinion.  We know that is in 
keeping with the Liberal way, to govern by polls and make sure 
everything is okay before they step in any direction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This takes it to another level.  It takes it to the direct 
contempt the government has for opposition members to be involved 
in the process at all.  By engaging with the media first it is 
able to have the clear advantage of getting its message out 
first.  By not informing members at all until 24 hours later, 
even 5 or 6 hours later, it obviously has the upper hand. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government knows and is familiar with the information in any 
event.  It does not need this advantage.  To refer to the 
comments of the House leader for the New Democratic Party, if the 
announcements are made in the House the media will come. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, you have been around long enough to know that the 
media will come.  They will report on what takes place here.  The 
Department of Justice does not have to go to them.  It does not 
need to seek out the media to ensure its message is heard.  It 
has ample opportunity to do so in the foyer.  It can go to the 
press gallery after it has shown the proper respect for members 
of the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister shrugs her shoulders and says that they tried, that 
they did their best.  That is not good enough. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know you are most familiar and most attached to the Marleau 
and Montpetit publication, Mr. Speaker.  With reference to 
breaches of privilege, I refer the Chair to page 67 where it 
talks about the range of contempt that can exist.  It states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Just as it is not possible to categorize or to delineate what may 
fall under the definition of contempt, it is not even possible to 
categorize the “severity” of contempt.  Contempts may vary 
greatly in their gravity; matters ranging from minor breaches of 
decorum to grave attacks against the authority of Parliament may 
be considered as contempts. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is footnoted at 91 on page 67.  On the previous page again 
it refers to the types of contempt and the privileges of the 
Chamber.  Mr. Speaker, you have been a long serving member of the 
House.  You know that members want to engage directly with 
ministers.  They want to have an opportunity to partake in what 
is their duty, what they have been sent here to do.  That is on 
occasion to criticize the government.  That is on occasion to 
improve legislation.  That is also on occasion, a perhaps more 
modern responsibility, to engage with the media on the message, 
on the legislation or on the issue of the day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With what has happened here, members have been denied that 
right.  Members have been denied the ability to speak directly to 
information.  I was asked specifics about a bill that I had not 
seen.  Clearly that reporter had received some specifics. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It does not take Sherlock Holmes and a fleet of detectives to 
figure out that the information came from one source, the 
Department of Justice.  That is wrong.  It is absolutely 
inexcusable that information is leaked out of the department and 
given to reporters who can then assail members of the opposition 
as they leave the Chamber and ask them to comment on something 
they have not seen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister must take responsibility for this.  It goes to the 
broader issue of the absolute melting away of ministerial 
responsibility that we have seen in the government's 
administration.  Heaven forbid that a minister would stand to 
apologize to all members for what happened in the department, to 
agree to find out what happened, or to give assurances that it 
will not happen again and to try harder.  It has never happened. 
The government refuses to take responsibility. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  I know the hon. member for 
Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough was trying to be helpful to the 
Chair but there are a lot of hon. members who could go on at 
length on the subject he has raised. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to deal with the question of privilege that has 
been raised and that is this bill.  If we stick to that, I think 
I am getting to the point where I will have heard the points to 
be made on this and would like to get on.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I will take that advice to 
heart and try to stay more directly on the point.  To that point, 
Mr. Speaker, you would be very aware of the range of actions, the 
way in which you can respond, that is available to the Chair. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I again refer to Montpetit and Marleau at page 69 where it 
states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reluctance to invoke the House's authority to reprimand, 
admonish or imprison anyone found to have trampled its dignity or 
authority and that of its Members appears to have become a near 
constant feature of the Canadian approach to privilege. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This goes to another point.  There has to be a line drawn in the 
sand.  There obviously has to be another message sent.  There has 
to be another shot across the bow of the government, similar to 
what happened in the last parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is the second occasion in two days.  In fact, there were 
two occasions yesterday, not one, where the government chose to 
make announcements outside the House and then come in and parrot 
those same remarks, which shows nothing but contempt for the 
members present.  We know that this is a partisan administration, 
but this has to be the Chamber where this information is 
exchanged, first and foremost. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In your authority and your wisdom, Mr. Speaker, I would ask you 
to look at this serious breach of privilege and to act, to at the 
very least respond to the government, to take it under 
advisement, to look at precedent, because this slippery slope we 
are on is clearly adding to the impression of the Canadian 
population that this Chamber is becoming irrelevant. That should 
be cause for all members to sit up and take notice. If this 
Chamber is further diminished in its usefulness, we are all in 
serious trouble. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask you, Mr. Speaker, to take the hon. member for Provencher's 
question of privilege very seriously.  I know that you will.  I 
know you have great respect for this Chamber and for the 
privileges of members present.  You, Mr. Speaker, are the 
protector of all members.  I would suggest that quite clearly 
some members, mainly members of the opposition and possibly 
members of the backbench of the Liberal government, have been 
completely denied their rights and privileges by virtue of what 
has occurred out of the Department of Justice.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Garry Breitkreuz (Yorkton—Melville, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the process involved in tabling this 
omnibus bill on justice strikes at the very heart of democracy in 
parliament, and the process that we have just seen is the very 
heart of the problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A notice went out stating that there was going to be a briefing 
session at 11.45 a.m. today, and it was to be held on the omnibus 
bill that was to be tabled by the justice minister.  We know that 
the government has made it a practice to leak information but 
this is a blatant contempt of parliament, Mr. Speaker.  The 
notice went out, and it did not say media only.  There was not 
even any mention of them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The problem I have is that my staff member went to this briefing 
expecting to be told what was in the bill.  No briefing was given 
to us or even scheduled before the bill was tabled.  My executive 
assistant went to the briefing but he was not allowed in. 
However, a Liberal staff member was seen to enter.  A little 
while later a reporter asked me questions about the bill, so it 
was not a lockup. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am really shocked and dismayed by the contempt that the 
Minister of Justice holds for us as members of parliament.  I 
cannot do my job as an MP if the government withholds information 
from us and it is obvious that this is a deliberate attempt to 
withhold information from us.  The Liberals are deliberately 
undermining the opposition's ability to do its job of holding 
them accountable.  We know why the Liberals do this.  They want 
the media to give a favourable report on what they do.  They want 
to avoid criticism. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In regard to this lack of process that is directed at the 
opposition, I take this personally, Mr. Speaker, because contrary 
to what the House leader said, that these were just a couple of 
bills from last year, rumour has it that there were substantial 
amendments to the Firearms Act.  The government wants to draw 
attention away from that disaster.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The justice minister should be held in contempt of parliament. 
That is my main point.  Democracy cannot operate if there is not 
a free flow of information, and this issue strikes at the very 
heart of the way Canadians want this country to be governed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians want us to hold the government accountable.  I have 
had to submit over 70 access to information requests to this 
point already to find out what has been going on in the justice 
department and in the administration of that particular piece of 
legislation known as Bill C-68. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A key part of our role is to respond to legislation in the media 
in a timely fashion, to use the minister's own words.  A point of 
privilege was dismissed earlier this week because it was ruled 
that the government made announcements outside of parliament on 
major issues.  However, we could at least attend those.  Here we 
were restricted.  We were not allowed to go. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now the government has done something designed to deliberately 
undermine our ability to effectively criticize legislation.  It 
was deliberate, so that we were not able to respond in a timely 
fashion, and the news reports have already gone out on this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is no secret that the firearms legislation is a disaster. 
This omnibus bill contains amendments to— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  Order, please.  The hon. member has tried to 
be helpful and, I am sure, some of his comments have been very 
helpful to the chair, but getting mixed up with the firearms 
legislation and the value of that and so on is not really very 
helpful. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If he has another point to make in respect of this question of 
privilege, I will hear him, but I would prefer to bring this to a 
conclusion.  I think I have the point, and I am not hearing new 
facts.  The member gave me a few new ones earlier on in his 
remarks which I found very helpful.  If he has more of them I 
would like to hear them, but I do not need to hear about other 
bills. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Garry Breitkreuz:</B>  Mr. Speaker, my main point is that 
it strikes at the very heart of democracy:  the operation of 
parliament.  This was not a secret, as it was supposed to be 
until it was introduced into parliament.  The media was briefed, 
but we were not.  This is a prima facie question of privilege. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberal House leader made a couple of points.  I would like 
to counter them.  If this is simply about bills that were 
introduced previously, why did the media even need a briefing on 
this?  This is the House leader's own argument, really, so he is 
not being upfront.  It was not embargoed, because we were already 
being asked before the bill was introduced to comment on the 
bill.  It was not embargoed and all the arguments I heard from 
that side are not true. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I appeal to you, Mr. Speaker.  Canadians are so disillusioned 
with the process in this place and with democracy that if we do 
not do something to fix it right now, the perception will be that 
we are totally irrelevant and we might as well just shut this 
place down. 
<P><A NAME="LINK144"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I will be brief.  I just want to again point out to you 
the House leader's argument, which is that because parts of this 
bill were introduced in the last parliament, this parliament does 
not need to have the same kind of briefing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, members of our caucus were approached by the media as 
they came into the House of Commons and were asked to comment on 
that bill.  These are new members of parliament who never had the 
honour of serving in the last parliament.  How on earth could the 
government House leader use that argument? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, I just want to bring your attention to page 86 of 
Marleau and Montpetit.  Speaker Fraser ruled at an earlier time 
that: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The privileges of a Member are violated by any action which might 
impede him or her in the fulfilment of his or her duties and 
functions. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The privileges of a member are violated when any action impedes 
his or her ability to do the job.  On the next page, page 87, 
Speaker Jerome actually ruled that there is also a prima facie 
contempt of the House that exists when a government official, one 
that deliberately misleads a minister, has “impeded a Member in 
the performance of his duties and consequently obstructed the 
House itself”.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In other words it does not matter, I would argue, whether it was 
the officials giving the briefing who somehow fouled up something 
so that a briefing was given when it was not given to other 
members.  It does not matter whether it was the minister who 
fouled up and whether it was deliberate or not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What happened is that actions were taken today which impeded 
members of parliament from doing their jobs and by so doing, Mr. 
Speaker, I feel you must find that this is a prima facie case of 
contempt.  I urge you to ask the member to put the appropriate 
motion, which is to move this into committee where a full 
investigation can be made and it can come back to the House with 
the appropriate recommendations. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B> I thank the hon. member for Provencher for 
raising this question of privilege. I also thank all the other 
hon. members who took part in the discussion this 
afternoon—namely the hon. House leader of the official 
opposition, the hon. member for Berthier-Montcalm, the hon. 
member for Winnipeg—Transcona, the hon. member for 
Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough, the hon. government House leader

your comments.

back to the House.  If hon. members have any documents relating 
to this briefing that might be helpful to the Chair, I would 
appreciate receiving copies through the Clerk in order that I may 
look at them in respect of the matter.  I assure the House that I 
will come back to the House in due course with a ruling on this 
point.

say that it is intended as such to protect wildlife species in 
Canada from extirpation and extinction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Nine years ago in Rio, Canada signed the international 
convention on biological diversity.  The bill reflects Canada's 
commitment and takes into account reports that in Canada 364 
species are at risk of extinction and that habitat loss is the 
number one cause. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the bill becomes law it would make the scientific list of 
species at risk the legal list.  It would make it an offence to 
harm, disturb or kill endangered species or their habitat.  It 
would ensure that provinces implement equivalent legislation 
through the bill, thus providing mandatory habitat protection to 
all endangered species in Canada.

words about my private member's bill to establish a code of 
conduct for parliamentarians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It provides for an ethics counsellor who would report directly 
to parliament and would do so annually.  Such legislation exists 
in every province and territory in the country and in many other 
countries that have parliamentary systems similar to that of 
Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is clear that we need such conflict of interest legislation 
and such a code of conduct to prevent the further erosion of 
confidence in parliament as an institution and to restore 
confidence that parliamentarians will act not with conflict of 
interest but with the public interest at heart. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know I do not have time to outline it in detail, but the 
attempt to get such a code of conduct into parliament has had a 
long history, including a committee which our current Speaker 
co-chaired. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, my former colleague from Halifax West introduced 
a similar bill not once but twice in the previous session of

Gordon Earle in this matter, we might have been spared the

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Greg Thompson (New Brunswick Southwest, PC):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I rise on a point of order.  In relation to questions on 
the order paper I have a very legitimate complaint.  I have a 
number of questions on the order paper dating back to the last 
parliament.  In two months' time these questions will enjoy their 
first birthday in the House without a response from the 
government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Reading through Beauchesne's and Marleau and Montpetit, the 
questions were accepted by the Clerk of the House.  They were 
deemed to be in order but I have not had a response from the 
government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The urgency on this matter has to be made public.  Two questions 
in particular have to do with the selling of military equipment 
by the government through a third party.  The third party is 
called Lancaster Aviation.

we are questioning the government on the selling of 40 Bell

that these questions have not been answered for an extended

that regard, if he wishes to respond, and bring the matter to a

point of order.  I admit to being a little unclear personally as 
to the status of questions asked and unanswered in a previous 
parliament.  If it is the practice or convention or rule that 
questions asked in a prior parliament carry over to a subsequent 
parliament provided the member is re-elected, then I certainly 
would see to the obtaining of the answers the hon. member has 
sought and would do that forthwith. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Greg Thompson:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the questions have been 
put on the order paper in the 37th parliament.  The point I am 
making is that we have gone through two parliaments in almost a 
year, and we will be blowing out the candle on this one before 
the answer is received.  There is no excuse for the government 
not coming up with these answers.  It is a consistent pattern 
of— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  I thank the hon. member for the 
clarification for the benefit of the parliamentary secretary.  I 
am sure the matter will be looked into.  If we do not receive a 
satisfactory response, perhaps we will hear from the hon. member 
again tomorrow when the questions come up.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed from March 2 consideration of the motion that 
Bill C-13, an act to amend the Excise Tax Act, be read the second 
time and referred to a committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  When the House last had this matter under

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Greg Thompson (New Brunswick Southwest, PC):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, thank you for your generosity.  Those eight minutes will 
mean a lot to our party at this end of the Chamber. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we are talking about on Bill C-13 are technical changes to 
the GST.  The point I was making when we last debated this is the 
fact that our party will certainly support those technical 
changes to the GST. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is somewhat ironic that we are supporting a bill on the GST, 
which the government said it was going to eliminate when it took 
office in 1993.  I think it is important that the government 
address that very issue of the elimination of the GST and why it 
did not live up to that red book promise dating back to the 1993 
campaign. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As everyone well knows, just about every member on that side of 
the House—possibly yourself, Mr. Speaker, although I am sure you 
were probably more reserved in your comments on this than some of 
the members—went door to door talking about the elimination of 
this dreaded tax.  Now this dreaded tax which the government 
promised to eliminate is one of the taxes that is certainly 
filling its coffers and helping to balance the books.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the other points I made and that I think will be made 
later today by our party as the debate unfolds is the fact that 
there are other matters of urgency on the economic side which the 
government should be but is not addressing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Prime Minister and the finance minister are sort of 
whistling by the cemetery in their walk through la-la land. There 
are some troubling signs that the economy might be stalling, that 
it might be in trouble.  They are ignoring those signs and not 
even extending some sort of courtesy to the House in terms of at 
least introducing a budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The last time the House actually discussed a budget was with 
regard to the so-called mini budget on the eve of the last 
election.  Things have changed in the last 120 days.  I suggest 
that it was probably a strategic move on the part of the Prime 
Minister.  Knowing full well that there were some troubling signs 
on the horizon in terms of the economy, he made what would turn 
out to be the right decision, I guess, in the timing of the 
election. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again, a lot of things have changed in the last 120 days.  What 
we are saying is that the minister should introduce a budget to 
address some of the concerns we see and to possibly offer some 
suggestions to the government on how it can deal with the 
faltering economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The belief that we are going to be somehow insulated from what 
might happen in the United States is absurd when 80% to 85% of 
our exports go to the United States.  They are our biggest 
trading partner.  When they catch a cold we are most likely to 
catch pneumonia.  It is possible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The truth is, those are some of the considerations that should 
be taken in the House to address some fast changing circumstances 
on the economic front. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With that I will conclude my remarks.  As always, I look forward 
to questions and comments from my colleagues.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Referring to Clause 6, it states that the objectives of the bill 
are: first, to protect the health and well-being of the crews and 
passengers; second, to impose standards as to the proficiency of 
the crew; third, to protect the marine environment from damage 
due to navigation and shipping activities; fourth, to protect the 
vessels and the environment; fifth, to develop a regulatory 
scheme and consequently to design administrative sanctions for 
violators; sixth, to ensure that Canada can meet its 
international obligations under bilateral and multilateral 
agreements with respect to navigation and shipping. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before getting any further in the review and analysis of this 
bill, I would like to draw you attention to a clause that raises 
many issues and intrigues me a lot. 
I am talking about the definition of the word “passenger”, in 
fact, about what comes after that definition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Clause 2 of the bill defines the various terms used in the act 
and gives an interpretation for each one. The word “passenger” 
is defined as follows, and I quote: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—means a person carried on a vessel by the owner or operator 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>So far, so good. Traditionally, with this government, the 
definition of “passenger” has always been very clear. The term 
refers to a person who boards a ship that belongs to the owner or 
the operator. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, when I keep on reading, I start wondering. Right after, 
it says, and I quote again from Clause 2: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—other than 
</UL><UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>(<I>a</I>) a person carried on a Safety Convention 
vessel who is 
</UL></UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>(i) the master, a member of the crew or a person 
employed or engaged in any capacity on board the vessel on the 
business of that vessel, 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is quite clear that the master and crew are excluded from the 
passenger category. What is strange is the exclusion coming next: 
a person who is under one year of age. Why? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why is a child under one year of age not a full-fledged person 
under Canadian law? What would be the impact of that 
definition, or rather that exclusion, in the event of an accident 
or a shipwreck, for example? Since they are not considered as 
passengers, would children under one year of age be excluded from 
any insurance settlement? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Puzzled, I sought to know and I asked questions. I got answers, 
but disturbing and rather strange ones. The Canadian government 
would have been forced to include this exclusion clause for 
children under one year of age in the bill because Canada would 
be bound by international treaties, protocols or resolutions it 
had signed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Has Canada forgotten that former Prime Minister Brian Mulroney 
himself presided over the community of nations that agreed to 
sign the Convention on the Rights of the Child? 
Is it really necessary to add that the United States were not 
part of that community of nations? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>After having been such a leader on the issue of children's 
rights, how can Canada accept that children under one year of age 
be considered as non-beings? This is unacceptable according to 
me. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If there are countries which do not respect children, we must 
refuse to sign conventions or protocols with those countries. If 
we do sign such documents for valid reasons, we must require that 
this exclusion be removed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada should be ashamed of including such a clause in one of 
its laws. Canada should be ashamed of hiding behind a document 
signed with another country.  Since when has Canada relinquished 
its sovereignty?

<A HREF="#LINKT30"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is hope however.  Three clauses in this bill refer 
directly to international conventions, protocols or resolutions. 
Under clause 31, Governor in Council may even amend international 
agreements.  Therefore, the government cannot use the signed 
documents as an excuse to justify refusing to amend clause 2 in 
order to delete that exclusion of children under one year of age. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the answer was not satisfactory to me, I continued to 
investigate and ask questions. Someone pointed me in another 
direction. What I was told is so far out that I want to share it 
with you. 
To have a good understanding of the explanation given to me, I 
will go back to the bill and quote clause 115: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>115. (1)  Every passenger on board a vessel shall comply with 
any direction that is given to them by the master or a crew 
member to carry out the provisions of this Act or the 
regulations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(2)  Every passenger on board a vessel shall comply with a 
direction to leave the vessel that is given to them by the 
master before the vessel embarks on a voyage. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps this clause excluding children under one year of age was 
included in the bill because these children who are 364 days old 
and under would not be able to obey the captain's order, whereas 
those who are 365 days old and over would. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am a pre-school education expert and I can assure you that 
several captains and several crew members will soon be 
encountering multiple problems when asking children barely over 
a year old, at least up to five years old, to leave a vessel. 
They will need help to make these children obey that order from 
the captain. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That explanation given to me to justify the exclusion of 
children under one year of age is totally ridiculous. A 
364-day-old child could not obey the captain's order, but a 
365-day-old child could. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have another question regarding this clause excluding children 
under one year of age. Nowhere in this bill does it say that 
these children cannot board a ship. It just says that they are 
excluded from the definition of “passenger”. Then how should we 
interpret clause 110? I quote: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>110. (1) The master of a vessel shall ensure that the number of 
persons carried on board is not more than the number of persons 
authorized to be on board under any certificate issued under this 
Part or under an international convention or protocol listed in 
Schedule 1. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I said at the beginning of my speech, this legislation 
provides that children under the age of one are not passengers, 
but it does not define what a person is. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Consequently, the definition of person has to be a 
reasonable one, and, in this case, a child under one year of age 
is a person without being a passenger. The child is included 
in the total number of people who must not be aboard the ship to 
ensure that the number of people on board does not exceed the 
number of people authorized under the certificate. Even if they 
are not passengers, these children should be treated the same way 
as the master and crew of the vessel and counted among the 
persons on board. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While I am making my comments on the bill, I would like to draw 
your attention to the fact that the legislation clarifies the 
respective responsibilities of the transport and the fisheries 
and oceans departments. Clause 35 even provides that either one 
of the ministers can make recommendations to the governor in 
council for the making of regulations implementing the bill after 
it has been passed by both Houses and it has received royal 
sanction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The enactment organizes the contents, updates the terminology 
and streamlines substantive requirements to make the law much 
clearer and easier to understand.

trading partners. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill has 14 parts, some under the responsibility of the 
Department of Transport and others under the responsibility of 
the Department of Fisheries and Oceans, although three of them 
are standard in legislation providing for transitional measures 
or consequential amendments to various bills. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under the responsibility of the Department of Transport are: 
part 1, defining the terms and the application of the 
legislation; part 2, providing for the registration, listing and 
recording of vessels; part 3, which includes provisions regarding 
the skills and the hiring conditions of crew members; part 4, 
providing for the safety of passengers and crew members; part 6, 
dealing with incidents, accidents and casualties. This part 
defines the right to salvage, the obligations in case of 
collisions, and the powers of inquiry into causes of death. Part 
9 defines the responsibilities of the department as regards 
pollution prevention. Finally, part 11 deals with enforcement and 
various powers of the Minister of Transport. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under the authority of the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans are 
part 5, which contains provisions relating to navigation 
services, the creation of vessel traffic zones and the 
obligations of vessels during search and rescue operations; part 
7, which deals with wreck, particularly their ownership and 
disposal; part 8, which determines the responsibilities of the 
minister in the area of pollution and provides for the making of 
regulations on pollution prevention and response; and part 10, 
which contains provisions relating to pleasure crafts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we can see, this bill contains two parts dealing with 
pollution: part 8, which is under the authority of the Department 
of Fisheries and Oceans, and part 9, which is under the authority 
of the Department of Transport. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Part 8 is entitled “Pollution prevention and response”, while 
part 9 deals only with prevention. Each part begins by giving the 
definitions which apply in it. Three expressions or words are 
found in both part 8 and part 9: oil pollution incident, 
polluted, and discharge. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Surprisingly enough, even if part 8 and part 9 use the same 
word, namely discharge, each part does not give the same 
definition of the word. I really wonder why the word 
discharge is not given the same meaning by both parts of the 
bill dealing with the same matter. This seems to be, at the very 
least, an anomaly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the face of it, the Bloc Quebecois supports the purpose of 
the bill. This is a bill we want to modernize. It is high time 
that we did what is necessary to be up to date in the area of 
shipping. 
Furthermore, the Bloc Quebecois has also given its support to 
Bill S-2 respecting marine liability. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, one thing is interesting. When the Minister of 
Transport introduced his bill on March 1, he was quoted in the 
press release as saying that the purpose of the bill was to 
promote economic growth in the shipping industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois has already often indicated, and uses every 
opportunity to repeat, that the only way, as far as it is 
concerned, to increase, promote, enhance and develop economic 
growth in the shipping industry is to adopt a real federal 
shipbuilding policy and to take concrete measures to assist the 
shipbuilding industry.

</I></B></P><P align=left>It is high time that the government decided to put aside the 
Minister of Finance's personal interests and take to heart the 
interests of the people of Quebec and Canada and give us a 
shipbuilding policy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The questions I have raised require meaningful answers. I hope 
the Canadian government will never pass a bill where children 
under one year of age are excluded. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Bélair):</B> Order, please. Before we get 
into questions and comments, it is my duty, pursuant to Standing 
Order 38, to inform the House that the question to be raised 
tonight at the time of adjournment is as follows: the hon. member 
for Dewdney—Alouette, Ethics Counsellor. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK202"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Brian Fitzpatrick (Prince Albert, Canadian Alliance):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, our reading of the act is that it imposes high 
standards for Canadian shippers in terms of safety, the 
environment and the qualifications of people who man and operate 
the ships. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For clarification, the area we are concerned about is where the 
act refers to the offshore registration of ships.  My reading of 
that section indicates that we would accept offshore companies if 
they met or exceeded Canada's very high standards.  I think this 
area needs clarification.  Many Canadians feel legislation too 
often leaves loopholes.  Many Canadians feel, for example, that 
the family trust legislation allowed well to do people to escape 
taxation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The concern I have is that there are lots of international 
shippers registered in countries such as Liberia and the Bahamas. 
For example, there is a company called Canada Steamship Lines 
International.  I think some of the members on the other side 
might be familiar with the company.  About the only thing 
Canadian about it is the name and maybe some of the ownership. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The question I am getting at is that we had the beef boycott in 
Canada, and in protecting the public interest we shot first and 
checked second.  What safeguards does the public have in this act 
that international shippers, if they should come into our waters, 
will comply with our standards regarding environment and safety 
and the qualification of the people who operate the vessels?  If 
they run afoul of those requirements what enforcement remedies do 
we have?  What can we do with a company such as Canada Steamship 
International if something like that should happen?  That is the 
question on which I would like clarification. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay:</B> Mr. Speaker, this is a very interesting 
question, but it ought to be raised in committee. The bill will 
soon be referred to a committee and we will have to put questions 
directly to the officials who will come before the committee and 
to the government so they can give us some explanation for the 
extremely important problem raised by my colleague. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We should see to it that Canada's shipping industry register its 
ships in Canada and that these ships sail proudly under the 
Canadian flag, at least in Canadian waters. The heritage minister 
should provide flags to those Canadian shippers who are unable to 
get them or who get their flags from other countries because they 
are cheaper. Perhaps we should ask that the government see to it 
that we truly have our own shipping industry in this country.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Marcel Gagnon (Champlain, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have a 
question for my colleague. I happen to live on the shores of the 
St. Lawrence River. I hear about many incidents at sea involving 
ships that are carrying oil or other dangerous substances. Not a 
month goes by without a major disaster happening, which causes 
pollution in some part of our planet. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What I fear, as do other people living along the shores of the 
St. Lawrence River with whom I spoke, is that some day one of 
those disasters will happen right here. Just imagine an oil 
slick on the river and the damage it would cause. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under clause 11 of the bill, the minister can have vessels 
inspected. 
Would my colleague agree that, in order to improve safety on the 
St. Lawrence River, we should have mandatory inspection of 
vessels coming from the sea, when they enter the St. Lawrence 
River? Vessels would be automatically inspected to provide the 
level of security needed to protect the shores of the St. 
Lawrence River. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague from 
Champlain for his question, which gives me an opportunity to get 
another very important message across. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We realize that the Food Inspection Agency is not working 
properly because of a shortage of veterinarians. Yesterday 
morning, at the Standing Committee on Fisheries and Oceans, we 
also realized that Fisheries and Oceans Canada is not operating 
properly because they do not have enough inspectors to inspect 
the lobster catch, for example, in the bay, in New Brunswick and 
in Prince Edward Island. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>People are very concerned when they see the government buying 
huge expensive trucks equipped with nice shinny mirrors, but 
forgetting that fish has to be inspected in water. Fisheries and 
Ocean has forgotten that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can see improvements in this bill, but we have had across the 
way for the last seven or eight years a mean government trying to 
save money everywhere it can and making sure that we do not have 
the means to respect the policies and the legislation it puts 
forwards. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While this bill is promising, if the legislation is not 
implemented better than the Food Inspection Agency or inspection 
scheme at Fisheries and Oceans, which is now using beautiful red 
and white boats—because we just love red and white in this 
place—that can be spotted from 150 miles away, it will be as 
useless as everything else.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Grant McNally (Dewdney—Alouette, Canadian Alliance):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, my colleague from the Bloc is a very knowledgeable 
member who has spoken quite eloquently on this bill.  I know she 
is very concerned about the environment.  She has made many 
interventions in the House on that particular topic. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Could she elaborate on the aspects of Bill C-14 which deal with 
the environment and pollution?  Does she think those are strong 
enough measures and would she be able to support them?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay:</B> Mr. Speaker, I got really worried when I 
read the part about pollution prevention and response. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not understand why we need two different parts within the 
same bill to deal with this issue and why each part has to be 
the responsibility of a different minister. When two people 
share the same hat, the hat is never on the right head when a 
disaster occurs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I said in my speech, we will never know what definition of 
the word discharge is to apply, since it is not the same in the 
both parts. 
This will give rise to some interesting arguments and 
challenges. Lawyers will say “You know, the word discharge in 
part 8 does not mean exactly the same thing as it does in part 9. 
Are you talking about part 8 or part 9?” 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not sure how good this will be for the environment, but I 
think it will be very good for Liberal lawyers.

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>CANADA SHIPPING ACT, 2001 
</H3><P align=left>

<A NAME="LINK208">&nbsp;</A>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed consideration of the motion that Bill C-14, an 
act to respecting shipping and navigation and to amend the 
Shipping Conferences Exemption Act, 1987 and other acts, be read 
the second time and referred to a committee. 
<P><A NAME="LINK209"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Brian Fitzpatrick (Prince Albert, Canadian Alliance):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I directed some of my inquiries to my hon. colleague 
from the Bloc, regarding the kind of safeguards, remedies and 
procedures that we have in place to ensure foreign shipping 
companies which enter our waters meet our standards.  It is one 
thing to put into a bill or into a piece of legislation that we 
will allow them in our waters provided they meet or exceed our 
standards. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, I would like someone from the government side, who has 
some knowledge on this matter, to clarify this whole area.  What 
safeguards do we have if we had a real situation, such as Canada 
Steamship Lines Inc. entering our waters?  If they were 
registered in Liberia and something went wrong, what steps could 
we take to protect the public interest?  I would be very curious 
to see what the government has to say on that matter.  This is an 
area of this act that is defective. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me expand on this topic a bit.  Let us say this hypothetical 
shipping company is registered in Liberia.  It has a fleet of 15 
ships and staff of 1,500.  The shipowner hires employees from the 
Ukraine to staff the ships and pays them $2 or $3 a day, which is 
much less than our Canadian standards and what my Liberal friends 
would say would be a compassionate level of remuneration. 
However, the ships do not comply with our safety standards. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian safety standards, inspection requirements and so on 
of ships are very demanding.  Our manufacturing requirements for 
building ships are extremely demanding.  If these ships enter our 
waters, we need to make sure they meet our standards in terms of 
safety and quality. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are also be concerned with environmental matters.  It is very 
easy for shippers without ethics and tough standards to dump 
garbage and different things into our waters which could pollute 
and cause problems.  That is a major concern as well. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1655"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT35"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would not be a bit surprised that some of the companies which 
register in Liberia or the Bahamas do that in order to escape the 
responsibilities, the liabilities and the high standards which we 
have in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I guess another concern is, if they do enter our waters and the 
ship crashes or sinks because of a lack of proper manufacturing 
safety standards, or it dumps a whole bunch of toxic substances 
in the St. Lawrence or the Great Lakes, or their employees bring 
diseases into the country because of third world type working 
conditions, what precisely would the act do to protect the 
Canadian public?  What steps can we take against such shippers? 
Do we send something off like the Italians did concerning the 
Mafia person in Canada?  Do we send something off to Liberia and 
ask the Liberian authorities to step in and help us out?  Do we 
go to Liberian court and start some sort of court action to try 
to collect damages from that country?  I think these are serious 
questions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members on the government side ought to know these are serious 
matters and they cannot be dealt with in a trivial manner.  The 
Canadian public safety and interest is too important.  This 
aspect of the bill should be shored up.  When it goes to 
committee I would encourage government members to really zero in 
on this area and address it because it is very skimpy.  The act 
says “meet or exceed Canadian standards” but I do not see 
anything in it that says how we are going to ensure that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is the Department of Transport going to send people over to 
Liberia, like it did with the Brazilian beef issue, and check 
everything out to make sure that it has top insurance standards 
on its ships, that it has good humane standards for taking care 
of its employees, that it has collective bargaining rights and 
tough measures in regard to environmental measures?  Is that what 
the act contemplates?  I do not really see that in the act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A lot of people have the impression that many important and 
powerful Canadians are evading our laws by simply going offshore. 
They might preach and talk about Canadian values, high standards 
and the Liberal way of doing things, but as soon as they have an 
opportunity for their own self interest they go outside the 
country.  They will circumvent our laws to suit themselves.  This 
is something that should not be overlooked in the act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a good act with a lot of teeth in it to make Canadian 
owners comply with the law.  It is lacking detail as to what we 
do with international shipping companies that are not registered 
in Canada but enter our waters.  That section in the act is 
inadequate.  We need much better clarification on that point. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a whole list of things that this section invites.  I 
would suggest that if international shippers are going to come 
into our waters we should require them to register just like 
Canadian shippers.  This, as it is, is too easy a procedure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Shippers can go to Liberia, or the Bahamas or some other country 
that does not have the Canadian standards, set up operations, 
then come into our waters.  If they can convince someone in the 
Department of Transport, we could have the buck passing that we 
saw in the House this afternoon among the Solicitor General of 
Canada, the Minister of Citizenship and Immigration, the Prime 
Minister and others.  They all said they could not tell so and so 
or they could not tell this department or that department.  In 
the meantime, the public could be sitting with a disaster on its 
hands.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Maybe it is like a ship that sinks in the Great Lakes, in the 
St. Lawrence or off the coast of British Columbia and causes a 
lot of problems, environmental or otherwise.  We would then find 
out that we really have no way of dealing with the owners and 
that we do not have any enforcement remedies along the line.  I 
think that is a very serious matter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am surprised that a Liberal government, of all governments, 
would not have identified the need to really have tough measures 
in place in this area.  It is a fairly major omission in the 
bill.  It is very tough on Canadians.  It seems to be somewhat 
slack for international shippers who would want to come into our 
waters. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am a new member of parliament and have practised law for 25 
years.  My attitude, based on 25 years, is that I have been shot 
as the messenger.  Bad laws are passed by governments and I have 
to be the messenger for them.  I have to deliver the bad news to 
my clients and quite often I am the one who gets blamed for it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am in a place today where I thought I would be at the front 
end of the process.  Based on some of the questions of privilege 
raised in the House today I am not so sure that I really am at 
the front end of the process.  I am wondering if I am not back in 
Nipawin, Saskatchewan at the back end of the load again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a practitioner of law, this is the time to tell the 
government to get the legislation clear in this very important 
area and make sure it is tough.  It should be tougher on foreign 
shippers who come in here.  Just because they are registered in 
Liberia or the Bahamas and Canada is written on the shipping 
line, it should not be a licence to come into our waters and 
abuse our jurisdiction.  We should have very tough shipping laws. 
That is a major loophole in the legislation and it should be 
tightened up. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This should not be like the family trust matter in the Income 
Tax Act.  There was some window dressing on that but still the 
tax experts, with whom I am familiar, said that the door was 
still wide open for wealthy families to evade and escape the tax 
responsibilities put into place by the Minister of Finance.  We 
certainly do not want to see the same sort of thing happening 
with shipping in Canadian waters. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We had some major accidents a few years ago, such as the sinking 
of the <I>Exxon Valdez</I> off the coast of Alaska.  We saw the 
environmental damage and disaster that caused.  It is important 
that we have stringent and tough standards on international 
shippers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not happy about a shipper coming into our country who is 
paying people who are down and out and in desperate straits.  I 
wonder where the Liberal compassion is on the issue.  The 
shippers hire these employees to staff their ships and pay them 
$2 a day.  I have no idea what the safety or environmental 
standards are for people working on those ships.  I conjure up 
visions of shoe manufacturers going to Malaysia to find people 
who are down and out and then pay them starvation type wages and 
so on.  They then come to Canada and say that they believe in 
high standards and the values of compassion and fairness for 
Canadians.  I guess that does not apply to people elsewhere. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If they are not Canadians and they can get through the 
loopholes, why should they not exploit labour, why should they 
not forget about collective bargaining rights and all the other 
things that the Liberal government has put into place for 
Canadians?  This is a serious concern. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My reading of the act is that there is only one section that 
deals with the matter and it simply states that a foreign owned 
company can enter our waters for shipping if the authorities are 
satisfied that it meets or exceeds our standards.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today and over the last few days I heard a lot of buck passing 
concerning a Mafia individual who is in Canada.  Nobody wants to 
accept the responsibility for him being here.  People were saying 
that they were not in charge of what happens in their departments 
and that other people were in charge.  I hope that does not 
happen in a Valdez-type situation where there could be a major 
environmental problem or in a situation where someone is possibly 
hauling a banned toxic substance.  This could be garbage from 
some other country which could be dumped in the St. Lawrence, on 
our shores or something along that line. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We should look at our immigration laws and how people look at 
Canada.  They see our country as an easy place to escape their 
responsibilities and liabilities.  We are seen in the world as 
the country to come to.  If people are criminals somewhere else 
and the authorities are hot on their path, Canada is the country 
to come to.  Our supreme court and our government have sent those 
signals out.  If they can get to Canada, they will probably have 
three square meals a day and, if they are lucky, they might get 
out to Mission, B.C. and do some golfing with Colin Thatcher 
before it is all over, or go to the riding academy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think there is a problem with the bill.  We see examples in 
other areas but the government says things are different here. 
There is only one way to make sure it is different.  We must get 
the bill right the first time.  It should have very tough 
standards in this area.  The standards should be detailed and not 
contain just one clause that is a kind of platitude. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill contains very extensive details on the registration 
requirements but for an international shipper, it is pretty much 
a blank cheque.  It seems to me we are giving the Department of 
Transport authorities an awful lot of room for discretion but 
with little direction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I suppose the minister and the department could get together and 
have a briefing session to decide what kind of policy they would 
put in place.  We in the opposition could then wait three or four 
years until one of those ships had a major calamity in our 
waters.  We would again be embarrassed as opposition members 
because we would not know what had taken place behind closed 
doors or in starred chambers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I encourage government members to take a very serious look at 
this area.  I understand why some government members might be a 
bit intimidated to move into this area, especially ones who sit 
further back from the front row of the House, but it is important 
and they should not let the intimidation factor enter the 
picture.  We must do our jobs and make sure that we pass good 
quality laws.  We should not let our personal feelings toward 
other members enter the discussion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This subject also raises the issue of foreign type international 
law questions.  I do not know if there are any members here from 
Prince Edward Island, but authorities found, or thought they 
found, some sort of disease on one-quarter or 60 acres of land in 
P.E.I. so they totally killed the potato crop industry in P.E.I. 
They did this without checking it out and caused terrible harm to 
the people of P.E.I.. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We almost did the same thing to Brazil.  The government decided, 
in the context of a trade fight between Brazil and Bombardier and 
other matters, that the way to get the message across to the 
Brazilians was to hit them where it hurt, which was to shut down 
their beef export industry.  The government came up with some 
sort of bogus allegation and said that in the name of public 
safety, it was shutting down that industry until it was satisfied 
that the beef was safe. 
We then send a bunch of people over there who find out there was 
really nothing wrong with the beef and the ban is lifted.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I feel we may also have a lot of problems with the shipping 
arrangement.  The bar has been set very low for shippers coming 
into our country and international shippers who do not meet our 
standards come in under the bar.  A disaster could happen and we 
would end up checking it out afterward.  That is not the way to 
do things.  We should make sure that the legislation is tight and 
that it does not have any loopholes.  We have enough loopholes in 
our laws.  We must address this area so it does not become a 
major problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My hon. colleague from the Bloc made some very good comments and 
I encourage the government to take a look at the concerns he 
raised.  Details will kill us on these sorts of things but this 
area has no detail. The devil is in the detail and there are no 
details in this area.  It is wide open.  To me it is almost like 
giving a blank cheque to get into our waters.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The member mentioned that we have to meet and exceed standards. 
If he is not happy with the in the way we meet and exceed 
standards, what would he propose?  How much more does he expect 
the government to do?  I wonder if he would comment on those two 
points. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Brian Fitzpatrick:</B>  Mr. Speaker, being from the 
prairies, rail transportation is an area that I am much more of 
an authority on than marine shipping.  It seems to me that we 
should look at the safeguards other jurisdictions have in place 
to deal with this particular problem.  They may have found a new 
and better way to deal with this sort of problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have committees to look at those things.  Hopefully a good 
transport committee could look at this sort of thing. We could 
then put down our political caps, quit playing games and look at 
some good solid proposals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why do we not make international shippers comply with our 
requirements?  Why does one section of the legislation allow them 
to come into Canada under the bar even when they do not meet our 
standards.  Maybe we should look at that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When a business or a company wants to do business in Canada they 
must comply with all our requirements.  We do not impose a bunch 
of requirements on Canadians and then allow foreign entities to 
come in and do business and bypass the requirements that apply to 
the rest of us.  This would be one obvious answer to the 
question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope my points in this area will be of some help to the 
government.  I would welcome the opportunity to be on the 
transport committee where we could roll up our sleeves and look 
at creating a good tight law in this area.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Bryden (Ancaster—Dundas—Flamborough—Aldershot, 
Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the member said in his speech that the 
bill does not demonstrate the responses.  He said that the bill 
is not tough enough.  Let me take him through a couple of 
passages in the bill. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1715"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT40"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT40"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1715

<A HREF="#LINKT39"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me just take him through a couple of passages in the bill 
very quickly. I know he is a lawyer and I know the 
bill is 200 pages long, but in fact, were he to look at section 
172, just looking at pollution, he would see that a pollution 
officer can board any vessel.  If he looked at section 176 he 
would find that a pollution officer can demand to enter the 
premises on any vessel, can demand that equipment be seized and 
can demand to make photographs.  He will see in section 176, 
subsection (4), that with a warrant he can arrest people on 
board.  He can demand to come aboard and use force. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister can seize the vessel and 
destroy the vessel.  That is section 180.  The minister can 
remove and actually destroy the vessel if it is deemed to be 
polluting. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, subsection 183(2) reads: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Every person who—commits an offence under subsection (1) is 
liable on summary conviction to a fine of not more than 
$1,000,000 or to imprisonment for a term of not more than 
eighteen months— 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is punishment. Did he not read those sections 
before he prepared his speech? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Brian Fitzpatrick:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am glad my hon. 
colleague raised those points.  Those are the enforcement 
provisions which would certainly apply to Canadian owned 
steamship operations or to other shippers in our waters.  There 
is no doubt about it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The ambiguity in the legislation is what we do with someone who 
is not in Canada.  The hon. member mentioned the $1 million fine. 
If the owner is in Afghanistan and registered in Liberia and 
causes $10 million worth of damage in the St. Lawrence River, 
what will we do?  Will we send the Canadian army over to 
Afghanistan, round this guy up and bring him back just like we 
are dealing with the Mafia man here?  These are not the answers 
Canadians are looking for. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Seriously, given this gentleman's background and knowledge as a 
journalist and so on, he ought to know better than to come up 
with an answer like that.  He knows the public wants higher 
standards and clear laws, not dancing around or looking for 
technicalities, not lawyers and courts with technicalities to get 
wealthy people off fines and charges, because they can afford it. 
The wealthy people, whether it is through family trusts or 
steamship lines, can hire the army of lawyers.  He ought to know 
that.  He has a wealth of experience in the journalistic world 
and he should know that. 
<P><A NAME="LINK212"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Brent St. Denis (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Transport, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the member has raised a number 
of questions, as have others.  In committee, I think every effort 
will be made to respond to them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the record I would just like to point out that Canada, as a 
port state, is permitted to board any foreign vessel regardless 
of the status and currency of its safety certificate and 
regardless of its flag. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact, in 1999, over 1,000 vessels from 86 different countries 
were inspected.  Where there were deficiencies, whether they were 
with respect to the safety of the workers on those boats or the 
marine environment, actions were taken.  The bottom line is that 
this legislation goes further in modernizing environmental and 
safety provisions and will do a better job for all Canadians when 
it comes to our offshore and Great Lakes waters. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Brian Fitzpatrick:</B>  Mr. Speaker, that is a good 
answer. It is part of the answer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us say we have the guy from Afghanistan who has his ships 
registered in Liberia and who brings a ship into Canadian waters. 
He owns 14 other ships.  He has not posted a bond or put anything 
in place in Canada.  Let us say we find his ship in our waters 
with a toxic substance, maybe nuclear waste, and we know it is 
going to be dumped in our water because he does not know where 
else to take it.  It is brought into Canadian waters.  We seize 
it and it becomes our problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How do we track down this individual who owns these ships and 
bring him into this country and make him accountable for the 
damages?  That is the real question.  I can assure everyone that 
the wealthy people of the world, whether they are Greek tycoons 
or a Canadian family heavily involved in shipping, want to use 
these loopholes.  These are the very kinds of problems we get 
into when a disaster takes place:  hunting down these people and 
finding an effective enforcement remedy to deal with this.

</I></B></P><P align=left>This is something I think we should take a good, long, hard look 
at.  We should not just rubber stamp the act, put it through and 
hope the system works.  In the House today we heard about a 
number of cases in regard to the immigration department, where 
people were bound and determined to get into Seattle and caused 
major damage.  They roamed around our country for seven years. 
There is another guy who, from what I gather, Hollywood could 
make a movie about.  He is a dangerous person and he has been in 
our country for two years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am a member of parliament for Prince Albert trying to get some 
answers as to how this could come about.  All I find is a bunch 
of buck passing.  Quite seriously, it is just buck passing from 
one department to the other.  No one accepts any responsibility. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not want a major environmental disaster to happen with an 
international shipper in our waters and have this sort of episode 
take place here.  Now is the time to make sure we have good laws 
in place and a system that will get the outputs we want. 
<P><A NAME="LINK213"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Grant McNally (Dewdney—Alouette, Canadian Alliance):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the comments made by my colleague from 
Prince Albert.  He of course hails from the area one of our 
previous right hon. prime ministers, the Right Hon. John 
Diefenbaker, and he is obviously upholding the tradition of 
statesmanship and speaking up for important issues across Canada. 
I applaud him for that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Hon. members on the other side are congratulating the member 
from Prince Albert, and I congratulate them for being so 
receptive to a new member.  That shows they are willing to work 
with the Alliance, and we in the Alliance appreciate that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to talk about Bill C-14.  There are many parts of 
the bill that have to do with the protection of our environment. 
Those are the parts of the bill that caught my attention and I 
had the opportunity to look through them.  The Alliance is, of 
course, the party that cares about the environment.  We in the 
Alliance care about our environment and we are looking for ways 
to work with others in the House, with members from other parties 
and from the government side, and to work together on important 
issues like the environment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The environment is of great concern to us.  We need to leave our 
country in a good state for those who are coming behind us, our 
children and future generations, and I would like to give some 
recognition to the government for including some issues having to 
do with the environment in the bill.  I think that is a good 
thing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are looking for ways to work together in the House.  When a 
good idea comes forward, even if it is from the government side, 
we will make mention of it.  We would also do the same in 
relation to other parties and hope that others in this place 
would work with us in a spirit of co-operation so that we can 
tackle the important issues of the country.  That is exactly what 
we are doing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member from the Liberal side who used to be a Conservative 
says it makes good sense and I appreciate what he says.  Again, I 
agree with him on that point. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In terms of the shipbuilding industry, we do have word that the 
government will possibly move forward in helping to re-establish 
the shipping industry in our nation.  We do have some concerns 
about that particular topic and the government's approach to that 
industry, such as whether it will be working on subsidizing that 
industry and using taxpayer dollars to support an industry which 
might have difficulty competing on the world market. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hear my colleague from the other side once again commending me 
for my good points and I thank him for that.  I truly thank him 
for that and for working in the new spirit of co-operation which 
the Alliance has initiated.  We in the Alliance truly appreciate 
it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We do have some concerns about the way the government might 
proceed on that particular issue, but we will save that for 
another day because I do want to make my comments pertinent to 
Bill C-14, the bill before the House right now. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1725"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT41"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I see that my comments are sparking great debate, ringing with 
agreement around the House.  At this late hour of debate in the 
House, it is reassuring to us that government members are so 
attentive and in agreement with us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When looking through Bill C-14 I did not see any mention of 
double hulling of ships.  As a member from British Columbia, not 
too far away from the coast, I think it is an issue that should 
be explored in committee in regard to the bill, in order to 
protect our environment and provide protection to our marine 
coastal areas, which are so important to the economy on the west 
coast, the east coast and throughout the nation.  I would like to 
see that point perhaps pursued in committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is something in part 8 of the bill in reference to the 
Department of Fisheries and Oceans which reminds me of an issue 
in my own riding.  There is an area referred to as the Codd 
Island wetlands, in Pitt Meadows in British Columbia.  It is a 
very important and sensitive ecological area.  Some experts are 
saying that it is one of the last remaining intact wetlands in 
the lower mainland area of Vancouver. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Right now there is concern that the area might be developed and 
turned into a cranberry bog.  That is a concern to many people in 
the community.  They are working to rally together to see if 
there might be some other solutions in order to maintain and 
protect this important ecological wetland.  I believe there have 
been and will be letters to the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans 
and to the Minister of the Environment, both of whom are 
ministers of the crown from British Columbia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We hope that members of my riding would have the ear of the 
ministers for their concerns and that a possibility might arise 
for the Department of Fisheries and Oceans and the Department of 
the Environment to work co-operatively with the province, the 
local jurisdiction of Pitt Meadows and concerned citizens.  We 
are looking for opportunities to build together to protect that 
area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know I have digressed a little from Bill C-14, but when I saw 
part 8 of the bill regarding the Department of Fisheries and 
Oceans, I saw it as a good opportunity to bring up this very 
important issue of the Codd Island wetlands. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Also in the bill there is a reference in clause 173 to the need 
to report to parliament every five years in regard to this 
particular bill.  We think reporting to parliament is a good 
thing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  What about the <I>Titanic</I>? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Grant McNally:</B>  The member on the Liberal side who was 
a Conservative is saying that his former party—or maybe he is 
saying his party—is going down like the <I>Titanic</I>.  I am not 
sure that all members would agree with him on that.  Perhaps some 
would. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The point about reporting to parliament is an important one.  We 
saw in this place today an example of what happens when a 
minister of the crown does not report to parliament and does not 
present a piece of legislation first in this place before holding 
a briefing and giving information about an important piece of 
legislation, in this case Bill C-15, the justice bill.  The 
minister's department gave information to the media first, 
excluding members of parliament from attending the briefing, 
saying that it was an embargoed briefing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know that Mr. Speaker will be ruling on the matter, but I 
think it is worth mentioning again in this place that the 
government needs to follow the proper procedures and process to 
restore people's faith in this place and that we are in fact the 
leaders in terms of what we are doing with legislation and moving 
forward together. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What happened here today is an example of why it is important to 
follow process.  Unfortunately the Minister of Justice did not do 
that.  We are disappointed with that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My time is growing short.  I will wrap up my comments knowing 
that I will have more time at another sitting of the House to 
discuss this important bill.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Svend Robinson (Burnaby—Douglas, NDP)</B> moved: 
<A NAME="LINK217">&nbsp;</A>
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That, in the opinion of this 
House, the government should take whatever measures are 
necessary to ensure that Canada does not participate in the 
research, development, or production of components for use 
in the proposed American National Missile Defense System. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said:  Mr. Speaker, at the outset I thank the hon. member for 
Halifax, the national leader of the New Democratic Party, for 
seconding this motion.  I also thank all my colleagues in the 
House of Commons for the work they have been doing across the 
country to try to bring to the attention of Canadians, and in 
particular to our government, the profound importance of Canada 
finally and urgently taking a strong and clear stand in 
opposition to the U.S. national missile defence system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I pay a particular tribute to my colleague, the spokesperson on 
defence for the New Democratic caucus, the member for 
Sackville—Musquodoboit Valley—Eastern Shore.  He has worked 
tirelessly on this issue for many years.  His predecessor, Gordon 
Earle, the former member for Halifax West, also did an 
outstanding job in pleading with the government to show 
leadership on the issue.  It is an issue literally of life and 
death not just for Canada but for the planet. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The essential elements of my motion are, first, that the 
government should speak out strongly in opposition to the 
proposed national missile defence system of the United States in 
view of the fact that it represents a very grave threat to 
international arms control agreements and raises the serious 
possibility of a new nuclear arms race. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, it is very important that Canada refuse all 
participation in the research, development or production of 
components for use in the NMD. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, and in many respects just as important, Canada should 
work with other governments to strengthen and deepen existing 
arms control agreements toward the goal of eliminating all 
nuclear weapons.  That must surely be our fundamental goal.  It 
is in that light that we approach the issue of the proposed U.S. 
national missile defence program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We all recall an earlier version of the program, the so-called 
star wars proposal of former U.S. President Ronald Reagan.  Even 
the Conservative government of Brian Mulroney spoke out against 
that incredibly destructive proposal by President Reagan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The tragedy today is that we look across at a Liberal government 
that remains on the fence.  It refuses to take a strong and clear 
stand now in opposition to the proposed national missile defence 
system.  The system clearly threatens the current international 
framework of non-proliferation, arms control and disarmament 
agreements, areas in which Canada has historically shown 
leadership. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada along with 186 other states has signed the nuclear 
non-proliferation treaty.  Canada has formally undertaken, along 
with those states: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—to pursue negotiations in good faith on effective measures 
relating to cessation of the nuclear arms race at an early date 
and to nuclear disarmament. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That was the commitment made by 187 states less than a year ago 
in May 2000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In February of last year United Nations Secretary General Kofi 
Annan said that the nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation 
agenda was in a state of deplorable stagnation and that it was 
difficult to approach the NPT review conference with optimism 
given the discouraging list of nuclear disarmament measures in 
suspense, negotiations not initiated and opportunities not taken. 
He said that a dangerous nuclear arms race looms on the horizon.

<A HREF="#LINKT43"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no question whatsoever that a decision by the United 
States to proceed with a national missile defence system would 
dramatically escalate that nuclear arms race.  We know that this 
would be a clear breach of the 1972 anti-ballistic missile treaty 
between the United States and Russia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That treaty is a cornerstone of the international arms control 
regime.  The United States would simply rip up the treaty. 
President Bush would rip it up and indeed President Bush's vision 
for star wars goes even further than that proposed by former 
President Clinton. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no doubt that in many respects it is part of an agenda 
to militarize space itself which, as we can all appreciate, would 
have a devastating impact again in terms of the nuclear arms 
race. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no doubt as well that deployment of the NMD would 
provoke other nuclear weapons states to counter it by building 
more nuclear weapons rather than keeping their NPT promise to 
eliminate their own nuclear arsenals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know the possible impact in terms of China.  The Chinese 
ambassador to the United Nations, Hu Xiadi, warned recently that 
once the NMD is deployed the treaty on the limitation of 
anti-ballistic missile systems, the ABM treaty, will be dead. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To seek complete missile defence capable of protecting all a 
country's territory is tantamount to seeking unilateral security 
so as to gain freedom to threaten others.  As a result, the 
threat of nuclear war will loom again and international relations 
will become turbulent and unstable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know as well the potential implications on other countries in 
the region, for example on India, Pakistan and Taiwan among 
others.  We cannot allow this escalation to take place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know as well that the current proposal has already stalled 
the negotiation of nuclear disarmament agreements in the UN 
conference on disarmament.  That again is a tragedy because we 
must be moving in the opposite direction for the elimination of 
all nuclear weapons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why we are calling on our government to show leadership, 
to speak out clearly and forcefully to the United States against 
the NMD.  We would not be the only country to do so.  Indeed, a 
number of European countries have raised very grave concerns 
about the deployment of the NMD, and indeed the Australian senate 
just recently passed a motion strongly opposing it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Countless groups in Canada that support nuclear disarmament, 
including the Canadian Peace Alliance, the Canadian Coalition for 
Nuclear Responsibility, les Artistes pour la paix, Veterans 
Against Nuclear Arms, Project Ploughshares, Physicians for Global 
Survival and many religious groups and others have appealed to 
our government to show leadership and to finally speak out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know as well that there has been a number of threats, some of 
them not so veiled threats, by our United States allies that we 
must get on board on this.  Indeed, the deputy Canadian commander 
of the joint U.S.-Canada NORAD scheme told Liberal MPs last year 
that the longer Canada delays its support the less influence it 
would have on the system.  He said that we must participate.  As 
my colleague the defence critic has pointed out, the U.S. deputy 
commander of space command threatened that the United States 
would be under absolutely no obligation to defend Canada unless 
it joined the missile shield. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The U.S. ambassador to Canada, Gordon Giffin, has warned Canada. 
He said a refusal by Canada to support the NMD would mark a 
significant evolution in the historic defence relationship 
between Canada and the U.S., and that if the defence relationship 
ends it could affect the fabric of the whole relationship.  We as 
New Democrats say it is time our government rejected those kinds 
of threats from the United States and stood up for peace and 
nuclear disarmament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to close by once again appealing to the government to 
listen to the voices of Canadians, 92% of whom in a recent public 
opinion survey called on our government to lead in the struggle 
to abolish all nuclear weapons.

support the motion.  I appeal to the Alliance which has recently 
stated that it supports the U.S. national missile defence system. 
The Leader of the Opposition was in Washington speaking to the 
vice-president in strong support of NMD, which is very sad.

</I></B></P><P align=left>It is true that the new administration in the United States 
clearly indicated that it will establish a national missile 
defence system. The American legislation says that the government 
will deploy such a system when it is technologically feasible. 
But the US government was also very clear on the fact that it 
intends to look at all the options available and consult its NATO 
allies as well as Russia and China. We need to know more about 
all this before we can make a decision. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleague mentioned the word leadership. This does not mean 
that we are staying idle. Our government has been having serious 
discussions with the United States and other countries involved 
to look at the repercussions of such a system. Our prime minister 
and President Bush have talked about this issue, and so have the 
Minister of Foreign Affairs and the Minister of National Defence 
and their American counterparts. The prime minister has also 
discussed this issue with the president of Russia, the president 
of China, the British prime minister and the French president. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the Canada-United States Permanent Joint Board on Defence, 
the PJBD, over which I have the honour of presiding, we have been 
following that issue for several months. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We want to pursue our dialogue with all of our friends and 
allies and most particularly, of course, with the United States, 
in order to be totally aware of the U.S. plans as they develop. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Moreover, we are trying to influence the United States in their 
decision-making process on that critical issue in order to find a 
solution that would allow for world strategic stability while 
strengthening the security of the United States, Canada and our 
allies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The United States are trying to develop a missile defence system 
because they feel the threat to their national security has 
changed fundamentally because of the proliferation of missile 
technology in the so-called “high-risk” countries, namely North 
Korea, Iran and Iraq. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Work on research and development of missile defence has been 
going on for a long time in the United States, both for the 
protection of troops in theatres of operations as well as to 
protect larger areas. Members will recall, for example, that the 
United States used “Patriot” missiles during the Gulf war to 
protect Israel, with moderate success. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>According to a report from the American Intelligence Services 
published in 1999 under the direction of the current defence 
secretary, Mr. Rumsfeld, high risk nations would be able to 
develop intercontinental ballistic missiles within five or ten 
years, which is much sooner than expected. That and the missile 
tests made that same year by North Korea forced Bill Clinton, who 
was then president, to sign the National Missile Defence Act in 
July of 1999. Since then research has increased in this sector. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A lot is at stake for allies of the United States and all the 
countries on this planet.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>A national missile defence system would have enormous 
consequences on world strategic stability, and we fear it could 
start a new arms race. National missile defence systems are 
presently not allowed under the 1972 treaty between the United 
States and Russia dealing with restrictions on ballistic missile 
defence systems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This treaty, better known as the ABM treaty, ensures that 
United States and Russia stay vulnerable as far as their 
respective nuclear weapons are concerned, to dissuade both 
countries from using them. The strategic stability ensured by 
this treaty also led to other measures regarding the control of 
arms and disarmament. 
The treaty can be changed, and it has been changed in the past, 
but, up to now, Russia has objected to any new changes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada shares the concerns of Americans about new threats to 
international and national security, including those resulting 
from internal conflict, terrorist attacks, and the proliferation 
of mass destruction weapons. We will continue discussing with the 
United States about the best way to counter these threats, 
through bilateral or multilateral agreements, involvement in 
operations promoting peace, diplomacy, or some form of 
antimissile defence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada is at the forefront of international efforts to stop the 
proliferation of missiles and missile technology. I am thinking 
about the missile technology control regime and initiatives 
promoting a multilateral standard against proliferation, 
especially principles, commitments, confidence building measures, 
and incentives that could evolve into a code of conduct. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We wholeheartedly support the resumption of weapons inspections 
in Iraq by the UN under the UNMOVIC, and we encourage North 
Korea, with which Canada has recently established diplomatic 
relations, to abide by the treaty. We also encourage all nations 
which have not done so, the United States and China included, to 
sign or ratify the treaty on the complete prohibition of nuclear 
weapons tests. Such multilateral agreements have an essential 
dampening effect on proliferation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are concerned about the impact the proposed 
national missile defence system would have on strategic stability 
and the potential arms race it could lead to, which would 
undermine current efforts toward non-proliferation and arms 
control. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are anxious to maintain and reinforce the relationship of 
co-operation on issues of security between the U.S. and Russia, 
that led to the ratification of the anti-ballistic missile 
treaty. We shared our concerns with the U.S. government and urge 
them to take all the time they need to seriously consider the 
impact their decision to deploy a national missile defence system 
would have. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>President Bush and his team have clearly stated that they will 
keep listening to what we have to say. They made themselves very 
clear on at least two issues: first, they do not intend to go 
ahead without fully consulting with NATO and their allies; 
second, the missile defence system that will ultimately be 
deployed will be used to protect not only the United States, but 
also their friends and allies. They have also indicated that they 
will be consulting with Russia and China. We therefore encourage 
Moscow and Beijing to accept the invitation extended by 
Washington. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Until the new administration adopts its action plan on a 
national missile defence system and all these consultations have 
been carried out, it would be premature to take position on the 
American initiative. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to participation in research, 
development and production activities concerning parts that would 
be used in this defence system, missile defence research 
activities that Canada is involved in with the United 
States, estimated at about $1 million, are primarily aimed at 
supporting traditional missions carried out by the Canadian 
forces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All antiballistic missile defence systems do not necessarily 
have an impact on global strategic stability. Such systems are 
also used to protect troops in operational theatres and are a 
major component of defence systems in conflict situations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The 1994 white paper deals explicitly with this matter; it 
emphasizes the importance of the antiballistic missile treaty and 
supports research co-operation on missile warning systems and 
antiballistic missile defence, provided that the costs of this 
co-operation are efficient and affordable, that this research 
helps to meet Canadian defence needs and that it builds on 
missions already carried out by the Canadian forces. The current 
co-operation between Canada and the United States is aimed at 
this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Given the considerations that I have just mentioned in broad 
terms, the government cannot support Motion No. 86.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gurmant Grewal (Surrey Central, Canadian Alliance):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to participate in the debate on the 
private member's motion brought forward by the hon. member for 
Burnaby—Douglas.  I know of my colleague's work in the foreign 
affairs portfolio.  We have served together on the committee 
since 1997.  The member is an experienced member of the House and 
has led many personal crusades, some being very controversial.  I 
have learned to work with him on an issue by issue basis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the House hardworking members bring forward private members' 
bills and motions.  I appreciate very much their hard work and 
the intent behind their bills and motions.  The motion today 
calls on the government to take whatever measures are necessary 
to ensure that Canada does not participate in the research, 
development, or production of components for use in the proposed 
American national missile defence system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is my understanding that America's missile defence system is 
still mostly only a part of the imagination or planning of U.S. 
military strategists.  They think they can do something to 
protect North America from a nuclear weapons attack.  They are 
not yet sure what is possible in this regard, but they have 
pledged to the world that they would continue in their tradition 
as defenders of the free world to develop a missile defence 
system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleague seems to be seeking to shut down all Canadian 
consultations and research.  He would shut down exports to the 
U.S. of technology, wire, aluminum, pencils or anything else that 
the Americans might use in their quest to protect North America 
from nuclear weapon attacks.  I have read the motion carefully. 
We have just heard from the hon. member his intention with 
respect to the motion, but I am concerned that he is 
overreacting. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us look into the background of the whole issue.  During the 
cold war, effective arms control agreements between the U.S. and 
the former Soviet Union acted as a deterrent to the Soviet threat 
to deploy missiles in western Europe.  Though it never went 
beyond the theoretical stage, the American strategic defence 
initiative, SDI of the 1980s, has been acknowledged as a factor 
that forced the Soviets to the arms agreement table.  Now, 20 
years later, the United States is on the verge of deploying the 
national missile defence system, known as the NMD program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>From what little the U.S. has told the world, its current 
missile defence system proposal, the NMD, is not as grand in 
scope as the SDI.  It is more easily deployable, tactically as 
opposed to strategically focused and extremely practical. George 
W. Bush has made it clear that he endorses the program and plans 
to proceed with its implementation.  Everyone knows that he would 
like Canada to be part of that implementation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us look at the issue strategically.  The application of the 
NMD is intrinsically tied to North American aerospace defence, 
NORAD.  It was an alliance forged between Canada and the U.S. in 
1958 and has been the focal point of Canada's air defence policy 
ever since.  With headquarters in Colorado Springs, NORAD is the 
most sophisticated air surveillance system on earth and monitors 
potential airborne threats to Canada and the U.S.  It is in 
constant communication with U.S. air force and Canadian air force 
units designated as primary NORAD interception units. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Originally tracking stations in Canada along the distant early 
warning line, the DEW line, provided primary intelligence but 
were replaced by satellites in the 1980s. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1755"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT47"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Because NORAD remains charged with defending North America's 
continental air space the NMD program falls into NORAD's mandate 
and the alliance is expecting to be formally tasked with 
administering the program.  For Canada not to participate in NMD 
would be problematic to the joint intelligence, security and 
military efforts that NORAD accomplishes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How could Canada be privy to a portion of the NORAD operation 
and be excluded from NMD activities?  The tension inherent in 
such a relationship could very well cause a serious reappraisal 
of the NORAD partnership or indeed an end to the defence 
alliance.  This potential consequences would be devastating for 
Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We cannot protect our airspace, gather the degree and volume of 
intelligence currently amassed by NORAD, or provide the air force 
training opportunities currently afforded by membership in NORAD. 
In the interest of our own defence we should allow the Americans 
the opportunity to ask us how, if and when they want us to 
participate.  Moreover, we should allow them to develop their 
efforts to the point of a formal proposal before we condemn them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will indicate the reasons the Canadian Alliance believes that 
Canada should support and be an early partner in the NMD. The NMD 
is a land based system that is easily deployable and relatively 
simple in design and scope.  It is primarily tactical in scope 
and is not viewed as an absolute defence against a massive 
missile attack against North America.  It is designed to prevent 
accidents and aggression from rogue states.  It is not a grand 
strategic plan that is aimed at eradicating all missile threats 
at all times.  The NMD will not result in any escalation or 
renewal of the arms race. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore arguments that it will nullify the anti-ballistic 
missile treaty are specious since the ABM treaty can be amended 
at any time.  The NMD offers at no cost tremendous security, 
intelligence and military benefits to Canada.  Like our 
membership in NORAD where club dues are basically waived, 
participation in the NMD will not have any financial impact upon 
Canada.  Rather it will enhance, not reduce, Canadian security. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The program will proceed with or without Canadian involvement. 
We would be well advised to participate at the ground level in 
order to gain the maximum benefits possible.  Canadian military 
leaders are overwhelmingly committed to the plan, including 
Lieutenant General George MacDonald, the deputy commander of 
NORAD who sees grave consequences for Canada if we choose not to 
participate in the program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For these reasons we will endorse the plan in principle.  We 
continue to encourage the government to participate fully in the 
NMD and cease its unfortunate habit of alienating our best 
friend, closest ally and largest trading partner, the United 
States.  Canada could only benefit from this far reaching plan. 
Canada must see what the NMD system will be once fully developed. 
If it is as presented, we must support it and give the U.S. the 
benefit of the doubt while it works out options for missile 
defence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the post-cold war era there is a new, real and growing threat 
since the world is confronted with a more diverse, less 
predictable and more risk prone group of states armed with 
increasingly capable weapons of mass destruction used as tools of 
terror, blackmail and aggression. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is always a risk of an accidental or unauthorized launch 
of an existing ballistic missile.  Therefore, we as an ally of 
the U.S. have a moral imperative to allow the use of all 
reasonable tools available to deal with this threat.  Missile 
defence will be a necessary element of deterrence and an 
opportunity for a collective approach to enhancing security for 
all.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Claude Bachand (Saint-Jean, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I too would 
like to congratulate the hon. member for Burnaby—Douglas for 
instigating this debate on the space shield. He is a 
parliamentarian with a lot of experience. He does not 
hesitate to deal with core issues or often to provoke 
discussions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have to give him the credit for having initiated this debate 
on the space shield. This is not the first debate he has 
initiated, but this one is particularly important at the present 
time. This debate is just a starting point. We will need many 
more discussions over this issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The space shield is not a new issue. The hon. member 
for Burnaby—Douglas had no qualms telling me that when he was 
invited to make a speech in the House of Commons Ronald Reagan 
quipped that there was a lot of echo in the House of Commons when 
some heckling came from the NDP benches. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The position the NDP is taking today does not come as a 
surprise. It is consistent with the position it has sustained for 
many years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In those days George Lucas, a great Hollywood producer, was 
having a big box office hit with his movie <I>Star Wars</I>. Ronald 
Reagan was said to promote a kind of star wars at an 
astronomically high cost for the time. 
The cost of developing such a system would probably be just as 
astronomical today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What has been done so far? Some testing has been done. In 
fact two tests, which were far from being conclusive. 
I think the great American pride was somewhat hurt by these 
tests because they were far from being conclusive. Finally they 
were cut short so the Americans could say “It has been a 
success. We have intercepted a missile”. On the contrary, they 
missed the mark. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us look at the geopolitical issues as well as those 
regarding current treaties. Already international powers such as 
Russia and China are saying “We are party to a treaty. We often 
hear about the anti-ballistic missile or the ABM treaty, but we 
will simply withdraw from this treaty because it is our 
understanding that the defence system you are putting in place 
will give you an offensive capability, with us being unable to 
retaliate”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are important geopolitical issues to consider. It is 
the same thing with the non-proliferation treaty or NPT. 
International powers such as Russia and China say they will 
withdraw from such treaties, which means we could see a revival 
of the arms race. 
I will come back to this later, because it is important to 
understand the impact on various treaties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With regard to geographical considerations, it is normal 
that Europeans be against this project given the way it has been 
designed. By Europeans I mean the European governments. The 
private sector, and members will see where I am going with this, has 
a totally different point of view since it is aware of all the 
potential economic spinoffs this could have. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As far as the U.S. is concerned, this is an election promise 
made by its new president, George W. Bush. It is far from being 
a done deal. The United States Congress and Senate have yet to 
say they agree with this. Need I remind the House that 
there is a very small Republican majority in congress and a 
one seat Republican majority in the senate. The President of the 
United States may have some plan in mind, but he still has to 
deal with American democratic and parliamentary entities. As 
we can see, it is far from being a sure thing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have already spoken at length about Russia and China. They are 
totally against this project. The position of Canada is 
questionable. The Prime Minister travels to China and says “We 
will just have to wait and see how things will go”.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>A few weeks later he meets with President Bush and things start 
to change. He gets a little mellower and starts opening doors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The foreign affairs minister says that it is okay as long as there 
is consultation and that Russia and China agree, which basically 
means that we are against the project. There are somewhat 
contradictory indications coming from the government right now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All that to say that as far as ideology and economy are 
concerned, this debate will never be over. I remember I was a 
great pacifist and I had problems when we talked about the cruise 
missile tests over the Canadian territory. To me, it made no 
sense at all, but I had been told “Sure, but from an economic 
point of view if contracts are awarded in your constituency 
people will not be happy”. It is always the same dynamic. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member who spoke before me referred to ties with NORAD. We 
must bear in mind that the NORAD agreement provides for the joint 
defence of the North American territory. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our economy is so integrated with the American economy and there 
is such a large scale integration in our North American 
territorial defence policy with the Americans that it seems to me 
that it would be very difficult for us to stay out of all this if 
the President of the United States were to suddenly convince the 
congress and the senate to go ahead. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There would be a problem for us. However, at the moment, the 
concept is far from being clear. 
I mentioned the inconclusive tests earlier, but what concept will 
the Americans put forward?  Everybody is waiting to know. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In English we often talk about the national missile defence 
program, which is really the American missile defence program, a 
program designed only for the United States. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Americans, having noted the hesitation, are now saying that 
it could be a global anti-missile program.  What does that mean? I 
think Canada being a close neighbour of the United States 
would certainly be included.  What about European countries? 
Could the concept be expanded so that the system would protect 
all friendly territories against enemy attacks? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know nothing about the American concept. Who would be 
included in a global program?  Should Japan, Europe and Canada be 
included?  In a strictly national program, the span would be 
totally different. The existing concept is one known as balance 
of terror. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a bit of a problem with arguments like “You know, Iraq 
could launch a missile attack on the United States”. 
If it launched a single missile aimed at the United States, 
Iraq would be wiped from the face of the earth.  I fail to 
understand how there could be any mistake, with Iraq attacking 
the most powerful country in the world with a missile.  I also 
have a hard time understanding the explanations given by the 
Americans. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is clear the Americans have not totally developed their 
concept yet. They are sending trial balloons to see how their 
allies will react.  Canada has not stated its position either; it 
is taking a wait and see approach. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We in the Bloc Quebecois would like to see what is coming, what 
concept the Americans want to introduce, before saying we 
agree.  We do concede, however, as neighbours that from the 
economic point of view aerospace and aeronautics are established 
industries in Quebec.  Obviously we want to wait and see, and 
should we decide to support the Americans we will have our say. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At this point, however, I would like to ask the government one 
thing.  Our colleague has initiated the debate, but if decisions 
are to be made the government would have to commit to coming 
back to the House of Commons so that there may be a thorough 
discussion of the matter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the moment we can unfortunately not support the position of 
our colleague from Burnaby—Douglas even if we do concede that he 
has brought the matter before the House and that the discussion 
is far from over.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Casey (Cumberland—Colchester, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
this is a very controversial subject and something Canada will 
need to deal with as it goes forth.  I appreciate the hon. member 
for Burnaby—Douglas who has always been able to bring 
controversial issues to the House to ensure that they are 
discussed.  I am sure that is his purpose today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I read the motion a thought came to mind.  The motion 
reads: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That, in the opinion of this House, the government should take 
whatever measures are necessary to ensure that Canada does not 
participate in the research, development, or production of 
components for use in the proposed American National Missile 
Defence System. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I thought perhaps it should be rewritten considering how much I 
disagree with it.  I thought it would be more appropriate if it 
read: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That, in the opinion of this House, we should bury our heads even 
deeper in the sand, pretend that the real world does not exist 
and refuse to participate in the future. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are opposition critics.  I respect the member for 
Burnaby—Douglas and I know he worded the motion in such a way as 
to create controversy and generate debate, which he has done.  I 
believe that as opposition critics we should put some thought 
into these issues and make sure we have the information before we 
blindly criticize.  That is the point we are at now.  We are 
still gathering information. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is law in the U.S.  It will happen, but it will only happen 
as part of a more involved system of defence from foreign 
missiles, be they rogue missiles or missiles from other 
countries.  The United States has a tri-level plan to prevent 
missiles from harming its country and this will be only a part of 
it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not nuclear.  It is not spaced based.  It is not star 
wars.  It is not a whole lot of things that some people think it 
is.  However we still do not know a lot about it.  We are 
gathering information, and more and more information is becoming 
available all the time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Surely we should not say that we will not listen, that we will 
not look at it, that we will not consider it or that we will not 
allow our young people and scientists and technical people to 
participate in it.  We cannot blindly say no and rule it out.  In 
that way I believe the motion is wrongly placed.  It is not 
applicable, it is not practical and it is not appropriate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I have said, it is law in the U.S.  The Americans will 
proceed with it, but they have not invited Canada to participate. 
They have sent messages that they would perhaps like us to 
participate, but they have not invited us to participate at any 
senior level.  It is totally an American initiative. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It will involve a great deal of technology and research, and a 
lot of the technology and research will bridge over from missile 
defence to the civilian industry.  It would be wrong to rule it 
out without considering the impact on the civilian aerospace 
industry, which is huge in Canada and has enjoyed a $25 billion 
surplus over the last 10 years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To blindly refuse it without any basis in fact, without knowing 
anything about it, without knowing what the issues are and 
without even considering the impact on Canada is wrong in the 
opinion of members the Conservative Party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our entire aerospace industry is almost all export driven.  It 
is a key component of our export business and of our entire 
economy.  We cannot allow it to be threatened by a blind 
decision.  To say that we do not want anything to do with it no 
matter what, that we do not want to listen or participate or hear 
anything about it, is definitely wrong. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The aerospace industry in Canada employs 60,000 people and those 
people could be very much a part of it.  If it is in our interest 
we could play a key role in helping to develop the program. 
Again, if we say we are not interested in even listening or 
talking about it, the whole program and its benefits to Canada 
are doomed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Earlier I said that the national missile defence system is not 
star wars.  It is not a nuclear system.  It is not even a spaced 
based system.  It is a smaller, downgraded system from the star 
wars proposal.  It appears very practical at first look and 
certainly we will be analyzing it as it goes forward. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Norman Doyle:</B>  Where is Brian Mulroney when we need 
him? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Casey:</B>  Good question.  The Russians have 
something like 3,500 missiles they could launch on us.  This 
system will involve perhaps 100 or 200 when it is fully 
implemented. 
It is not possible to consider this part of a nuclear missile 
system or anything like it.  It is a small system that will have 
a lot of practical use and may also have benefits to Canada as 
far as economic development goes.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our position, which we are developing now, although we need to 
get more information, is that we think Canada could use this 
opportunity as a bargaining tool to encourage the United States 
government and the Russians to enter into more strategic arms 
talks to reduce nuclear arms more than they are reducing them 
now.  We are down to approximately 3,000 to 3,500 missiles per 
side.  Perhaps we could use this opportunity to get them to start 
anti-ballistic missile talks, START talks, to try to get them to 
agree to a level of maybe 1,000 or 1,500 as a condition of being 
involved with this program.  We will be presenting that position 
to the government when we get more information on the exact 
details of the proposal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In summary, we are not widely opposed to this.  Our minds are 
open and we want to base our decisions on the facts when they 
become available.  When that happens, we will base our decision 
on facts.  In the meantime, we are going to encourage the 
government to use this as a bargaining tool to try to really do 
something positive in the missile defence system and the 
anti-missile defence talks because there is an opportunity now to 
do that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our position is that of having an open mind.  I would have to 
say that we are leaning in favour of it because of the tremendous 
benefits from technology, from training and from experience.  To 
just say that we are not going to be involved with any of this 
will turn the brain drain into the brain train.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to have an opportunity to participate in the debate this 
evening.  I want to congratulate my colleague from 
Burnaby—Douglas for introducing the motion and launching a very 
important debate around the sheer madness of Canada being 
associated in any way, shape or form with the proposed U.S. 
national missile defence system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before I get to the position of the government or, I guess more 
accurately, the non-position of the government, I want to just 
say a word or two about what I have heard from the other parties 
in the debate this evening. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I suppose it is not surprising that we hear from the Alliance 
the same usual knee-jerk, uncritical embracing of American 
defence initiatives.  According to the Alliance, we want to 
Americanize our political system, Americanize our economy and 
certainly Americanize our health care system and our education 
system.  Why would anybody be surprised at the Alliance's 
commitment to further throw in our lot with American defence 
initiatives, no matter how mad and irresponsible they really are? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have to say I was somewhat more disappointed and frankly 
surprised at what I heard from the Bloc member who essentially 
said “Actually, I tend to be a bit of a pacifist myself but gee, 
what can you do?  It is going to happen anyway”.  Besides, said 
the member, there might be some economic advantages to us if we 
get in on this madness that has been condemned from every corner 
of the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again, I am not entirely surprised.  Maybe it underscores the 
basis for some reuniting of the Alliance and Tory interests here. 
Essentially, we have an uncritical view coming from the Tory 
Party as well, which I think is disappointing and really an 
abandonment of what one has from time to time seen of a more 
enlightened nature from this party on similar issues in the past. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to turn now to the government's position or, as I say, 
non-position.  What is that position?  Essentially the government 
claims that it does not yet know enough to take a position.  What 
is it about the government that it is so committed to sitting 
squarely and firmly on the picket fence on an issue such as this 
one, which cries out for leadership?  The excuse given is that 
the government does not really know enough yet or that it does 
not really know whether the technology is going to work.  For the 
love of God, what does this mean?

<A HREF="#LINKT52"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why is it that the German defence minister was absolutely 
unequivocal in stating that Germany was not prepared to be part 
of what essentially becomes the dismantling of the international 
architecture of arms control?  That is the implication of going 
ahead with the national missile defence system.  It has been 
recognized that what will absolutely go up in smoke is the 1972 
anti-ballistic missile treaty.  That is the architecture. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know some have said that it is sort of an old treaty since it 
is from 1972, but we heard the member for Burnaby—Douglas remind 
us again that as recently as May 2000, I believe, 187 countries, 
including, by the way, the U.S. and Russia, all acknowledged that 
we have to build on that anti-ballistic missile treaty in order 
to move forward with meaningful disarmament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is it that makes it impossible for the government to take a 
moral stand here when we see, for example, that the prime 
minister of Italy had no difficulty in saying that he had enough 
information?  He was persuaded on the basis of what we know: that 
the NMD poses a risk to the indivisibility of NATO.  In February, 
the French president, Jacques Chirac, said very clearly that the 
NMD cannot fail to relaunch the arms race in the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How much more do we need to know than that every major peace 
group in the world and major research bodies have clearly taken a 
stand that this is madness?  We used to have a tradition in this 
country.  We had a deserved reputation for taking leadership in 
such matters.  What happened to the Pearsonian tradition?  What 
happened such that Canada is willing to cower and to hide out 
from taking leadership on something that literally threatens to 
relaunch a major arms race in the world and threatens the future 
of peace and security worldwide? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I appeal to those members who are sort of playing around with 
this as if it were star wars.  I have to say that one of the 
difficulties with the image, which was made to stick to the 
Reagan era but is now out there as a sort of questionable 
description of what the NMB would mean for the future of the 
human race, is that we now have a whole generation of young 
people, and actually I think the whole Canadian population, who 
actually think that star wars is something that is just in the 
movies.  It has a kind of positive notion about it.  There is 
nothing positive about a proposal of the U.S.A. to relaunch 
nuclear proliferation and to relaunch a massive arms race, 
because once the 1972 anti-ballistic missile treaty goes up in 
smoke, then we are talking about a free-for-all.  We simply have 
to re-establish Canada as a leader in these matters.  The 
government has congratulated itself, with good reason, for taking 
some leadership on the issue of landmines. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me make this my final point.  Surely if government members 
will not listen to the pleas of opposition members, major 
scientists, other leaders and peace activists around the world, 
would they not be willing to listen to the pleadings of the 
former minister of international affairs in the government, the 
Hon. Lloyd Axworthy, who now has thrown off the shackles of being 
part of the madness of this Liberal government?  He is prepared 
to take a stand and say that we must not be part of this madness. 
I appeal to members to listen to that message.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Svend Robinson (Burnaby—Douglas, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I thank all of those who participated in this debate.  In 
particular, of course, I thank my colleague, the leader of the 
New Democratic Party, the member for Halifax, for her comments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I must say I was very saddened to note that spokespersons from 
each of the other parties all spoke out in opposition to this 
motion. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Frankly I was astonished by the position expressed by the 
spokesperson for the Bloc Quebecois.  He has said very clearly 
that the space shield exists and that Quebec wants to profit from 
contracts arising out of Canada-U.S. co-operation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is going on with members of the Bloc Quebecois?  In the past they were 
occasionally the voice of progress, but now they are speaking out 
in support of the spate shield because of the profits it will 
bring?  This is truly shameful and unacceptable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I recall that in the past they also supported France's nuclear 
testing. I presume that was for the same reason. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is very interesting to note that two weeks ago today the 
Minister of Foreign Affairs, speaking from Brussels, said that 
there was some urgency to the community of nations making their 
views known with respect to the proposed national missile defence 
system.  He said in an interview from a NATO meeting: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think the message there is that those of us who feel we should 
influence what comes out ought to be talking to them now. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>He went on to say: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think they are very much at the stage now of really putting 
their facts together and deciding what their plans are and what 
their options are and now is the time for their allies to 
indicate what their concerns or interests may be. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>For heaven's sake, that is exactly what we are appealing to the 
government to do.  It should get off the fence, as the leader of 
my party said, and make our views known now clearly and 
unequivocally to our allies that this is unacceptable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have heard talk about NORAD and Canada's involvement in 
NORAD.  I sometimes wonder when I hear this talk whether this is 
not the desperate pleas of the generals and the arms 
manufacturers to allow them to continue their jobs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is the enemy?  Surely to goodness the real enemies that we 
should be confronting are the enemies of environmental 
destruction, of poverty, of homelessness and of injustice, not 
these theoretical enemies that NORAD has created to try to 
counter.  That is why we have said that Canada should be 
strengthening our position within the United Nations and not 
working within this absurd and outdated framework. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleague referred to the words of the former Minister of 
Foreign Affairs, Lloyd Axworthy.  I want to refer to the very 
eloquent words of a member of the House of long standing, the 
member for Davenport, who spoke out very recently in opposition 
to the national missile defence and appealed to his own 
government to take a stand. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He talked about the fact that this so-called rogue state 
scenario was in fact ludicrous.  He said that this absurd 
hypothesis omitted the fact that none of these states had nuclear 
weapons nor long range missiles, that these countries were very 
poor, and that their leaders did not want to provoke retaliation. 
Moreover, experts agreed that terrorist attacks, weapons stuffed 
in briefcases or trailer trucks, posed a greater danger to 
national security than ballistic rockets. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I appeal to the members on the government side to listen to 
their colleague from Davenport who has pleaded with his 
government to say no, to take a clear stand now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Medical students in British Columbia have just launched a 
campaign called www.bombsaway.ca, appealing to the government to 
speak out against missile defence.  They said the nuclear arms 
race is one of the greatest threats to global health and 
security. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>New Democrats strongly support the attempts to try to convince 
the government to say no to NMD and to say yes to the abolition 
of all weapons of mass destruction, including nuclear weapons. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Bélair):</B> The time provided for the 
consideration of private members' business has now expired.  The 
motion was not selected as a votable item and is therefore 
dropped from the order paper. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have also been informed that there will be no proceedings on 
the motion to adjourn the House this evening. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It being 6.30 p.m., the House stands adjourned until tomorrow 
at 10 a.m., pursuant to Standing Order 24(1).
