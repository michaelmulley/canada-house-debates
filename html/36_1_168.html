local and regional museums has declined from 29% to 5% over the 
last decade and because many regional and local museums in Canada 
are facing financial shortages so severe that the preservation of 
their artifacts is in question, the people of Dartmouth call on 
the House to urge the Minister of Canadian Heritage to restore 
the federal government funding level for regional and local 
museums to at least the level of 1998.

possible legislation by listening to Canadians, learning from 
their input and taking the appropriate action. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our government issued a major proposal, then we revised it to 
reflect what we heard.  We put forward a second proposal and 
again improved it after listening to people from every corner of 
the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Three times we went back to the provinces, to the territories, 
to members of parliament, to tax experts, to the customs and 
trade professionals and organizations.  We established a special 
advisory committee to provide ongoing comments.  We received 
input from close to 10,000 of our employees. What started out as 
a sound concept has become even a better piece of legislation 
which reflects what people told us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There have been many important improvements to the original 
proposal and those improvements flowed directly from those 
citizens who thought about the bill and offered up some better 
thinking. I strongly believe this is a fine bill and I thank 
those Canadians who gave their time, their wisdom and their 
insights to making it so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know my friends from the opposition will argue during this 
debate that we still have not consulted enough.  Let me quote Mr. 
Garth Whyte, vice-president of the Canadian Federation of 
Independent Business, when asked about more consultation in the 
committee hearings: “We have been consulted to death”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The simple truth is that the CFIB wants this bill passed.  The 
Canadian Institute of Chartered Accountants wants this bill 
passed.  The Canadian Bar Association wants this bill passed. 
The Canadian Tax Foundation wants this bill passed.  The Canadian 
Importers Association supports this legislation.  The Tax 
Executives Institute support this legislation.  The Canadian 
Society of Custom Brokers supports this legislation.  L'Association 
de Planification Fiscale et Financière supports this 
legislation. The Canadians Alliance of Manufacturers and 
Exporters supports this legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reasons for this broad range of support are really quite 
simple.  First, a new Canada customs and revenue agency makes 
plain, ordinary, everyday common sense.  Second, the bill 
constructively addresses all the serious issues raised by 
Canadians during these three rounds of consultations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to touch on both these matters, why a customs and 
revenue agency makes sense and how we have improved the bill, and 
explain why this agency is a sensible idea.  I do not want to 
throw out a lot of complex jargon. I would rather relate some 
real life experiences. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Take for instance overlap and duplication.  Take for instance 
red tape for small businesses.  I was in business for 20 years 
before I went into politics.  I remember having to deal with an 
auditor for workers compensation asking the same questions, going 
through the same books as another auditor for payroll deductions. 
That auditor went through the same process as another auditor 
for provincial sales tax. That auditor in turn went through the 
same process as an auditor for the GST. What a waste of talented 
professional auditors.  What a time consuming waste for business 
people.

<A HREF="#LINKT3"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Everybody talks about wanting to get rid of overlap and 
duplication and we hear that every day in the House from members 
over there, all the time.  We hear it from the provinces every 
single day.  We hear it from small businesses.  We hear it from 
individual Canadians.  Everyone talks about wanting to reduce the 
paper burden and compliance costs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This legislation is a real life opportunity to turn all that 
talk into action because everybody understands there is only one 
level of taxpayer, so let us move toward creating a single window 
tax collection. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians want governments to work together for their citizens. 
They do not want to build a parallel tax system across the 
country.  Canadians have said that repeatedly.  Every place I go 
business people tell me they spend too much time and money 
dealing with governments.  I believe we should allow them to do 
what they do best, create products and jobs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is something else I hear from every Canadian of every 
political stripe.  They said quit wasting money.  Spend taxpayer 
money wisely.  Get governments to work together to cut costs and 
streamline the process.  The new agency makes plain, ordinary, 
everyday sense. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Do not listen to me.  Listen to other Canadians.  Let me quote 
from the presentation of the highly respected public policy forum 
before the finance committee: “ The compliance cost saving from 
a single administration would be between $171 million and $285 
million.  As well, we estimate administrative cost savings in the 
range of $97 million to $162 million”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The creation and successful implementation of a new agency can 
save hundreds of millions of dollars for Canadians.  Why on earth 
would we want to spend all that extra money on the process of 
collecting taxes when it could be put to so much more productive 
use ending overlap and duplication, cutting red tape and saving 
huge amounts of money?  Those are all compelling reasons for 
creating a new agency. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are still other strong reasons, technology for one. It 
takes a split second to transfer funds from St. John's to 
Victoria.  The power of computers is doubling every 18 months. 
Electronic commerce is growing enormously and yet it can take a 
full year to hire a government auditor. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We simply have to modernize that system.  We have to design 
faster and fairer staffing procedures.  We need a system that can 
keep pace with the ever changing world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The new agency will take advantage of new technologies to reduce 
paperwork, speed up decisions, keep employees and our clients, 
individual Canadians, travellers and businesses, satisfied. 
Technology is forcing us to make choices.  Each province and 
territory can spend vast sums in creating its own software and 
computer systems. Or we have a choice, we can work together to 
produce those systems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the province of British Columbia decided to add the B.C. 
family bonus it could have built a whole new infrastructure, a 
whole new software system and it would have cost tens of millions 
of dollars. Instead it came to the federal government.  We were 
able to deliver that program for a little over $2 million.  That 
is working together.  That is working smarter for the citizens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Within two years $400 billion of business will be done on the 
Internet around the world.  Of that, $13 billion will be done in 
Canada.  Do we really want 12 different Canadian systems trying 
to collect the taxes on these transactions like the people in the 
Bloc want to do?  Does that make sense, 12 different systems for 
business to deal with? 
We should be working together on a national basis to develop new 
programs that make it easier for taxpayers to file over the 
Internet or over the phone.  We should be working together to 
develop the world's finest software for privacy protection.  We 
should be working as one to spend limited resources to guarantee 
that technology serves the interest of Canada and the interest of 
Canadian taxpayers.  Working together to serve the interest of 
Canadians makes sense.

</I></B></P><P align=left>We are creating the new Canada customs and revenue agency with 
the goal of forging new partnerships with the provinces.  We are 
making a very serious effort to reach out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill is about providing more options to the provinces, 
giving them alternatives that can better serve the public 
interest.  The provinces and territories will have the right to 
nominate people for 11 of the 15 positions on the agency's board 
of management. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I must emphasize that the participation of the provinces is 
completely voluntary. The provinces will maintain control over 
provincial tax policy while the new agency will administer these 
policies.  This means that a province or territory will retain 
full authority over the tax and will be accountable to its 
taxpayers for it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The opposition parties seem fairly worked up by the fact we are 
moving to pass this legislation without having the provinces on 
board.  I have met with the provinces.  I have met them on a 
number of occasions.  They all have supported the concept and we 
will work closely with them.  But I am a realist.  I know that we 
will have to work hard to earn the provinces' business.  Frankly, 
I do not mind if the provinces want to kick the tires of the new 
agency or take it for a test drive.  It will be a lot easier for 
them to buy into something that is a real entity than a proposal 
on paper. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Garth Whyte said for the CFIB: “If we wait for everybody to 
come on side it never gets done”.  We have lots of examples. 
When we try to get everybody on board it never gets done.  We 
have to move on and show leadership. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Blair Nixon of the Canadian Bar Association said: “Go 
forward.  Pass it and let the agency convince those who are going 
to be able to enjoy the efficiencies”.   Mr. Robert Spindler, 
representing our country's chartered accountants stated: “It is 
usually better to start the process and then draw people in 
rather than to turn it around and wait for the people to come and 
then develop the system.  The agency represents an opportunity. 
Having the infrastructure at least allows that opportunity”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This legislation provides for a uniquely Canadian model for 
customs and revenue administration, a model rooted in a 
non-partisan public service, a model based on partnership with 
the provinces, a model respectful of our Canadian parliamentary 
traditions, a model premised above all on fairness for Canadians 
and service to Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On every major front the concept of a new agency makes plain, 
ordinary, everyday common sense.  But as I indicated, the bill 
before the House is far superior to the original plan. We have, 
for example, removed provisions that would have allowed for the 
imposition of user fees without the approval of elected 
officials.  We have acted to guarantee that Canadians will 
receive service anywhere in Canada in the official language of 
their choice.  We have ensured the agency will have the 
flexibility to deal with the fundamental personnel issues of 
hiring, training and retaining quality employees. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Most important, we have acted to strengthen ministerial 
accountability.  Over and over again I heard from Canadians that 
political accountability is absolutely paramount if we want to 
guarantee fairness to Canadians.  Individuals and organizations 
alike were adamant that the Minister of National Revenue retain 
the primary stewardship role. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I took that message very much to heart.  As I have said time and 
time again, the bill does not mean the agency will not be part of 
the government.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The new Canada customs and revenue agency will remain proudly in 
the public service of Canada and a strong federal agency.  For 
example, whenever a member of parliament wants me to inquire into 
the fairness of how a specific case is handled, I will have the 
power to do so.  I will respond directly to them, as I do now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me be crystal clear about the accountability measures 
contained in this bill.  The Minister of National Revenue will be 
fully accountable to parliament.  The Auditor General of Canada 
will audit the agency's books and the agency's work.  A corporate 
business plan must be submitted to the minister for Treasury 
Board for approval.  The minister will submit an annual report on 
its operations to parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is also a mandatory review of recourse mechanisms by a 
third party after three years, as provided in section 59 of the 
bill.  A summary of the results will be included in the agency's 
annual report to parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Public Service Commission can review and report on the 
agency's staffing procedures. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Parliament will conduct a legislative review in five years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>No private sector member of the board of management will have 
access to any file of any taxpayer.  Only the minister will have 
that oversight power. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the Canadian Federation of Independent Business told the 
finance committee of this House less than two weeks ago, “Bill 
C-43 addresses the main concerns of political accountability, 
privacy and provincial autonomy identified by our members”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the Institute of Chartered Accountants told the same 
committee: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is clear that comments provided... during the consultations, 
were heard and taken into account.  We're pleased to see that 
under Bill C-43, the Minister of Revenue will retain 
responsibility for this Agency and it will be structured to allow 
for close Ministerial oversight and, in particular, that the 
Minister's power of inquiry into any activity of the Agency will 
be maintained. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As both the bar association and the tax foundation put it to the 
same committee, “We support the initiative currently being 
advanced by this government”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The people on this side of the House consult with Canadians, 
they listen to Canadians and they respond, just as we have in 
this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As much as I welcome such serious backing for this bill, I am 
well aware that the creation of the agency is only the beginning 
of the process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Earning the trust of as many provinces as possible is essential. 
I am trying to do that by building a better framework. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Ensuring fairness for every single taxpayer is also very 
critical.  That will be my priority every hour of every day. 
Canadians deserve nothing less. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Treating our incredibly dedicated employees with understanding 
and empathy is vital.  I know some of them are a bit apprehensive 
about change.  I will do my very best to make the transition as 
easy as possible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Safeguarding the faith of Canadians in our tax system is of the 
utmost importance.  That, after all, is what makes it all work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I promise the members of the House that, regardless of what 
happens to this bill, I will soon come forward with a fairness 
action plan and I will deliver on my word. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I intend to continue seeking advice from the vast range of 
Canadians on means to improve service to taxpayers.  With the 
help of members of parliament from all parties, I will act on 
that advice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The truth is that I feel deeply honoured to be the trustee of 
Canada's tax system.  It is a fine and honourable system held in 
high regard around the world.  It is an amazing system premised 
on honesty, voluntary assessment and fair payment of taxes owing. 
It is a system upheld by public servants of hard work and 
decency. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The job of every member of parliament is to take the necessary 
steps to make a great system even better.  The job of every 
member of parliament is to ensure that our tax system is 
unquestionably the world's finest and fairest, and that it 
remains so.  Our job is to take the necessary steps to seize the 
opportunities and meet the challenges of the modern era.  Our job 
is to eliminate the red tape, chop away the overlap, cut wasteful 
costs, build new partnerships, take advantage of technology, make 
the most of far-sighted management practices, offer better 
service and make the system work to Canada's advantage.

</I></B></P><P align=left>This legislation is a major step in that direction.  This 
legislation is a major step forward.  This bill is all about 
providing better service to the provinces and the territories, to 
businesses and, most importantly, to individual Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know that my friends in the opposition will want to mount 
vigorous criticisms of this bill.  I respect that.  I do not 
understand it, but it is the bedrock of democracy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the end of the day, however, I urge all members of parliament 
to remember three simple facts.  First, there is only one level 
of taxpayer in Canada.  Second, this bill has massive support 
from a wide range of Canadians.  Third, this bill makes plain, 
ordinary, everyday sense to Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the end, this bill is not about politics.  It is about doing 
something positive for Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I urge members of the House of Commons to vote yes to this bill 
and to do this with genuine enthusiasm. 
<P><A NAME="LINK37"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jason Kenney (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I would like to congratulate the minister on finally having his 
bill brought before us at third reading.  Unfortunately, it came 
before us after time allocation was invoked at each stage of the 
bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister said that this bill respects the finest traditions 
of the parliamentary system.  If that is the case, then why did 
he cut short democracy?  Why did he cut short democratic 
deliberation when it came to this bill? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can tell the House why.  It is because for months he was not 
able to get any degree of precedence or priority for this bill 
from the government House leader or from those who manage the 
government's legislative agenda.  Suddenly they were seized with 
an urgency to ram this bill through before the Christmas break 
and they invoked time allocation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government announced its intention to invoke time allocation 
on both report stage and third reading only two hours into the 
debate.  I must say that while I commend the minister for the 
work that he, his officials and his parliamentary secretary have 
put into this bill, I think it is disappointing, to say the 
least, that the government has, in passing such a critically 
important piece of legislation, so carelessly and callously 
disregarded the best traditions of democratic deliberation in 
this place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister spoke at some length about the degree of 
consultation which was exercised in the development of Bill C-43, 
an act to establish the Canada customs and revenue agency.  I 
would concur with him that his officials did a fine job in 
consulting, particularly on the technical aspects of the bill, 
with traditional interest groups like some of those he mentioned 
which have a great deal of familiarity with the tax laws and 
their application. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also commend the minister and his officials for having 
taken to heart some of the constructive criticisms that were 
levelled at earlier versions of his bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, I would point out to the minister that his 
consultations fell far short when it came to the kind of 
democratic, political and public consultations which ought to 
surround any important piece of legislation such as this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is fine and well to set up an advisory board of technical 
experts who are extremely familiar with the Byzantine 1,300 page 
tax code and its associated regulations, and to sit around and 
talk with Revenue Canada union officials and people in the 
department about the framing of legislation of this nature, but 
that merely leaves about 30 million Canadians out of the process 
of consultation. 
This is where we think the minister and the government have 
completely failed to consult deeply and broadly with respect to 
the implications of this bill.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I suspect that some day when this bill is proclaimed and this 
new Canada customs and revenue agency comes into effect, there 
will be a sudden flurry of news stories in the media regarding 
the creation of this new agency and the passage into history of 
Revenue Canada.  Canadians will suddenly wake up startled, 
wondering what is going on.  I submit that the vast majority of 
taxpaying Canadians have little or no idea that this rather 
dramatic proposal has been made and will probably be adopted by 
the House tonight. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think that it would have behoved the minister and the 
government to have consulted far more broadly and deeply with 
grassroots Canadians.  I think it would have behoved government 
members to have voted for a Reform motion at the finance 
committee which sought to extend hearings beyond the two or three 
days on which hearings were held, to extend hearings across the 
country, to allow Canadians in communities across our country, 
those who work in Revenue Canada, those who are ordinary 
taxpayers and those who have concerns about the administration of 
the tax laws, to appear before us to prolong the debate so that 
this rather dramatic change was not suddenly sprung upon them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am also disturbed that the government did not, with respect to 
consultation, take at all seriously some of the very thoughtful 
and substantive amendments put forward by the opposition.  I will 
grant that my colleagues in the Bloc Quebecois put forward a 
number of dilatory amendments to essentially strike every clause 
of the bill.  In a sense they were provoking the government into 
time allocation.  However, I would submit that there were some 
very substantive and sensible amendments put forward at report 
stage by the official opposition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister talked about common sense.  Where was the common 
sense in the government voting against our Motion No. 7?  Among 
other things, that motion would have inserted words like “the 
legislation should be enforced in a manner that respects the 
principles of fairness, impartiality and accountability”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why in the world did government members stand in this place last 
night to vote against ensuring that the legislation be enforced 
in a manner that respects fairness, impartiality and 
accountability?  Are they against fairness, impartiality and 
accountability in this legislation? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It escapes me as to why the government voted against a motion to 
ensure that any new powers granted to the agency could only be 
granted by parliament and not simply by the cabinet through order 
in council.  Why did the government vote against a motion to 
restrict this granting of further powers to this parliament and 
to remove the carte blanche power of the cabinet to grant such 
powers to the new agency? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These and other substantive motions which we put forward were 
voted down without apparently even a moment's consideration on 
the part of the government, which again causes me to question the 
sincerity of the minister's remarks with respect to consultation, 
listening to Canadians and following the debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Having said all of that about process—and I really do find it 
disappointing—let me say that there are certain redeeming 
aspects to this legislation.  We in the official opposition have 
been quite consistent in pointing out that we feel there are 
certain incremental gains to be found in the kind of corporate 
culture of the new revenue agency which this bill envisions.  We 
believe that it would be an improvement over the status quo for 
this new revenue agency to be released from the kind of 
burdensome, bureaucratic, inefficient, cookie-cutter style 
personnel and human resource policies enforced on it by the 
regulations of the Treasury Board and public service legislation. 
Creating greater flexibility in the revenue agency's management, 
hiring and personnel practices we think is a positive step 
forward.

<A HREF="#LINKT8"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, the gains to be made in terms of flexibility of human 
resources management would allow the new agency among other 
things to pay some of its people on the basis of merit.  It would 
allow the new agency to pay some of its senior highly skilled 
auditors competitive salaries vis-à-vis the private sector.  All 
of these improvements could be achieved without Revenue Canada 
metamorphosing itself into an agency. It simply is not necessary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Other opposition members and I have made the point again and 
again in the House and at committee that if the government simply 
wanted greater flexibility in hiring, firing and paying people, 
it could have done that without moving to an agency and without 
the bill that is before us today.  The government did not need to 
create a new level of bureaucracy through the adoption of a 
commissioner and a patronage appointed board of directors. The 
government could have achieved the personnel efficiencies without 
potentially diminishing parliamentary accountability through the 
minister to parliament.  It could have achieved these things 
simply by amending the statutes that govern personnel in the 
public sector. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is not just my view.  It is the view of the Canadian Tax 
Foundation which published an article suggesting that was a 
possibility.  It is the view of the Library of Parliament, which 
produced an opinion for us that confirmed various amendments to 
existing statutes could have achieved the desired objective of 
greater flexibility in personnel management.  I want to be 
absolutely clear for the record.  That alleged rationale simply 
does not hold up. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another rationale which the government presented for this 
legislation was that it would create greater efficiency through 
the removal of much of the current overlap and duplication 
between the provincial and federal governments in tax collection 
and administration.  The bill would concurrently reduce 
compliance costs for businesses which today must fill out tax 
forms and in some provinces must comply with two separate tax 
bureaucracies. The government argues sensibly that compliance 
costs would be reduced under a single tax agency since the 
business taxpayer would only have to fill out one corporate tax 
form as opposed to two. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government solicited an opinion from the Public Policy Forum 
which indicated there would be a potential savings to the economy 
of a couple of hundred million dollars through reductions in 
compliance costs if all 10 provinces were to participate in the 
agency proposal. That is the big caveat.  The government has 
thrown around this argument about efficiency gains and reduced 
compliance costs and at the same time it has not told Canadians 
this requires the full, complete, unanimous participation of all 
10 provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is absolutely evident to all with eyes to see that this 
agency does not have the support of all 10 provinces or even a 
majority of provinces or even a single province, at least as of 
this date.  We know of only one province.  The Government of Nova 
Scotia has indicated its willingness to participate in a very 
modest way with this new agency through the administration of its 
workers compensation system.  The Government of Nova Scotia could 
very easily have contracted with Revenue Canada to assist it with 
its WCB system under the current departmental model of Revenue 
Canada.  Bill C-43 is completely unnecessary to achieve the 
objectives of such provinces as Nova Scotia participating on the 
WCB front. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What do we see as we look across the country from Newfoundland 
and Labrador to British Columbia?  After nearly two years of 
consultation and pressure and lobbying on the part of the 
Minister of National Revenue, at least nine provinces have 
indicated that they are not prepared to sign on to this new 
agency. 
The minister and government members will say that the provinces 
have not said that they are opposed to the idea.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Certainly the Government of Quebec has indicated that it has 
absolutely no interest whatsoever in any circumstances of ceding 
tax collection authority to this new federal agency. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The province of Ontario has indicated publicly and to me in 
writing through the Minister of Finance, Mr. Eves, that it has no 
particular interest at this point.  The Government of Ontario has 
suggested that it is looking at greater flexibility, not greater 
federal control over its tax collection and tax policies through 
the possible opting out of the federal-provincial income tax 
collection agreements and the adoption of a tax on income process 
as opposed to the tax on tax which currently exists. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Similarly the province of Alberta and its provincial treasurer 
Mr. Day have indicated that they really have no interest in this, 
at least at this point.  The province of Alberta is looking at 
some rather dramatic changes in tax policy which would perhaps 
preclude any efficiencies gained by participating with a single 
revenue agency such as the one proposed in this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we look across the country we see at least three provinces 
which seem to be out of the game and we see six or seven other 
provinces which are not really interested but have not yet closed 
the door.  Why is the government proceeding with legislation 
which is predicated on the participation of the provinces whose 
basic rationale is co-operation between the provincial and 
federal governments, when the other partners, that is to say the 
10 provinces, have not yet offered to participate and have not 
yet agreed to engage in this new agency? This is a legitimate 
question and one which the minister has not yet provided an 
adequate answer to. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to flexibility of personnel management and human 
resources and with respect to efficiency through the reduction of 
overlap, duplication and compliance costs, we see that the 
government has not made its case. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Having said those things, I think the basic structure of the 
bill is not malignant.  As I mentioned, there are incremental 
improvements in public sector administration which could be 
achieved through other statutes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me add parenthetically that the changes to employment 
practices contemplated by this bill could very easily be and 
ought to be applied to every department of the government. The 
minister has made a compelling case that the current Treasury 
Board guidelines with respect to the employment of public 
servants are far too rigid and far too bureaucratic and do not 
create a culture of efficiency in the revenue department. If that 
is the case in the revenue department, as I believe it to be, 
then equally it is the case in other government departments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would ask the government why it is prepared to change the 
personnel regime with respect to Revenue Canada, the largest 
government department which employs approximately 40,000 to 
45,000 individuals, but it is not prepared to apply the same 
principles of personnel management to every department of 
government.  Why is the government not prepared to do what the 
Government of the United Kingdom has done with respect to its 
agencies?  Why is the government not prepared to do what the 
Government of New Zealand has done with respect to the 
corporatization of the public sector there? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We could apply these same principles elsewhere without 
diminishing parliamentary accountability if this legislation is 
crafted properly.  It makes very little sense for the government 
to be myopically focused on one department while leaving the rest 
of the public service in the current strictures of the Treasury 
Board rules. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our principal concern on Bill C-43 is the potential for 
diminished parliamentary accountability, for accountability to 
Canadian taxpayers who after all are the people who really hold 
sovereignty in this country.  These are the people who day after 
day put in an honest day's work and come home to find that up to 
half of their paycheque has been consumed by politicians and 
bureaucrats at all three levels of government. 
These are Canadians, the vast majority of whom are honest, 
law-abiding taxpayers who want to comply with the tax laws.  They 
want to pay their fair share but they have felt increasingly over 
the past years that they are paying more than their fair share.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The average Canadian is working harder today than he or she ever 
has before in Canadian history.  Statistics Canada tells us that 
the average Canadian family now works longer hours and more hours 
with more two income families than at any point previously in our 
history, yet they are coming home with less money in their 
pockets after tax.  Why?  Not because they are not working hard 
enough, not because people in the private sector economy are not 
taking enough risks, but it is because governments continue to 
consume a larger and larger percentage of the fruits of the 
labours of Canadian taxpayers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Revenue Canada every business day collects roughly a billion 
dollars. That is a billion dollars sucked out, hoovered out of 
the pockets of Canadian taxpayers.  I see even you are 
flabbergasted, Mr. Speaker.  It is remarkable.  We sit here in 
this place thinking that this is sort of commonplace; we 
authorize another spending bill, authorize another tax bill and 
sooner or later it all adds up. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is not my figure.  It is the figure of the minister of 
revenue.  He is quite proud of boasting that his department 
collects a billion dollars each business day.  It is about $120 
billion that is collected in normal revenues, the gross revenues 
of the GST plus corporate tax revenues.  The figure is enormous. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the end of the day, Canadians are telling us that they are 
paying too much tax, that the tax system is too complex.  Too 
often when they are dealing with Revenue Canada, they feel guilty 
until proven innocent under the current tax system. That is just 
plain wrong. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A voluntary system such as ours which relies on voluntary 
compliance requires the absolute trust of taxpayers in the 
collection system.  The moment that trust is impugned, the moment 
Canadians lose trust in the tax collection process, the basis of 
a voluntary compliance system is thrown into question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why we need to be absolutely certain in debating this 
bill that the agency we are creating enhances and does not 
diminish the trust between the taxpayer and the tax collector. It 
is why we must be absolutely clear that this bill strengthens 
rather than weakens the accountability of the tax collectors in 
this agency to taxpayers through their elected representatives in 
this parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It would be a grave error were we to adopt a bill which included 
even the possibility, the mere potential of a diminishment of 
parliamentary accountability of the tax collecting agency and 
that accountability through this parliament to taxpayers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Parliament came into being as members well know largely as a 
result of the tension between the commoners, the taxpayers in 
earlier parts of our history and the crown.  Parliament 
essentially became the body which ensured that the taxes 
collected by the crown were done so in a fair, legal and 
democratic way.  It ensured that no one, including the monarch, 
was above the law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>And here we are today contemplating the passage of a bill that 
will give the executive branch of government further enormous 
power in tax collection through this agency and has the potential 
of diminishing parliamentary accountability. The minister will 
say that he remains responsible for the revenue agency under this 
bill and that therefore the accountability could not possibly be 
diminished.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Among other substantive amendments put forward by the opposition 
last night, the government voted against a motion in my name 
saying that the minister was responsible for “all aspects of the 
revenue agency”.  We simply wanted some minor amendments to 
clarify that the minister would be responsible for all aspects of 
the agency because the bill is unclear about that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill gives responsibility to the minister in section 6, but 
later it gives responsibility for the agency to a board of 
management in section 14.  Even later it gives responsibility to 
a chair in section 22, and in later sections of the bill it gives 
responsibility to a commissioner. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government says these are different kinds of responsibility 
that will be exercised in different ways.  I do not understand 
that bureaucratic bafflegab.  All I understand is that the bill 
takes responsibility, which today is completely in the hands of 
the minister who is accountable to the House and through the 
House to millions of Canadian taxpayers, and delegates it to a 
board of patronage appointees, to a commissioner appointed by 
cabinet and to this agency.  Where does the buck stop?  It is not 
absolutely clear. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is with the very grave concern of diminished accountability 
that we in the official opposition have proposed a series of 
amendments which would enshrine due process in the tax collection 
administration of the government.   We have proposed a taxpayer 
bill of rights and the creation of an office for taxpayer 
protection, which we say would strengthen and deepen 
accountability rather than diminish it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why is that necessary?  I have talked about the theoretical 
argument that tax collection is an awesome power.  Next to the 
criminal law power that we wield in parliament, the power to 
collect taxes is the most significant and potentially destructive 
power.  Some have said that the power to tax is the power to 
destroy.  It is an awesome power that we wield here.  It is an 
awesome power that we grant to officials of the revenue 
department and the future revenue agency to exercise on our 
behalf, on behalf of the crown and parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Sometimes, believe it or not, that power is abused.  The 
Minister of Revenue thinks his department and all his 45,000 
officials are completely above and beyond reproach.  I have no 
doubt that most of them are, but I equally have no doubt that 
from time to time, in fact every day, honest, law-abiding, 
voluntarily complying Canadian taxpayers find themselves harassed 
by overzealous, non-compassionate and out of control tax 
bureaucrats. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Every member of the House, I am sure, has faced case files from 
constituents who have done everything according to the law, 
everything ethically, exercised due diligence and have 
nevertheless found themselves getting the short end of the stick 
from Revenue Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I raise the matter, for instance, of Mrs. Suzanne Thiessen from 
Winnipeg.  I have raised this matter before in question period 
and elsewhere.  Suzanne Thiessen is a Manitoba taxpayer who found 
last year that she had to make an insurance claim with the 
Manitoba Public Insurance Corporation, the MPIC.  She discovered 
that somehow, without her authorization, the Manitoba Public 
Insurance Corporation had obtained confidential knowledge from 
her tax returns to the MPIC. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How does it happen?  The minister says that confidentiality will 
not be compromised by the bill.  He says it is not by the current 
department, but we know that is not the case because I have 
received through the Thiessens and others over half a dozen files 
of individuals in Manitoba who had their confidential tax 
information leaked by Revenue Canada to that provincial crown 
corporation.

<A HREF="#LINKT12"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is against the law, but what can somebody like Mrs. 
Thiessen do?  She is a person of ordinary means.  She cannot 
afford to hire some high priced downtown Winnipeg tax lawyer. She 
is not connected to senior officials in the department, so she 
complains and raises her concern with a member of the opposition, 
as well she should.  Part of our role is to act as ombudsmen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am duty bound to raise the matter with the minister of 
revenue, as I have done twice in the House.  What kind of 
response do we get to this breach of confidentiality?  None 
whatsoever.  The minister and his previous parliamentary 
secretary have said on this file that they would look into it. 
This was more than six months ago and we still have not get 
received an answer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When it comes to the confidentiality of Mrs. Thiessen's tax 
information, the current process of accountability did not work. 
It will be even less likely to work under the governance of the 
new agency, its commissioner and board that are not immediately 
accountable to parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have raised what I think is the most outrageous case of 
taxpayer abuse with which I am familiar, the case of Janice 
Collingridge, a lady who lives in Calgary.  Janice Collingridge 
is a high stem quadriplegic.  She cannot move.  She cannot speak. 
She cannot breathe without the assistance of a respirator.  She 
lives independently in an apartment with the assistance of a 
provincial government disability grant.  The provincial 
Government of Alberta has provided her with this grant to 
contract with home care workers to come in and help her live 
independently. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mrs. Collingridge was going about her life, living independently 
with the assistance of the grant, and along came the tax cops 
from Revenue Canada who said that they were going to audit Mrs. 
Collingridge's books.  She asked “What is there to audit?  All I 
get is the grant”.  They said they were going to take a look at 
how she was spending it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They found that Mrs. Collingridge using some modern technology 
had managed to print out on a computer some kind of a work 
schedule for her home care contractors.  The Revenue Canada 
bureaucrats said they were sorry to tell Mrs. Collingridge that 
the work schedules constitutes essentially terms of employment. 
These people who are working in her home were actually employees, 
not contractors, and she is therefore liable to pay Revenue 
Canada over $5,000 in back payroll taxes because they have been 
employees of hers for years and she has been evading taxes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Can we believe it?  This is more money than she has in her life 
savings.  She is a high stem, low income, non-verbal 
quadriplegic, and the officials of the government dragged her 
into tax court in Calgary.  These heartless, cruel and 
non-compassionate tax collectors trying to meet their de facto 
quota dragged this person who does not have the resources, even 
the physical resources, to defend herself into court.  They tried 
to shake her down for that $5,000 plus interest and penalties. 
That is what is wrong with the tax system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have raised this matter with the minister.  I know there are 
other matters like it.  Tax lawyers can tell us about them.  MPs 
can tell us about them.  What does the minister say?  He says 
“We will take a look at the file”.  No response. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I raised it in September 1997.  It has been 12 or 13 months with 
no answer as to whether the government believes that home care 
grants from the government to the severely disabled constitute 
taxable income for payroll tax purposes.  It will not answer that 
question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the minister who has to sit here and evade my questions will 
not answer them and will not look into this kind of gross and 
extreme abuse, how much less likely is he to answer, if he can 
say “Mr. Speaker, I am the minister responsible for an agency 
and there is a board and a commissioner in place which have to 
deal with these policies.  I as minister cannot possibly second 
guess those officials?”  That is my concern.  It is a serious 
concern that has not been addressed by the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why exercising our responsibility to provide an 
alternative to the government, the official opposition has put 
forward a series of amendments which would ensure that the 
Suzanne Thiessens and the Janice Collingridges of the country and 
thousands of others receive the help that is needed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will comment on another case.  It is a case of a dentist in 
Calgary who came to my office recently to tell me what had 
happened. 
He was subdividing some land he owned for development.  Before 
the subdivision he sought a ruling from Revenue Canada, 
exercising his due diligence as an honest and ethical taxpayer, 
as to whether or not GST would be applicable to the sale of these 
lots.  A Revenue Canada official looked at it and responded with 
a letter, an opinion, saying no, that under the current tax laws 
the sale of these lots would not have GST applied to them. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1110"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT13"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This honest taxpayer sold his lots and made his profit after 
having taken a risk and having created some wealth for our 
economy.  A year later Revenue Canada came along and said 
“Excuse me, sir, but we are afraid to inform you that the day 
before you sold those lots Revenue Canada sent out an 
interpretation bulletin changing its understanding of the tax act 
and the application of the GST.  We are now telling you our 
ruling notwithstanding, that you are to be retroactively assessed 
tens of thousands of dollars in back GST on those lots.  Even 
though you exercised due diligence, even though you planned 
according to the information we gave you, we sent out an 
interpretation bulletin that probably not more than a half dozen 
bureaucrats and tax lawyers read, and you are going to have to 
pay us back taxes”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those kinds of things happen every day of the week in Canada. 
There is no accountability when it happens.  There is no way that 
people like the Janice Collingridges, the Suzanne Thiessens and 
the thousands of others have recourse to high price tax lawyers. 
Janice Collingridge only managed to get her matter thrown out of 
court because she had a lawyer offer her assistance pro bono. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why we have proposed the adoption of a taxpayers bill of 
rights.  Let me be crystal clear.  I said all along to the 
government that if it were to adopt or agree even to consider 
adopting a taxpayers bill of rights and an office for taxpayer 
protection along the lines of what we have proposed, we would 
support the bill because we would see enhanced rather diminished 
accountability.   The government has not even had the 
straightforwardness to respond to our offer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What would the proposed taxpayers bill of rights do? Essentially 
it would enshrine in one piece of legislation all the rights to 
due process taxpayers ought to have.  Some people would ask 
whether we already have a taxpayers bill of rights.  No. What we 
have is a declaration of taxpayers rights brought in by then 
minister Perrin Beatty in 1985.  It is a worthwhile document. 
Basically it is a motherhood statement, but it has no teeth, no 
sanctions.  It is just a statement of principle.  It is not 
legislation.  It does not have statutory force.  It does not 
impose any sanctions on Revenue Canada if it steps out of bounds. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our taxpayers bill of rights has teeth, has sanctions and 
clearly guarantees accountability.  It would, among other things, 
enumerate the right of taxpayers to understand the tax laws they 
are required to comply with in plain language.  It would give 
them the right to be treated in a professional manner by the 
agency.  It would give them the right to complain about poor 
treatment or service and to receive a written response from the 
employee's supervisor.  If the response is not satisfactory, the 
taxpayer would have the right to be heard by more senior 
officials.  It would give taxpayers the right to pay the amount 
of tax required by law and no more.  Revenue officials would be 
required to inform taxpayers of overpayment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We recently saw in the auditor general's report cases where 
millions of dollars were collected in overpayments by the 
government, millions coming from pensioners on fixed incomes who 
cannot afford tax accountants and are paying more than they 
should. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It would give taxpayers the right to know for what purpose 
information will be used and what penalties will apply if 
information is not provided.  It will give them the right to 
represent themselves or appoint someone to act in their place in 
any dealings with the agency, and the right to record any and all 
meetings with agency officials without being required to give 
advance notice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It would give them the right to continue to to appeal agency 
rulings, first administratively through the existing appeals 
branch and a fairness process and, if necessary, through the 
judicial system.  It would require that the agency waive 
penalties and interest wherever it can be shown that a taxpayer 
acted in good faith, as the dentist in Calgary did with respect 
to his lot sales, and without the intention to evade, or where 
the taxpayer relied upon incorrect advice provided by an agency 
official as in the case I mentioned.

</I></B></P><P align=left>In cases where penalties and interests can cause severe 
financial hardship or in cases where reassessments can be proven 
to cause severe financial hardship, alternative arrangements 
could be made through abatement or negotiated repayment 
schedules.  Where fraud or evasion is suspected, officials would 
be permitted to seize or freeze assets after first demonstrating 
a compelling reason why such action should be taken and taxpayers 
would have the right to complain to the office for taxpayer 
protection in cases where freezing or seizing of assets could be 
expected to create serious financial hardship for others. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have cases where that has happened, including a disabled 
young man in Niagara who had his personal bank account frozen 
because Revenue Canada was investigating his father.  He could 
not pay rent or buy groceries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All these rights I have just enumerated would be enforced by a 
taxpayer ombudsman, or the office for taxpayer protection, who 
could issue taxpayer protection orders where necessary to protect 
taxpayers from arbitrary treatment or treatment that could lead 
to undue financial hardship.  He would report to parliament once 
a year.  He would give a summary of at least 25 of the most 
serious problems encountered by Revenue Canada.  He could assist 
taxpayers in resolving disputes with the agency.  He could make 
recommendations on changes to the administrative and legislative 
apparatus of the agency. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope the government will give serious consideration to this 
honest effort on our part to deepen accountability in the tax 
collection process.  I regret that because it has not yet done 
so, as the official opposition we have to vote against Bill C-43.

</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleagues from the opposition, the hon. members for Calgary 
Southeast, Regina—Qu'Appelle and Kings—Hants, moved good and 
sensible amendments to this bill, but what did the Standing 
Committee on Finance do? It simply packed the gallery with 
Liberal members and gagged the opposition. Opposition amendments 
were ignored, which prompted the Bloc Quebecois to say “If that 
is how you want to play it, we will introduce 118 motions in 
amendment to make fun of the government.” 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Only 18 organizations and some 50 people testified before the 
committee. Only two of these 50 individuals were totally in 
favour of Bill C-43. These were our revenue minister, 
naturally—the bill is his brainchild and I think he is somewhat 
proud of it—and André Vallerand.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Vallerand, as members will remember, is a former Quebec 
revenue minister under Robert Bourassa, a good Liberal. He did 
not come to tell us about the benefits or the flaws of Bill C-43. 
He simply came to talk like a politician, to discuss things and, 
I imagine, to get contracts from his Liberal friends in Ottawa, 
since Mr. Vallerand's company does consultation work and so on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of all the other organizations, none was fully supportive of the 
bill. Most were lukewarm, if not cold to this legislation, and 
the unions were totally opposed to it. 
But this bogus committee refused to hear the 18 organizations 
that came here, that travelled to Ottawa to express their views. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Incidentally, it is not the first time there are problems with 
this federal committee. Last year, I was a member of the 
Standing Committee on Finance. We travelled across Canada to 
hear testimonies on what should be included in the budget of the 
Minister of Finance for the current year. No proposal made by 
these witnesses was included in last year's budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This year, my colleagues from the Bloc Quebecois and the other 
opposition parties who travelled across the country are telling 
us that not much of what they heard during the hearings is 
included in the report which, incidentally, was leaked to the 
media, as seems to be the trend right now. 
It got the same treatment as many other reports that are 
supposed to be kept secret until tabled and read in the House, 
but that are leaked to the newspapers instead.  They are leaked 
to friends.  Why?  To impress people?  I have no idea. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If governing is about listening and consulting, my friends 
across the way have a lot to learn.  Governing is about 
respecting people.  With the arrogance we have come to know, 
this government simply gagged us during clause-by-clause study of 
the bill.  They did the same at second and third reading.  Is 
that respect?  No, it is not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another example of their lack of respect surfaced in the 
newspapers with the report that the Prime Minister went to 
Alberta to announce a youth assistance program. 
Not one provincial minister, not even the premier of Alberta, 
had heard anything about this new program.  This is a flagrant 
lack of respect. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Governing is about being fair.  In the short year and a half 
since my arrival in this place, I have seen daily examples of 
the government members' unfairness.  They are arrogant, 
bulldozing ahead like little dictators, doing what they want 
with no concern about respect. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There was the example of the millennium scholarships that were 
supposed to get the Prime Minister some publicity.  What did the 
government do?  It consulted nobody.  It poked its nose into 
areas of provincial jurisdiction, such as education.  It 
invested billions of dollars, telling Canadians and Quebeckers 
that it was running the country.  This is disrespectful and 
unfair.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government over there is patting itself on the back for 
having attained zero deficit and for now making a profit.  A 
profit at whose expense?  The provinces'.  Since 1993, all the 
profit the government has made accounts for 49% of the cuts it 
has made in payments to the provinces for health, social 
services and education.  Yet the government's expenditures in 
health, education and social services are only 17.2%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Where is the fairness in slashing, in strangling, instead of 
doing some tidying up, putting affairs in order?  Speaking of 
cutting back on waste, it is no big deal, a mere $220,000 the 
development bank in Montreal decided to invest in golf courses, 
not in their facilities but in memberships. A mere $220,000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yesterday, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of 
National Revenue told us “No problem. This is an agency and they 
are supposed to be able to govern themselves properly.  Golf 
memberships are a recognized business practice”.  I'd like to 
know the Royal Bank's golf budget.  I doubt it spends $220,000 a 
year on golf in the Montreal region. This shows a lack of 
respect. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Governing also means making choices.  The government has chosen 
to establish agencies. 
From the experience it acquired with the agencies it has already 
established, it ought to be able to understand that the customs 
and revenue agency is quite simply doomed to failure like the 
rest or to look after and provide jobs for the friends of those 
in power.  In my opinion, this is not sufficient grounds for 
establishing an agency which will cut at least 40,000 public 
service jobs in the public service. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The majority of the representatives of the 18 organizations that 
appeared before the committee told us that the department of 
revenue had many shortcomings, but was improving considerably 
and a good team could be created there, since we have what is 
required to do so.  Even the auditor general says the agency 
will not remedy the current problems in the department of 
revenue. That is what our auditor general says. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why spend money to create another level of public officials? 
The appointment of a commissioner and a deputy commissioner 
creates another level of officials.  I think the only reason the 
minister of revenue is keeping to this position is to please the 
Prime Minister and the President of the Treasury Board by saying 
“Our union is too powerful, so we will muzzle it”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I mentioned existing agencies earlier.  Before I give the floor 
over to my friend the member for Rimouski—Mitis, I would like to 
quickly go over the existing agencies.  Let us look at the new 
wheat board in western Canada.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It comes.  It goes.  It flies by the seat of its pants.  I do 
not know whether there is one too many or one too few wheels in 
the board, but we will soon find out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is Nav Canada, an agency that has relieved Transport 
Canada of all responsibility for air traffic control.  Nav 
Canada simply decided to close the control tower in Gatineau. 
Nav Canada closed the tower at Baie-Comeau.  An accident occurred 
at Baie-Comeau yesterday.  Had there been controllers present at 
the Baie-Comeau tower, help might have arrived more quickly and 
more lives might have been saved.  I do not know, but at least 
chance would have been on our side in this instance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Nav Canada said “No problem. 
We will not cut jobs.  At least for two or three years, we will 
not cut jobs”.  It has been only 18 months since the agency was 
established and some 20% of jobs have been eliminated.  What 
happened to the promise?  On questioning, the Minister of 
Transport says “They are making adjustments.  They are doing 
their job.  They are responsible”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is the ADM, the Montreal airports agency. This issue is 
important to me and to all the members from the Lower 
Laurentians, because it means the region's survival, 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Previously, there was a good and interesting arrangement. 
International flights landed in Mirabel and local and North 
American ones in Dorval.  The year before they decided to close 
Mirabel down partially,  Dorval had made $12 million in profit, 
Mirabel $13 million. 
It was not a record profit, but neither was it a loss. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the strength of misleading studies, ADM management sold all 
of Quebec, including the Montreal region, on the idea that it 
would be better to transfer all flights from Mirabel to Dorval. 
This was done, but there has been chaos ever since.  Flights are 
backed up and many from Europe now go to Toronto, not even 
stopping over in Montreal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have questioned the Minister of Transport and he replies that 
it is not the government's fault, that the agency is responsible 
for making its own decisions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is what we get with agencies.  They are something a 
minister can hide behind, instead of doing his job and answering 
questions in the House about any problems in his particular 
department. 
He can wash his hands of his responsibilities. 
The government is afraid to govern, afraid to do its job.  But 
its job is to make decisions that serve the interests of 
Quebeckers and Canadians.  Its job is to act in everyone's 
interests, not just the interests of its friends and of the 
rich. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It has been hinted that, after the next budget, the rich, those 
earning over $50,000, would no longer pay the 3% surtax. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Governing is about making fair and equitable decisions, good 
decisions in the economic interests of all Quebeckers and 
Canadians.  That is what governing is about, not what the 
government is doing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My twenty minutes are up, so I will turn the floor over to my 
colleague, the member for Rimouski—Mitis. I have made it clear 
that Bloc Quebecois members are completely opposed to Bill C-43 
and that we will be voting against it, as will, I hope, most of 
the opposition members.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski—Mitis, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to speak today for two reasons.  First of all, because I 
would like to take part in this debate concerning Bill C-43, 
which establishes the Canada customs and revenue agency, but 
also to fulfill a commitment made by me on November 27, when I 
accepted a mandate from Quebec City radio personality Robert 
Gillet. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Every week, the private radio station he works for gives out the 
bolo award to the person who gets the most listener votes.  On 
November 27, the Minister of Canadian Heritage was voted by the 
people of Quebec as the bolo award winner, for her involvement 
in the olympic games bids. 
So, I can say mission accomplished as far as the bolo award for 
the hon. member for Hamilton East is concerned. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now, for a more serious mission, addressing Bill C-43.  What 
amazes me is that no one, or virtually no one, in the Quebec and 
Canadian public seems to be aware of what is going on at the 
present time in the House in this connection. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This weekend I had the opportunity to meet a number of my 
constituents.  I asked them all “What do you know about the 
Canada customs and revenue agency?”  No one could answer, and 
yet we have spent a number of hours debating this already. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I asked myself why the information was not reaching the public. 
We have to find a way to inform people. It may be that our 
debates so far have been much too abstract for the public to 
realize the importance of this issue. We are discussing an 
extremely important issue, but the public does not seem to be 
aware of it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The opposition made it clear why it objects to this bill. Since 
I was going to take part in today's debate, on the weekend I 
surfed the Internet to see what had been said last week, at 
second reading and during the clause by clause review at report 
stage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I learned a few good ones. Among other things, I realized that 
the government introduced a bill that is a further symptom of 
the degenerative disease that has plagued it at least since the 
days of Sir Wilfrid Laurier, a disease better known as “acute 
centralizationitis”. I know of no other disease that is a 
greater threat to Canada's future. This government never stops 
accusing us of acting in bad faith, of saying that we want to 
break up the country. Come to think of it, we did everything we 
could to save Canada, if only with the arguments we put forward 
during the debate on Bill C-43. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government's negligence gives us one more reason to want to 
leave this country, because the government is truly insensitive 
to the perverse effects of this legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has no qualms about creating a legal framework 
that will allow it to look over the provinces' shoulder at will, 
even though it means interfering in provincial jurisdictions.

<A HREF="#LINKT19"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a government that imposes gag orders in order to keep 
the opposition quiet and keep it from playing its role, 
basically. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Everyone knows this arrogant Liberal government forgets it has 
the support of only 38% of the population.  So, the 62% of the 
population that we on this side of the House represent is trying 
to convince the government that it cannot proceed with its bill. 
It is a ridiculous bill that most Canadians reject. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So, day after day this government shows us its very twisted view 
of Canada's future. 
If the Liberal government were more democratic and less 
dictatorial, it would allow the opposition to express its 
dissent, especially because, since June 2, 1997 when it was 
unfortunately returned to power, this government has done 
nothing valid.  It lets the time go by.  It manages time, that 
is all.  When things do not suit it, it manages time by stifling 
the opposition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur:</B> It takes out the baseball bat. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay:</B> Yes, as my colleague from 
Berthier—Montcalm has said, it takes out the baseball bat or 
its pepper shakers, which I add on my own. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So the government does not let the opposition express its 
dissent.  On the contrary. 
This minority government in terms of votes and barely majority 
government in terms of seats was so afraid of having a hard time 
controlling its majority that it gave you, Mr. Speaker, the 
honour and us the pleasure of allowing you to sit, as an 
opposition member, even, in the Chair during our debates. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This says just how much Canadians decided. But I invite them 
seriously, right off, to follow the debates in this House daily 
so they do not get taken in the next election and can decide 
that the government deserves a holiday on the opposition benches 
next time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us look at the situation a little more closely. 
Ever since it came to this House five years ago, the Bloc 
Quebecois has consistently supported the government whenever the 
bill before us was well structured, everything looked great and 
we had assurances from officials that all was in keeping with 
the many international treaties Canada is a party to. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We did, on occasion, suggest to the government a number of 
amendments, some of which the government actually accepted 
because, more often than not, these opposition amendments 
improved the government bill under consideration. 
In such cases, after a healthy debate that was beneficial to the 
people of Quebec and Canada, we helped move the bill forward, we 
did not object to it, we let the government take the necessary 
votes, where we either approved the bill or registered our 
dissent, without unduly dragging out debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, on a number of occasions, the Bloc Quebecois did object 
to the speedy passage of a bill, which we felt did not make any 
sense, was not consistent with the interests of Quebec or 
Canada, lacked clarity or invaded provincial jurisdiction, or 
was too complex and required further consultation. 
We also stood our ground if the bill represented a major change 
from how we thought things should be done and the government was 
not allowing us enough time to present our views or was simply 
not interested in hearing what we had to say. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If anyone were to compare the number of times we have stood our 
ground in the last five years to the number of ridiculous bills 
the government used its majority to pass, we, the opposition 
parties, would win the day, compared to the government, which 
has bungled several bills, often completely ignoring 
accountability, and which is now taking cover behind a series of 
agencies so as not to be seen mismanaging the country.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is interesting that every time the opposition's views 
differed substantially from those of the government, closure was 
invoked and any continuation of debate that might have resulted 
in common ground being found was squelched. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is instructive to read all the impassioned speeches against 
closure made by members of the Liberal Party when they were in 
opposition, during the Mulroney era.  In five years, the 
Liberals have already beaten the Mulroney government's record. 
Not a single government in recent democracy has gagged its 
opposition as often as this one. 
This shows how fundamentally unsure and dissatisfied they are 
with what they are doing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They are no longer able to stand us telling them what a rotten 
job they are doing.  They say “We will stop them from speaking, 
because it could get out to the public that we are doing a bad 
job”.  The honeymoon continues, and until it is over, this 
government thinks it can keep getting re-elected.  But the 
honeymoon is nearly over. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We criticize this government every day.  Soon we will be 
bringing out the horrible truths, and I do not know which one is 
the worst. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is something horrible about the arrogance of this 
government, which has done nothing but mark time since June 2, 
1997.  This is a government that does not govern, one that 
pockets the funds of workers and puts them to illegal use. 
This is a government which contributes each and every day to 
widening the gap between the haves and the have nots.  This is a 
government which is saying that it is prepared to turn millions 
of dollars over to sports millionaires, while it refuses to pay 
the unemployed the benefits they need to support their families. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a government which has unjustly slashed transfer 
payments to the provinces in order to cut itself some slack to 
invest in propaganda, waving the flag, giving contracts to 
buddies, while middle-class taxpayers are getting poorer.  This 
is a government which makes a conscious effort each and every 
day to ensure Quebec is punished, crushed, humiliated, made a 
mockery of. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But there is even more.  Last Friday in this House, the Minister 
of Industry had the gall to not even try to hide his face when 
he responded to a question from the member for Laurentides, 
saying he was punishing us for having an opinion different from 
his. It is this different concept of the organization of a real 
federation that forces us, because he has understood nothing, to 
leave and to advance our plan, which offers much greater 
possibility for development and growth to the Quebec cultural 
community than this centralizing vision, and especially that of 
the Minister of Industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By imposing its gag order and ramming the bill through at third 
reading, the government agrees wittingly—and that is the crazy 
part—that the bill has major flaws, which will prevent it from 
serving the interests of the people of Quebec and Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By wanting the bill passed at any cost, the federal government 
is gagging us to force us to end this debate before all the 
members have had a chance to express their ideas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no urgency in this area.  There was some urgency with 
respect to other bills, including the one on periodicals.  There 
was some urgency about it, in order to protect an industry. 
When it comes to protecting an industry, the government is in no 
hurry, even though the opposition parties were offering to 
co-operate, with the exception of course of the Reform Party. We 
could have moved more quickly with that bill.  It was to defend 
one of our industries, to defend Canadian culture.  No, the 
government preferred to push ahead with a bill that will cause 
harm to everyone in Quebec and Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no national crisis, nor international one.  This bill 
requires major improvements.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many provisions should have been included at report stage to 
make the bill acceptable to most parties in the House. This bill 
is far from enjoying unanimous support. Quite the contrary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member for Rivière-des-Mille-Îles, who worked so hard to 
try to improve this legislation and who participated in the 
hearings, told the House that, when the committee conducted its 
clause by clause review of the bill, 18 groups, organizations or 
individuals came to the committee to state their views on this 
legislation. 
Two witnesses who appeared before the committee supported the 
bill: the minister who tabled it, and André Vallerand, a former 
Quebec revenue minister under Mr. Bourassa. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Because he is a good Liberal, Mr. Vallerand probably came to do 
some lobbying, just in case—he had carefully reviewed the 
bill—the government might need a chair, a deputy chair or a 
commissioner for that customs and revenue agency. He told himself 
“I will go to Ottawa and tell them their bill is perfect. This 
will get me a good job”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The qualifications listed in the act for the positions of chair, 
commissioner or director are that the appointees must be 
Canadian citizens, but cannot be members of the Senate or House 
of Commons, or full-time public servants. An exception is made in 
the case of the commissioner. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Vallerand came and told the committee how great this 
agency would be. However, the 16 other groups that appeared 
before the committee explained, one after the other, why this 
agency should not be established as proposed. Some were lukewarm 
to the idea, some were timid in their objections, while others 
were very much opposed to the agency. The 16 other groups or 
organizations that appeared had strong reservations against the 
bill. But the government turned a deaf ear. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our opposition is based on a large number of major and important 
reasons. The government turned a deaf ear not only to the groups 
that appeared before the committee, but to all the opposition 
parties. It is rejecting our input and it refuses to change 
anything. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is frustrating to work as hard as the hon. member for 
Rivière-des-Mille-Îles did, only to run into a wall of 
misunderstanding. 
To submit our recommendations, table our research or express our 
concerns would be pointless. The government is not interested in 
what the opposition can bring to this debate, because they know 
that, with a majority in the House, they can impose this 
legislation. Its meagre 38% of the popular vote should be enough 
to remind them to be more cooperative, more careful, more open, 
less arrogant and less conceited. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-43, which establishes the Canada Customs and Revenue 
Agency, is an extremely important piece of legislation that 
affects all Quebeckers and all Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, through you, I would like to point out to our dear 
friends who are watching this debate that, by setting up this 
Customs and Revenue Agency, the Liberal government led by the 
little guy from Shawinigan is giving them, on Christmas Eve, a 
poisoned gift. 
I want the people to know how harmful this agency will be. I 
hope everyone who hears this message will repeat it to a family 
member during the holidays. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>People throughout Quebec and Canada should know that, while 
thinking about giving tax breaks to our sports millionaires, the 
government is spinning a web in which they hope to catch every 
taxpayer owing a penny to Revenue Canada, but from which the 
rich will find it easy to escape, as usual. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I urge the people to use their privilege and make 
representations to their senators, in the other place, since 
they will have to rely on their cooperation to railroad such a 
harmful, vicious and dangerous bill for the people of Quebec and 
Canada.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Wendy Lill (Dartmouth, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to speak to Bill C-43 on behalf of the New Democratic 
Party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-43 will repeal the Department of National Revenue Act and 
convert Revenue Canada from a fully accountable government 
department to an autonomous arm's length business oriented 
agency. The proposed legislation, Bill C-43, sets out new powers 
of the minister, the structure of the new agency and its 
authority over all matters relating personnel management, 
contracting, organization, the prescription of user fees, general 
administrative policy and real and intellectual property.  In 
addition, the agency is given authority on legislation which for 
most other federal departments and agencies is vested in the 
Treasury Board and the Public Service Commission.  For instance, 
the agency will have full authority to enter into agreements with 
its bargaining units. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The objects of the agency reflect the current mandate of Revenue 
Canada such as customs services and trade administration, tax 
administration, for example the GST, and the delivery of social 
and economic benefits for provinces and the federal government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The New Democratic Party opposes the passage of Bill C-43 and 
has since it initial introduction.  Why do we oppose Bill C-43? 
We believe the creation of the customs and revenue agency would 
for all intents and purposes be an abdication of political power. 
We believe the agency is the largest Liberal Trojan horse for 
privatization.  Revenue Canada's 40,000 employees make up about 
20% of the federal public service.  The move would involve the 
transfer of more than $2 billion in annual parliamentary 
estimates.  This is way beyond the concept of delivering better 
services.  It is part of the government's drive to privatize and 
downsize the public service in the name of cost cutting. The 
government glorifies the role of private sector appointees and 
seems to think the public sector can only run on private sector 
principles.  The government would also take credit for slashing 
expenditures by $2.2 billion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We believe it is appalling that the control of tax collection 
which is an historical prerogative of the state is abandoned by 
stealth to the private sector.  Even the most right wing 
economists and classical philosophers such as Adam Smith and John 
Locke acknowledge that collecting taxes is the raison d'être of 
the state.  Even Margaret Thatcher and Helmut Kohl, both 
champions of privatization, never went so far as to privatize 
their tax agencies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The NDP opposes a single privatized tax collection agency for 
political reasons as well.  The government is moving toward an 
independent agency without the support of the four major 
provinces.  Nor does it have the support of the majority of its 
workers.  The major stakeholders are not buying into this idea. 
The majority of public service workers oppose the concept of the 
independent agency and stress that there is no valid reason for 
it.  There is no firm support by the provinces for a single 
taxation agency.  The federal government has reached no agreement 
with the provinces, not even a non-binding letter of intent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Ontario, Quebec and P.E.I. are firmly opposed to Bill C-43. 
B.C. and Saskatchewan have not endorsed the concept.  Alberta has 
supported the concept of an independent agency for ideological 
reasons.  While Alberta does not have a sales tax and administers 
its own programs, there is a fading possibility that it might 
sign on the administration of its provincial income tax to the 
agency. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While Mr. McKenna's New Brunswick supported the concept, Nova 
Scotia and Newfoundland have not bought into the concept but are 
bound by their tax administration agreements to the federal 
government and are unwilling to cede further authority. It is 
clear that all provinces generally see the agency as an intrusion 
into provincial jurisdiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadian businesses have major reservations about the proposed 
agency.  The public policy forum study commissioned by Revenue 
Canada found that 40% of businesses surveyed by the PPF saw no 
advantage to a single tax collection agency.  Sixty-eight per 
cent thought that a single tax agency would either increase their 
compliance costs or have no impact at all. 
The NDP opposes the creation of a single privatized tax 
collection agency as well for economic reasons.  There is no 
valid case for an independent agency.  The government claims that 
the agency will bring about significant cost savings or stronger 
partnership with the provinces. These are at best exaggerated.

</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, the economic rationale for the proposed agency 
originated in 1996.  It was seen as a means of administering the 
planned harmonized sales tax that would blend the federal GST and 
provincial sales tax.  The idea was originally set up so that the 
Prime Minister could keep his promise to harmonize tax and hide 
the GST.  The agency's biggest savings were to come from the 
harmonization which is a non-starter in all but three of the 
Atlantic provinces, New Brunswick, Nova Scotia and Newfoundland. 
The initial plans for a federal-provincial council on tax 
administration were quietly dropped from the original agency 
proposal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Harmonization occurred in three of the Atlantic provinces while 
Revenue Canada was a department.  The overwhelming unpopularity 
of the HST in the Atlantic provinces has eliminated any talks of 
further extending it to the rest of Canada. Canadian taxpayers 
are asked to support the creation of a new layer of bureaucracy 
in the hope that the provinces might participate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Both the auditor general and internal Revenue Canada reports 
confirm that the government has lost billions of dollars because 
of unaudited tax statements due to a shortage of qualified 
auditors. The Provincial Institute of the Public Service of 
Canada estimated that over $2 billion of tax revenue was lost in 
1997-98 alone.  The federal Liberal government gutted the civil 
service workforce, inflicted a six year tax freeze to the 
survivors and allowed executive managers an increase in 
compensation of up to 19%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It now has the gall to say it needs an independent agency to 
afford hiring qualified auditors.  Nothing prevents the 
government from hiring these auditors now.  The cost of hiring 
these auditors is ridiculously low compared to the billions of 
losses in tax revenues and to the lethal blows inflicted on the 
morale of civil servants and thereby on the public in general. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government is jeopardizing the careers and stability of 
40,000 civil servants, the cost of which will be far exceeding 
the tax and cost savings estimated at $116 million to $193 
million for Canadian business and $37 million to $62 million in 
administration costs for all governments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The agency is an excuse to cut out workers and inflate executive 
salaries, a worst case scenario for the civil service. Professor 
Vern Krishna, head of the CGA tax research centre, University of 
Ottawa, stated that these executive salaries could double or 
triple.  The 40,000 employees moving to the agency will be 
considered to have transferred outside the federal public service 
and receive reasonable job offers with only a two year employment 
guarantee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The plans to exclude the agency from the Public Service 
Employment Act and establish it under the Public Service Staff 
Relations Act means that employees will lose job security and the 
right to negotiate staffing and classification matters. Thousands 
of Revenue Canada employees will likely pay the price with their 
jobs, as this was the case in Australia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Employees of the agency will have no guarantee to the same right 
of third party redress as other public service employees in case 
of non-disciplinary demotion or termination.  Details of the 
recourse mechanisms are not available and are not provided by the 
legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The agency will impose user fees for specific services, for 
example services that provide a specific benefit to service 
recipients. The agency has every incentive to slap on user fees 
because unlike revenues from tax proceedings that have been paid 
into general revenues, the proceeds can be accumulated. 
Tax collection is big business in Canada and this has the 
potential for abuse.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The agency has the potential to attract more business by 
provinces and municipalities that will turn over to the agency's 
administration more taxes and programs, including a property tax 
and even payroll taxes such as workers compensation.  This is a 
lose-lose situation for jobs and will result in downsizing of 
administrative and collection departments at the expense of 
provincial and municipal civil servants. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The NDP opposes Bill C-43 for philosophical, ethical and 
economic reasons.  We believe Bill C-43 is both bad legislation 
and dangerous legislation.  To borrow from a slogan which we have 
used regarding banks, we need a better taxation system, not a 
bigger, privatized tax collection system. Canadians need a better 
taxation system to move us into the 21st century, a taxation 
system which is fair and equitable for all. For all these reasons 
the NDP will be voting against Bill C-43.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Scott Brison (Kings—Hants, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to speak on behalf of the Progressive Conservative Party to 
Bill C-43. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The issue of cost savings is the one that has been trumpeted by 
the government most vociferously, that the government can save 
$171 million to $285 million in compliance costs and also savings 
of $97 million to $162 million in administrative costs to the 
taxpayers with this new Revenue Canada tax agency if all the 
provinces sign on to it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is a very big if, because the fact is the government has 
not been successful in achieving the agreement or the buy-in of 
the province to date despite significant lobbying efforts by the 
federal government.  The track record of the government in this 
area has not been that successful.  For instance, only three 
provinces have signed on to the concept of a blended sales tax, 
those being in Atlantic Canada, one of which is Nova Scotia which 
I represent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian Federation of Taxpayers believes there will be no 
major savings to the government by implementing Bill C-43 to 
create this new Revenue Canada tax agency. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At a time when we should be focusing on tax reform, on reducing 
the level of taxation and also in creating a fairer, flatter tax 
code that actually enables Canadians to compete globally, we are 
spending an inordinate amount of time focusing on the logistics, 
on the minutia of tax collection, finding out better ways of 
plucking the goose. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have significant difficulties with this piece of legislation. 
We have the risk of the amount of very personal, private 
information concentrated in a new arms' length agency that will 
not have the same direct linkage to parliamentarians that it does 
today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have a difficulty with the fact that this heavy handed 
approach of the federal government on any number of issues 
continues to violate the principles of federal-provincial 
relations.  At a time when provincial governments like Ontario 
are speaking about wanting more access to the levers, the 
government is looking to create more or larger mega agencies to 
effectively control the processes of government.  At a time when 
Canadians are looking for greater accountability this agency will 
provide less accountability. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The biggest risk we have with the creation of this agency is the 
potential to create an IRS type tax agency that will be less 
impeded when it goes after Canadians.  Currently there are 
significant concerns that Canadians have right now with Revenue 
Canada and the collection processes and the enforcement processes 
that Revenue Canada has utilized over the years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those processes have improved over the last several years 
largely due to political pressure from elected representatives in 
the House, largely due as well to measures by former minister of 
national revenue Perrin Beatty with his taxpayer bill of rights 
which led the way to ensuring Canadians had more enshrined rights 
in defending themselves against Revenue Canada. 
Some of those principles are also being promoted by the Reform 
Party currently in some of its motions and recommendations.  We 
are supporting those motions and recommendations which originated 
with the Conservative revenue critic and eventually a 
Conservative minister of revenue.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has not articulated in a convincing way the 
benefits to Canadians of this new agency. There are risks and 
there is a down side to this agency.  We are not convinced of the 
government's validity and ingenuousness in promoting the benefits 
or what the benefits are. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government speaks euphemistically about the importance the 
human resource factor has in its decision.  It speaks about how 
human resources cannot be maximized under the current civil 
service.  The government is actually talking about unions.  It 
says it is not capable of working with the public service in 
Canada and the unions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At a time when government should be a standard bearer in labour 
relations and at a time when a government should be demonstrating 
to Canadian companies how to work with labour and how to develop 
policies that encourage productivity and forward thinking and 
co-operative effort between management and labour, the government 
is saying that it is not possible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Chrysler Canada has as a member of its board a representative of 
the CAW.  In the U.S. automobile industry members of the boards 
of the big three are from the unions. This government is saying 
“We cannot work with the public service.  We are willing to take 
all these risks because we are willing to abdicate responsibility 
for effective labour management and to offload that to an arm's 
length agency”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Governments should be setting an example in this area because 
labour relations is a cornerstone of productivity.  Good labour 
relations can help demonstrate to all Canadian businesses how 
they can become more productive.  We should not be surprised that 
the government is taking a hands off approach to productivity 
issues.  The Minister of Industry has said high taxes actually 
encourage productivity.  There has never been a statement of 
economic illiteracy as profound as that. This is a government 
whose minister responsible for the economic strategy and 
industrial strategy of the country believes high taxes actually 
help productivity.  It is little wonder the government cannot 
wrap its mind around the concept of positive labour relations as 
a cornerstone of productivity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is little wonder the government does not accept its role in 
both the secular decline of the Canadian dollar over the past 
several years and, more specifically, the 9% decline in the 
Canadian dollar over the last several months, 30% of which is due 
to productivity that is lagging in Canada behind our trading 
partners and behind the other OECD countries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will speak about the Canadian dollar and the relationship of 
the government's decision on Bill C-43 and the idea of government 
being unable to harness the power over the public service and has 
seemed to improve productivity in the public service. It is 
directly related to the Canadian dollar because a large 
component, and perhaps some would say too large, of the Canadian 
GDP is government related.  If we do not get our minds around 
creating a more productive and efficient public service as 
opposed to trying to offload those responsibilities to arm's 
length agencies and specifically to the private sector, we will 
continue to wallow behind our trading partners in areas that are 
very important like productivity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the dollar issue, I know the Prime Minister thinks it is 
probably a good thing.  He says it will increase tourism, which 
actually represents 1% of our GDP.  He is spending too much time 
golfing and not enough time governing.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact is that a low dollar does not benefit anybody.  In the 
short term there may be some minute benefits to Canadian 
exporters.  In the long term, however, we cannot devalue our way 
to prosperity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When lagging productivity within the public service is acting as 
an albatross around productivity levels for all Canadians, this 
is a time when the government should be embracing the opportunity 
to take this department, Revenue Canada, which represents about 
20% of the public service of Canada, and revolutionize the 
delivery of service within that department. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a time when the government should be setting an example. 
Instead the government is putting its hands up in the air and 
saying “We give up.  We can't do that.  We are willing to risk 
the downsides of this agency.  We are willing to risk the 
creation of an IRS type of agency that can run rampant over 
Canadian taxpayers simply because we lack the intestinal 
fortitude and the creativity to create good labour relations 
within our own government”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is the same government that has referred to a tribunal the 
pay equity issue and now it is backtracking on its commitment to 
abide by what the tribunal said.  It is no wonder that our pubic 
service is at an all time low in terms of morale levels. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My cousin was headed for the public administration department at 
Dalhousie University.  We have had discussions over the years 
about the similarities of public administration programs and 
business administration programs.  Many of the same skill sets 
are taught in both business administration and public 
administration schools. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The difference is that there are some people who have a certain 
public ethic who want to be part of the public service, who want 
to serve their country and who want to participate in a positive, 
forward thinking public service that provides the best service to 
Canadians.  It is those people who are being let down by a 
government that refuses to work co-operatively with the unions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a government that refuses to create a sense of 
co-operation, proactivity and productivity that can lead the 
public service and set an example for all private sector entities 
in Canada that can lead Canadian productivity rates upward as we 
enter the 21st century. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I must say that I am not only frustrated with this legislation, 
I am also frustrated with the haste with which this government is 
pushing this flawed legislation through the House of Commons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill represents legislation which would dismantle 20% of 
the public service of the country, yet Canadians are hardly aware 
of it.  Canadians have not been consulted about it.  There has 
been some lip service paid to it and the minister has travelled 
throughout the country and talked to some people.  To my 
knowledge, as recently as a few weeks ago, the minister has yet 
to sit down to have a face to face meeting with the minister of 
finance of Ontario.  Ontario being the largest province in the 
country in terms of population, it would certainly make sense for 
the minister of revenue to sit down with the minister of finance 
of Ontario to discuss a change in public policy of this 
magnitude.  But in fact the minister has not had a face to face 
meeting with the minister of finance of Ontario. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There has been no real public consultation on this incredible 
sweeping change.  There has been no discussion.  There has been 
no cross-country consultation by the finance committee or a 
sub-committee of the finance committee.  That is what we have 
suggested.  We suggested that at committee.  We suggested that in 
this House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is the kind of consultation Canadians are looking for. 
Canadians are looking for greater transparency in all of the 
institutions that represent them, including the institution of 
parliament and the institution of government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A systemic abuse of power pervades this government.  Its members 
feel that if they have an idea it is obviously right and that 
Canadians, whether they like it or not, are going to get it. What 
this government has not realized is the degree to which Canadians 
have evolved over the past 30 years, largely due to things such 
as the Internet and the education system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians have access to the same information now that we do as 
parliamentarians.  In fact, Canadians who are utilizing the 
Internet and utilizing the worldwide web have access to more 
information than many parliamentarians in this House today.

judged because I was only one year old and it would have been 
difficult to get elected at that point.  However, 30 years ago 
parliamentarians may have been judged based on the information 
they had because they had access to more information than 
Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today, in an age where Canadians have access to the same 
information, we are going to be judged based on the quality of 
the decisions we make with that information.  Canadians, in fact, 
want input on that decision making process at a rate that is 
unprecedented.  Canadians want in.  They want to participate in 
these types of important decisions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is absolutely unconscionable that the government is pushing 
ahead with legislation that will impact the lives of Canadians as 
dramatically as this legislation will without actually consulting 
Canadians and telling them the truth about the gravity of this 
decision. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I call again on this government to do what is right and to 
engage the finance committee.  It should not treat the finance 
committee as a branch of the ministry of finance or the ministry 
of revenue.  It should go back to the model used by the previous 
Conservative government where Don Blenkarn led a finance 
committee that had autonomy.  It actually disagreed with the 
government periodically.  It actually did what committees were 
supposed to do, and that is to stand up for Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I call on this government to stop its haste and pressure and 
bullying opposition members into agreeing with its decisions and 
to start engaging Canadians and giving Canadians some input to 
ensure that the decisions we make as parliament, that the 
decisions we make as individual members of parliament and as 
caucuses reflect the views and the needs of Canadians.

</I></B></P><P align=left>He said he is a new member of Parliament, and we appreciate that

renewed consultations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here is my question: Does he think that these renewed 
consultations will be similar to those being held by the finance

listening to those who come to testify and to table briefs, all 
this will be ignored? 
We see no trace of those consultations in the budgets tabled by 
the finance minister. What is the use of consultations if all 
the results are being shelved? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That was my question and I would like to hear the hon. member's 
answer. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Scott Brison:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend for that 
very important question.  He is quite right that the committee 
structure as it stands now in this Canadian Parliament, under 
this government, has strayed significantly from what was 
intended. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was intended as a means by which independent members, private 
members, could work together in a non-partisan way to gauge and 
to receive the views of Canadians and then to discuss those views 
as well as the expert advice of individuals who have intrinsic 
knowledge in these areas and then to develop policies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The difficulty with the current structure is that the committees 
are being operated, by and large, as branches of the ministers' 
offices.  They were not intended for that purpose. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We spend our time travelling throughout the country, putting on 
a charade for Canadians and pretending that their views are going 
to be taken seriously. 
Then we come back after weeks and weeks of travel, after hearing 
hundreds of Canadians, and we devote, as we did yesterday, two 
hours to the discussion on a draft report written by members of 
the research staff.  To their credit, they have been working very 
hard and they deserve a lot of credit for their hard work in the 
finance committee.

a sham. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have seen a secular decline in the role of the MP.  We have 
seen an emasculation of MPs since the late 1960s in this House. 
It is time, as the hon. member suggested, that private members 
have an opportunity to contribute to the fullest of their 
abilities and to actually participate in the creation of public 
policy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The best vehicle for that is through the committees.  They 
should be allowed to work in the way that they were initially 
designed and in the way they worked under the previous 
Conservative government under committee chairs like Don Blenkarn. 
<P><A NAME="LINK43"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Werner Schmidt (Kelowna, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank 
my hon. colleague from across the way for his remarks.  I concur 
with some of the points he has made, in particular with regard to 
the arrogance of the Prime Minister and the arrogance of the 
minister imposing this new structure on the people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think the Minister of National Revenue indicated he had not 
been successful in getting the co-operation of the premiers to do 
this, partly because he is not providing any safeguards. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The point my hon. colleague made a moment ago about the common 
sense of the people and listening to what they have to say is 
significant and I commend him for that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Could the member outline how we could get a true picture of what 
the people think?  As well, could he suggest how we could get 
some sort of true, honest to goodness co-operation among the 
federal government, the minister and the premiers of the 
provinces? Finally, how can we ensure that some of the privacy 
violations that have taken place in the past will not be 
perpetrated again by this new agency? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Scott Brison:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank my hon. colleague 
for his question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will deal with the privacy issue first.  Revenue Canada has 
actually come a long way over the last several years in being a 
kinder and gentler department.  That is not to say that there are 
not significant abuses periodically and that is not to say that 
it could not be improved. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My fear is that the progress that has been made could be largely 
undone if we develop an arm's length agency that will have, 
whatever way the government cuts it, less accountability than the 
current agency which is tied directly to parliamentarians in this 
House as a department and which reports to a minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In terms of the basic ways to improve consultation with 
Canadians, I would suggest that the government set a standard for 
its committees and actually give committees the ability to pursue 
public policy in a creative, non-partisan, consultative way. 
There is no shortage of great ideas.  Most of the people with the 
greatest ideas are not in this House because they are too smart 
to run politically or they are not masochists. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are great ideas out there and we need to make our 
political parties, our committees and this parliament more 
receptive and welcome to those people who have good ideas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I mentioned earlier, Canadians have more access to 
information now than they ever have before.  We as a parliament 
have a duty to engage Canadians in dialogue on public policy 
issues, not to tell them what is good for them necessarily, but 
to engage them in a discussion about what is good for them. 
Periodically we could actually learn something. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We do not have to reinvent the wheel.  We need to go back to the 
committee structures that have existed and have been productive 
in channelling public opinion and thought into good public 
policy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also have to be careful that public policy does not simply 
reflect short term public opinion.  That can sometimes be bad as 
well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are some great ideas out there and we need to work with 
Canadians.  If we work with Canadians and listen to some of the 
expert advice out there we will find that Canadians want and need 
a fairer, flatter tax code.

</I></B></P><P align=left>As polling indicates Canadians recognize that we have the 
highest tax of the G-7 countries.  Despite what the Minister of 
Industry has stated, this is an albatross on the productivity of 
Canadians. It is holding us back as we enter the 21st century. It 
is part of the secular decline in the Canadian dollar.  In the 
long term that decline can reduce productivity even further. 
Canadian businesses are denied the opportunity to buy some of the 
equipment and software they need to compete globally because much 
of it is imported. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We do not need to reinvent the wheel.  We could go a long way if 
we were to ensure the committee structure as it exists was 
actually used by the government and parliament the way it was 
designed to be used.  We should stop muzzling committees and 
operating them like branch plants of the ministers' offices.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Roy Bailey (Souris—Moose Mountain, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I appreciate the comments of my colleague from the 
Progressive Conservative Party.  I am glad to hear him talk about 
using committees.  Since I have been here the department has 
deliberately abused the committees. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is one thing that bothers me with the federal and 
provincial governments and it is part of the nineties.  It 
appears that it is actually deliberate that provincial and 
federal governments stage information leaks.  In doing so the 
governments are able to get a course in public opinion for much 
cheaper.  That is an abuse of committees.  It really makes 
committees look like tools of the government that are not able to 
fulfil their original purpose. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Scott Brison:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the hon. 
member's comments.  I would not want to accuse the government or 
any committee member of leaking information.  I do not know who 
is leaking the information from the committees but eight 
committees have had their reports leaked over the past several 
months.  That is clearly unacceptable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In answer to this, the government is talking about clamping down 
on the media.  That is so perverse.  As hon. members of this 
House, we pledge a certain code of conduct.  For the government 
to say it will clamp down on the media is absolutely ludicrous. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  It is a joke. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Scott Brison:</B>  The hon. member says that it is a joke. 
It is quite perverse and it is a joke but it is not that funny. 
It is a systemic issue that has to be dealt with.  I would 
certainly hope the government departments are not somehow behind 
these leaks but it reduces the credibility of the individual 
committees and it reduces the credibility and the impact of those 
reports.  Sometimes I fear the credibility of all 
parliamentarians is reduced when this kind of behaviour exists.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Beth Phinney (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
National Revenue, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I will be sharing my 
time with the hon. member for Mississauga South. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is with great pleasure that I rise to discuss Bill C-43, an 
act to establish the Canada customs and revenue agency.  As we 
conduct this final House of Commons debate on Bill C-43, I would 
like to talk about the people who work at Revenue Canada. I would 
like to talk about the fellow citizens they serve, the fellow 
citizens we serve. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is the minister's firm conviction and it is my firm 
conviction that the new Canada customs and revenue agency will be 
good for our current employees and the Canadian public.  We need 
to show leadership. We need to create the conditions that will 
make it possible to streamline the tax system.  That is what the 
agency will accomplish. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I sit down with the department's employees, be it in 
Yarmouth, Nova Scotia, Hamilton, Niagara Falls, or Windsor, I am 
struck by their dedication and their determination to make the 
system better. 
They more than anyone understand the frustration of taxpayers 
when they are confronted with different auditors from different 
levels of government.  They more than anyone see the need for new 
technology to permit most Canadians to cross the border with a 
simple Canpass so that time can be spent on higher risk areas. 
They more than anyone see the need for faster hiring practices 
and more flexible management of human resources.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The employees of Revenue Canada see better than anyone how 
taxpayers could benefit from a single window for taxes and 
one-stop shopping for tax information. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those are the reasons why we are proposing the new agency.  If 
we want a simpler system for taxpayers, we need to bring the 
provinces and territories on side.  If we want faster hiring and 
more flexible human resources management, we need to create a 
separate body with the authority for such issues as 
classifications, training and development and terms and 
conditions of employment. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The new agency would have such authority. At the same time, it 
is critical to show that we value the Canadians who work at 
Revenue Canada and who will work at the new agency. That is why 
any personnel rules of the agency will be premised on fairness 
and equity. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under Bill C-43, permanent employees of Revenue Canada are 
guaranteed two years of employment at the new agency.  This 
guarantee is more than any employees of the federal public 
service now have.  Collective agreements will remain in force. 
Pension and leave credits will remain intact.  Employees will 
have the right to compete for jobs in the federal government 
departments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Believe me, the minister is determined that all employees will 
be treated with fairness and decency.  He will strengthen the 
legislation to do just that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Public Service Commission will have the power to review and 
report on the agency's staffing procedures.  There will be a 
mandatory review of recourse mechanisms by an independent party 
after three years.  And of course, there will be a five year 
legislative review by parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps more importantly, the Minister of National Revenue will 
remain answerable for the actions of the agency on the floor of 
this House of Commons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am convinced that the new agency will offer meaningful new 
opportunities for employees.  A reduction in the number of 
occupational groups and levels will make it easier for employees 
to move between jobs.  There will be more career mobility. 
Vacancies will be filled in a few weeks rather than many months. 
A flexible agency will be able to adopt more extensive use of 
flexible hours or work at home arrangements. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are untold numbers of new possibilities to expand programs 
and services for the provinces and territories.  There are untold 
possibilities for new ways of performing work, especially with 
the growth of technology. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The critics say this is a downsizing exercise.  I say with great 
respect that they are 100% wrong.  This is an upsizing measure 
providing more opportunities for employees, more opportunities 
for growth and more opportunities to serve Canadians more 
effectively. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That brings me to the second half of the people equation: 
service to the people of Canada.  The employees of the Canada 
customs and revenue agency will be better placed to serve the 
needs of Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The small business owners in my riding of Hamilton Mountain are, 
like millions of other Canadians, honest, hardworking people who 
are willing to pay taxes.  What has frustrated them over the 
years is the paperwork from the federal government, from the 
provincial government, from the regional government, from the 
municipal government. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The new agency offers a genuine chance to bring an end to much 
of that overlap and duplication. It offers a genuine opportunity 
for all kinds of programs to be administered from a single 
source. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By simplifying the process, we can save millions upon millions 
of dollars for taxpayers.  That too is a clear example of better 
service to Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In its presentation before the Standing Committee on Finance, 
the Public Policy Forum made a vital point.  For big business the 
cost of filing tax or customs forms is relatively small in 
proportion to sales or profit.  For small businesses however, 
that is not the case at all.  The filing of forms and the costs 
of dealing with multiple audits is often a make or break 
situation for a smaller company. 
This new agency can be the first step on the road to righting 
that situation.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is another way in which a new agency can help business 
flourish in our country.  With the phenomenal growth of 
electronic commerce comes real concern about security and 
privacy.  If governments work together through the new agency, we 
can make Canada the global leader in the development of the most 
secure software and hardware. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The agency can be on the cutting edge in developing the programs 
that will give Canadians the confidence to engage fully in 
electronic commerce. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is what this bill is all about.  Better service through 
savings in time.  Better service through savings in money. Better 
service through wise use of technology.  Better service through 
new opportunities for partnerships.  Better service through more 
employee flexibility and autonomy.  Better service through 
streamlining and simplifying.  The people who work at Revenue 
Canada will be the better for the agency.  The people of Canada 
will be better for the new agency. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-43 is a positive move for public servants and a positive 
move for the public.  We have put people first in establishing 
the agency.  We have put people first in the mandate of the 
agency.  We have put people first in the operation of the agency. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I congratulate the Minister of National Revenue for this bill. I 
say to every member of parliament, let us pass this bill as 
quickly as possible.  In the end, this bill is in the public 
interest.  In the end, this bill serves the people of Canada.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gilles-A. Perron (Rivière-des-Mille-Îles, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
would like my colleague to read Hansard carefully tomorrow. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>She says she spoke with the government employees at Revenue 
Canada and that everyone is in favour. But she forgot to speak 
with Mr. Lampron. The committee received a brief from Mr. 
Lampron. She also forgot to speak with Mr. Flynn of Revenue 
Canada and with Mr. Tutti, who lives in the riding of the chair 
of the Standing Committee on Finance. She forgot to speak with 
all these people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member also said she consulted with small business 
owners in her riding. Well, her riding is like no other riding 
in Canada, for she claims that everyone is happy with the new 
agency. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But the federation representing small and medium size 
businesses across Canada submitted a brief featuring a survey it 
conducted. The hon. member should have reviewed this survey and 
its findings before delivering her speech. 
It shows that 8.1% of those surveyed saw the new agency as a 
very positive development; 24.8% as not very positive; 36% had 
no opinion; 18.6% saw it as a negative; and 14.5% as very 
negative. Where did my colleague get her information? 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Beth Phinney:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I did speak to a lot of 
people in the department, people across Canada and small 
businesses.  I have some questions that they brought to my 
attention and the answers we were able to give them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the questions I received from employees within the 
department was when would the two year employment guarantee 
begin.  It will begin the day the agency becomes a separate 
employer and employees are transferred.  In all likelihood this 
will be a few months after the passage of Bill C-43.  Time is 
going to be needed to establish the board of management. All 
employees will be informed in writing with regard to the 
effective date of the transfer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another question that was asked was would employees be able to 
transfer to a government department after the two year guarantee. 
The simple answer is yes.  Agency employees will most definitely 
be able to transfer with the same mobility rights that Revenue 
Canada employees currently possess.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have also been asked by employees what employee benefits 
carry over to the agency.  The job offer that employees will 
receive on the transition to agency includes the carryover of the 
salary, core benefits such as health and disability insurance and 
dental plan, accumulated sick leave and vacation credits, and 
pension benefits under the Public Service Superannuation Act. 
Years of services which are used for calculating leave 
entitlement and severance pay will also carry over. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A question that I was asked just last week is what unions will 
represent employees under the agency.  On the given day that the 
agency is created and becomes a separate employer, currently 
existing collective agreements will remain in effect until they 
are renegotiated.  Employees will continue to be represented by 
the same unions for a transitional period of 120 days or until 
the Public Service Staff Relations Board makes a ruling on the 
agency bargaining unit structure.  After that time there will be 
unified certification processes. 
<P><A NAME="LINK47"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jason Kenney (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
in my remarks earlier this morning I asked why the government 
voted against all the opposition motions including some very 
substantive ones which I thought were constructive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to know from the parliamentary secretary why last 
night the government voted against a motion which would have 
required that the legislation be enforced in a manner which 
respects the principles of fairness, impartiality and 
accountability. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why did the government vote against fairness, impartiality and 
accountability?  Why did the government vote against a motion 
which would have clarified that the minister was responsible for 
all aspects of the agency?  Will the government support our 
proposed taxpayers bill of rights which would enumerate more 
clearly in a single piece of legislation rights to due process 
for taxpayers? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Beth Phinney:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I do not have time to 
answer all those questions, but I will say that fairness is 
already included in the act and has been included for a number of 
years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As far as accountability, there were five major accountability 
mechanisms already in the Revenue Canada Act and there are three 
new ones.  Eight accountability mechanisms will be included in 
the agency. 
<P><A NAME="LINK48"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
am pleased to rise to speak to Bill C-43, an act to establish the 
Canada customs and revenue agency. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As with any new government undertaking there is always the 
question of what the costs will be.  During the committee's 
consideration of the bill the Minister of National Revenue tabled 
a report with the committee on the amount of money spent by the 
department to develop this agency concept.  As I am sure members 
of the committee have realized, these expenses have been very 
reasonable, especially considering the significant proposed 
changes to the agency. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Over the last two and half years Revenue Canada has had between 
nine and fifteen persons working at any one time directly on this 
agency proposal.  This staff has been drawn from other areas 
within the department. The total cost over that two and a half 
years has been just over $3 million. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, considerable work has been done on the design and 
development of a new human resources regime.  This work has 
contributed to the broad objectives for public service renewal 
such as la relève, as well as the human resources requirements 
for the agency.  Like all other departments, Revenue Canada has 
been focusing a great deal of attention on its human resources 
needs.  The expenditures to date of about $2.8 million over three 
years will be a very worthwhile investment in the future of 
Revenue Canada employees. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I emphasize that the money spent today on design and development 
is an investment that will reap tremendous benefits in the future 
efficient and effective management of the Revenue Canada agency. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are talking about some very important changes in management 
style as well management processes and procedures which will 
bring productivity gains that will pay for the development costs 
many times over.  The agency will benefit from a significant 
reduction in time and effort spent on complex and cumbersome 
administrative processes.  Reducing hiring time and eliminating 
the large number of vacant positions will substantially reduce 
staffing costs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Simplification of the classification system will also allow 
employees to transfer more easily to jobs that need to be filled. 
Simplified and more responsive recourse mechanisms will also 
significantly reduce the waste of time and energy and the cost of 
litigation.

<A HREF="#LINKT33"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The result of all this will be to allow employees at all levels 
to concentrate on their job of providing service to the Canadian 
public rather than wasting their time on administrative 
activities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Savings from the productivity gains will be reinvested in the 
tax and customs programs of the agency in order to improve levels 
of service to the public while maintaining the integrity of our 
overall income tax system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are savings to be made through modernizing many of the 
administrative processes that Revenue Canada must now follow.  To 
do this effectively new authorities are required.  The 
fundamental changes that are foreseen simply cannot be 
accomplished in the existing departmental structure.  The changes 
are too great and the existing structures are all too rigid. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are some very important safeguards in the proposed new 
structure, especially in so far as financial management is 
concerned.  I can assure that the parliamentary oversight of the 
agency's financial management will be retained.  The agency will 
still be governed by the Financial Administration Act as well as 
the policies and procedures of the Treasury Board and the 
Receiver General for Canada with respect to matters of financial 
management and the treatment of public moneys. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The budget of the Canada customs and revenue agency will still 
have to be approved as part of the government's overall 
expenditure management system.  It will be subject to the normal 
Treasury Board approval process and no money will be spent before 
being approved by parliament.  Parliament will also continue to 
receive at least as much information for the agency as it does 
now for Revenue Canada.  The agency's financial statements will 
be prepared in accordance with standard government accounting 
practices. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to talk a little about the user fees issue for a moment. 
Quite a myth has been built up over the potential use by the 
agency of increased user fees.  I want to lay this myth to rest. 
Nothing in the bill would give the agency the authority to set 
fees.  The situation respecting user fees will be the same as it 
is now with Revenue Canada.  There are many controls in the 
current system over the charging of fees to which the agency will 
be subject.  Let me outline these controls. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, the minister will have to approve any new or increased 
fees. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, the full regulatory process must be used for new or 
increased fees, including the requirement to consult with those 
affected and to receive governor in council approval. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Third, the agency's corporate business plan will have to outline 
the strategy related to the spending of fees.  This plan must be 
approved by Treasury Board and the summary must be tabled in 
parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Fourth, parliament will have to approve the agency's 
appropriations which include the proposals for the spending of 
fees. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no danger that the agency will abuse user fees because 
the government and parliament will have full control over how 
fees are established. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some significant savings will arise from the new agency as have 
been outlined by a number of colleagues who have already spoken 
on the bill.  The public policy forum, an independent 
organization with extensive experience in public sector 
management, outlined in its study examining costs of compliance 
with and administration of Canada's tax systems and the savings 
from a single administration system, said there could be 
significant savings to Canadian businesses, particularly small 
businesses, from a single revenue administration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Peter O'Brien, vice-president of Atlantic Canada for the 
Canadian Federation of Independent Business, confirmed this when 
he appeared before the House of Commons Standing Committee on 
Finance on November 24, 1998.  He said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There's only one taxpayer in the end, and to have more than one 
agency... I think is inefficient....  Time is very significant for 
business, particularly smaller firms. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>More precisely, the public policy forum study estimated that the 
level of compliance savings to business each year would be 
between $116 million and $193 million at a minimum.  The study 
also examined the administrative cost to government of tax 
collection and the potential savings.  It found that there was a 
high potential for savings in the areas of personal income tax, 
corporate income tax and payroll tax because of the similarities 
at the federal and provincial levels as well as in a common 
collection system.  This reduction in overlap and duplication 
will result in real savings to governments at all levels. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the study outlined, in total it was estimated that 
administrative costs to governments could be reduced by between 
$37 million and $62 million annually at a minimum.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Right now the provinces, the territories and the federal 
government have tax measures and tax administrations that deal 
with similar kinds of transactions with the same taxpayers.  This 
in essence is the reason why consolidation of these activities is 
so important. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Provinces and territories will obviously invest their money 
where they can achieve real savings from the central 
administration of a program.  A single administration would 
result in real cost savings to the provinces.  The point to be 
made is that the potential savings to individual Canadians, 
businesses and governments far outweigh the start-up and new 
operating costs of the proposed agency. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are entering the new world of the 21st century.  There will 
be a vast array of new technologies.  Electronic commerce is 
becoming one of the most important new mechanisms of the 21st 
century, which has the potential for creating significant 
improvements in productivity of Canadians in general.  It also 
has the potential for making it much easier to deal with the tax 
man through such mechanisms as electronic filing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Electronic commerce, which involves the transfers of billions of 
dollars from one jurisdiction to another, also has frightening 
potential to hide money.  Transactions that take place in the 
wink of an eye are very difficult to track.  We need to be able 
to respond to that.  It concerns me that the federal and 
provincial governments might take approaches to this issue which 
are not well co-ordinated.  One way to start co-ordinating this 
activity would be to have tax administrations that are well 
co-ordinated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Modern problems require modern solutions.  The time has come to 
seize the opportunity presented to us with the new Canada customs 
and revenue agency for the generation of benefits to the 
provinces and the territories as well as to Canadian businesses 
and our citizens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, as we enter the new millennium, Canada needs a 
revitalized and more comprehensive Revenue Canada to serve the 
best interest of all Canadians.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jean-Paul Marchand (Québec East, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I had to 
laugh when I heard my colleague from Mississauga South mention 
that this new agency would be able to solve the long standing 
problems that have been plaguing Revenue Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is trying to fool people, especially when we see what the 
agency will have to offer. There is an old saying that “Taxation 
without representation is tyranny”. Others say that 
representation, now that we have it, is worse than tyranny. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government wants to set up an agency whose decision-making 
powers are removed from the elected representatives. 
It will have many powers including the authority to administer 
and impose regulations that might take unfair advantage of 
taxpayers even more than now. The current government seems to 
turn a blind eye to the increasing poverty in this country. It 
seems bent on reducing taxes for the rich. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to put a question to my colleague regarding clause 
8 of the bill. This clause seems to grant limitless powers to 
the agency. I would like to ask the member for Mississauga South 
for his views on this clause. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will now read the most significant sentence of this clause:

terms and conditions that the minister specify, to exercise or 
perform on the Minister's behalf any power, duty or function of 
the Minister under any Act of Parliament or of a province.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Szabo:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the governing of a country 
is not a laughing matter.  Had the member been listening to the 
speech, he would understand that there is no change in terms of 
the accountability and control of the minister or the 
accountability or access of parliamentarians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member should stop with the rhetoric and start understanding 
that as Canada enters into the new millennium the whole concept 
of e-commerce, the whole concept of productivity and the whole 
concept of working smart and not hard are very important to 
embrace.  Revenue Canada is in a situation right now where it 
cannot move forward with the existing structures and existing 
rigidity in its system.  We have to move into the next 
millennium.  Whether the Bloc wants to come or not is its 
decision.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jason Kenney (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
it is very interesting that the member for Mississauga South just 
berated the other member for engaging in rhetoric.  I do not 
suppose all that millenarian stuff has anything rhetorical about 
it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member said the changes which the government 
seeks could not be achieved without becoming an agency. It is 
rather circular thinking to stay it cannot become an agency 
without becoming an agency.  I do not deny that but I what I do 
deny is that we could not make the personnel management policies 
more flexible without becoming an agency.  The Library of 
Parliament says so, the public policy forum says so, the Canadian 
Tax Foundation says so.  The government has presented no evidence 
to say it could not amend Treasury Board guidelines and the 
public service governing legislation to allow them to employ 
people on a more flexible basis as needed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does he not believe that with a board and a commissioner between 
ourselves and the agency's day to day activities accountability 
could and potentially will be diminished under the new agency? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Szabo:</B>  Mr. Speaker, there is no question that 
Revenue Canada could be restructured in any way the member wants. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I said to the previous questioner, we have to work smart, not 
hard.  It is like changing the oil in your car without changing 
the filter.  It does not good because you continue to have some 
of the same fundamental problems.  It is time to get a renewed 
Revenue Canada, a revitalized Revenue Canada, a Revenue Canada 
built on a foundation for the new millennium, not for history. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member asked about the board.  There is no question that to 
have a board to oversee the day to day operations is important. 
Members of parliament and the minister will have absolutely no 
diminished accessibility or accountability. It is all still 
there.  The member is worried about the spectres of somebody else 
being between us and the people in the front lines.  Frankly, I 
am not afraid of our Canadian public service being able to do a 
very good job on behalf of all Canadians regardless of who is 
administering day to day.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ted White (North Vancouver, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is 
nice to have you in the chair again.  It seems to becoming 
habitual that you happen to be on shift just at the time I am 
giving my speeches.  It is nice to have you trapped there. Even 
if the House is empty you are forced to listen to my speech, so I 
thank you very much for that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will be splitting my time with the member for New 
Westminister—Coquitlam—Burnaby. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member who just spoke mentioned the new millennium.  It made 
me think of the fact that the new millennium actually starts at 
the end of the year 2000, that is December 31, 2000, not at the 
end of 1999 when the government will waste huge amounts of money, 
hundreds of millions of dollars, on meaningless millennium 
celebrations.  It is typical of the government to be totally out 
of touch with reality. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Swiss apparently are not going to celebrate the change of 
the millennium until the correct time which is the end of 2000, 
typical Swiss punctuality.  They make good watches so they know 
how to measure time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Somebody asked me what New Zealanders are doing and I am not 
really sure.  I could get myself into trouble with that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One other thing I wanted to mention in relation to this before 
getting into the meat of Bill C-43 is that the government has 
moved time allocation on every stage of the bill.  This is the 
government that when it was in opposition screamed like crazy 
every time the Mulroney government moved closure or time 
allocation.  When we look at its record in the 35th parliament it 
moved time allocation 32 times and closure    times.  In this 
parliament, just less than a year, it has moved time allocation 
10 times. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The total since it took office in 1993-94 is time allocation 42 
times and closure 3 times.  I can see the government is shocked 
at that.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know when it was in opposition it was shocked at Mulroney for 
doing it at about half that rate.  This government is actually 
worse than the one that preceded it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It seems any discussion about this bill, an act to establish the 
Canada customs and revenue agency, must of necessity involve the 
detailed consideration of the need for accountability and for 
transparency of operations in such a new agency. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Plenty of Canadians consider the existing Revenue Canada to be 
less than appropriately accountable.  It is important that we 
address their concerns when we are considering this whole 
application of Bill C-43. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To illustrate the point, how many members have actually tried to 
call Revenue Canada to ask about a tax problem, but not as 
members of parliament?  Members have have secret telephone 
numbers that are not published and we can get through directly to 
real people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope they have tried to do that because it is an incredibly 
frustrating and upsetting experience.  Not only is it rare to 
reach a real person by telephone but when someone does, it is 
virtually impossible to get the name of the person. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the person ever has to call back, my goodness, it is almost 
guaranteed that they will get someone completely different and 
they will have to explain the entire problem all over again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If someone tries to make a personal visit to the place from 
which emanate these notices of taxes due or the ones that contain 
all sorts of errors that we are constantly trying to fix, they 
would be in for a surprise. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many of those offices do not actually seem to have real people 
there.  Some tax offices whose addresses are shown on the 
envelopes that we receive in the mail from these places do not 
even have a public reception area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A visitor to the building gets the distinct impression the 
employees sneak in the back door so that they can avoid 
recognition.  Even for MPs, though, with this special and 
privileged access through these unpublished numbers, it is not 
always easy to get answers or to get action. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a great and pressing need for a better level of service 
along with the greater efficiency that would flow from allowing 
taxpayers to at least speak to the same person each time they 
call.  This alone would surely invoke enormous efficiencies and I 
hope the government would consider that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Imagine not having to explain one's tax problem story all over 
again to a different person every time they call Revenue Canada. 
What a pleasure it would be to be given the name and direct 
contact number for a Revenue Canada employee who looks after a 
certain set of accounts.  Problems surely could be dealt with 
more efficiently if that sort of system were in place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The well documented experience with the existing agency demands 
of us that we build into Bill C-43 some accountability.  Some 
sort of taxpayer bill of rights is a great idea.  I know my 
colleagues have mentioned this in their speeches as well as 
establishing an independent ombudsman type of office for taxpayer 
protection. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Such an office would have the right to demand accountability and 
would obviously have access to all the files in the new agency. 
It would have to be directly accountable to parliament, something 
that must happen with the new Revenue Canada agency anyway. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We cannot allow a government created agency that touches on 
the lives of each and every taxpayer or potential taxpayer to 
operate without direct accountability to parliament and to the 
members of parliament.  It is simply not good enough to establish 
accountability to the minister.  There must be a greater amount 
of transparency and accountability than simply to the minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The present agency and the proposed new one would come in for 
far less criticism and attack if this government would take steps 
to reduce the taxes presently collected from citizens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>People are so financially stressed by the tax load imposed on 
them that they are going into the underground economy.  Some 
small businesses are not able to pay their instalments and people 
are getting into difficulties with Revenue Canada simply because 
they are overtaxed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They are taking on more and more of a personal debt load as a 
result of that income shortfall and the ministers of taxation, 
the Minister of Finance and the Minister of National Revenue, 
live high on the hog as multimillionaires as we know. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What do they know of the pressures being felt by the small 
business operators and the average wage earners across the 
country?  I would say little or nothing.  As we know, they live 
in a dream world of parliamentary receptions, state dinners, 
holiday residences in the country and international travel.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps like the Prime Minister they get their advice from 
imaginary homeless people.  There is no doubt, though, that they 
are hopelessly out of touch with the real world of the average 
wage earner. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It reminds me of the Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern 
Development who is out in B.C. at the moment travelling around 
trying to promote the Nisga'a treaty even though 40% of the 
Nisga'a themselves rejected it.  Nobody has asked why 40%, almost 
half, of the Nisga'a rejected this treaty.  Maybe the government 
and the minister should do that but they do not want to listen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is just like this bill. The government will not listen to 
input that comes from the average person.  Eighty per cent of 
B.C. residents have expressed displeasure with the treaty and all 
they hear from this government is that they have a racist 
attitude when it is in fact genuine concern. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister lives in a dream world of political correctness. 
She applauds Nelson Mandela but here she is trying to set up an 
identical sort of apartheid like system in B.C. with these types 
of treaties where we could have as many as 50 different 
governments in B.C. each with its own set of laws and no 
protection whatsoever for the rank and file members on the 
reserves to have the money and benefits flow to them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have so many bands in B.C. that are not democratically 
structured where there are high ranking chiefs in place who are 
taking all the benefits and flowthrough that come from these 
types of treaties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a Squamish band in my riding.  In the last week alone 
five different band members have called, urging me to vote 
against Bill C-49 they are afraid that all the benefits will flow 
to the chiefs. On the Squamish band reserve in North Vancouver 
there are 16 different chiefs.  It is all hierarchal with no 
democracy in place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not just for this bill but for all the measures this 
government is looking at, it really needs to get a little more 
down to the grassroots and start listening to the average person 
and the input that comes from them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately, because we are running out of time, I cannot go 
through all this other wonderful stuff that I have down here 
which I know would amuse some of the members opposite, but I will 
try to get another chance to get up later in questions and 
comments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I finish by urging the government side to listen to the input 
that has come from my colleagues on this side regarding a 
taxpayer bill of rights.  There is really a good logical reason 
to have at least a set of principles by which the new agency 
should act. 
<P><A NAME="LINK52"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
thank the hon. member for the first three-quarters of his speech 
in which he outlined the precise reasons why it is important for 
this new revenue agency to be set up.  He outlined very clearly 
and very sincerely all the areas in which Canadians want and 
deserve better service.  I therefore thank the hon. member for 
giving such wonderful support from the Reform Party for this new 
revenue agency. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member spent the last portion of his speech talking about a 
different issue, the Nisga'a agreement.  I overheard some 
colleagues commenting that when the member had a problem with 60% 
in favour and only 40% opposed, what about that 40%?  He said it 
was terrible but this is the party that argued that 50% plus 1 
was okay to break up the country.  What irony; 60% is not good 
enough for a treaty but 50% plus 1 is good enough to break up a 
country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member did touch on two items relevant to the bill or at 
least what he thought was not in the bill.  First was the issue 
of an ombudsman.  He answered his own question by suggesting that 
members of parliament do have these special facilities to 
communicate on behalf of their constituents with Revenue Canada. 
Therefore Canadians do have an ombudsman. In fact, they have 301 
ombudsmen. 
Each and every one of us has that responsibility.  I know we have 
all served our constituents.

<A HREF="#LINKT38"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other item, and this is the point of the question I would 
like to pose to the member, was with regard to the taxpayers bill 
of rights.  It is an interesting notion.  Would the member 
articulate two or three examples of what might be included in a 
taxpayers bill of rights? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ted White:</B>  Mr. Speaker, first I would like to comment 
on the opening remarks of the member opposite. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In terms of the things that I identified which should be in the 
bill and the changes that should be made to Revenue Canada, yes 
this is true, these are changes that everyone feels should be 
made.  We feel that this bill does not go far enough in 
establishing the criteria that should be taken into account.  We 
want to see democratic consideration of what the people out there 
in the world want in this new tax agency.  In just a moment I 
will come back to some specific points on that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What I would like to mention first is in connection with the 
percentages of people who vote for one thing or another.  I made 
no judgments whatsoever about whether the Nisga'a vote being 60% 
to 40% was an appropriate percentage to create a country within a 
country or to break up a country.  I made no judgments about that 
at all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The point I made was that 40% of the Nisga'a people voted 
against what the politically correct government over there thinks 
is a wonderful treaty.  My point was why not ask the 40% who are 
not being asked why they did not like it.  Maybe that 40% had 
some critical reasons why they did not like it. I can tell the 
member why they do not.  It is because they are afraid that the 
power and the benefits will flow to a few at the top.  If the 
member does not recognize that scenario from his own party, then 
he needs more lessons on the topic. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It has absolutely nothing to do with whether 50% plus 1% is 
appropriate for Quebec separation, or whether 60% is appropriate 
for the Nisga'a to separate.  They certainly are separating if 
that treaty goes ahead because there will be a new country within 
a country. There is absolutely no doubt about that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since the member opposite does not appear to have read the 
document that the official opposition put out called “Protecting 
the Rights of Canadians—The Office for Taxpayer Protection”, I 
will give him a few points from it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The office for taxpayer protection under the chief advocate 
would be responsible for assisting taxpayers in resolving 
disputes or problems where the mechanism within the agency itself 
was not being helpful.  They could propose changes to 
administrative practices within the new agency in order to 
minimize problems that are encountered by taxpayers.  Sometimes 
those close to the action do not always see the best way to 
proceed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, I see you are cutting me off again.  This is really 
bad news.  There is such a lot to discuss here but I will take 
your ruling and I will sit down. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  I know that the hon. member would 
have preferred to have the full 20 minutes instead of sharing his 
time but since he shared his time, I have to enforce the rules. 
<P><A NAME="LINK53"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Forseth (New Westminster—Coquitlam—Burnaby, 
Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, this is Christmas time in Canada.  It is 
known as the time of giving, not taking. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are here today talking about government behaviour and how it 
takes its taxes. From my historical reference book which sits on 
the clerk's table in front of me in the centre aisle of this 
Commons chamber, I want to quote a relevant portion about taxes 
at Christmas time.  The book is the fundamental legal and 
cultural base reference work for Canadian society, where we look 
at the roots of our Canadian origin. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can understand from the reference I will quote that it has 
long been viewed as legitimate that governments can tax, can 
count its subjects and render economic recompense to the central 
authority. Specifically the Bible says in Luke, chapter two: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>And it came to pass in those days, that there went out a decree 
from Caesar Augustus, that all the world should be taxed.  And 
this taxing was first made when Cyrenius was governor of Syria. 
And all went to be taxed, every one into his own city.  And 
Joseph also went up from Galilee, out of the city of Nazareth, 
into Judaea, unto the city of David, which is called Bethlehem, 
(because he was of the house and lineage of David) to be taxed 
with Mary his espoused wife—

<A HREF="#LINKT39"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We learn from this venerable reference that indeed taxes, levies 
or a portion of production including the census of all, has 
traditionally been taken from individuals to serve the purposes 
of those in power. Therefore in history governments tax and 
people pay.  It has always been that way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However the fundamental political question for our society now 
is how the government takes or collects its taxes and how, with 
its degree of wisdom, does it use the revenue taken. For some 
years now Canadian governments have taxed too much, spent too 
much and thus we owe too much.  And now at Christmas time we are 
presented in this parliament with a whole new regime of federal 
taxation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill changes the legal basis of how taxes are collected.  We 
are creating a new agency that is something akin to a crown 
corporation, as we have known them in Canada, as the final 
controller of economic life. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Specifically the government has proposed Bill C-43 which 
establishes the Canada customs and revenue agency to carry out 
the mandate of the Department of National Revenue and repeals the 
Department of National Revenue Act.  The Minister of National 
Revenue is named as the minister responsible for the agency. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister continues to be accountable for the administration 
and enforcement of federal tax, trade and customs legislation. 
The agency supports the minister in the administration and 
enforcement of such legislation and the minister directs the 
commissioner of customs and revenue and the agency employees in 
that regard. The enactment also authorizes the agency to contract 
with the provinces to administer provincial tax and other 
programs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This enactment sets out the responsibilities, accountability 
regime, organization, human and financial resources regime and 
planning and reporting framework of the agency.  It establishes a 
board of management to oversee the management of the agency and 
gives the commissioner of customs and revenue responsibility for 
day to day management of the agency as its chief executive 
officer. The minister may issue written directions to the agency 
in matters within the authority and responsibility of the board 
that affect public policy or could materially affect public 
finances. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The agency continues to be subject to Treasury Board's 
requirements with respect to financial management but has its own 
authorities for matters such as human resources, contracting and 
property management. The agency must annually submit a corporate 
business plan to the minister for recommendation to the Treasury 
Board and the minister must table a summary of the plan in 
parliament. The plan must include the strategies the agency 
intends to use to meet its human resources and other 
administrative objectives as well as the proposed operating and 
capital budgets. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill may be the sleeper hold on Canadians which will catch 
us unaware.  The bill is a dramatic historical change.  It is 
powerful and pervasive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Consequently the official opposition has put forward a 
comprehensive proposal for a taxpayer bill of rights. It would 
enumerate for the first time in federal law a number of rights to 
due process for taxpayers in the collection system. There are 
rights existing now with manuals of operation, interpretation 
bulletins and various rulings, but a single charter list of 
performance standards and actionable rules that are listed up 
front for taxpayers to hang on to just is not there. It has never 
been administratively convenient for bureaucracies to be user 
friendly or too willing to provide its servant clients with too 
much bargaining power against the official edicts of the 
department. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Essentially our draft taxpayer bill of rights would have 
legislative force.  It would essentially ensure in legislation 
that taxpayers would be presumed innocent until proven guilty in 
the tax process.  It would reverse the onus which is now on 
taxpayers who too often are determined to be guilty and 
financially penalized before even being ruled innocent. 
Furthermore it would give taxpayers various avenues of appeal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Currently if taxpayers of ordinary means find, as they do in 
many cases, that they have been unduly targeted by a heartless 
collection agent at Revenue Canada, they have only one real 
avenue of recourse and that is through the tax court.  The vast 
majority of people of modest means do not have the resources to 
use the appeal process through the courts.  They cannot hire tax 
lawyers and spend months and years and tens of thousands of 
dollars defending their basic rights. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We propose as part of our taxpayer bill of rights the adoption 
of an office for taxpayer protection which would essentially be 
an ombudsman to adjudicate legitimate disputes between taxpayers 
and the revenue agency.  It would essentially provide an avenue 
of appeal and mediation which would be far less costly and far 
more accessible to taxpayers than what currently exists.  These 
two measures, a taxpayer bill of rights and the adoption of an 
office of taxpayer protection, would go a very long way toward 
protecting Canadian taxpayers in the new era of the Canada 
customs and revenue agency.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can see no good reason, nor has the government offered a 
single good reason, why a taxpayer bill of rights ought not to be 
introduced and passed as part of the bill before us today. I call 
on the government to consider our sincere, detailed and 
thoughtful proposal for a taxpayer bill of rights.  If the 
minister were to give us an inclination that he was willing to 
seriously consider this kind of recommendation that we have made, 
we in turn as the official opposition certainly would seriously 
consider fully supporting the bill because of some of the 
administrative innovations that may be achieved by it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is clear that many Canadians are not satisfied with the level 
of fairness and due process in the tax collection system. There 
is a need to entrench and protect the taxpayers rights as the 
agency becomes more distant from government. In a previous speech 
I outlined some of the suggested specific terms of a list of 
written rights which parallel some of the rules of fundamental 
justice concerning due process. There are some rights now but 
taxpayers do not know them and there is no tax charter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, it must be a fundamental principle and it would 
be of a Reform government, that the rights of taxpayers must 
supersede the efficiency enhancements or the interests of the 
agency.  We must guard against agency interests overwhelming 
taxpayer interests.  Let us never forget about who works for 
whom. Certainly we have evolved somewhat since Caesar taxed the 
world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As Reformers proceed to get support for a more simplified and 
flatter tax system, we are going to try to be vigilant to monitor 
that any benefits derived from the new CCRA are not lost due to 
the greater damage wrought upon taxpayers through poor 
implementation and assaults upon taxpayers' basic dignity of the 
person.  An office of taxpayer protection in place to enforce the 
taxpayer bill of rights represents a very low cost, partially 
self-financing, effective tool for protecting citizens and 
ensuring that the human cost of change and implementation are 
carefully considered.  For, in spite of the technical nature of 
revenue collection, it is still all about people and how we as a 
society organize ourselves to be governed with fairness, equality 
and above all, compassion.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the member really wanted to talk about the taxpayer bill of 
rights. Bill C-43 is a bill to establish an agency, virtually to 
create a new foundation for an existing government department. 
The member is a lawyer.  Does he believe that a taxpayer bill of 
rights would be better positioned within Bill C-43 or would it 
make more sense to incorporate it into the Income Tax Act itself 
as a provision or regulation of the act where it legitimately 
belongs? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Forseth:</B>  Mr. Speaker, perhaps we could take the 
example of the Criminal Code. The Criminal Code spells out the 
offences which would be the equivalent of the tax act itself, the 
technical parts.  Yet when we deal with young offenders, we want 
to give special consideration on how we deal with children. The 
Young Offenders Act deals with process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill is a covering bill which sets up how the collection of 
taxes is going to be done in this structure.  This is the more 
appropriate place to have a charter of basic rights that would be 
actionable, that talks about how in spirit as well as with the 
office of the ombudsman and so on that tax would be collected.  I 
think it is the most appropriate place to put it.

would like to comment on what the hon. member for Mississauga 
South said to one of my colleagues, because I was insulted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If I understand correctly, he said that making changes to the 
revenue department for the next millennium would be like 
changing the oil without changing the oil filter.  This is an 
insult to the employees of the revenue department. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member for Mississauga South should have compared the 
establishment of this agency to the construction of a new 
vehicle, as the revenue minister did.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I answered that the new vehicle put together by the department 
does not look too good.  The best clients, the provinces, were 
not even consulted, so we could find out whether or not this 
vehicle would sell.  In my opinion, it will not sell. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like the Reform member to tell me why the provinces will 
not buy Bill C-43. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Forseth:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I believe the provinces 
will adopt a wait and see approach.  If the government in its 
carrying forward of the bill is sensitive and works in a 
co-operative partnership manner perhaps it will build support. 
That is the same approach we are asking for in the taxpayers bill 
of rights to deal with the taxpayers who basically pay the bill, 
the very reason the agency exists. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why can it not be said clearly upfront that taxpayers have a 
right to be treated in a professional manner?  The professional 
manner has been well defined in the schools of public 
administration.  Taxpayers have the right to understand laws with 
which they are required to comply.  There are international 
discussions between parliamentarians about what plain language 
means.  There has been a lot of debate about plain language.  One 
can get a master's degree on that point. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Taxpayers have the right to pay the amount of tax required to by 
law and no more.  Revenue officials should inform taxpayers of 
overpayment.  Taxpayers have the right to record any and all 
meetings with Revenue Canada-CCR officials without being required 
to give notice to do so.  If the government does the right thing 
it will develop co-operation.

from both sides of the House today.   On one side I heard about 
coming onstream, being smart and getting into the new century. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why are the provincial governments not jumping on board the new 
taxation vehicle that is being created in the bill that has come 
before us through closure? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Forseth:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the record is that they 
have not been doing so.  None of the provinces have jumped on 
board.  We will see if the agency actually delivers what it is 
said to deliver.  This is something the auditor general talked 
about in the past. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have legislation and a lot of fancy advertising that proposes 
certain things, but when they are examined for their dollar value 
they do not deliver what was proposed.  We will see whether or 
not the agency is innovative.  The true test is in the pudding. 
The provinces may sign on if the government makes delivery in a 
proper manner.

<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The establishment of the new Canada customs and revenue agency 
is a major undertaking.  Questions have been raised during 
consultations with the provinces, territories, clients and the 
public.  The question of accountability is one that came up 
frequently during these consultations.  It is an important issue 
and I will address it in my speech. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Basically, everyone wants the proposed new agency to be 
responsible for its actions and for the manner in which it 
operates.  I wish to assure members that ministerial 
accountability for program legislation will be maintained, as 
will overall control of the agency by the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As is now the case, members will be able to ask the Minister of 
National Revenue to look into the handling of a file. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-43 establishes a number of accountability mechanisms that 
will ensure the agency, despite its new structure and potential 
increased services on behalf of the provinces and territories, 
will remain accountable to parliament, to its clients and to the 
public for its actions.

</I></B></P><P align=left>For instance, the minister will remain accountable as provided

agency's auditor as stipulated in clause 87 of the bill. There is 
a five year legislative review as specified in clause 89 of the 
bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A corporate business plan is to be submitted to the minister for 
recommendation to Treasury Board for approval.  The minister then 
tables the summary of the approved plan in parliament as provided 
for in clause 49 of the bill.  An annual report on operations 
will be tabled by the minister in parliament as stipulated in 
clause 88 of the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Public Service Commission can periodically review the 
compatibility of the principles governing the agency staffing

Employment Act.  It may report its findings in its annual report 
as outlined in subclause 56(2).  There is a mandatory review of 
recourse mechanisms by a third party after three years as

results will be included in the agency's annual report to 
parliament. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of National Revenue will remain responsible for the 
administration and enforcement of program legislation such as 
the Income Tax Act, the Excise Act, and the Customs Act.  He 
will also be able to direct officials in the exercise of 
authorities under this legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister is currently named 1,470 times in various pieces of 
program legislation as the person with the authority to exercise 
specific actions, such as assessing tax returns. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister will continue to be the person named to exercise 
those authorities.  This means that the minister will retain 
personal accountability for the way tax and customs programs are 
run.  This direct accountability ensures that the minister has 
the authority to inquire into any matter of program 
administration.  This is important, because the minister can 
ensure that clients of the agency have been treated fairly and 
equitably. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister will continue to respond to questions in the House 
and from the public on program and policy matters.  He will 
continue to be able to respond to members of parliament when 
their constituents seek their help in dealing with tax or 
customs matters.  However, while the minister is accountable for 
how the programs are carried out, the agency has a considerable 
amount of autonomy in matters of internal management. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The agency will be directed by a board of management which will 
be accountable to parliament through the minister responsible for 
management policies of the agency such as human resource 
activities like staffing and compensation, mandates for 
negotiating with its bargaining agents in collective bargaining 
agreements, services and performance standards, and the 
appropriate allocation of internal resources. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some people have expressed concern that the board of management 
consisting of private sector individuals might ignore the public 
interest and act in a way that is motivated only by revenue 
generation.  There are sufficient checks and balances in the bill 
to ensure that the agency will remain within the overall 
government policy framework.

Chartered Accountants when he appeared before the House of 
Commons Standing Committee on Finance on November 24:

</I></B></P><P align=left>We recommended that the existing ministerial oversight of the 
revenue system exercised by the minister of revenue be 
maintained.... It is clear that the comments provided on this

We're pleased that under Bill C-43, the minister of revenue will 
retain responsibility for the agency and it will be structured to 
allow for close ministerial oversight and, in particular, that 
the minister's power of inquiry into any activity of the agency 
will be maintained.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ghislain Lebel (Chambly, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I listened with 
great interest to the speech made by my colleague opposite. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The concern for the opposition, and the member will certainly 
understand that, is that all these agencies that have multiplied 
under the Liberals, whether it be Nav Canada, Canada Post 
Corporation or Canada Housing and Mortgage Corporation, are all 
independently managed. There are accountable to the House only 
once a year when they table their financial statement, and if it 
is even ever so slightly positive, there are no questions asked. 
If there were no losses, there were no problems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, if the taxpayers want a precise answer to a particular 
question, the minister washes his hands of everything and says 
he cannot do anything because it is an agency. That is what all 
the opposition parties are speaking out against in the House, 
namely the fact that the government is making sure that it  does 
not have to answer our questions from now on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to ask the member if he does not see the risk that this 
kind of agency could become a patronage haven, as was 
unfortunately the case with Canada Post Corporation, for 
example. Are these agencies required to go to the lowest bidder 
when awarding a contract or do they just go down the list of 
Liberal Party contributors? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the member not see the danger in taking assets out of the 
hands of regular public servants to have them managed by friends 
of the government? We want to hear what he has to say on that 
particular point and nothing else. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul DeVillers:</B> Mr. Speaker, had the hon. member listened 
more carefully to what I said, he would have realized that this 
agency is different from the other agencies he just mentioned. 
The minister remains responsible for the agency. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We parliamentarians will continue to have the opportunity to ask 
the minister to intervene, if our constituents, our voters, have 
a problem with the agency. This is not how it goes with other 
agencies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is why I believe this agency will be more accountable. 
Every year, the minister must submit a corporate business plan 
to the President of the Treasury Board, who in turn will table 
it in the House. The auditor general will be auditing the 
agency's books. This agency is different from the others in many 
regards, in my opinion.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yves Rocheleau (Trois-Rivières, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would

</I></B></P><P align=left>Can he tell me, since this agency will have the power to collect 
taxes on behalf of the federal government—taking the place of 
Revenue Canada, which, in itself, is a major step, given the 
drawbacks my colleague from Chambly just mentioned with respect 
to parliament's role—and on behalf of the provinces, 
municipalities, school boards and those private businesses that 
wish to avail themselves of this service, where this is leading 
Canada as a political entity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does it not look like provincial governments will soon be 
nothing more than regional government? Are we not moving toward 
a centralized, unitary Canada, where Quebec will not truly feel 
at home? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul DeVillers:</B> Mr. Speaker, the first thing we must take 
into consideration is the fact that the agreements the agency 
may sign with the provinces or any other government are 
voluntary agreements. The provinces that do not want to 
participate do not have to. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, I am surprised that members of the Bloc Quebecois, who

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lynn Myers (Waterloo—Wellington, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I begin by noting that accountability and fairness are the 
cornerstones of our government's legislation, policies, 
regulations and processes.  Certainly residents in 
Waterloo—Wellington, indeed Canadians everywhere, understand and 
know this to be true. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Fairness is an essential foundation to the entire revenue 
administration.  It is a system based on voluntary compliance and 
if the clients do not believe they are being treated fairly, one 
cannot expect them to comply voluntarily. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Revenue Canada is already a world leader in treating citizens in 
a fair and equitable manner in the delivery of customs and 
revenue programs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Despite this excellent record, the Minister of National Revenue 
launched the fairness initiative in March of this year to solicit 
feedback on the fairness of the department's programs. More 
specifically, it looked at the measures that were in place, 
evaluated how well the department was doing at providing fairness 
and identified improvements that will be made to provide a 
greater level of fairness to Revenue Canada's clients. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The consultations were broad and comprehensive.  Canadians from 
all walks of life were asked for their views on the department's 
record at being fair as well as to identify opportunities which 
would make the system even fairer.  Consultations included 
speaking to and listening to the general public, the department's 
independent advisory committees, stakeholder groups and Revenue 
Canada's managers and frontline staff. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To ensure the entire process would be objective, Revenue Canada 
partnered with the Conference Board of Canada to analyse results, 
hold a national symposium to verify priorities and to produce an 
independent report. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As well, a comparative assessment was undertaken of the best 
practices of other customs and revenue administrations around the 
world.  As a conference board report states, Revenue Canada is 
well regarded among Canadians and among international customs and 
revenue agencies as a leader, an innovator and an effective 
organization, truly a strong voice of confidence to it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many suggestions have been received to make further improvements 
to the fairness of Revenue Canada, and its officials are in the 
process of developing an action plan for the minister's 
consideration.  This action plan, along with the conference board 
report, will be released by the minister in early 1999. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One message was crystal clear in all this. Revenue Canada needs 
to continue strengthening the organization to make fairness an 
ongoing part of every employee's job.  Taking the responsibility 
for fairness out of Revenue Canada and giving it to the 
taxpayers' advocate and ombudsman or an office of taxpayer 
protection is not what Canadians are calling for.  The conference 
board reports that Revenue Canada has already made significant 
strides in this direction and is well equipped to provide 
fairness to Canadians. Revenue Canada is constantly striving to 
improve its services to all Canadians. 
We are living in a constantly evolving world and Canada's 
business, economic and social environment is dramatically 
changing.  It is one of the reasons that the agency is being 
created, to respond to those changes and to provide better service 
to all our clients.  Good service is fair service always.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Fairness means being open, clear, courteous, responsive, timely 
and accessible.  Applying legislation fairly for Revenue Canada 
and for the new agency then means applying it impartially, 
consistently and responsively.  It means as well that commitments 
Revenue Canada makes to fairness will be commitments for the 
Canada customs and revenue agency.  That agency is all about 
providing better and more effective and efficient service to 
Canadians.  Fairness is part and parcel of service and an 
efficient organization that is not fair to its clients is not an 
effective one. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Feedback as well from the fairness initiative reinforced the 
longstanding practice of building commitment to fairness 
throughout the organization as opposed to isolating it in a 
separate office. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Creating and office of taxpayer protection as some have 
suggested would also carry additional expense and would detract 
from the ability of members of parliament to deal directly with 
the Minister of National Revenue to resolve their constituents' 
problems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members of parliament should have the right to call the minister 
to task if the agency appears to behave unfairly in its ways and 
to its clients.  The agency's clients should also have the right 
to have a member of parliament raise concerns directly to the 
minister in the House of Commons on the actions of the agency. 
That is very important. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some hon. members have also suggested entrenching a taxpayer 
bill of rights in the legislation.  Their rationale is that the 
agency may become out of control, leading to taxpayer complaints 
on the scale of those facing the United States Internal Revenue 
Service in recent years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remind them that Revenue Canada's declaration of taxpayer 
rights was the first of its kind in the world, introduced in 
1985. The declaration has been periodically updated to remain 
current with the law and societal needs and is entrenched in the 
day to day operations of the department and is part of the public 
service ethos that will carry over to the agency. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, feedback to date from the consultations on the 
fairness initiative indicates that Canadians are pleased with the 
current declaration of taxpayer rights. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canada customs and revenue agency will not be an arm's 
length agency like the IRS and therefore what it might need is 
not what we need. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Garth Whyte, vice-president of national affairs for the Canadian 
Federation of Independent Business, pointed out when he appeared 
before the House of Commons Standing Committee on Finance on 
November 24: “The problem is once you put it in the act it is 
pretty hard to enforce.  We want to see this as a cultural change 
happening in the department and a dedication to service.  You can 
write it in the act, and we have seen many things written in the 
act but then people think it's done. I think it should be done at 
the department level”. That is well worth remembering. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition to not being necessary, adding a taxpayer bill of 
rights to the agency legislation would have the effect of 
amending program legislation such as the Income Tax Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Provisions such as those proposed should therefore be directed 
specifically at that act and other similar statutes the agency 
would administer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unlike the situation with the IRS, there will continue to be a 
minister of national revenue who will continue to be accountable 
to the public and in the House of Commons for all aspects of the 
agency's performance, including its fairness. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians certainly expect no less and Canadians deserve no 
less.  I therefore urge all members to support this very 
worthwhile legislation. 
<P><A NAME="LINK61"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jason Kenney (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker,

of rights. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member mentioned the current declaration of taxpayer 
rights introduced in 1985 by then Minister Beatty.  Would he not 
agree with me that this declaration has not statutory force, no

exist on paper in the form of a declaration? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lynn Myers:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank the member for the 
very good question.  The declaration of taxpayer rights really is 
an evolving piece of legislation that will be part and parcel of 
this new agency. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It will underscore the kind of commitment that certainly we as a 
government want to see carried forward in the best interests of 
all Canadians as it relates to this agency in a manner that is 
meaningful and consistent with the kinds of information that 
certainly we on the government side have been given with respect 
to the importance of carrying forward in this manner. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In answer to the hon. member, the declaration is a very valuable 
piece of legislation that is in keeping with the kinds of values 
that we as Canadians want to promote.

yesterday, taking the lives of seven of the ten people on board.

lives, the crew of the small chopper arrived at the crash sight 
in 17 minutes.  They flew low enough to the turbulent waters to 
snatch the three survivors from the icy grip of the St. Lawrence 
just before the tide rolled in and hope was slipping away. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To the Quebec provincial police, Canadian armed forces and the

flew the small privately owned helicopter, we salute your

the newly formed Canada-China Legislative Association recently 
made its inaugural visit to China and held meetings with the 
National People's Congress.  It is called a legislative 
association and not a parliamentary association because China has 
neither a true parliament nor a parliamentary political culture. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A parliamentary culture not only tolerates but welcomes and even 
formalizes dissent and opposition.  The crackdown of the last two 
weeks on political dissenters in China shows the wisdom of 
withholding the name parliamentary from the association we in 
this parliament have with the National People's Congress. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>China is a major player on the global stage and must be engaged 
by Canada both politically and economically.  However, at the 
same time as we show respect for China we must also show respect 
for our own values. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>China is now a place where people can make money.  But a more 
open economy without democratic values is surely not enough.  The 
west must not be bought by the lure of such a big market.  When 
parliamentary values can be openly practised in China, China's 
signature of the International Covenant on Civil and Political 
Rights will take on new meaning and China will truly take its 
place as a leader among nations.

is already burdened with rail transportation costs which have 
doubled while service declines.  Finally, processing plants are 
largely farmer owned. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I urge the Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food to keep this 
industry and these facts in mind before setting emergency

their efforts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last night at a Liberal fundraising dinner the Prime Minister

</I></B></P><P align=left>The Prime Minister has indicated that we want to make progress on 
this particular issue (the social union).  He indicated also that 
we might not agree on all the issues but certainly there are some 
areas where we can agree and hopefully we will have some resolve 
on these issues in the very near future.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):</B> Mr.

the premiers' social union proposals will somehow weaken the 
federal government, which is simply not the case. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The social union is about strengthening Canadians.  It is about 
giving all Canadians better health care and better social

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):</B> Mr.

him to respect the Constitution.  The Prime Minister has a lot to 
do without meddling in provincial affairs.

with aboriginal affairs?  Where is the new Young Offenders Act? 
Why does he not fix the Canadian dollar?  Why does he not attack 
unfair foreign trade subsidies instead of the provinces? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is it not true that the Prime Minister's real reason for

are not paranoid, but we are not deaf. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When he talks about not negotiating in good faith, as he just 
did, the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs is falling back 
into his old ways.

should they not give thought to the attitude of the Prime 
Minister of Canada, who yesterday announced in Edmonton, without 
either advising or consulting Mr. Klein, that he planned to 
remain involved in youth matters, which should come under 
provincial jurisdiction?  Is the fact that he did not even 
consult the provinces not an indication of his contempt for

not unusual.

he would act in good faith.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Gauthier:</B> How can the minister and the Prime Minister

rightly or wrongly under the impression that it was not 
sufficiently consulted by the other.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The industry is asking for a fair national shipbuilding policy. 
The low Canadian dollar is making it harder for this industry to

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry, Lib.):</B>  Mr.

the hon. member must have been reading her question upside down. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a policy of a 33.3% straight line depreciation rate. 
Canadian built ships can be written off faster than any other 
asset. There is a 25% tariff on ships that are being imported 
into Canada.  There is support for the shipbuilders from the 
Export Development Corporation.  There is a government 
procurement policy on Canadian shipping. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The problem the hon. member for Saint John has is that she wants 
subsidies for the shipbuilding industry.  We are not prepared to

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Elsie Wayne (Saint John, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the

one the previous Conservative government followed.  However, let 
me say that does not mean it is all bad. In this case we have 
support for the shipbuilding industry.  A straight line 
depreciation rate of 33.3% is faster than most other rates of 
depreciation.  There is a 25% tariff.

Speaker, this question of privilege arises from a situation that 
occurred on December 3 following question period.  It was the 
same situation that occurred with the member next to me with 
regard to a question put through you to the Minister of Transport 
that involved a former member of the House, Doug Young, who is 
involved in a very controversial highway deal back in New 
Brunswick. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yesterday I rose on a point of order, not on a question of 
privilege.  I do not have to get into as much detail as the 
member from Nova Scotia who sits next to me did, but it was the 
same force of intimidation and innuendo that the member for 
Kenora—Rainy River used against the member from Nova Scotia. 
That same tactic was employed against me outside the Chamber in 
the parliamentary precincts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It has gone beyond that. 
Not only has it happened to me and the member next to me from 
Nova Scotia, but it has happened to a number of members of 
parliament on the same issue through the same member and his 
staff.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is where it becomes confusing.  Yesterday I rose on a point 
of order and not a point of privilege.  The issue is very 
serious.  I will go through specific citations in Beauchesne's. 
Citation 92 reads: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>A valid claim of privilege in respect to interference with a 
Member must relate to the Member's parliamentary duties— 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It did.  It related to a very sensitive question in the House to 
which the member opposite took offence.  He used threats and 
intimidation to shut me up but it did not work.  I will now read 
citation 93.  I want the House to listen very carefully.  It 
states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is generally accepted that any threat, or attempt to influence 
the vote of, or actions of a Member, is breach of privilege. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Reading on in Beauchesne's sixth edition, citation 99, which is 
the important one for you to hear, Mr. Speaker, reads: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Direct threats which attempt to influence Members' actions in the 
House are undoubtedly breaches of privilege.  They do, however, 
provide serious problems for the House.  They are often made 
anonymously and it is rarely possible for the House to examine 
them satisfactorily. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This was not made anonymously.  It was made in the flesh by the 
member for Kenora—Rainy River.  Citation 99 concludes with the 
following: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The common practice today is to turn the responsibility for 
investigating them over to the ordinary forces of the law. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In his apology yesterday to one of the other members, which is 
inferring I guess an apology to me, the member was quoted as 
saying “if I really meant this threat, if it was a pure and 
honest threat and I carried through with the threat”, to quote 
the hon. member for Kenora—Rainy River from yesterday's 
<I>Hansard</I> at page 10986, “I can assure you, he would not be 
sitting over there today”, pointing to our seats. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is a threat.  It is not ambiguous.  It is direct and is not 
in any way made anonymously.  It was made by that member sitting 
over there.  I think this goes beyond an apology.  It is a prima 
facie case of breach of privilege. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  The hon. member for Kenora—Rainy River is 
in the House and I am going to give him the floor. 
<P><A NAME="LINK194"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Robert D. Nault (Kenora—Rainy River, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, since this was supposed to be put to rest yesterday 
based on your ruling, I would like to get some guidance from the 
Chair.  Standing Order 10 of the House regarding Speaker's 
rulings states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>No debate shall be permitted on any such decision, and no such 
decision shall be subject to an appeal to the House. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am going to ask just a question, Mr. Speaker.  If you are 
going to allow this debate to go on then I would like the 
opportunity to respond to the debate as it is now because it has 
become a debate, not a ruling— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  Yesterday I ruled on a point of privilege. 
This is a different point of privilege and that is why I heard it 
today.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this point of privilege specifically the member for New 
Brunswick Southwest mentioned the hon. member for Kenora—Rainy 
River and I wanted to give the member for Kenora—Rainy River at 
least a chance to say, from his perspective, what transpired in 
the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is not the point of privilege from yesterday.  That is over 
with.  I am dealing with the point of privilege for today.  The 
hon. member for Kenora—Rainy River is here.  If he wishes to 
intervene, I invite him to do so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Robert D. Nault:</B>  Mr. Speaker, let me make it very 
clear to you, to all the members of the House and to the member 
who just spoke that we had a conversation below this place on the 
first floor.  It was very much a debate thrust in a difference of 
opinion.  I was making it very clear to the members, this member 
from New Brunswick particularly, that I thought their comments 
about a particular ex-member of the House were unbecoming of this 
place because they were throwing insults, allegations and slander 
when they would not do it outside the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That was the conversation.  There was no intimidation.  It was 
very much a debate that we have in this place all the time. I 
think it demeans the House when people say things like that about 
members, whether they are here or not, or whether they have gone 
on to another profession. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The only thing we have in this place is our name.  Once we leave 
this place, if one slanders a person's name continuously in this 
place without any information to back it up—and I said to the 
member to say it outside and he refused to say it outside— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Oh, oh. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>   Order, please.  I will hear the hon. member 
for Kenora—Rainy River. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Robert D. Nault:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the debate was 
basically about the level of decorum in the House and that I was 
personally insulted as a friend of Mr. Young that people would be 
making that kind of allegation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yesterday I came into my place in good faith as an hon. member 
and said that if I had offended anybody with the fact that I am a 
little bit aggressive, and I think everybody would admit that, 
then I apologize. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now we are back here because, wanting to get some cheap media 
hits, they come back into the House and suggest that I am 
basically running at them when in fact I am not.  I have said it 
once and I am not about to say it again.  I made it very clear 
yesterday that I apologized if they were offended by the fact 
that I had a difference of opinion with them. 
<P><A NAME="LINK195"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  Here we have in the House one hon. 
member saying that another hon. member said something to him.  We 
have the other hon. member giving his version of what went on. 
They are both hon. members of parliament.  They are both giving 
their views as to something that transpired.  I have to accept 
both hon. members' words that this is indeed what transpired. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I rule there is no point of privilege in this case.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe—Bagot, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, in 
spite of the matter of privilege I raised in the House on 
December 3 concerning leaked committee documents, in particular 
the one that occurred on December 2 concerning the report on the 
pre-budgetary consultations of the Standing Committee on Finance, 
I must unfortunately again today submit to you another case of 
contempt for the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This morning's <I>Le Droit</I> and <I>Ottawa Citizen</I> gave the key 
recommendations in the report of the Standing Committee on 
Finance on the future of the Canadian financial services sector. 
This is the sixth committee report leaked in the past two weeks 
and, in the case of the Standing Committee on Finance, the 
second leak in five days.

<A HREF="#LINKT62"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Once again, I must remind you that this disclosure betrays the 
spirit and the letter that must guide us in the tabling of 
committee reports.  It is also an affront to democracy, which 
suffers from the lack of dissenting opinions by the opposition 
parties, implying unanimity or unconditional support for the 
government positions reflected by the members of the Liberal 
majority on committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This action shakes the faith of all parliamentarians of all 
parties who agree to abide by the rules of confidentiality and 
the parliamentary traditions based on the honour and dignity 
incumbent on them through their public responsibility and 
democratic mandate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Need I remind you that this action diminishes parliamentary 
privilege, interferes with the work of the Standing Committee on 
Finance and does not augur well for the future, creating a 
climate of distrust that is both unproductive and discouraging. 
There is no doubt that this leak constitutes contempt of the 
House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Allow me once again to quote from Maingot's parliamentary 
procedures, chapter 12, at page 240, on the definition of 
contempt: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Any act or omission which obstructs or impedes either House of 
Parliament in the performance of its functions, or which 
obstructs or impedes any Member or officer of such House in the 
discharge of his parliamentary duty, or which has a tendency, 
directly or indirectly to produce such results may be treated as 
a contempt even though there is no precedent for the offence. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, on December 3, at the time of the first leak by the 
Liberal majority on the Standing Committee on Finance, you ruled 
that there had been contempt, and you asked the Standing 
Committee on Procedure and House Affairs to submit its 
recommendations post haste so that there would be no recurrence. 
I am very grateful for your response and wish you to know that 
you have our support. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But on December 3 you also said that you did not have the power 
to curtail this sort of thing immediately because, in the case 
then before us, no member of parliament could be identified, 
charged and sanctioned for leaking in-camera proceedings of the 
Standing Committee on Finance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The case that concerns us today is different.  In the article by 
Éric Beauchesne, on page A-1 of the <I>Ottawa Citizen</I>, two MPs who 
are members of the Standing Committee on Finance are quoted, the 
Liberal member for Niagara Falls and the Progressive 
Conservative member for Kings—Hants. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The article quotes the member for Niagara Falls, who explains 
the difference between the Liberal caucus report and the report 
of the Standing Committee on Finance, as follows: 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>“There is a difference.  I cannot tie the hands of business, 
but as a representative of consumers I think that if banks need 
to merge there ought to be some conditions”. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For his part, the member for Kings—Hants was critical of the fact 
that Liberal members could support both their caucus report and 
contrary proposals in the report of the Standing Committee on 
Finance, and I quote: 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>“What this basically indicates is, they didn't know what they 
signed onto on the Liberal task force and then probably don't 
know what they are signing onto now”. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Moreover, the member for Kings—Hants disclosed the content of the 
Conservatives' dissenting opinion before that opinion was tabled 
in the House, along with the committee report. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In so doing, the two members confirmed the content of the leak 
and commented on the in camera discussions of committee members. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I therefore accuse the Liberal member for Niagara Falls and the 
Conservative member for Kings—Hants of showing contempt for the 
House by releasing and discussing the content of the report of 
the Standing Committee on Finance, before that report was tabled 
in the House of Commons on Thursday, along with the dissenting 
opinions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This contempt is all the more serious and disturbing since these 
two members, along with the other members of the finance 
committee, supported a motion which I moved yesterday morning in 
committee, seconded by the hon. member for Sherbrooke, 
stipulating: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That the members of the Standing Committee on Finance solemnly 
pledge on their honour not to disclose or discuss the content of 
the committee report on the future of the financial sector 
before its tabling in the House, including the dissenting 
opinions of the opposition, as the case may be. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As Victor Hugo said “There are people who observe the rules of 
honour the way we observe the stars, from very far”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, I very respectfully submit this to your attention. 
If you find there is a prima facie case of contempt for the 
House in these disclosures by the member for Niagara Falls and 
the member for Kings-Hants, I am prepared to move in the House a 
motion that would allow the Committee on Procedure and House 
Affairs to investigate the matter.

the comments by the member for Saint-Hyacinthe—Bagot concerning 
the number of days we unfortunately have had repeated and 
frequent leaks, I would like to mention that on every occasion 
the government House leader rose and joined members from other 
parties in condemning these outrageous leaks we have witnessed, 
particularly these past few weeks. It is a real hemorrhage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With regard to the serious problem affecting every one of us 
working here in a climate of mutual respect, dignity and honour, 
we are ready, Mr. Speaker, to cooperate with you and members 
from the other parties in the House to solve it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I share the concerns expressed by the member for 
Saint-Hyacinthe—Bagot concerning these leaks. However, I would not 
go as far as accusing any particular member. I am not familiar 
enough with the issue to make such accusations, but I met 
briefly with the chairman of the Standing Committee on Finance, 
who agrees with us and finds this unacceptable. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is really more than unfortunate.  It is totally unacceptable 
that we find ourselves in this situation once more today.  I

problem as soon as we come back after the winter recess.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B> Things are different today since the hon. member

House and tell us what happened. After I hear them, I will make 
a ruling. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>]

of privilege after I have heard from the two members who have

it.  No one is deprived from speaking to this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Randy White:</B>  Mr. Speaker, further to that, in 
fairness to members who have not spoken, could you give us some 
notice when these members will be in the House on this issue so 
we can address—

</I></B></P><P align=left>I am addressing myself to my hon. colleague who gave me notice 
that he was going to bring up a point of order which will take a 
few minutes.  We are going to listen to it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am going to absent myself from the chair.  My hon. colleague

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>ORDER PAPER QUESTIONS 
</H4><P align=left>

<P><A NAME="LINK201"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Cummins (Delta—South Richmond, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I wish to bring to your attention a problem relating to 
order paper questions.  The problem can be categorized as 
follows.  The first issue I would like to raise is the issue of 
the length of the questions.  The second is the number of 
questions allowed and the length of time taken by the government 
to answer the questions.  The third matter has to do with a 
failure to receive factual answers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, your experience in this House and your wisdom can 
be of guidance in these matters.  I would appreciate your 
comments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On October 28 I submitted a written question.  It was a question 
dealing with how the Gladstone decision of the Supreme Court of 
Canada had affected the management of the spawn-on-kelp fishery 
on the north coast of British Columbia.  It was a detailed 
question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A very general question might have elicited some of the same 
information, but there is no guarantee of that.  For example, I 
might have asked:  “How did the Gladstone decision affect the 
management of the spawn-on-kelp fishery?”  But I did not.  My 
question had a number of sub-parts that attempted to get to the 
details of how the decision is now affecting the spawn-on-kelp 
fishery. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The detail of the question was developed in conjunction with 
several of my constituents who are in the spawn-on-kelp fishery. 
All parts of the question involved this issue.  All sought 
details.  None involved any other fishery.  None involved any 
other court decision. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the question was submitted, House staff refused to put the 
question on the order paper. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was anxious to have the question put on the order paper as 
soon as possible because local fishermen believed the answers 
could assist them in making recommendations to the government on 
the management of the 1999 fishery which begins in March. 
However, staff found the question too long.  They requested that 
it be divided into five separate questions.  At the time I had 
one spot for a question on the order paper. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>After meeting with staff I was told that if it were divided into 
three separate questions they would put it on the order paper. 
Obviously their decision was arbitrary.  It was not based on the 
standing orders.  They agreed that the issue of division into 
separate questions only arose because of the length of the 
question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was told by staff that prior to the rule changes emanating 
from the McGrath report in 1985 which addressed such matters I 
could have put my question on the order paper as 26 individual 
questions as there would have been no limit to the number of 
questions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now we have the worst of both worlds.  We have a four question 
limitation, but without the government responding within the 45 
day period contemplated by the new standing orders.  Further we 
have House staff who feel empowered and emboldened to arbitrarily 
refuse to put questions on the order paper because they consider 
them too long.  The standing orders do not provide staff with any 
guidance on the division of questions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The present standing order on written questions is a product of 
the McGrath report which had recommended a limit of four 
questions, with a requirement that they be answered within 30 
sitting days.  McGrath would have given the Clerk of the House 
the power to reject outright or split into separate and distinct 
questions those that contained unrelated sub-questions.  The 
power to “split into separate and distinct questions those 
questions that contain unrelated sub-questions” was not given to 
the Clerk of the House in the present standing order, nor did the 
standing order adopt a 30 day time limit, instead opting for a 
weaker 45 day limit that did not contain a requirement to respond 
within that period. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>McGrath had called for a requirement that the government answer 
within the 30 day time period.  The only guidance available to 
staff is found in the McGrath report, but in a section that was 
not adopted.  If it had been adopted it would not have given 
staff the authority to divide my question because my question 
does not in any way contain unrelated sub-questions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am concerned that staff may believe it is their job to 
arbitrate between the needs of government to have easy questions 
and the needs of members to submit thorough and, on occasion, 
detailed questions to elicit a detailed and informative answer. 
If staff have fallen into such a trap, and I believe it is 
possible they have, then they are mistaken and must be extricated 
from this trap quickly.

<A HREF="#LINKT65"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>If staff require the authority to divide questions recommended 
by McGrath, then the House ought to look at the whole set of 
McGrath recommendations on written questions and make the 
necessary changes. We set a dangerous precedent when staff 
believe it is their job to protect the government and limit 
members' right to put forward written questions in a way that is 
not authorized or contemplated by the standing orders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, I would ask that you review my question to ensure 
that it complies with the standing order and to ensure that staff 
have not misinterpreted their role. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the second matter, the standing orders of this House indicate 
that no member may have more than four written questions on the 
Notice Paper at any one time.  When the standing orders were 
changed to limit the number of questions that may be placed on 
the Notice Paper, it was established that members could request 
that questions be answered within a fixed period, 45 days.  Thus, 
limitations were placed both on the number of questions asked and 
the days that could elapse before an answer was tabled.  A 
reasonable balance was established. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The four in 45 rule was never intended to prevent members from 
asking questions yet that is what is happening.  This is a misuse 
of Standing Order 39.  It is being used against members.  It is 
being used to prevent them from asking questions. If answers are 
not tabled, the member is prevented from asking further 
questions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Library of Parliament has reviewed the time it has taken 
during this parliament for me to receive an answer to Order Paper 
questions.  None of the 10 questions I placed on the Notice Paper 
during this parliament were answered within the 45 days 
contemplated by the standing order. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Question No. 16 was answered in 64 days, Question No. 19 in 58 
days, Question No. 33 in 195 days, Question No. 51 in 151 days, 
Question No. 56 in 161 days, Question No. 91 in 194 days, 
Question No. 103 in 137 days and Question No. 119 in 69 days. Of 
the eight questions answered, it took an average of 129 days to 
receive an answer, about two and a half times as long as 
anticipated by the standing orders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, I have two unanswered questions on the Notice 
Paper, Question No. 132 which was asked on September 18, 1998, 
about 80 days ago, and Question No. 138 which was asked on 
September 24, 1998, over 75 days ago. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By refusing to answer my questions in the 45 days allotted by 
the standing orders, I have been prevented from asking questions 
due to the four question limit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When questions are not answered in a timely fashion as 
anticipated by the standing orders, members are prevented from 
asking additional questions.  I do not believe that was the 
intended outcome of the parliamentary reforms following the 
McGrath report. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reforms as reflected in Standing Order 39 were intended to 
facilitate members in asking questions and in receiving replies. 
Instead we have a situation where my ability to ask questions is 
undermined. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If answers require more than 45 days, I believe it would be 
appropriate for the government House leader or the government 
member responsible for tabling the answers to stand at the end of 
45 days and report to the House on the reason for failing to 
answer within 45 days and to indicate when an answer could be 
anticipated.  This could be done within the existing standing 
orders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Australia has a similar practice.  Its standing orders provide 
that if a question has not been answered in 60 days, the member 
may request the Speaker to seek reasons from the minister 
concerned.  The Australian practice seems to work. In the 
Australian parliament the overwhelming majority of questions are 
answered within 13 sitting days, according to the Library of 
Parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the United Kingdom parliament the standing orders do not 
limit the number of questions for written answers a member may 
place and members may specify the day on which they would like 
the question answered. Questions are normally answered within one 
working week. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps the most effective way of protecting the member's 
ability to place questions on the Notice Paper would be to exempt 
from the four question limit those questions that go unanswered 
after 45 days. Thus, members would not be prevented from asking 
further questions.

</I></B></P><P align=left>If the answers to their existing questions have not been tabled 
within the 45 day period anticipated by the standing orders, I 
think it appropriate that the House look to the standing orders 
of Great Britain and Australia with a view to incorporating the 
best of those systems and ours.  Certainly, having questions 
answered within one week would be most welcome by all 
parliamentarians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally on the last point, on March 27, 1998 I asked Question 
No. 91.  The answer tabled for Question No. 91 for the most part 
is not factual. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Written answers are placed on the Notice Paper so that the 
members may get the facts on a particular matter. When the answer 
is signed and tabled by a minister, there is a reasonable 
expectation that the answer is accurate as far as the minister 
can ascertain. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, Question No. 91 involved the purchase in September 
and October 1992 of some 69,000 mefloquine tablets by the 
Canadian forces under the authority of the Lariam Safety 
Monitoring Study. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Question No. 91(i) we find an answer that is obviously wrong. 
The response given to parliament said that in October 1994 the 
Department of Health first became aware through news reports 
alleging behaviour changes associated with the use of 
mefloquine— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  If the hon. member 
for Delta—South Richmond would allow, I think we cannot get too 
far down this particular road.  There seems to be a number of 
different questions and the hon. member for Delta—South Richmond 
is not the first member to stand and address the fact that it 
seemingly takes forever to get a response to a written question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do find it my responsibility and prerogative to defend the 
clerk and the office of the clerk and point out very clearly that 
the clerks and the people working for parliament work for 
parliament.  They do not work for one party or another.  They do 
not act as standard bearers for the government.  They have a 
specific job that is mandated to them to make sure that the 
questions are in a form that may be responded to. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Whether or not a written response to a written question received 
by a member is factual is a question of debate.  What we cannot 
do on this point of order is to provide licence for a member to 
take issue with the response that was provided by the government. 
If there is another way, perhaps in another question, certainly 
that is a point of debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Having provided this intervention, we will go back on the point 
of order of the member for Delta—South Richmond. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Cummins:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I do not want to get into 
a debate with you on the issue at this point, but I would like it 
if you would hear me out on this matter of the factual answer to 
the question.  I think it is important.  I have a suggestion at 
the end which I think is reasonable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was talking about Question No. 91(i) and I will take it up 
from approximately where I left off.  I talked about the response 
given to parliament and the fact that news reports were alleging 
behaviour associated with the use of mefloquine by Canadian 
forces personnel in Somalia as presented by defence counsel in 
well publicized court martial and the Somalia Inquiry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The response sounds plausible until we give it a careful 
reading.  Defence counsel did not use mefloquine as a defence in 
any of the court martial events.  The office of the judge 
advocate general confirmed with my office that mefloquine was not 
raised by defence counsel. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Further, the Library of Parliament reviewed the coverage of 
mefloquine and found that in 1994— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  Let us stick to the 
point of order.  The point of order is to the length of time it 
takes to get a response to a written question and whether or not 
the clerk has any position to change or anything to do with the 
length of the question or the complex nature of the question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The response to a question right now at this time is debate.  If 
the hon. member for Delta—South Richmond takes exception to the 
response to the question that he submitted, that is an entirely 
different kettle of fish.  It is totally different and that is 
debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the hon. member for Delta—South Richmond wants to close on 
the original point of order which had to do with the length of 
time it took to get a response and the fact that the question 
that was placed was particularly complex and had to be broken 
down, fine.  But we are not going to continue the debate upon the 
merits of the response of the government.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Cummins:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I said at the outset that 
there were three issues I had concern with. They are related. 
They have to do with the issue of Order Paper questions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first item I wanted to address was the length of the 
question.  As I indicated quite clearly, in my view there is 
nothing in the standing orders that limits the length of the 
question. To tell me on one occasion to come on in and we will 
divide the question up into five parts and then after we have a 
conversation three parts is good enough, suggests to me that 
there is something arbitrary at work here.  It is not following 
any set prescription by the rules of order.  That was the first 
item I wanted to raise. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second item was the number of questions allowed and the 
length of time taken by the government to answer.  As I 
indicated, what is happening is that we are well over the 100 
days on average to get some of these questions answered.  For 
some of them it is taking almost 200 days. That prevents me from 
doing my job because there is a limit on the number of questions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The third issue is related and it is the factual nature of 
responses.  This is of concern. I am not suggesting for a moment 
that there is an intent on the other side to provide me with 
information which is not factual. What I would suggest is that 
somebody on the ministerial staff is not taking the care to 
ensure that the job is done properly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  The point is made by 
the hon. member for Delta—South Richmond on the three separate, 
distinct issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the interest of members, Standing Order 39(2) reads: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Clerk of the House, acting for the Speaker, shall have full 
authority to ensure that coherent and concise questions are 
placed on the Notice Paper in accordance with the practices of 
the House, and may, on behalf of the Speaker, order certain 
questions to be posed separately. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is right there in the standing orders.  We accept your point. 
<P><A NAME="LINK202"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Randy White (Langley—Abbotsford, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I will be brief on this issue.  I would suggest that the Speaker 
not enter into debate on this issue but give rulings on it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today on the Order Paper, there are several questions with at 
least five parts, and a number of longer questions.  The member 
for Delta—South Richmond and the member for Calgary Centre have 
questions with 10 parts.  The question of the member for 
Madawaska—Restigouche weighs in at 11 parts. Without any clear 
guidelines, I suppose I could pick apart here in the House these 
long questions and make the argument that they are 10 or 11 
separate questions.  We just cannot put a number on the parts to 
a question and cut it off there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I take it that guidelines are imposed to these questions but it 
is not clear what those guidelines are.  I think that is what we 
are dealing with here.  I will read Standing Order 39 which you 
began to do in my stead, Mr. Speaker. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Standing Order 39(2) says: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Clerk of the House, acting for the Speaker, shall have full 
authority to ensure that coherent and concise questions are 
placed on the Notice Paper in accordance with the practices of 
the House, and may, on behalf of the Speaker, order certain 
questions to be posed separately. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The only reference in the standing orders to separating 
questions is that the clerk has the authority to do so.  Nothing 
more, nothing less.  I am not blaming the clerk.  We have charged 
him with this responsibility without giving him the detailed 
guidelines. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The standing orders also have a provision whereby the government 
is required to answer the questions within 45 days.  While that 
45 day guideline is clear, the government does not have to obey 
it, which is the big problem I am sure members opposite have. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The rules governing questions were established in the 33rd 
Parliament.  Unfortunately the members in that parliament struck 
a bad deal with the government. In exchange for the restrictions 
on the number of questions a member could submit to the 
government, the government promised to answer the questions 
within 45 days.  The problem is that the members are forced to 
uphold their end of the bargain but the government is not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is the same sort of deal the government made with respect 
to Standing Order 73.  The government asked that the motion to 
refer a bill to committee before second reading be automatically 
time allocated to 180 minutes in exchange for more flexibility in 
the type of amendments to be proposed in committee. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1545"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT68"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In practice the government gets its time allocation guaranteed 
in the standing orders, but the acceptability of amendments is no 
better than before.  In some cases it is worse because the 
government began to take advantage of the fast-tracking mechanism 
of this process and started to send controversial bills to 
committee before second reading. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, in questionable cases regarding order paper questions 
the member should be given the benefit of the doubt.  The 
government does not need any favours since the rules 
overwhelmingly favour it to begin with.  If you are going to 
impose strict restrictions on members with respect to the length 
of questions, Mr. Speaker, then I hope you impose the 45 day 
requirement for the government to answer those questions. 
<P><A NAME="LINK203"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg—Transcona, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I welcome the opportunity to intervene on this point of order. 
The hon. member for Delta—South Richmond does the House a 
service by raising this and by being persistent in raising it.  I 
recall speaking to a similar point of order not so long ago. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was vice-chair of the McGrath committee and, therefore, in 
some way responsible for this rule whereby members of parliament 
can only put four questions on the order paper in return for the 
prompt answering of those questions within 45 days.  We actually 
recommended 30 days, but what eventually came out of it was 45 
days.  The idea was that in return for limiting the number of 
questions there would be a prompt answering. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Other parliaments answer within 13 days or within other periods 
of time which are much shorter than is the rule here.  It is not 
just a question of confidence, it is also a question of respect 
for the rules of the House of Commons and for members of 
parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the reasons people want to be members of parliament is so 
they can put questions to the government and get answers.  If we 
put questions and cannot get answers, if it takes as long for us 
to get answers as anybody else, then what is the point of being a 
member of parliament?  We are no different than anyone else 
outside the Chamber.  We get elected to this place so that we 
might have access to information and to answers from the 
government that other people do not have because they are not 
elected to this place.  To leave the answering of these questions 
for so long, the government shows a disrespect for members of 
parliament and for the rules of the House of Commons.  It is just 
not good enough to keep getting up and saying that this question 
cannot be answered and that question cannot be answered. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is part of the general malaise.  The government does not 
respect the standing orders.  It does not answer questions. 
People leak committee reports.  The Speaker stands up to try to 
get order.  People keep on yapping and yelling.  What is going on 
around here, Mr. Speaker?  It is not just Christmas.  There is a 
general malaise of systemic disrespect for the rules that we put 
in place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government makes announcements.  It does not even go across 
to the press gallery.   Now it goes all the way to Edmonton to 
make announcements about a national youth job strategy.  We have 
complained about the government showing disrespect for the House. 
This is all part of the same piece. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to support the member in his point of order.  He 
has made some helpful suggestions by noting practices that are 
established in other parliaments which put us to shame, both 
collectively and put the government to shame in terms of the 
amount of time it takes to answer questions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other point the member makes is that if our questions are 
not answered we cannot ask more questions.  If the government is 
going to persist in not answering questions, then I think the 
Standing Committee on Procedure and House Affairs or some other 
body should look at other means by which members can continue to 
put questions on the order paper. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But then we would really be back to the old system.  If members 
can put more than four questions on the order paper because the 
four that they have already put on have not been answered in the 
45 day period, then the government will say “Oh well, they are 
happy.  They got their questions on the order paper.  They have 
eight or nine questions, so we will take longer to answer them”.

<A HREF="#LINKT69"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is one of the dangers in that particular suggestion.  In 
the absence of the government actually answering the questions, 
it becomes a way of restricting a member's right to ask further 
questions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is all I have to say on the matter.  But I urge you, Mr. 
Speaker, when you discuss this point of order with your 
colleague, to make some helpful suggestions and to indicate very 
strongly that there is an obligation on the part of the 
government to respect the standing orders of the House of 
Commons. 
<P><A NAME="LINK204"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Adams (Parliamentary Secretary to Leader of the 
Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
listened very carefully to the remarks of members opposite.  I 
would like to confirm that the member for Delta—South Richmond 
has been persistent on this matter.  He does take a great 
interest in the questions which he has tabled. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, I was very disappointed by the remarks having to do 
with the interpretation of the existing standing orders.  There 
was some criticism of the existing standing orders.  Mr. Speaker, 
I think you picked up on this.  I do not think it is appropriate 
to bring in staff and have them use their best efforts to 
interpret the standing orders which have been set by this House. 
I hope that when you give some thought to this matter you 
discount those particular remarks of the member.  In fact, in his 
second intervention he gave some indication that that was not 
what he meant.  The standing orders exist.  He has some criticism 
of them.  It is the job of staff to interpret them.  They have to 
interpret with respect to criteria.  One criterion is length. The 
member has addressed that.  As well, the government House leader 
gave the Speaker some other information on that point. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The number of questions has also been addressed.  Again the 
staff do their best to address the length and number of 
questions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then there is the question of the 45 day time limit.  When I 
last looked, a few days ago, the government had received upwards 
of 200 standing questions.  It has answered close to three out of 
four of those questions.  With respect to the 45 day limit, when 
I last looked, somewhere around 12% or 13% of the questions have 
not been answered within the 45 day limit.  Those are the facts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Sometimes members, such as this member who has a great interest 
in and uses this method very systematically, can put down 
questions which might involved detailed consultation with every 
federal department.  That is quite different than answering a 
question which involves going to one of our departments, getting 
a response and coming back to the House of Commons.  Therefore, 
this relatively small percentage of questions which take longer 
than 45 days to answer are questions which have a complication of 
some sort. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another thing concerns me.  We heard the opposition House leader 
speaking a moment ago.  You will recall, Mr. Speaker, that 
earlier this year we had the required review, a full-scale debate 
in the House on our standing orders.  If this thing has been 
ticking like this, the way to deal with it is not to get up and 
attack the staff, it is to get up and deal with the House of 
Commons and the standing orders.  I do not recall—and I could be 
wrong—in a full day of debate earlier this year this particular 
standing order being raised or these matters being raised. 
Perhaps the member has a case, but there is a way in which that 
case can be made. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Standing Committee on Procedure and House Affairs has been 
mentioned.  It is our standing committee which is responsible for 
the standing orders.  Again, without getting up and attacking the 
staff of the House, it is possible for any member to write to the 
chair of that committee to raise concerns about either the 
standing order or about ways in which the standing orders are 
being interpreted by the staff, if the member has particular 
views. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, I hope that you will take these points into account 
when you consider the member's point of order.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Cummins:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I would like to clarify a 
point.  I do not think I was attacking the staff.  To suggest 
that is to deflect criticism away from the issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The issue is that when we do not define a rule carefully, then 
the staff are put in the position of having to make a judgment 
call, and that is not fair.  It is not fair to them and it is not 
fair to us to have to debate with them about a particular issue 
that we may feel strongly about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  The point of the 
hon. member is well made and I am sure the staff take comfort in 
the fact that that was not the intent of your intervention.

act to establish the Canada Customs and Revenue Agency and to 
amend and repeal other acts as a consequence, be read the third 
time and passed. 
<P><A NAME="LINK211"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Jocelyne Girard-Bujold (Jonquière, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to rise to speak to Bill C-43, an act to establish the 
Canada Customs and Revenue Agency. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will begin my remarks by saying that the government's 
insistence on creating the Canada Customs and Revenue Agency 
against everyone's advice, starting with the vast majority of 
provincial governments, including the Government of Quebec, 
gives the impression that certain Liberal ministers are 
suffering from what I would call “acute neroitis”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This disease is named after the infamous Roman emperor Nero who, 
as members will remember, played music while watching Rome being 
devastated by raging fires that were set at his own command. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At times, I even wonder if this Liberal government does not have 
among its members firebugs of such talent that even the former 
Roman emperor would be red with envy. 
One has to be a real hot head to insist so doggedly on setting 
up an agency that will result in a 20% reduction of the Canadian 
public service as soon as it comes into being. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under the guise of modernizing the state, our Liberal Neros are 
establishing a new structure which will translate overnight into 
a 20% cut of our public service. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the sake of what interests is the government taking steps it 
knows full well are meant to take apart the government 
apparatus? Where is the public interest when, in this era of 
electronic communications, the government is getting ready to 
transfer to a private agency an incredible amount of personal

</I></B></P><P align=left>I must admit this government worries me. It worries me a lot. 
Its policies worry me because sometimes they seem to come from 
nowhere, as is the case with this Canada Customs and Revenue 
Agency. Or rather, and this is even less reassuring, it would 
appear the government is taking orders from some interests 
unknown to you and I, that would rather remain behind the scenes 
and are in any case contrary to the best interests of the 
Canadian population as a whole. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I cannot for the life of me understand why the Canada Customs 
and Revenue Agency is such a priority for the government at this 
point in time when there are more urgent issues we should be 
dealing with. If only this government's ministers would leave 
their ivory tower to go and see what goes on in the real world 
they would realize that, as we speak, a real social crisis is 
ripping the country apart, leaving behind an increasing number 
of unemployed workers, something which unfortunately does not 
seem to matter for this government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Government members should feel ashamed to expand so much energy 
today on debating the creation of a new structure nobody wants 
when so many of our fellow citizens do not even know where their 
next meal, and their children's, is coming from or whether they 
will have a place to sleep tonight. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will be blunt: this government should be ashamed of talking 
about creating a new private agency that 40,000 Revenue Canada 
employees will have to rely on for their jobs. These are fathers 
and mothers who, in two years, could very well see their salary 
reduced, their working conditions changed for the worse or their 
job simply disappear without being able to do anything about it. 
It is as though the government were set on imposing economic 
uncertainty on the largest possible number of our fellow 
citizens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is the same government that cut transfers to the provinces, 
transfers aimed at helping students, social welfare recipients 
and the sick. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not surprising that Jean Chrétien's Canada is a country 
where injustice and inequity are commonplace, a country where 
the worst thing that can happen to someone is to lose one's job 
or to be poor and unemployed, because this country is run by a 
government that does not care about its weakest and most 
vulnerable citizens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The worst threat facing the people of this country does not come 
from the nasty separatists who were elected in Quebec and who 
create political and economic uncertainty. No. The threat does 
not come from this side. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For thousands and thousands of Canadians, the enemy is not in 
Quebec City but rather in the federal capital, in Ottawa. The 
enemy is this Liberal government, whose employment insurance 
reform has reduced the rate of contributors eligible for 
benefits from 80% to a mere 42%. 
Thousands of our fellow citizens who had paid EI premiums lost 
the right to receive benefits when they needed it and were 
forced onto the welfare rolls and into poverty by this 
government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As if that were not enough, after denying access to EI benefits 
to thousands of our fellow citizens, thereby generating a 
surplus of billions of dollars in the EI fund, this government 
is now contemplating the robbery of the century and is trying to 
get its hands on this surplus and use it for its own ends.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Despite what some ministers across the way might say, thousands 
of our fellow citizens are convinced that the worst threat to 
our country does not come from the PQ government in Quebec, but 
rather from the federal Liberal government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Just last Saturday evening, I attended a function where I met 
around 150 senior citizens from my riding. These people 
unanimously told me that they are outraged and deeply offended 
to see that, while poverty is rampant in this country, the only 
concern of the government is not to save the poor. That would be 
too much to ask of them. Its only concern is, believe it or not, 
to save the millionaires in Canadian professional sport. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As far as I know, none of these sports millionaires are 
wondering how they will manage to put food on the table for 
their families. I can assure the House that the privileged few 
who feed off the system do not have these kinds of worries. 
Still, the government has decided to help them out, to save 
them. But to save them from what? Is it not normal for people 
who earn millions of dollars to pay taxes accordingly? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberal government does not seem to think so, because it is 
about to reduce by hundreds of millions of dollars the taxes 
paid by these poor sports millionaires. The government wants to 
fund these measures at the expense of the real poor from the 
middle class, in part by drawing billions of dollars from the EI 
surplus that belongs to them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would someone please explain to the leader of this government 
and to his ministers that millionaires are not poor? There is a 
limit to being out of touch with the reality of those who 
elected them and whom they wooed by promising to represent them 
well and defend their interests, only to forget everything the 
day after the election. I think it is high time the Prime 
Minister start listening again to what ordinary people have to 
say. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I urge him to visit seniors in my riding of Jonquière and listen 
to what they think of his plans to help professional sports 
tycoons, while at the same time dropping 40,000 loyal government 
employees, including 1,000 or so in the Jonquière tax centre, 
employees with whose services the government is about to 
dispense by shifting them to a private agency that will not be 
obligated to them in any way two years from now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before rushing to the rescue of professional sports tycoons, 
this government must scrap Bill C-43 and reassure the 40,000 
affected employees that they no longer have to fear for their 
future. If it fails to do so, it will mean that the government 
has a hidden agenda, which is completely different from the one 
it sold Quebeckers and Canadians in the last election campaign. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the 1997 election campaign, the government never told Revenue 
Canada employees that, as a reward, 40,000 of them would fall 
into the clutches of a bureaucratic structure. The government 
never said that, and therefore had no mandate to do so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This government never told Quebeckers and Canadians that, if 
they voted for it in 1997, it would set about dismantling Canada 
a little at a time, and yet this is what it is doing by 
privatizing 20% of the federal public service.  This government 
never said so openly and therefore was never mandated to do 
this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I repeat, this government has no mandate to do this.  If the 
Liberal government still understands the meaning of the word 
democracy, it has only one option open, that of abandoning the 
establishment of the Canada customs and revenue agency.  I 
realize it is not an easy decision.

</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not easy, because I suspect that the Liberals have 
probably already promised some of their friends in the private 
sector, no doubt themselves poor millionaires too, that the new 
structure would benefit them.  Today, however, they have to turn 
to their friends and say they cannot keep their word. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They cannot keep their word because they had already given their 
word to the people of Quebec and Canada that they would act in 
their interest.  The Canada customs and revenue agency is not in 
their interest. 
They cannot keep their word because they had already given their 
word during the election campaign to the officials of the 
department of revenue, including those in my riding, that they 
need not worry about their jobs under a Liberal government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the government of Jean Chrétien has any honour left, it must 
keep the promise it gave to the people of Quebec and Canada and 
kill its proposed Canada customs and revenue agency.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Steve Mahoney (Mississauga West, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I will be sharing my time with the member for Etobicoke North. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I listened to the member who just spoke on behalf of the Bloc. I 
was not sure that the speech had anything to do with the revenue 
bill, but I cannot stand in this place and allow certain comments 
that were made not to be challenged. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It does not seem to matter to members opposite from time to time 
if statements are based on fact or on someone's personal 
interpretation of a particular committee report.  The member went 
on at some length about the report of the subcommittee on sports 
in Canada.  The member should read that report as I have done. 
Nowhere in that report will a reference to tax breaks for 
millionaire athletes be found.  I am absolutely confident that 
members of the government would be opposed to such a thing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wonder what the member might say to the people of Quebec City 
who lost their hockey team due to its inability to compete in the 
marketplace known as the National Hockey League in North America. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wonder what the member of the Bloc might say to the fans in 
Montreal and right across Canada if the Montreal Canadiens were 
to find themselves in jeopardy or facing bankruptcy or the 
possibility of moving to the United States.  It is unimaginable 
that a veteran franchise such as the Montreal Canadiens could 
simply lose its position in the Canadian sports scene. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All that committee has done is highlight the difficulties faced 
in an industry.  Sports in Canada is an industry.  The Montreal 
Canadiens alone pay more in property tax than all franchises in 
the United States combined.  It is a stunning figure and a 
frightening situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I refer other members of the House, not the member of the Bloc, 
to the minority reports that were appended to the committee 
because there was a lot of support for amateur sports in the 
country.  I just wanted to correct the record in that regard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have heard members say in this place that somehow the revenue 
bill was being rushed through the House.  I did a bit of 
research.  In the throne speech of February 1996 an announcement 
was made by the government of its intention to introduce this 
bill.  On June 4 the bill was introduced for first reading and on 
October 2 it received second reading.  It was then sent to 
committee where witnesses from across Canada were interviewed 
about the impact that they thought the bill might have. 
Here we are at December 8 and we are talking about third reading 
of the bill.

<A HREF="#LINKT74"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>To suggest that the bill has been given short shrift or in some 
way rammed through parliament is to simply mislead the Canadian 
public.  The bill has had debate.  It has had input. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also heard from members opposite, particularly those in the 
New Democratic Party, who said that none of the provinces had 
bought into the bill and that none of the provinces were prepared 
to accept the new agency. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me deal first with the province of Quebec.  It is 
interesting that in committee the other day members opposite put 
forth 188 amendments, every one of them calling for a particular 
clause to be rejected.  How many clauses might hon. members think 
are in the bill?  There happened to be 188.  In their creative 
way of thinking, from a province that does not even have its 
taxes collected by the federal government but has its own tax 
collection regime, they would take exception to the agency for 
some unknown reason, simply because it is a government bill and 
to oppose is to oppose is to oppose. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us talk about quotes from some of the folks whom we have 
talked to.  The minister of finance for the province of Nova 
Scotia, Mr. Don Downe said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This contract builds on the current strong, co-operative 
relationship between Nova Scotia and Revenue Canada and provides 
the means for our relationship to evolve under the new agency. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another five provinces are actively working with Revenue Canada 
to determine if this agency could improve the administration of 
their programs because they understand that at the end of the day 
there is only one taxpayer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even Ernie Eves, the Ontario Minister of Finance, in a letter of 
September 22 makes the following point: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The CCRA could benefit Ontario taxpayers if it is able to 
administer Ontario taxes (both non-harmonized and harmonized)— 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is a very interesting point, because the Conservatives in 
Ontario have been very staunchly opposed to any kind of 
harmonization, to any kind of attempt to bring collection 
agencies together and perhaps establish one base tax that could 
be collected for all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why should we fight over who collects it?  It gets transferred 
down to the provinces.  Possibly it could be collected in a 
harmonized negotiated atmosphere and transferred up.  Up to this 
point Mr. Eves and his government have refused to even discuss 
it.  He goes on in his letter: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—more cheaply and efficiently than the Ontario 
government... taxpayers could benefit if the CCRA were able to 
improve services available to taxpayers. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many think that there is some kind of coalition between the 
Ontario Conservative Party, the Reform Party and the drive to 
unite the right.  I want to take members a little farther west on 
that point, if I might, to a proud Albertan, the provincial 
treasurer of Alberta, Mr. Stockwell Day.  We have seen Mr. Day in 
negotiations with the Leader of the Opposition and with others on 
the unite the right drive.  We have seen Tony Clement, the 
minister of transportation for Ontario, joining that somewhat 
crowded king size bed.  Maybe it is queen size, I am not sure. It 
is not that big, but they are attempting to expand it.  I am sure 
members get my point. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reason they are all doing this, they try to purport, is to 
somehow offer a magical solution to the Liberals.  Are you 
signalling victory or two minutes remaining, Mr. Speaker?  Poll 
after poll indicates that Canadians believe in the government, 
believe in the things we are doing.  We have incredible support 
for our Prime Minister and for the policies of the government. 
Let me share the comments of Stockwell Day: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It's good to see Revenue Canada becoming more open to provincial 
input in its approach to collecting provincial taxes, as it moves 
toward its new status as a federal crown agency.  We're always 
willing to explore possibilities that would benefit our taxpayers 
as well as safeguard the public purse. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It appears that as we speak, unfolding before us at this very 
moment, the wheels on the unite the right wagon are falling off.

<A HREF="#LINKT75"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It appears that Mr. Day sees the benefits of an agency that 
could streamline administration, that could be more open and 
accessible to Canadians, that could benefit every taxpayer at the 
provincial and the federal level. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Frankly I congratulate him for not confusing the politics of 
extremism on the right with—I hate to use word common sense 
because Mr. Harris seems to think he owns it—the common sense of 
putting in place an agency that will be accountable to 
parliament, where there will be a mandatory five year review of 
the agency and an opportunity at the public accounts committee to 
review it even more often.  It will be an agency that will be 
accountable to the minister, accountable to parliamentarians, 
accountable to provincial treasurers and ministries across the 
land.  It is an agency whose time has come. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we hear people talk about rationalization and downsizing, we 
have an opportunity to do something that will save taxpayers' 
money and benefit all Canadians.

fueled by members of the opposition who simply find it their duty

of them on this subject.  The vast majority of provinces have

They could contract with Revenue Canada now to do the kind of 
things that are proposed under the agency.  There is really no 
difference. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member said that the opposition always opposes for the 
sake of opposing.  Perhaps he could tell me why he rose in his 
place last night with his colleagues and voted against an 
opposition amendment to ensure that the act would be in force to 
include the principles of impartiality and fairness for 
taxpayers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is he against impartiality and fairness?  Why did he vote 
against the amendment?  Why does he not rise in his place and 
support the entrenchment of a taxpayers bill of rights which 
would ensure no diminishment of accountability under the bill but 
that taxpayers rights to due process and to being treated 
innocent until proven guilty are protected in the legislative 
framework of parliament.

sure that earlier sign was a victory sign because I heard a lot 
of winning arguments by the member for Mississauga West. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are looking at the demands of Canadians for better, more 
responsive and streamlined tax, customs and trade administration 
services.  It is one of the most important reasons for Revenue 
Canada's move to a departmental agency status.  It is a sign of 
the times, the times of economic expansion, the times of 
increased demand for tax, customs and trade services, and the 
times of a marked increase in new jobs since 1993 which has 
resulted in a marked increase in tax filers.  Canada's exports 
are at an all time high. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1997 alone, actual total exports increased 8.6%.  The upturn 
in the domestic economy stimulates imports.  This will not be a 
fleeting trend; the volume of activities will continue to 
increase. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The commitment to improve client service will not change.  Over 
the years resources at Revenue Canada have remained relatively 
stable during this period of economic expansion and sharp 
increases in business volumes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Revenue Canada has done its very best to accommodate the new 
demand.  As a government department Revenue Canada has to submit 
to across the board federal government rules and guidelines which 
apply to some 80 other government departments and agencies, many 
entirely dissimilar from the work done by Revenue Canada.  These 
government-wide rules often fail to meet the specific needs of 
the unique functions the department undertakes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Revenue Canada has exhausted its internal operating 
efficiencies.  There are few gains that can be made through this 
approach.  That work has been done.  There is new work to be 
undertaken.  We must forge ahead and create a new structure, a 
new framework that will provide opportunities and generate new 
efficiencies. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is time for the proposed new Canada customs and revenue 
agency.  It is time for this unique, Canadian model that 
combines the strengths of both the public and private sectors, 
while remaining fully accountable to parliament and the Canadian 
public—while remaining, proudly, in the federal public service. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In developing the Canada customs and revenue agency, Revenue 
Canada has been sensitive to the fact that tax, customs, and 
trade administration affects the lives and livelihoods of 
Canadians. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Revenue Canada's clients insist on better services while at the 
same time they must be dealt with fairly with their rights fully 
protected.  The design of the new agency makes certain the 
essential checks and balances which govern its activities are in 
place and ensures that the accountability as presently stipulated 
under Revenue Canada has been maintained. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The enforcement powers of the new agency will be the same as

is all about harmonization.  To the contrary, Mr. Speaker. 
Revenue Canada can already administer harmonized taxes. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is new is that the proposed Canada customs and revenue 
agency will also be able to collect non-harmonized taxes for the 
provinces, something Revenue Canada is unable to do now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The new agency will be able to expand the potential for single 
window tax collection with considerable savings for businesses 
and individual Canadians.  Is that not what alternative service 
delivery is all about? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is about greater co-ordination between the federal, 
provincial and territorial governments.  A simplified tax 
administration for Canadians will reduce costly overlap and 
duplication between governments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The move to agency status will also permit the adoption of a 
more client oriented approach.  This will increase operational 
flexibility in the management of internal resources.

of Commons Standing Committee on Finance on November 24 on behalf 
of both the Canadian Bar Association and the Canadian Tax 
Foundation: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The move to the agency should provide more flexibility to deal 
with personnel issues, a fundamental aspect, we think, of the 
organization. That flexibility should provide a better position 
to the agency to hire, train and retain good personnel. The 
agency needs to bolster its ranks with good people in order to 
provide better service to taxpayers, which we understand is one 
of the fundamental thrusts of the agency. 
</UL>
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill before the House today will allow the proposed agency 
to tailor its human resources and administrative functions to 
meet the needs of its clients—as well as those of its employees. 
This will mean better service—to provinces and territories, to 
businesses, and to Canadian taxpayers. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Doing something better is not an expansion of power but an 
extension of service, service to Canadians, service to 
businesses, and service to the provinces and territories.  Better 
service means savings in time and money, savings in compliance 
costs for businesses and savings in administrative costs for 
governments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The intent of Bill C-43 is to establish a framework with all the 
checks and balances for a superior agency, a winning proposal for 
government and Canadians alike. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I encourage all members in this House to support this important 
piece of legislation.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Maud Debien (Laval East, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, this 
independent customs and revenue agency will help the revenue 
minister to shirk doing his duty to protect taxpayers from any

independent agencies to say that no, the government is not to 
blame for this or for that, the agencies are.

government, basic duties like enforcing the Income Tax Act 
supposed to reassure taxpayers? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the hon. member not believe that privatizing the revenue 
department is just another way to appoint friends of the 
government to all the positions available on the agency's board 
of management? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Roy Cullen:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the member from the Bloc 
Quebecois for her comments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This initiative does not mean we are privatizing Revenue Canada. 
On the contrary, there will be more accountability with this new 
bill. At the present time, there are five accountability 
measures at Revenue Canada. This bill will add three more. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Revenue Canada has legislation on taxpayers' rights, and it will 
be maintained with this bill. It deals with all Canadians who 
have tax related problems. Therefore, this bill improves the 
situation for Canadians.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvan Bernier (Bonaventure—Gaspé—Îles-de-la-Madeleine—Pabok, BQ):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I am not sure if I understood well. The member said 
the minister will still be accountable for tax legislation to 
his peers in the House, that he will still be required to answer 
any questions parliamentarians will want to ask. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the minister is still responsible and has to answer the 
questions, what is the use of changing the law?

<A HREF="#LINKT79"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is it to harmonize federal and provincial tax laws? There is no 
need to estaablish a superagency to do that. It can be done with 
the provinces, as shown by the harmonization of the GST and the 
PST in Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not know if that is what they want to do. But what is 
behind all this—and I would like the member to confirm this if 
he can—is that the minister will no longer be the employer of 
the tax collectors who now work for Revenue Canada and 
collection agencies. The bill says that the agency will be their 
employer. Will the minister end up with his chauffeur as his 
sole employee? Is that what it means? Do we still need to have a 
minister in that case? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is the government looking to save money at the expense of public 
servants? It seems to me that this is an anti-union bill. The 
government is cutting the federal public service by 20%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is that the purpose of this bill? If the member has not 
understood, he can tell us and then again ask the minister the 
question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Roy Cullen:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the Bloc Quebecois member 
for his comments. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think the member opposite has missed the intent of the new 
agency.  If I might say, it is the typical paranoia from the Bloc 
Quebecois.  It is always a plot to look at harmonizing Quebec 
taxes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As my colleague from Mississauga West pointed out earlier, the 
Quebec government already has its own unique or separate income 
tax system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What this new agency will do is it will provide more 
flexibility.  It will eliminate redundancy, overlap and 
duplication.  It will be one-stop shopping for businesses.  It 
will provide efficiencies for government.  The bill is about 
achieving certain economies and efficiencies for the benefit of 
all Canadians.

time and passed. 
<P><A NAME="LINK234"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Angela Vautour (Beauséjour—Petitcodiac, NDP):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
found it interesting to listen to the members who spoke on Bill 
C-43, especially the government members. It is quite clear they 
are avoiding telling the truth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am a former member of the Public Service Alliance. I worked 
for Parks Canada, the Department of Veterans Affairs and the 
Department of Human Resources Development. I am well aware of 
the gimmicks the government uses to get rid of a large number of 
public servants. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was announced 45,000 to 55,000 jobs were going to be cut 
across the country. Services will go with the jobs. The 
government has found a way to eliminate 40,000 jobs. It has 
decided to establish a new agency. By so doing it will also 
break the unions. 
I suggest it is going to have a very difficult time getting rid 
of these 40,000 employees because Revenue Canada unionized 
workers are very well organized. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>And they are not pleased. I met with their union 
representatives. They do not want this agency. They are tired of 
the insecurity. The purpose of the agency is once again to 
create insecurity among workers, who do not know whether or not 
they will have a job two to three years down the road.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The member opposite talked earlier about ASD, alternate service 
delivery, and he painted a very rosy picture. But what ASD is 
all about is clearly cutting salaries, benefits, and eventually 
laying off people. This is not complicated. We already saw this 
with Parks Canada, which is going to become an agency; workers 
are worried because they do not know where they will be two 
years from now, whether or not they will have a job, and what 
kind of salary they will get. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Park visitors can see they are worried because the new policy is 
to make a profit at any cost. The same will happen with the 
Canada customs and revenue agency. 
They say they will be collecting provincial and municipal taxes, 
and that it will be more efficient that way. But the hon. member 
did not tell us how many jobs will be cut. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Back home, in Bouctouche, the employment centre has been closed. 
In the Department of Human Resources Development alone, 5,000 
jobs have been cut. Because of that, some employment centres and 
their services have disappeared. People have to travel to 
Richibucto, Shediac, or Moncton. Many do not go there, because a 
large number of them cannot afford it. So they have to do 
without those services. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is what happens with those agencies and the decisions the 
Liberal government makes. They never stop slashing and cutting. 
And then they brag about their job creation record. 
However, they should not forget to tell us new jobs are part 
time jobs, low wage jobs without benefits, that make families 
even poorer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Recently, the UN stated the same thing we have been saying for 
years. The Liberal government tells us these findings are based 
on the statistics for 1995. In that case, we would not like to 
see the statistics for 1998, because they are even worse. 
Canadians will not buy the argument that the statistics the UN 
analysed are for 1995. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How many people qualify for EI benefits today, compared to 1995? 
How many more children live in poverty, compared to 1995? I 
would be ashamed to say these are the figures for 1995. They 
would be better off say they are the figures for 1998. One 
wonders sometimes who is advising those members. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am here today to say that we know the truth. We know that 
people are living in poverty.  We organised a nice dinner for 
children who will not have any Christmas, as was already 
mentioned in the House.  Why? Because these children are poor. 
We have to help them, we have to share our wealth.  It is too 
bad that there are not more members on the government side who 
feel like sharing their wealth.  But they only feel for banks 
and millionaires. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the government talks about cutting taxes, it does not mean 
that poor people will pay less.  No, no.  Millionaires will 
benefit and the gap between rich and poor will grow even larger. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>And then the Minister of Finance gets up and brags about doing 
this and that.  Yet, this same government refuses to come to New 
Brunswick and look at the situation it created with its cuts and 
its new rules, regulations and legislation. 
The Minister of Human Resources Development fears New Brunswick 
more than the devil fears holy water, as we say in our neck of 
the woods.  He does not even come close to New Brunswick, 
because he does not want to face what he has created.  The Prime 
Minister who, at one time, was elected in my riding no longer 
has the courage to come and visit us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The day will come when they have to face the music, because, as 
members know, chickens always come home to roost.  If the 
government will not answer questions here, it will have to 
answer them some day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us talk about the 40,000 employees who feel insecure today. 
Let us talk about the centralization of authority.  Let us talk 
about the jobs we are going to lose. We do not hear anything on 
that score. 
Those who do lose their jobs, what will they find?  Part time 
jobs, insecure jobs, jobs that will leave them even poorer than 
they were?  This is the mandate of the Liberal governement.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We talk about taxes, we even hear members of the Progressive 
Conservative Party say that we ought to lower taxes. But who 
introduced the GST? Earlier, a Liberal member said that the 
opposition was there to criticize. Yet, I remember the Liberal 
Party promised to abolish the GST. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What happened in New Brunswick? We got a 15% tax on everything. 
We got a tax increase on electricity, heating and children's 
clothing. We do not need an agency to collect these taxes 
because it is already being done in New Brunswick. If they use 
this as an excuse, it will not wash, because taxes are already 
being collected. We already pay a 15% tax. 
It is true that we got rid of the GST, but what we got in return 
is even worse. Frank McKenna was very happy to have done it. I 
think he got a little bonus at the time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When an agency is set up, we have to look at the facts. This is 
just another way to reduce job security. It is just another way 
to cut jobs and again, it is always the same people who are 
caught in the middle, those who work all year around, the middle 
income earners, who end up getting poorer and poorer. Some 
things never change. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is no different when we talk about lowering taxes. The EI 
premiums were reduced by 15 cents for every $100. I found that 
so ridiculous. Opposition parties felt the premiums should have 
been reduced even further. Today, the Reform Party told the 
House that employees could have saved about $300 a year. 
Yes, but how much money was taken from our communities because 
people no longer get their employment insurance cheque? Is this 
so hard to understand? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not an economist or a mathematician, but the government 
took $20 billion from the New Brunswick economy because it made 
the system too complicated for people to receive employment 
insurance benefits. Is this not cutting into the economy? Is 
this not causing problems? Is this not causing problems for our 
small and medium size businesses? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no longer any money in circulation. Thousands of people 
received employment insurance cheques and put all that money 
into their community. The money of the unemployed was not going 
into RRSPs; they need it to live on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some members of parliament are saying that premiums have not 
been reduced enough. So now, there will be other reasons to cut 
benefits once again. The government will say that its surplus is 
not sufficient and will make cuts once again on the back of the 
little slave who needs his meagre cheque. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Who benefited from the 15 cent reduction on each $100 of 
insurable income? It is the large companies that have thousands 
of employees. It is not the small company that has four or five 
employees, or only one, or the self-employed who does not pay any 
premiums at all. This does not help the small employer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Sometimes I wonder how people can go to bed at night and sleep, 
when we think about the billions of dollars that were taken from 
the economy. Almost one billion dollars was taken from the New 
Brunswick economy alone. The finance minister always harps on 
the $1.7 billion he has given back to poor families. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has made nearly one billion dollars worth of cuts 
in New Brunswick alone, and it brags about giving back $1,7 
billion for the whole country. I know my maths. Believe me, it 
has taken away a lot more than it has given back. There is no 
doubt about that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members should look at what is going on in the hospitals. They 
should come and see the waiting lists in New Brunswick. I am 
beginning to think that the situation is not the same in all the 
provinces. When I go to the doctor here, in Ottawa, I am out of 
the clinic within 45 minutes. And I want the people who are 
listening to know that these are not special clinics for MPs. In 
and out in 45 minutes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Try to get the same kind of service in New Brunswick. It is just 
impossible. We do not have the same level of service. We cannot 
see a doctor in less than 45 minutes in New Brunswick. 
I am beginning to wonder if we really do have the same level of 
service. Maybe there are more complaints coming from Atlantic 
Canada, but the fact is we have been neglected. And it is still 
going on. The more Liberal governments we have in Atlantic 
Canada, the worse it is for these provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is also the issue of pay equity. The Department of 
National Revenue has 40,000 employees. 
How many of them have been denied pay equity?

</I></B></P><P align=left>The United Nations said it. A woman from the Philippines said 
she would never see the day when she would criticize Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are supposed to be a model country. We were, but we no longer 
are, with the number of calls we receive in our offices from 
people who are in utterly hopeless situations. There is Albert 
County; the Minister of Human Resources Development refuses to 
recognize that some people have to drive one hour to the 
employment centre in Moncton to try to find a job, in vain. 
To qualify for employment insurance, they need the same number 
of hours as someone living in Moncton. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is unacceptable. The minister is denying these people the 
right to qualify for employment insurance; he is denying them 
months of EI benefits. Why? Because he has the authority and can 
do what he wants. The fact that people are destitute is of no 
concern to him. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>And now we have our infamous toll highway. Some people will have 
to pay $14 to go to their doctor or the hospital. How many 
people are going to go without care because they cannot afford 
the $14? The government will say they can travel on the other 
road, the unsafe one. It is indeed because the alternate route 
is not safe that this highway had to be built. However, if you 
are poor, if you cannot afford it, take a chance. Take the other 
road. This is unconscionable in a country that is supposed to be 
the best in the world. 
If I recall, we came in 10th not long ago. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The same applies to post-secondary education. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is exactly the same thing with Bill C-43. The government says 
it is a good thing. We have heard that one before. Everything is 
good. It is good for a very small group of millionaires. 
Everything is good for them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the finance minister goes out for dinner, he does not go to 
the food bank. He goes out with his banker pals. They pat him on 
the shoulder, telling him “Keep up the good work. We are doing 
fine”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Food drives are being organized because Christmas is around the 
corner and people have nothing to eat. Children will have no 
Christmas presents. Members have the nerve to criticize while I 
am talking. They should repeat what they are saying to the 
people who line up at the food banks every day to eat. This is 
the fastest growing industry in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They are critical because they refuse to see there is a problem 
in this country. That way, they can go to bed and sleep at 
night. They are denying reality, but reality will catch up with 
them one day. It is breathing down their necks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will conclude by saying that Bill C-43 is another attempt to 
destroy security, break unions and get rid of good salaries. 
Canadians have to realize that service are also on the way out. 
Once the employees are gone, so is the service.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Grant Hill (Macleod, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I would 
like to take this opportunity to rise and ask the member a 
question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The question is:  What does she think of the process of time 
allocation being invoked on a bill like this?  This is one of 
those anti-democratic actions to which I believe the NDP is 
opposed.  Would the member make a comment on what she thinks of 
the process in relation to this bill?

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Angela Vautour:</B>  Mr. Speaker, this is a very important 
bill and I think we should have all the time that is needed to 
make sure, or maybe I should say more time to try to convince the 
government that this is a lot of crap, I guess. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Being a new member, I have seen government members being able to 
cut things short when something is not suitable to them. 
Certainly this is a very important bill and I think we should 
have decent time to debate it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  Before we take any 
more questions and comments, I cannot let that one slide by 
either.  We are going to find new adjectives that are more 
presentable in the House.  It is just not appropriate. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK236"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvan Bernier (Bonaventure—Gaspé—Îles-de-la-Madeleine—Pabok, BQ):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I shall try to leave a little time for my Reform 
Party colleague, for questions and comments.  Since the debate 
is to end by 5.15 p.m., I have less than 15 minutes left. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to recap the situation with Bill C-43, giving the 
Bloc Quebecois view of it in four points. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, we feel that this bill is a form of abdication of 
political power. Even if the other side of the floor is telling 
us that the minister will still be accountable, that is not the 
impression we get from reading the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second point in the powerlessness of the Minister of 
National Revenue.  I have always thought of him as a nice guy, 
but I cannot understand how a minister with 20% of the public 
service under him would want to find himself, the day after this 
bill passes, with possibly only his chauffeur still working for 
him.  I wonder how appropriate it is to still have a minister 
responsible for this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What I see as equally serious, given the size of the public 
service, and this is the third point the Bloc Quebecois wishes 
to bring to the attention of this House, is that establishment 
of this new agency appears to be anti-union.  They are trying to 
do away with 20% of the Canadian public service.  That is not 
peanuts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fourth point is that this bill smacks of centralization. 
Not only does the government have trouble keeping its hands in 
its own business, it would like, with the agency, to look after 
everything to do with taxes.  It would like to offer its 
services to the provinces.  It would even like to offer its 
services to municipalities.  If this is not centralization, I 
would ask the other side of the House to give me another term 
for it, one that is acceptable, of course. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With the four points I have just raised, if it is true that this 
is an abdication of political power or if it is not true, in 
other words if the government will in fact continue to be 
responsible under the Income Tax Act, and accountable to the 
House for responding to questions on the Act, what is the point 
of establishing this agency?

<A HREF="#LINKT84"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will always question the fact that with the federal 
government, primarily when government seats are occupied by 
Liberal Party members, the word “modernize” often rhymes with 
“privatize”.  Where is the government going with this? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since the Liberals' election in 1993, they have privatized the 
railways, tried to privatize the ports and there are even 
privatization agreements for the airports.  Canada Post 
Corporation, which is no longer a government department as such, 
was established earlier. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is the government sending the message that Canada is being put 
up for sale piece by piece, that there will just be a group of 
subcontractors from whom Canadian taxpayers will have to get 
public services and pay for them? The user pay principle is 
being hammered home with the imposition of new rates by the 
coast guard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the government insists on a user pay system, it should allow 
all Canadian taxpayers to pool their collective interests and to 
start calling for bids themselves. They could draft the bids and 
manage their own affairs. Is this where Canada is headed? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other thing that concerns us with this way of doing things 
is that the agency will privatize its operations and will let go 
20% of the public servants who are currently working for Revenue 
Canada. 
Clauses 15, 22 and 25 of the bill, which deal with the 
appointment of the directors of that future agency, are of 
particular concern to me. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is provided that 15 directors will be appointed, including a 
chairperson and a commissioner. These people will be appointed 
by the government, which will have a great opportunity to reward 
friends that did not get elected, or that have been waiting to 
be compensated for past services. This is worrisome. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is also worrisome is that these appointees will have the 
authority to determine their own salary. Some members opposite 
may object that this is not true, that I should just read the 
clauses carefully. I will do just that. Clause 30(1) provides, 
and I quote: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>30.(1) The Agency has authority over all matters relating to 
</UL><UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>(a) general administrative policy in the Agency; 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(b) the organization of the Agency; 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(c) Agency real property as defined in Section 73; and 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(d) personnel management, including the determination of the 
terms and conditions of employment of persons employed by the 
Agency. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Are savings going to be made at the expense of frontline 
workers, for the benefit of senior managers, who will be 
appointed by government people? This is very worrisome. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When it says they have the authority to determine their 
conditions of employment, will the future chair or future senior 
officers want to compare themselves, in terms of salary or funds 
for which they are responsible, to bank presidents?  Without 
naming any names, this is several times what members here make. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have no objection to people in a capitalist system making 
money, and the structure is such that they are accountable to 
their shareholders.  In this case, however, I fail to see how 
they can be accountable to these shareholders, the people of 
Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Usually, it is elected officials who are responsible for how 
they manage things.  But here we have a superminister sharing 
his management authority with a team of 15 friends of the party. 
That will be fun. 
Who will be answerable to Canadians as shareholders?

<A HREF="#LINKT85"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even more amusing are clauses 47 and 49, which provide that the 
agency's business plans must be submitted to the Treasury Board 
for approval and that the minister must table a summary of the 
plan in each House of Parliament in the first fifteen days after 
it is approved. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There will be only 15 days in which to do a post-mortem of the 
megaprojects and megastructures to which the members across the 
way have accustomed us.  They are very good at cover-ups.  As we 
have seen in recent budgets, they are also very good at making 
cuts that only kick in somewhere down the line.  Is that what we 
can expect?  I have some serious questions about transparency 
and accountability for actions further down the road. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will digress, if I may. I come from a seaside riding. While 
the government wants to part with 20% of its employees—and is 
willing to give up all related powers—I find it somewhat shocking 
to see the Minister of Canadian Heritage come to the rescue of 
rich sports people these past few weeks. She sponsored a bill on 
the establishment of marine conservation areas. On the one hand, 
the government wants to take apart a department or get rid of 
civil servants. On the other hand, through the establishment of 
marine conservation areas, a field the minister does not know 
the first thing about, it wants to infringe on an area of 
provincial jurisdiction. To compound the problem, these marine 
conservation areas will have to have on-shore facilities. But who 
lives by the sea? Fishers and plant workers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last June, the government opposite sneaked in a final proposal 
washing its hands of the crisis in the fisheries. The whole mess 
is no longer its problem. Now I wonder who is going to stand up 
for fishers and plant workers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the one hand, it tries to get rid of 20% of its public 
servants. On the other, it got rid of 40,000 fishers and plant 
workers and wants to establish marine conservation areas. I 
cannot for the life of me understand the government's management 
style nor its policy thrusts. It blows all over the place. It 
twists and turns. Nobody will be able to understand it any more. 
Worse yet, no one across the way will be able to answer our 
questions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wonder about the appropriateness of this bill at a time when, 
as my colleague from Beauséjour—Petitcodiac said earlier, OECD 
statistics show that, far from diminishing, the number of poor 
children is on the rise. The government would have us believe 
that the elimination of 20% of jobs in the public service will 
somehow result in fewer poor in this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am quite willing to believe—

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Joe Fontana (London North Centre, Lib.)</B>  moved that 
Bill C-316, an act to amend the Income Tax Act (interest on 
students loans), be read the second time and referred to a 
committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said:  Mr. Speaker, it is my honour to speak on my Bill 
C-316.  Like my fellow members of the government caucus as well 
as other members of parliament, I believe that a well educated, 
vibrant workforce is the key to Canada's continued growth and 
prosperity and improved standard of living for all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of all the riches the country holds, our greatest resource by 
far is our people.  It is our responsibility as the government of 
this great country to provide the people of Canada with an 
environment in which they may reach their full potential. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By giving recent graduates a tax credit for interest paid on 
student loans, the bill aims to support those Canadians who have 
decided to invest not only in themselves but in Canada and in our 
common future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For years businesses have been given a tax credit for interest 
paid on business investment loans.  This credit was granted based 
on the reasoning that moneys invested in business were 
contributing back to the Canadian economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-316 builds on this rationale by promoting the concept 
that a student's investment in his or her education is an 
investment not only in himself or herself but also an investment 
in Canada and in our future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government adopted the primary tenant of Bill C-316 in the 
1998 budget and for that I thank the Prime Minister, the Minister 
of Finance and Liberal caucus colleagues for their support.  The 
main issue which remains is the extension of interest relief to 
all student loans. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are tens of thousands of students across Canada who do not 
qualify for government sponsored student loans.  For many of 
these students the only way to pay for their education is to turn 
to private lending institutions for loans. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-316 would extend the interest relief credit to involve 
those loans that have been granted by private lending 
institutions for the purposes of financing a student's 
post-secondary education. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Education is a high priority for me and I believe for all 
members of the House and the government.  The growing global 
economy is creating work that uses minds, not muscle.  In the 
early 1990s more than 60% of new jobs were created in the areas 
of information and communication technology. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are few businesses today that do not use a computer 
somewhere in their organization.  Moreover, Canadians who earn 
good salaries and pay taxes contribute to a strong economy.  A 
strong economy leads to progress and that is why the Liberal 
government launched a major assistance program this year, the 
Canadian opportunities strategy.  This is good economic policy 
and good social policy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The number of jobs requiring a university degree or 
post-secondary diploma has increased by 1.3 million since 1990. 
On the other hand, the number of jobs available for people with 
less education has dropped by 800,000. 
These statistics speak for themselves and the government is 
paying close attention.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition to transfer payments to the provinces to support 
post-secondary education, the Liberal government has put in place 
several initiatives to help Canadians who want to go to college 
or university.  Canadians today must excel at the post-secondary 
level in order to achieve their personal dreams and to keep 
Canada at the head of the developed world, a global leader. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The most important direct federal support for post-secondary 
students is the Canada student loans program. Since the Liberal 
government brought in this student loan program in 1964, over 34 
years ago, 2.7 million students in financial need have received 
over $12 billion in loans.  Loans amounting to $1.4 billion went 
to 360,000 students in 1996 and 1997 alone.  The CSLP is helping 
380,000 students this year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The new Canadian opportunities strategy will help hundreds of 
thousands of students through a series of measures.  The strategy 
helps students manage their debt load through tax relief for 
interest on student loans.  Graduates with long term problems 
repaying their loans may be able to reduce their debt or qualify 
for extended interest relief for up to 54 months. Through an 
improved student loans program the Liberal government is making 
it easier for young Canadians to gain the skills and knowledge 
essential to building an innovative economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1994 we announced that we would put an additional $2.5 
billion over five years into the Canada student loans program. 
More than $1 billion in Canada student loans helped about 300,000 
Canadian students go to college or university this year and the 
level of commitment is continuing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also increased loan limits by more than 50%.  They had been 
frozen by the last government in 1984.  We have brought in more 
flexible repayment rules.  Under the old rules borrowers had to 
begin paying back their student loans six months after graduation 
even if they were unemployed or earning very low incomes.  Under 
the new rules payment can be reduced or deferred for up to an 
additional 30 months and the government will pay the interest 
during that time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Furthermore, the government introduced Canada study grants of up 
to $3,000 a year.  This will help over 25,000 needy students with 
children or other dependents.  We also doubled the annual limit 
on contributions to the registered education savings plan to 
$4,000 so that young families could put more money away for their 
children's future education.  When fully implemented, the budget 
proposals of last year will increase federal assistance to 
post-secondary education by over $270 million a year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill is more than a simple tax credit.  It is about giving 
young Canadians the help they need as they enter the workforce, 
hope and confidence of a prosperous future and the dream of 
possibilities.  It is about telling Canadians that when they 
choose to invest in their future through education their elected 
representatives, we here to represent them, will support them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since introducing this bill I have received numerous letters of 
support from students, educators, parents, school administrators 
from across the country as well as from members of parliament 
from all parties, all of whom recognize the importance of 
supporting our young people as they make the transition from 
classroom to workroom to boardroom. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I call on all members of the House to recognize and acknowledge 
the importance of supporting Canada's young people, for they are 
the foundation on which Canada's future will be built.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gilles-A. Perron (Rivière-des-Mille-Îles, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
would like to congratulate the hon. member for London North 
Centre. We are in favour of Bill C-316 and it is unanimously 
that the members of the Bloc Quebecois hail the initiative of 
the hon. member for London North Centre.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must indeed support our young people, as our hon. colleague 
said. But that is what we, in Quebec, have been doing since 
1964. At the time, the Prime Minister Pearson and Premier Lesage 
agreed on the transfer of powers over 24 areas to Quebec. One of 
these areas of responsibility was education. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1964, we immediately set out to develop in Quebec one of the 
best education systems and a grants and bursaries system second 
to none in the world today. We are very proud of this system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why we furious and prepared to fight with all we have 
got to keep the federal government from laying even a finger on 
our school system. 
The Government of Quebec should be able to opt out of the 
millennium scholarship program with full compensation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the people across the way do things that we find are good, 
and they do, I make a point of acknowledging them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again, I want to tell our colleague from London North Centre 
that he can count on our support. We will be voting in favour of 
this bill.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Forseth (New Westminster—Coquitlam—Burnaby, 
Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the purpose of this enactment is to allow 
a person who pays interest on a student loan to deduct from 
income, for the purposes of determining the tax payable, the full 
amount of the interest for 10 years after the first payment of 
interest was due.  If the student does not use the full deduction 
in any year it may be transferred to the person, if any, who 
guaranteed or co-signed the loan initially. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It covers loans made under the Canada Student Loans Act, the 
Canada Student Financial Assistance Act and certain other loans 
for the same purpose not made under the government loan program 
for students if they meet the prescribed conditions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The total cost of this new tax measure may amount to some $800 
million.  The 17% tax credit included in the measure will cost 
about $130 million.  It would be a major step in helping 
students.  Canadian society in general is certainly better off if 
we produce more university graduates.  A well educated young 
population that has marketable skills benefits the individual and 
the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada's academic community is as good as that of any country. 
In many areas we are better.  However, Canadian students have 
been under enormous pressure to bear more of the costs of their 
education.  The total amount of federal-provincial student loans 
jumped from $875 million in 1990 to over $2.1 billion in 1994, a 
144% increase in just four years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As education is an investment, it should not be treated any 
differently than other capital investments that receive tax 
credits.  Allowing student loan deductibility will relieve some 
of the pressure resulting from increasing student loan debts, 
even though student fees are only a fraction, perhaps just 10%, 
of the full cost. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Tax relief in the form of student loan interest deductibility 
will reduce student loan default rates.  Tax relief for students 
may result in more opportunity for young people to apply to 
university and community college. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals have cut $7 billion from transfers to the provinces 
for health care and post-secondary education and are replacing it 
with $325 million a year from the millennium scholarship fund and 
$120 million per year from three other grant programs.  The fund 
will not ease existing student debts.  A grant of $3,000 to 6% of 
students will not help in a meaningful way, except in a political 
way, as it will be given by a Liberal government.  Therefore, 
students are supposed to be grateful and vote Liberal.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill was introduced before the February 1998 budget.  What 
is proposed in Bill C-316 goes further than the announcements 
contained in the 1998 budget, however.  Considering the brain 
drain that afflicts certain sectors of our economy, such as 
computer science and medicine, this measure could be seen as a 
way of keeping recent graduates in Canada.  This would protect 
Canada's human capital. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A Reform government would help all students by increasing 
transfers to the provinces for education, giving broad based tax 
relief, creating an income contingent repayment program and 
allowing interest deductibility. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We oppose the call for free, universally available undergraduate 
university attendance at this point.  Some of the unrealistic 
student lobby groups have asserted that it is their right to have 
free university.  They have also added that they want 100% 
grants.  However, the country just cannot afford it at the 
present time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There was also the operation of personal responsibility to 
contribute at least a fraction of the great subsidized benefit 
which university students receive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are many ways to ensure that demonstrated academic talent 
is supported and encouraged.  Finances alone should not be a 
barrier.  Therefore, loans, bursaries, scholarships and payment 
plans attached to income tax forms to truly address the ability 
to pay is the way to go at the present point in the nation's 
finances. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill is a good idea and should be supported not just by 
Reformers, but by all members of the House. 
<P><A NAME="LINK248"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Libby Davies (Vancouver East, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am 
very pleased to have the opportunity today to speak in support of 
Bill C-316, which has been introduced by the member for London 
North Centre. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to congratulate the member for bringing forward 
this proposal which will help provide some relief to students who 
are in very dire straits in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we have heard, the purpose of this bill is to allow a person 
who pays interest on a student loan to deduct from income, for 
the purposes of determining tax payable, the full amount of the 
interest for 10 years after the first payment of interest was 
due.  If the student does not use the full deduction in any year 
it may be transferred to the person, if any, who guaranteed or 
co-signed the loan initially. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe that the member's rush now for bringing forward this 
bill is because business owners are permitted to deduct interest 
paid on business investment loans.  Using that provision as a 
precedent, Bill C-316 acknowledges the role of student loans as 
investments which deserve the same consideration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Certainly from that point of view, in terms of the motivation of 
the member, we would support this bill coming forward. However, I 
think it also needs to be pointed out that this particular bill 
is a bit like treating the symptoms while ignoring the disease. 
The fact is that tax relief, while always welcome, does nothing 
to ease the fact that students must cough up increasingly high 
tuition fees in order to make it through post-secondary 
education. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill, although providing some relief, does nothing to 
address the fact that post-secondary education is becoming 
increasingly inaccessible to more and more students, particularly 
those with low and moderate incomes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately it does nothing to address the fact that over the 
last decade tuition fees have climbed a whopping 240%.  Even in 
the last year alone tuition fees rose 12% nationally, which is 
seven times the rate of inflation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That should give us some idea of the severe difficulties that 
students are facing today in trying to pay their tuition and in 
making it through school.  It is simply an astounding fact that 
tuition fees are now seven times higher than the rate of 
inflation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Nor does this bill, unfortunately, expunge the massive debts 
that students are graduating with, which now average $25,000. 
That figure is up from the average of $13,000 when the Liberals 
took power in 1993. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are talking about a bill that would amend the Income Tax Act. 
The bottom line is that the reason we have a crisis in 
post-secondary education is because we have seen a retreat in 
public funding.  We have seen the federal government slash funds 
from post-secondary education by $3 billion since 1995.  As well, 
$4 billion has been cut from training.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we really want to examine what is facing students in Canada 
today, why they are having such a hard time and why more and more 
students are graduating into poverty, we have to look to federal 
public policy from this Liberal government which basically has 
withdrawn its support to the provinces in transfer payments. 
Students are paying the price for that.  That needs to be said. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While I support the member in his efforts to provide some 
relief, I also hope that the member would, within his own caucus 
and within his own government, rethink and examine the policies 
that have been put into place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the changes in the last budget that was particularly 
cynical which affected students was the change in the bankruptcy 
laws.  That has really had a very dramatic impact on students. 
It used to be that a student could declare bankruptcy two years 
after completing studies.  It should be pointed out that most 
students do not declare bankruptcy.  Most students will do 
everything they can to pay off their Canada student loan.  In 
actual fact, the new law passed by the Liberal government now 
says that a student cannot declare bankruptcy until 10 years 
after completing studies or finishing school.  That virtually 
rules out that option. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not know about other members of the House, but I have heard 
horror stories from students about how they are harassed by 
collection agencies at 7 a.m or 8 a.m. because they defaulted on 
a payment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am glad the member brought this forward.  However, we have to 
get the real picture of the things that have been done by the 
government, such as changing the bankruptcy law and slashing 
public funding to post-secondary education, which have made the 
lot of students much worse. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Liberal members often point to the millennium fund as the 
panacea and the cure-all for the difficulties that face students. 
We should recognize that the millennium fund, which does not even 
begin until 2000, is just a drop in the bucket when one compares 
it to what actually has been taken out of public funding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>New Democrats are not about to let the federal government forget 
about the student debt crisis.  Instead of creating a scholarship 
program which duplicates existing programs and does nothing to 
help students in need, we have called on the federal government 
to take steps that would reduce student debt. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have demanded of the government that we end the privatization 
of Canada student loans, that we end the harassment that students 
have to go through. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have also called on the government, along with the provinces, 
to begin to restore the billions of dollars that have been cut 
from post-secondary education.  If we really are genuine about 
wanting to assist students we have to begin at that point.  There 
has to be a recognition of what the erosion of public funding has 
done to post-secondary education. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also suggest that we should follow the leadership of my 
province of British Columbia which has had a tuition freeze for 
three years in a row.  That is something that needs to be done on 
a national basis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the federal government really wants to show leadership for 
students and show that it cares about what happens to students, 
then the minister should be convening a meeting of provincial 
education ministers, putting some bucks back on the table and 
saying “We are going to help students by enacting a national 
tuition freeze”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That would be the first step in restoring confidence in what 
really has been a first class system in Canada of public 
education, which now is going down the slippery slope to 
privatization. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The NDP would change the millennium fund to make it the first 
step of a national grant program to assist first and second year 
students. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Probably most important, we would begin by saying that 
accessibility has to be a national standard that is brought 
forward by the federal government with the co-operation of the 
provinces so that we can say to young Canadians “You do have a 
future.  You do have accessibility and you are not going to come 
out of post-secondary education with a massive debt around your 
neck”.  That is what the reality is now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have talked to students who have a $60,000 debt. 
They are single parents who are trying to pay off that debt and 
they have not started working yet.  It is an appalling situation.

</I></B></P><P align=left>In closing, this is a good measure that has been brought 
forward, but I urge the member to go back to his caucus and say 
that the government must rethink its priorities and that if they 
support public education it needs public funding and confidence 
to make sure students are not facing the severe situation they 
face. 
<P><A NAME="LINK249"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Charlie Power (St. John's West, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker,  I 
congratulate the member for London North Centre for bringing 
forth the bill.  Obviously it would be an improvement to the 
student loan system of today.  However, I have fully concur and 
agree with the member from British Columbia who just spoke. 
Oftentimes the Liberal government takes away so much and gives 
back a tiny bit in its place, which does not solve the problem at 
all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The real problem with post-secondary education is the cash 
transfers under the Canadian Health and Social Transfer Act. In 
1995-96, $16.6 billion were transferred to the provinces to give 
social services and in particular post-secondary educational 
services to all young people.  In 1997-98 Canadian health and 
social transfers to the provinces were $10.4 billion, or a loss 
of $6.2 billion to the provinces primarily in a fund directed 
toward social services and in particular post-secondary 
education. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we combine that problem with tremendous cuts in transfer 
payments to the provinces, a tremendously high unemployment rate 
for young people, twice the national average consistently for the 
last 10 years, we realize the problem that many of our young 
students face. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill we are discussing is a good one.  It is an improvement. 
Giving a tax break or a tax incentive to somebody who is heavily 
in debt, to the tune of $50,000 or $60,000 after getting an 
education, is good, but it is not the solution that young 
Canadians want when they cannot find jobs.  Allowing students to 
write off some of their interest under student debt is good, but 
again it is not the solution that young Canadians want. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First and foremost young Canadians want an opportunity to access 
a good education at a reasonable cost.  That is not happening in 
Canada today with tuition increases of over 200% in the last 
seven or eight years.  Education is becoming almost impossible 
for many of our young people to access at any cost.  Tuition 
increases are prohibitive.  They are encouraging some of our 
young people not to become educated and as a result they will be 
faced with tremendous unemployment problems as they go through 
their lives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bankruptcy problems of young students and the change the 
government made to make it more difficult for students to declare 
bankruptcy is shameful.  It does not serve young Canadians well. 
It does not serve students well.  It is almost discriminatory 
against young people who have worked hard to obtain an education. 
If we combine that with some of the out-migration because there 
are no job opportunities in Canada, we begin to see a fuller 
picture of the problems facing post-secondary students. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-316 is an improvement.  Our caucus will be voting for 
this improvement.  If nothing else, it at least acknowledges the 
fact that an investment in education is an investment for the 
benefit of the country.  As such students should get a tax break 
because they have invested in many ways as businesses do in their 
education, which makes Canada a stronger, better and more 
productive country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill will allow all students to be treated fairly, those who 
can access the Canadian student loan program and those who have 
to go through private sources of lending such as banks or other 
sources.  If they are attending school and require a loan from a 
private source, a bank or whatever, at least now students 
involved in the post-secondary system will be treated fairly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, we in our caucus will be supporting the bill.  It 
shows that the government is at least beginning to think in the 
right way and look in the direction of post-secondary students, 
education and its value into the next millennium. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We do not agree with some of the other government programs, but 
in this case the member for London North Centre and his caucus 
colleagues have brought forward a bill that makes some sense to 
students and will make their lives a bit easier.  It will get the 
full support of the Conservative caucus.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Nick Discepola (Vaudreuil—Soulanges, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, we 
are here tonight to debate a bill which I consider very 
important for Canadian students. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1820"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT95"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT95"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1820

<A HREF="#LINKT94"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill is aimed not only at helping students have access to 
post-secondary education by allowing them to deduct their annual 
interest payments from their taxable income for a particular 
fiscal year, but also at reducing their overall tax burden. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is worth mentioning that, for the 1997-98 school year, each 
student who graduated had a average loan of $25,000 to pay off. 
If that loan is paid off over a period of ten years at a 10% 
interest rate, the person will pay almost $15,000 in interest 
charges alone. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the majority of students, monthly payments leave very little 
money, even for their basic needs. 
By amending the Income Tax Act to give students the possibility 
of reducing the interest payments on their loans, this bill 
recognizes education as an investment in our country's future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a government, we firmly believe in the importance of 
education for the future of our young Canadians. This 
responsibility belongs to us all. For this reason, we have taken 
the necessary measures to invest in education. We recognize the 
need to remain competitive in a global economy. That means we 
need workers who have the required education and training to 
provide a skilled workforce. This benefits the Canadian economy, 
but it also benefits young workers who, with a good education, 
are in a better position to find permanent jobs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need only look at the figures to see that education is 
increasingly important for the future of our students.  The 
number of jobs requiring university graduation or college 
training has increased by 1.3 million since 1990. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the other hand, the number of jobs available to individuals 
without education has dropped by more than 800,000.  These 
figures clearly show the need to promote education among young 
people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a government, we put a lot of our efforts into measures 
promoting education.  In September 1997, we proposed a strategy 
to give young people scholarships for the new millennium. 
Regardless of the objections put forward, the essence of these 
initiatives is that the scholarships will give students 
additional funds to help with the cost of their education. 
As a Quebecker, I am proud to be part of a government that 
invests in such projects. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Starting in 2000, this money will provide thousands of 
scholarships annually to help young Canadians with low and 
modest incomes to continue their college and university 
education.  This fund will be managed by an institution at arm's 
length from the government and will further eliminate barriers 
to education while rewarding scholastic excellence.  Through 
this program, even more young Canadians will have the skills 
necessary to develop in a society increasingly focussed on 
information and new technologies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The scholarships will support a wide variety of knowledge 
acquisition and skills development programs. They will be 
available to Canadians of all ages studying either full or part 
time at universities, community colleges, CEGEPs or 
state-supported technical facilities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This new initiative is in addition to the numerous measures 
announced in the 1997 budget to reduce the barriers to 
education.  For example, the amount on which post-secondary 
education credits are calculated has already been raised from 
$100 to $150 a month, and will go to $200 after January 1998. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, the education tax credit has been expanded to 
include additional charges by the universities, such as those 
for library and other services. 
By virtue of these changes, a student who received combined 
federal and provincial assistance of $900 in 1995 got $1,200 in 
1998. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In order to help parents put more money aside for their 
children's education, the maximum annual contribution to a 
registered education savings plan was doubled to $4,000.  Now 
parents will also be able to transfer funds from an RESP to an 
RRSP if they have unused amounts.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Graduates who are unable to pay back their loans may, since 
August 1, 1997, defer their payments for 30 months, after the 
standard six-month period.  This change also gives new graduates 
the time to get more solidly established in the work force 
before starting to pay off their loans. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In today's society, we know that having a diploma does not 
immediately open doors to the work force.  Experience is also an 
essential requirement.  This is a reality with which young 
people in search of work are very familiar. 
We know that it is not always easy to get that work experience, 
particularly in our field of study. Managers want employees who 
are qualified, educated and experienced. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberal government is promoting concerted efforts to help 
young people gain the knowledge and know-how necessary to meet 
labour market requirements. This is why the Liberal government 
also included in its youth employment strategy initiatives that 
will allow young Canadians to get their first work experience. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In February 1997, the Liberal government launched the youth 
employment strategy, which seeks to help young people make the 
transition from school to the labour market by developing 
long-term opportunities for meaningful careers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This initiative provides young people with training and 
internship opportunities, job opportunities, and information on 
the job market. 
For 1998-99, the strategy has a budget of $427 million. It is 
estimated that this initiative, which includes the efforts of 
the private sector and associated groups, will provide at least 
95,000 internship opportunities per year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, the federal public service internship program will 
provide a one-year apprenticeship to 3,000 young people. Other 
internship programs will also provide a work experience to 8,000 
graduates, in growth sectors such as science and technology, the 
environment and international trade. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By investing today in helping young Canadians gain the knowledge 
and experience necessary to work in an economy dominated by new 
technologies, the government is ensuring Canada's future 
prosperity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are aware that students' indebtedness is a real problem. 
This is precisely why the 1998 budget was called the “education 
budget” and included major measures to help students manage 
their debt. These initiatives include the millennium 
scholarships, to which I just referred. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the last budget, we also introduced the following changes: 
tax relief for interest payments on loans; extension of the 
interest exempt period; and assistance to reduce the debt. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As for adults who wish to update their skills, we allow them to 
take money out of their RRSPs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All these initiatives show that this government firmly believes 
in the importance of education. It is a priority for us. We want 
to invest in future generations to ensure the best possible 
future for Canadians.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Tony Valeri (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Finance, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I will be very brief.  I wanted 
to stand in the House this evening and applaud the member for 
London North Centre on his concern for students and for bringing 
forward Bill C-316. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under the existing legislative provisions students have a credit 
for tuition fees in an education credit as well as government 
support in the form of Canadian and provincial loan and 
scholarship programs.  However, growing indebtedness has put many 
Canadian students and graduates in a difficult situation.  That 
is why the government supports the spirit of the bill, which is 
designed to facilitate repayment of student loans. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The substance of the bill was an integral part of one of the 
measures proposed in the 1998 federal budget.  The 1998 budget 
proposed the introduction of a 17% credit rather than a 
deduction.  Only loans obtained under the Canada student loan 
program and equivalent provincial programs will qualify for the 
credit.  Although the credit is not transferable, it may if 
necessary be carried forward and used in one of the five years 
following the year of interest payment. 
The government believes that the measure proposed in the 1998 
budget meets objectives through reducing the burden of student 
debt for taxpayers with limited capacity to repay and limiting 
the possible risk of abuse. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1830"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT96"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The question is often whether it should be a credit or whether 
it should be a deduction.  It is always an issue of debate when 
it comes to these types of issues.  It has been argued that a 
credit is preferable to a deduction because it provides fair and 
equitable support to all taxpayers who are repaying loans.  There 
are often many accountants who come before committee or many 
individuals who are familiar with the tax system who often argue 
in favour of a credit rather than a deduction because it is in 
the eyes of those individuals fairer and more equitable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I said earlier, the government fully supports the initiatives 
that will ease the debt burden of students and believes that the 
carry forward of unused credits should allow the full use of that 
credit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government agrees with the substance of Bill C-316 and that 
is why the government put forward the proposals it did in the 
budget and believes that it will provide targeted relief to the 
graduates who need it most. I to congratulate the hon. member for 
bringing this forward. 
<P><A NAME="LINK252"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Adams (Parliamentary Secretary to Leader of the 
Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is 
a pleasure for me also to join in this debate on Bill C-316 
presented by the member for London North Centre.  Like others 
this evening, I congratulate him for bringing this bill forward. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The purpose of the bill is to allow those paying off student 
loans to deduct the interest on the loan from income for tax 
purposes.  This bill is an attempt to deal with the increasing 
problem of student debt.  All across Canada students in 
universities and colleges are facing steadily and steeply rising 
costs, increases in tuition and increases in other fees. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know this is not something that can be solved by a single 
action or even by a few actions by government.  The best way to 
deal with debt is to avoid it.  I know the member for London 
North Centre knows this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government is making great efforts to help students avoid 
debt.  For example, as the member mentioned, the changes in the 
RESPs now include grants so that families which are putting money 
aside in RESPs now get grants that match to a certain level the 
money they are putting aside.  So we actually have grants which 
help students avoid debt. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The millennium scholarships have been mentioned in a negative 
way by the member from the Bloc.  In effect the millennium 
scholarships are also grants.  A substantial number of those 
scholarships, $100,000 a year for 10 years starting in 2000, are 
in effect grants.  They will be based on need.  Some will of 
course be based on merit but many will be based on need. I cannot 
understand how the member from the Bloc can oppose such a 
program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Also to help avoid debt, the government has done its best to 
help students find work before they go to college or university, 
while they are at college or university and in their years 
immediately following graduation.  For example, the federal 
government's summer job programs have increased greatly since 
1994. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another simple example of helping students find jobs is our 
increased support for the research grant councils, the NSERC and 
SSHRC and the Medical Research Council.  Those moneys which go 
into research programs on our campuses rapidly produce jobs for 
students while they are in school, helping in labs with 
experiments and things like that, and jobs during the summers on 
research programs of various types.   Those jobs provide money 
which helps the students avoid debt, but they also provide 
education.  One of the greatest ways to learn is to work in jobs 
of that type.  They also provide the students with this 
invaluable experience for when they graduate.  They can get a job 
which will help them again avoid debt. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In our increased support for science in the federal line 
departments it is the same thing.  An example, although it is not 
a department, is the National Research Council. Its funding goes 
to, among other things, helping students find meaningful work in 
science projects all across the country.

<A HREF="#LINKT97"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another way we have tried to help students avoid debt is by 
simply eliminating the deficit and stimulating the economy and 
bringing the interest rates down.  The unemployment rate in 
Canada now is at its lowest level in 10 years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The renewed national youth strategy was announced yesterday in 
the west by the Prime Minister.  All those things are designed to 
help students find jobs, have money and avoid debt.  But when 
they are faced with it, which Bill C-316 addresses, the question 
is how to cope with it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As he and others have said, we have already improved the Canada 
student loan program.  There is a longer period of time after 
graduating before students have to start paying off the loans. 
We have special measures for students who find exceptional 
difficulties after they graduate in dealing with their loans. 
There are extra funds, as the member for London North Centre 
mentioned, available now for loans and more flexible ways for 
paying those moneys back. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-316 deals with the interest aspect.  I agree with the 
member for London North Centre that this is an investment on the 
student's part.  It is exactly like the business owner who gets a 
tax benefit on the interest for business investment loans. There 
is no difference.  The member for London North Centre is right. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I understand there is a similar program in the United States 
which has been operating effectively for a number of years.  The 
Canadian Alliance of Student Associations, which I am sure would 
support this measure, has pointed out in its recent brief that it 
is not just tuition which is increasing.  There are now many 
compulsory student ancillary fees.  They are not really ancillary 
fees anymore.  A student cannot go to college or university 
without paying these fees anymore than he or she can go without 
paying tuition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian Alliance of Student Associations urges that student 
ancillary fees should also be tax deductible.  I am sure that 
group of students at least, and many others across the country, 
would support the member for London North Centre and Bill C-316 
in the first step which is to make the interest on student loans 
tax deductible. 
<P><A NAME="LINK253"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gerry Byrne (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Natural Resources, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am delighted to say 
to the House and to the member who initiated this bill that I 
offer my congratulations and on behalf of the House and this side 
we are very grateful.  We are indebted to the member for bringing 
once again the concerns of students and higher education into the 
forefront of parliamentary democracy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need more initiatives and good ideas to present to young 
people, in particular those facing significant student debt 
problems. This is one measure which the Department of Finance and 
Revenue Canada should be looking at very seriously.  It 
complements a series of measures which the government has already 
implemented, measures which were described in detail by other 
members. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is the type of debate that students are expecting of the 
House and the type of good ideas that should come forward.

I say to all members who have spoken and other members who have 
indicated their support for this bill how appreciative and 
encouraged I am by their support. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some people have addressed issues that continue to be a 
challenge for governments, federal and provincial, relating to 
accessibility and affordability of education. But the fact that 
everyone talked about the importance of education is a highlight 
in itself.  Everyone recognized education is the key to providing 
hope and opportunities for our young people.  We know the economy 
of tomorrow demands an education.  We have to look at all 
measures. The bill is not perfect. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I introduced Bill C-316 over a year ago and I am happy to see a 
lot of the provisions in the bill, including the deductibility of 
interest which has for the first time been introduced as changes 
to the Income Tax Act in our last budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are a number of initiatives that our government has taken 
into account with regard to education.  We know that education is 
a provincial jurisdiction.  We know that the provinces set the 
tuition fees.  We know that the provinces set the curriculum. 
What Canadians have told us is that regardless of the fact that 
government is really responsible constitutionally for education, 
parents, grandparents and young people themselves want all 
governments to work together toward education and ensuring that 
every person who wants to get an education is not deprived of 
getting that education through colleges or universities or other 
institutions by virtue of the fact that they do not have any 
money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Surely we have learned that regardless of where you live, 
regardless of your socioeconomic stature, you should be provided 
the opportunity of education.  We know education leads to a much 
more prosperous life.  Hence the government's initiatives, 
including this bill, hope to address the question of student 
indebtedness, accessibility and affordability. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I look forward to the support of the House and the support of 
the government to move on the next part of my bill yet to be 
addressed by the government, to make sure that all student loans, 
not only the ones that are under the Canada student loans 
program, are tax deductible to ensure fairness and equity for all 
students, not only those who got the money through the Canada 
student loans program but who went to their banks, their credit 
unions, their trust companies or other financial institutions to 
borrow money to further their education and invest in themselves 
and in the country.

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>ENERGY EFFICIENCY STRATEGY 
</H3><P align=left>

<P><A NAME="LINK256"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pat Martin (Winnipeg Centre, NDP)</B> moved: 
<A NAME="LINK257">&nbsp;</A>
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That, in the opinion of this House, the government should invest 
in a comprehensive energy efficiency strategy, thus: (a) 
exploiting the considerable job creation potential of energy 
efficiency;  (b) encouraging the development of high tech 
expertise and export opportunities; and (c) increasing the number 
of federally owned buildings (of which there are 50,000) 
retrofitted for energy efficiency through the Federal Buildings 
Initiative. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said:  Mr. Speaker, I welcome the opportunity to speak to 
this motion.  I have been quite anxious to introduce and to 
encourage this concept of job creation through energy 
conservation for quite some time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I start by saying thank you to the committee for ruling that 
this motion be deemed votable.  I appreciate that very much.  I 
understand that this is the only motion of the current batch of 
motions in Private Members' Business that was deemed votable in 
this round. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The concept is job creation through energy conservation. 
Although the motion could be worded better, I look forward to the 
opportunity to try to explain what that means. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We believe that the situation does not have to be jobs versus 
the environment as is so often the case.  I would like to 
demonstrate how the situation can be jobs and the environment. 
In other words I point to, focus and showcase the enormous job 
creation opportunities involved in the energy retrofitting of our 
publicly owned buildings. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a carpenter by trade I spent much of my working life building 
megaprojects.  I built energy generating stations.  For many 
years of my career it would be heresy to actually advocate 
harvesting units of energy out of the existing system rather than 
building new generating systems, whether they were nuclear power 
plants or hydroelectric dams.  Obviously that was the kind of 
work that we looked forward to as tradespeople.  Like many 
others, I would drive across the country to try to get on one of 
those megaprojects. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The original research paper on this subject was done in 1993. 
This idea came to fruition because the province of Ontario 
cancelled a huge energy purchase from my province of Manitoba. 
Thus the Conawapa hydro generating station which was about to be 
started had to be cancelled. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many tradespeople were anxiously and eagerly awaiting Conawapa. 
This was something we were looking forward to.  Five years of 
work for skilled tradespeople was nothing to be sneezed at. When 
the province of Ontario cancelled this project we were 
devastated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At that time I was representing the carpenters union in the 
province of Manitoba.  We had 1,200 members who were anxiously 
waiting to build Conawapa. It was something we wanted to do. When 
it was cancelled these people literally did not know which way to 
turn. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That led us to investigate other ideas.  How would we put these 
people to work?  We commissioned a study on the idea of job 
creation through energy conservation.  We wanted to find out what 
kind of job opportunities there would be in harvesting units of 
energy from the existing system through demand side management 
techniques rather than building new generating stations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We were happy to find out that there were as many as seven times 
the number of jobs per $1 million invested, or per $1 invested, 
in the demand side management of our energy resources than there 
were in building new generating stations.  This came as a huge 
relief.  We could now advocate a green environment by being good 
environmental stewards without shooting ourselves in the foot. 
It would have been heresy not too many years ago for a carpenter 
to openly promote this demand side management rather than build 
new generating stations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is what led us to this conclusion.  For many years we have 
been pushing this idea.  We have been training our people in 
anticipation of this idea catching on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this motion I point to the federal government owning 50,000 
buildings.  In its literature it is actually 68,000 building that 
the federal government owns and operates.  It does have some 
measures under way.  Nobody is trying to say that the federal 
government is doing nothing in this regard.  There is the federal 
building initiative program.  Its goal is to try and conserve 
energy within publicly owned buildings. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of those 68,000 buildings the government owns and operates, the 
federal building initiative has only done about 100. With my 
motion, we are hoping to make the argument that we could do as 
many as a couple of thousand per year and put a whole industry 
back to work in this new and laudable concept of demand side 
management. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not believe that we are taking full advantage of this 
opportunity if we are only doing a couple of projects a year. The 
federal government's web page is almost a brag sheet about the 
federal building initiative.  The savings are unbelievable.

<A HREF="#LINKT100"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>One example I pulled off the web site shows that Public Works 
and Government Services Canada upgraded a 500,000 square foot 
building in Calgary.  I believe it was the Harry Hays building. 
It resulted in an energy saving of $300,000 per year.  That is 
for one building. We created a lot of jobs.  Obviously the 
manufacturing sector benefited as well because there was the 
installation of new lighting fixtures, HVAC systems and smart 
boilers, et cetera. And we saved $300,000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We spend over $800 million in energy costs per year to heat, 
light and cool all those 68,000 buildings. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the document “A Brighter Future: Job Creation and Energy 
Efficiency in Manitoba”, research shows that we can achieve an 
energy savings of as much as 40% by introducing many of the high 
tech systems that are currently available.  Many of the buildings 
the government owns and operates are old and outdated.  They were 
built in a time when energy was not an issue, when energy was 
cheap and plentiful. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remember the time when Ontario Hydro and Manitoba Hydro ran 
ads on TV advocating more use of energy.  They wanted us to do 
everything electrically, to turn on the lights.  We cannot do 
that any more. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is another upside to what I am trying to introduce here. 
First is the job creation aspect.  As carpenters, that was our 
first motivation and the reason we got into this.  The second is 
the cost saving for the owners of the public buildings of up to 
40% of that $800 million a year.  The third very good argument is 
that we could help to meet our commitments made at Kyoto and Rio 
de Janiero to reduce harmful greenhouse gas emissions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal building initiatives web page lists not only how 
much money it is saving by doing these buildings, it also lists 
how many millions of kilos of harmful greenhouse gas emissions it 
is saving per year.  Some of these buildings are belching out 
unbelievable amounts of pollution.  If we are going to be 
examples to private sector businesses in asking them to clean up 
their act and reduce harmful greenhouse gas emissions, surely we 
have to start with our own buildings.  Surely we can demonstrate 
to the private sector that not only is it a good idea and good 
environmental stewardship to reduce energy consumption and 
eliminate waste, but they can also save a fortune by doing it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is why I believe that the federal building initiative, the 
program which is already in place and which I am not critical of 
at all, should be expanded tenfold.  If 100 buildings have been 
done so far and there are 68,000 buildings to go, what are we 
waiting for? We could put a whole generation of tradespeople back 
to work.  We could finally get some young people coming into the 
skilled trades, which is a real problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the trade that I represent, the average age of a tradesman is 
48 years.  These guys are looking for a way out by the time they 
hit 50.  Their knees and backs are gone.  Young people are not 
choosing the skilled trades as a career option because the work 
is so spotty.  This project could be a decade long program to get 
our buildings up to world class standards. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Besides job creation, obvious cost savings and environmental 
stewardship, the fourth benefit is the research and development 
that goes into this new high tech field.  We could show the 
world.  We could be the centre of excellence for environmental 
stewardship in terms of living in a harsh northern winter climate 
and show that it is still possible not to be wasteful in our 
energy use.  We could export the engineering and research that we 
do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are already leaders in many aspects.  There is the window 
industry, for instance.  I do not think anybody in the world 
makes better windows than our own companies, such as Loewen 
windows in Manitoba. They export all over the world.  They are 
leaders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are other aspects of energy retrofitting. We embrace this 
concept but one caution I have is there is a real temptation when 
one gets involved in energy retrofitting to pick the low hanging 
fruit, the easy stuff. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1855"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT102"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT102"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1855
<A HREF="#LINKT103"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border=0 alt="+"></A>
<A HREF="#LINKT101"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>For instance, anybody can change the light fixtures to more 
energy efficient ballasts.  That is okay.  It is all very well 
and good and one might get a very quick payback on one's 
investment.  But when one goes to do the building envelope, the 
much more expensive things, insulation, windows and doors, the 
payback might take eight years or so.  Average the two together 
and there might be a three or four year payback on one's 
investment.  Most property owners will tolerate that. But if one 
picks the low hanging fruit and only does the easy stuff and does 
not do a comprehensive energy retrofit, it renders the other 
details less economical. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The real clinger here, the real thing I hope to excite people 
with is that everything I have talked about so far can be done at 
absolutely no cost to the taxpayer.  Free.  Revenue neutral.  Not 
a penny. Private sector investors are standing by ready, willing 
and able to finance all of these retrofits.  As many as we can 
throw at them, they are happy to underwrite, to pay for and to be 
paid back slowly out of the energy savings. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is called the ESCO industry, energy services contracting. 
Many private financial institutions are involved.  It is a very 
high tech field.  Some of the best engineering firms in the world 
are doing the energy audits first of all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All the federal government would have to do is to let us use its 
buildings to create jobs, reduce its operating costs and reduce 
harmful greenhouse gas emissions.  What are we waiting for? 
Instead of doing 100 of these projects over the five years that 
the federal building initiative has been in place, why are we not 
doing 10,000 of them?  And why are we not doing outreach to show 
those in the private sector how it can be done and that they 
should be doing it too? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The whole idea of reducing our greenhouse gas emissions has been 
viewed in a very negative light.  Here we can point to a very 
positive side of it and we can save a fortune. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The province of Manitoba spends $3.2 billion a year on energy. 
Every dollar that is not spent on energy can be spent elsewhere 
in the economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The whole concept of demand side management and energy retrofit 
is almost too good to be true.  It is such a win-win situation. 
Any unit of energy that we harvest from the existing system by 
demand side management measures is exactly the same as one 
produced in a generating station, except for a couple of 
important things.  For one thing it is available at one-third the 
cost.  One-third the cost.  The American research shows this.  It 
is on line immediately.  At the same instant one introduces 
demand side management measures in a building, the energy is on 
line immediately instead of waiting five to 10 years for a 
generating station to be built and to get on line.  No additional 
infrastructure is needed in terms of distribution.  And it 
creates seven times the number of jobs.  One would think that 
would be really smart. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Frankly the Americans are way ahead of us on this. The 
Bonneville hydro authority has precluded the need to build seven 
nuclear power plants just by its demand side management program. 
Seven nuclear power plants at $10 billion each.  That means it 
does not have to borrow that money on the open market.  It does 
not have to pollute the environment with seven more power plants, 
although it is arguable whether they pollute or not.  The hydro 
authority saw the sense in this and really embraced it 
wholeheartedly. The Tennessee Valley hydro authority has similar 
statistics. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not know why we are so slow on this. We live in a harsh 
winter climate where energy costs are a huge issue.  Why are we 
not showing them how it is done instead of the other way around? 
I believe this is possible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>People ask what the motivation is behind this.  Frankly I sound 
like a broken record.  I came to Ottawa in 1993 to pitch this at 
an energy efficiency conference at the minister's request.  I was 
given the energy innovator's award by the then minister of 
natural resources.  Everybody said that it was fabulous and 
great, that it was a public-private partnership. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One source of venture capital for this was union pension funds. 
We pulled together a pool of union pension funds dedicated to 
this project, $150 million of dedicated capital ready to go.  We 
said “We have H.H. Angus, one of the best engineering companies 
in the world to do the auditing.  We have the financiers in 
place.  Just let us use your buildings”.  Nothing.  Frankly, it 
did not really go very far.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Other financiers are in place and are underwriting the 100 
projects done by the FBI but at a much greater mark-up.  They 
want a much greater rate of return on their investment.  Pension 
fund investors are happy to have a slow, steady, guaranteed rate 
of return, which is what makes it such a good investment for 
them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The study we did called A Brighter Future is in its fourth 
printing now.  Groups as diverse as the James Bay Cree have been 
asking for copies of it because they have a vested interest in 
reducing the number of hydro projects given the impact they have 
on northern communities.  In Manitoba we are still dealing with 
the flooding of South Indian Lake. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Building a hydro project on a river is radical intervention in 
an ecosystem.  We cannot enter into that kind of project lightly. 
It is irresponsible not to do everything in our power to look 
elsewhere for our energy.  Building another generating station 
should only be a last resort.  Certainly we will build more 
generating stations someday, but until we harvest every unit of 
energy we can out of the existing system it would be crazy to 
borrow $10 billion to build another dam.  It is just 
irresponsible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are many measures in energy retrofitting.  Rather than 
getting into the complicated technical side of things, I would 
like people to think of their own homes.  We have known for years 
that an energy saving shower head that is worth about $15 can 
save $75 a year, but how many of us have actually gone down to 
Canadian Tire, paid the fifteen bucks and screwed the shower head 
on at home?  We are stupid if we do not.  We can save $75 a year 
for a $15 investment.  That is how painfully obvious the measures 
are.  The measures that need to be taken in buildings like the 
Wellington Building are that obvious to engineers. Why do people 
not do that? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now we have taken the last obstacle away.  What if one does not 
have the $15 to buy the shower head.  We can do it free of 
charge, at no cost to the government, zippo, free, gratis.  There 
would be hundreds of thousands of jobs with no charge to the 
taxpayer.  We could reduce greenhouse gas emissions and save 40% 
of the $800 million per year that we currently spend on energy to 
heat and light 68,000 federal government buildings.  What are we 
waiting for? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The whole industry is anxiously waiting to get started.  The 
carpenters union in partnership with contractors across the 
country are running courses on energy retrofit construction, new 
vapour barrier and insulation systems.  They are eagerly awaiting 
and anticipating this volume of work.  The sheet metal workers 
union is specializing in various HVAC systems, the heat 
exchangers, the balancing, et cetera.  Electricians are one of 
the groups that has offered to use some of its union pension 
funds because it will create jobs for its members.  It is an 
ethical investment and it is good work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is another advantage to having the work in demand side 
management measures rather than in the construction of new 
generating stations.  When a hydro dam is built all the jobs are 
concentrated in some isolated bush camp in the middle of nowhere. 
With demand side management measures jobs are spread evenly 
throughout every community in the country.  Everywhere there is a 
publicly owned building is where the jobs will be.  There may be 
30 jobs to renovate a post office or 30 jobs to renovate a 
building on a military base.  Those jobs will be more evenly 
distributed.  It would be a far more equitable type of project. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We could view it as a megaproject but it is spread over the 
country.  It would put an industry back to work. It would help us 
to embrace the idea of public-private partnerships in a very 
positive light. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let the industry pay for it.  It just wants to use the 
government buildings.  It wants to help the government meet its 
Kyoto targets and bring down greenhouse gas emissions.  Job 
creation for energy conservation is an idea whose time has come. 
It is long overdue.  I welcome the support of other members in 
this regard.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Carolyn Parrish (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Public Works and Government Services, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it 
is interesting to listen to talk on a motion with which the 
government and I concur.  It is an excellent motion.  We will be 
supporting it when it comes time to vote. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am pleased to speak to the motion brought forward by the 
member for Winnipeg Centre.  We appreciate the opportunity to 
speak about the government's commitment to energy efficiency.  We 
know we can do more.  We thank the member again for bringing it 
to everyone's attention. 
My comments today will focus on the government's federal 
buildings initiative and specifically on the role of Public Works 
and Government Services Canada in this initiative.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Energy efficiency makes sense not only for government but for 
all Canadian homeowners, drivers, businesses and industry. Energy 
efficiency is a winning strategy for reducing greenhouse gases, 
for promoting a competitive economy and for creating skills, 
sustainable jobs and expertise in high tech fields as was pointed 
out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government must show leadership on this issue.  The 
best way to do that is through action rather than words.  The 
Department of Public Works and Government Services is a common 
service agency providing a wide range of services to federal 
departments and other agencies.  The department's mandate 
provides the unique opportunity for helping client departments 
identify and implement best practices in the areas of 
procurement, fleet management, waste management, water 
conservation, land use management and energy efficiency. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a major property owner in Canada with about 350 office 
buildings and close to 2,000 lease contracts within Public Works, 
it is a unique position to promote and implement energy 
management initiatives such as the federal buildings initiative. 
If the other 16 departments under the Government of Canada, such 
as Health Canada, National Defence and Revenue Canada, are added 
we either own or lease 50,468 buildings.  We have downsized the 
government; maybe their statistics are a little older than mine. 
It is impressive to know that over 24 million metres square is 
under government control.  Also we have 22,793 vehicles which 
should be energy efficient as well.  The department has been an 
active player in the development of this initiative in concert 
with Natural Resources Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal buildings initiative helps federal departments and 
agencies reduce their energy consumption and greenhouse gas 
emissions by improving the energy efficiency of their buildings. 
This is achieved through partnerships with the private sector and 
at no upfront cost to the taxpayer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In these times of fiscal restraint it is fair to ask where the 
government is finding the money to invest in energy efficiency. 
The member opposite talked about trade unions and various other 
organizations which have gone into partnership to improve energy 
efficiency.  The answer is to get a willing third party, an 
energy service company to find the money for us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The company provides the capital, implements the project and 
assumes any risk associated with it.  Once the project begins to 
reduce energy consumption, the energy service company recoups its 
investment from the dollar savings.  After the company is repaid, 
which may take as little as two years, the savings then go to the 
taxpayers.  This innovative financing strategy effectively means 
that energy efficiency retrofits are paid for through the savings 
they generate.  At the end of the day everyone is a winner.  The 
federal government gets to upgrade its facilities with modern 
equipment and technologies at no new cost. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I must make a brief aside.  I have been married to an engineer 
for 30 years.  His idea of energy efficiency is the new shower 
head.  He has gone around the House and put a brick in the water 
tank of each toilet.  I asked what he was doing and he said it 
was a very technological advanced way of saving water. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government upgrades its facilities with a little 
more finesse, with modern equipment and technologies at no new 
cost.  Energy management companies generate new business and make 
a reasonable return on their investment.  Canada increases its 
global competitiveness by developing high tech expertise and a 
skilled workforce in this field.  Energy efficiency upgrades 
require a combination of new equipment and systems, technological 
expertise and labour.  That means more Canadians are being put to 
work, as the member opposite pointed out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Job creation is a priority of the government.  The growing 
demand for energy efficiency retrofits is helping energy service 
companies prosper and generate new jobs.  Federal buildings 
initiative projects in the federal sector alone have a potential 
to create some 20,000 person years of employment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to share some very impressive figures.  I think the 
House will be interested in them, not that is it jam packed. To 
date the Department of Public Works has signed 27 contracts 
representing about $32 million in energy investment by the 
private sector.  This generates over $5.5 million in annual 
energy savings, reducing CO2 emissions by 20,000 tonnes per year, 
5.25% from the 1995 levels, and creating in the process 640 jobs. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1910"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT104"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>By the year 2000 public works will have reduced energy 
consumption by approximately $12 million per year and have 
reduced CO2 levels by 14%.  This is an important element in the 
government's initial response to meeting the greenhouse gas 
commitments made in Kyoto last year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Through the federal buildings initiative Public Works and 
Government Services Canada alone will generate about $60 million 
of private sector investment and will create approximately 1,200 
jobs in the private sector. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the same time as the department of public works has been 
implementing federal building initiatives projects it has also 
proceeded with a unique project in a leased facility.  The Place 
Vincent Massey building, a complex which is leased by the 
government, underwent an impressive $1.4 million in energy 
upgrades which will achieve a potential $200,000 annually in 
energy cost savings.  As a result of this success, public works 
is now pursuing federal buildings initiative projects in all the 
leased buildings it manages.  This means even more savings and 
more job creation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am pleased to report to the hon. member for Winnipeg Centre 
that included in the 27 projects public works has already signed, 
four contracts for 12 buildings were awarded in the western 
region.  The member may also be interested to know that four of 
these buildings are located in Winnipeg.  Overall these contracts 
represent an investment of close to $4 million by the private 
sector, generating approximately $650,000 of energy savings and 
creating 73 jobs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Department of Public Works and Government Services is not 
alone.  Virtually every federal department that owns buildings 
has made a commitment to pursue this unique opportunity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition to launching its own projects, public works will 
help other departments implement the federal buildings initiative 
by undertaking project management on their behalf.  I think that 
is why the hon. minister we have now was put into his position. 
When we were first elected in 1993, he went through and slashed 
budgets.  Nobody could paint offices.  He was a real tough 
character.  He has been put in charge of this initiative.  With 
his broad expertise in energy management and wide range of 
property management services, public works is well suited to the 
task as is its minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is particularly exciting about the federal buildings 
initiative is that it can be easily replicated by other levels of 
governments and other sectors of the economy.  Public works has 
been working in partnership with other levels of government, 
federal, provincial, territorial and municipal.  Let us not 
forget that businesses, hospitals, schools and universities can 
all use the federal buildings initiative approach too, and many 
are.  In the end everyone benefits from the federal buildings 
initiative:  the government, the private sector, the taxpayer and 
our environment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I assure the member for Winnipeg Centre that the federal 
buildings initiative program is alive and well.  The government 
is committed to seeing that the program is implemented whenever 
and wherever it makes sense.  We welcome the hon. member's 
support and I encourage him to follow the federal buildings 
initiatives progress as we make our way through the full 
inventory of federal buildings.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. David Chatters (Athabasca, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, after 
listening to the two previous speakers I cannot for the life of 
me understand why every small business and homeowner in the 
country is not busy retrofitting their homes for energy 
efficiency. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  Motherhood and apple pie. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. David Chatters:</B>  Yes, the issue is motherhood and 
apple pie.  It is pretty difficult to say that it is wrong.  The 
idea has a lot of merit, but I have some concerns with the 
member's motion and the federal building initiative it is based 
on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I recognize and I applaud the hon. member who presented the 
motion on his demonstrated commitment to the issue and his 
efforts in working in energy efficient strategies for many years 
in his home province of Manitoba. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While I have some reservations regarding the simplicity of the 
motion and the specific program, the FBI the member endorses, I 
agree there certainly is a need in the country for his 
comprehensive energy efficiency strategy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The development of long term strategies is one of the 
government's demonstrated weaknesses.  One has to look for 
evidence only to its handling of the Kyoto conference last 
December, the issue of gasoline standards in Canada and certainly 
the issue of air quality standards in Canada.

<A HREF="#LINKT105"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Kyoto example is certainly one of the better examples. 
Canadians everywhere were imploring the government to make its 
position and strategy known prior to going to Kyoto and this 
information was still unavailable right up to the day the 
delegation left for the summit.  It was apparent that the 
government had no clear strategy going into the conference and 
was watching for other countries to lead. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now, a full year later, even after Rio, the government still has 
no concrete plans or strategy for the implementation of the 
commitments made at Kyoto.  Throughout the entire process the 
government presented a one-sided argument in an effort to sway 
public opinion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While it was widely agreed that the measures needed to be taken 
and some commitments made, Canadians were only given half the 
information and were not and have not been invited to participate 
in the process.  If this government is to develop a comprehensive 
energy efficiency strategy, as I believe it should, it must 
engage Canadians and open up the process so that Canadians get 
the full and honest picture of the benefits and costs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This leads me to my first concern with this motion.  The member 
for Winnipeg Centre endorses a retrofitting program called the 
federal building initiative.  Through this program federal 
departments may retrofit federal buildings for greater energy 
efficiency.  Departments pay the cost of the renovations out of 
the savings on energy bills over a negotiated pay-back period. 
At first glance this program seems ideal and it certainly does 
have merit.  It would lead one to say “What is holding us back? 
Why are we not going at this full bore?” 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, it is impossible to make a fair assessment when only 
half of the information is available and has been presented. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Despite my interest in energy efficiency and my role as the 
natural resources critic for the opposition caucus, I have been 
able to get only very limited information about this program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the program is successful and worthy of Canadian support, why 
is more information not being made available?  Too often the 
government aggressively promotes a program, only to ignore it 
after implementation or to provide only information that it deems 
to be supportive while it suppresses all other information. 
Programs fail to live up to expectations and are therefore kept 
from the public spotlight.  Canadians deserve more in the way of 
feedback and regular updates on the success or failures of 
programs that cost millions of taxpayers' dollars. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I began researching this program I asked for a cost 
breakdown of one or two examples of contracts that we might 
examine to assess it.  I was curious about the size of the profit 
margin that would be incentive enough for a private sector energy 
service company to enter into a contract in which it is not paid 
in full for up to eight years.  It was a simple enough request, 
but I have not yet received an adequate response. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also requested complete information on the specific 
retrofitting projects identified as the government's success 
stories on its natural resources web site which other members 
have referred to.  Three such examples were listed on the web 
page alone with the annual savings reaped by retrofitting each 
facility.  I was informed that a case study exists about one of 
the facilities, but I have yet to see that study in any detail. 
We were provided with only three pieces of information. The total 
annual savings were $880,000 on that particular project, the 
amount of the contract was $6.1 million and the pay-back period 
was 7.1 years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am hesitant to endorse this program until I have received more 
information about it.  However, gathering information has 
certainly proved to be an onerous task. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I therefore have to question how the public can fairly assess 
such a program when information is so difficult to obtain.  I can 
only assume that they will base their assessment on the 
relatively few facts provided by the government, thus making 
their judgment on partial information. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a prime example of the lack of government transparency 
that is to be avoided in the development and implementation of a 
comprehensive energy efficiency strategy.  The federal building 
initiative may be a raging success or it may be an abysmal flop 
for all we know from the information we seem to be able to get on 
it.  Either way there needs to be greater public accountability 
through detailed reports showing the progress of the program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also have some concerns with the tendering process espoused by 
the federal buildings initiative. 
Through this program federal departments are given significant 
freedom in choosing an energy service company to retrofit their 
buildings.  Unlike other government contracts, the awarding of a 
retrofit contract is not based on the lowest bid.  Departments 
must take a number of factors into account and may place emphasis 
where they see fit.  Energy service companies must be chosen from 
a qualified bidders list kept by Natural Resources Canada.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>These features of the tendering process blow the doors wide open 
to patronage, whereby contracts can and likely will be awarded to 
friends of the government.  To avoid or at least to minimize 
patronage it is necessary to open up the tendering process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That being said, I would like to express my general skepticism 
regarding motions and bills introduced by the members of the New 
Democratic Party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a young man I was searching for a home for my political 
ideology and I looked at the NDP philosophy.  It certainly 
appeals to many Canadians.  However, assessing any political 
ideology is like the retrofit program:  if we only get half the 
story it is pretty hard to make an intelligent and informed 
decision.  Certainly the NDP motion that we are dealing with 
today fits into that category.  Every Canadian wants to live in a 
free society with zero unemployment, a healthy environment with 
no poverty.  All Canadians share those ideals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, I fear that these ideals are in direct conflict with 
the realities of the day.  That is not to say that we should 
abandon those ideals, but we should be working toward the ideal 
while recognizing the reality. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada does not have a bottomless pit of money to finance 
government programs and initiatives.  All programs come at a cost 
to Canadians.  There are no free rides.  In many cases the cost 
may be worth it, but that does not mean the financial side of the 
program can be ignored. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion points to job creation and the development of 
high-tech expertise through an energy efficiency strategy.  It 
was my hope upon reading the motion that the member for Winnipeg 
Centre was talking about jobs created naturally in the private 
sector, not through substantial investment by the federal 
government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Contrary to my hope, in a report prepared by the member, to 
which he referred, “A Brighter Future:  Energy Efficiency and 
Jobs in Manitoba”, the member for Winnipeg Centre advocates 
federal funding in a number of areas, but particularly in 
training workers for the conservation industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion also calls for the development of high-tech 
expertise.  Again I hope that the member for Winnipeg Centre is 
talking about encouraging private sector investment in research 
and development.  However, if he is talking about government 
investment, it is very important that Canadians get a good return 
on their money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If high-tech expertise is to be developed through government 
investment, that expertise must not be patented and sold by the 
private sector with no return to the taxpayers of Canada.  I 
think the term is intellectual property. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Having expressed all of those reservations, this issue is 
motherhood and apple pie and certainly our caucus will be 
supporting the motion when it comes to a vote.  However, I would 
like some of the issues which I brought forward to be addressed. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK260"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pierre de Savoye (Portneuf, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the motion 
before us focuses more on the economic impact than the 
environmental impact of an energy efficiency strategy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>You may have noticed that the motion deals for the most part 
with the economic benefits associated with such a strategy. 
Basically, it suggests that an energy efficiency strategy would 
promote job creation while at the same time boosting export 
opportunities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In that sense, the motion put forward by the hon. member for 
Winnipeg Centre hits the mark. There are undeniable financial 
benefits to energy efficiency. In this respect, the experience 
of Quebec is a case in point. 
As the Quebec minister responsible for natural resources, Guy 
Chevrette, recently pointed out, Quebec has successfully 
developed a whole economic structure around energy efficiency. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1925"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT108"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT108"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1925

<A HREF="#LINKT107"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The latest available statistics date back to 1994 but 
nevertheless speak volumes. The commercial activities associated 
with the manufacturing, distribution and installation of 
energy-efficient products brought in nearly $2 billion for Quebec 
businesses alone. And these activities created approximately 
13,000 jobs for Quebeckers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are talking about a real industry here, a business that is 
not only booming on domestic markets but also very promising in 
terms of export potential. In fact, Quebec's new energy 
efficiency agency, about which I will say more in a moment, has 
taken a proactive approach to international relations. This 
openness to the rest of the world is designed to preserve and 
reinforce Quebec's expertise in this respect. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In short, the economic basis for Motion M-300 is absolutely 
sound. However, this motion fails to address the environmental 
impact, which is unfortunate and rather surprising. More than 
ever, energy efficiency appears to be an inescapable way of 
meeting international requirements in relation to climate change 
and the greenhouse effect. Natural Resources Canada has already 
started implementing an energy efficiency strategy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is well known that the resources now devoted to energy 
efficiency initiatives are modest.  Strategic tools are limited 
and Natural Resources Canada is focussing primarily on public 
awareness.  The following question therefore arises:  are 
existing initiatives well managed and are they having a real and 
positive impact on the environment? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this respect, the 1997 auditor general's report identified 
the areas in which Natural Resources Canada's implementation of 
its energy efficiency strategy was weak.  The auditor general 
pointed out that there is no clear link between federal energy 
efficiency initiatives, on the one hand, and Canada's 
environmental objectives, such as stabilizing green house gas 
emissions at 1990 levels, on the other. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Furthermore, the contribution of existing measures to the 
attainment of stabilization objectives is not being well 
measured.  The department's performance data do not allow this 
specific input to be measured.  Nor do they allow us to measure 
the overall success of existing energy efficiency initiatives. 
All this was pointed out by the auditor general in 1997. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Motion M-300 proposes that the government invest in a 
comprehensive energy efficiency strategy.  Logically, the motion 
implies that the Government of Canada should launch new 
initiatives.  Before doing so, however, the federal government 
should first ensure that its existing initiatives are having a 
positive impact, one that is measurable and verifiable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion before us today does not say which department or 
agency should implement the exhaustive strategy proposed. 
Caution would dictate better management of existing initiatives 
before Natural Resources Canada or the new energy efficiency 
office is given responsibility for implementing new initiatives 
in this area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a Bloc Quebecois member, I am particularly concerned about 
the question of jurisdiction.  Energy is a provincial 
responsibility.  This obviously includes energy efficiency. 
Furthermore, Quebec is in the forefront when it comes to energy 
efficiency. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Despite an increase in our population and in our economic 
activities, Quebeckers use the same amount of energy they did 20 
years ago.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a testimony to the considerable efforts made by Quebec 
with respect to energy efficiency.  Quebec is leading the way in 
Canada with its energy efficiency legislation, particularly as 
it applies to new buildings. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1997, the Government of Quebec created the Agence de 
l'efficacité énergétique.  This agency has the backing of all 
Quebeckers.  The legislation that created it was passed 
unanimously in the National Assembly.  The agency will be the 
focal point for anything having to do with energy efficiency in 
Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Agency president Michel Dallaire shared his vision for the new 
agency last May.  I quote: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Between now and the year 2001, the Agence de l'efficacité 
énergétique wishes to gain recognition as the key Quebec source 
of reference for energy efficiency and an unbiased promoter of 
its economic and environmental advantages. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of this agency's mandates is to support R&D in energy 
efficiency technologies.  This is, in fact, one of the main 
concerns in the motion by our colleague for Winnipeg Centre. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of course, the Government of Canada regulates interprovincial 
commerce involving energy-consuming machinery and equipment. 
Through its spending powers, the federal government also devotes 
considerable resources to the promotion of energy efficiency, 
particularly in the areas of R&D and transportation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Motion M-300 might be interpreted as being intended to encourage 
the Government of Canada to broaden its jurisdiction over energy 
efficiency. The Bloc Quebecois certainly has no intention of 
helping the federal government to broaden its jurisdiction.  The 
federal government ought not to be needlessly duplicating 
provincial efforts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Any major federal initiative in the area of energy efficiency 
ought to start off by gaining the support of the provinces.  The 
Bloc Quebecois wishes to ensure that increased federal resources 
for energy efficiency will be used to support provincial 
objectives and strategies in this area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the federal government were to put new programs into place in 
this field, Quebec and the other provinces ought to be able to 
opt out of these programs with full compensation. 
In Quebec, the Agence de l'efficacité énergétique would be 
responsible for managing the amounts in question, according to 
its own priorities and strategy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, the economic concerns underlying Motion M-300 are 
entirely laudable.  Investing in energy efficiency can lead to 
the creation of thousands of jobs and open up new markets for 
businesses in Canada and in Quebec.  The Bloc Quebecois is not 
questioning this logic.  However, economic logic should not be 
the sole criterion by which this motion is judged. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The primary raison d'etre for an energy efficiency strategy is 
to improve our environmental performance.  Unfortunately, the 
Government of Canada's track record in this regard is 
disappointing.  Existing initiatives could be much better 
managed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is why we are reluctant to support the motion. 
Before investing more money, the government must ensure that 
existing programs are well run. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Furthermore, it is primarily for jurisdictional reasons that the 
Bloc Quebecois has doubts about the content of this motion. 
Quebec has its own agency for energy efficiency issues, which 
will be responsible for all matters having to do with energy 
efficiency in Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We wanted to move an amendment to Motion M-300 that would have 
reflected provincial jurisdictions.  Unfortunately, under the 
Standing Orders, such an amendment would have gone beyond the 
scope of the present motion and was therefore not allowed, 
leaving us no choice but to oppose the motion before us.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to talk about the primary origin of why this particular 
debate is becoming very topical. It comes down to the fact that 
just over a year ago the industrialized world and emerging 
nations attended a conference in Kyoto to make a tangible 
approach to cut down carbon dioxide emissions and fight the 
serious challenge of climate change. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Over the last 40 to 60 years the use of fossil fuels which we 
use to heat our homes and drive our automobiles has proliferated 
the amount of greenhouse gases within our environment.  We are 
now seeing a number of extreme weather events. Last year the ice 
storm affected my riding of Fundy—Royal.  It affected our 
cousins in the United States and many of our cousins in the 
province of Quebec.  These severe weather conditions are products 
of what can happen with the continuance of global warming. It is 
prudent for us to look at this issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government needs to engage in more energy efficiency. Canada 
has an export driven economy, an economy that relies on our 
natural resources and an economy that is industrially based.  The 
industrialized world said just over a year ago that it would be 
investing in energy efficiency initiatives and research and 
development on renewable sources of energy in order to address 
the challenge of climate change. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>President Clinton and Vice-President Al Gore touched on the fact 
that the Americans would be spending over $7 billion on energy 
efficiency initiatives. This issue is just as much a trade issue 
from the Canadian perspective as it is an environmental issue. 
One thing we do know is that when the Americans want to engage in 
a particular topic they usually do it quite well. Given that the 
Americans will be spending over $7 billion on energy efficiency 
and they can start spending that money before the senate or the 
congress actually ratifies the Kyoto protocol, it is a myth that 
we should wait until it is ratified. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Once the Americans start spending some cash on energy efficiency 
is when we have to begin. If our American cousins start running 
their industries in a more energy efficient and cost competitive 
manner, it would have some very negative implications on our 
country's competitiveness, on our ability to trade and on the 
ability of our industries to compete on a cost perspective with 
our American cousins. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government speaks quite often about the need to reward early 
action in terms of climate change.  Canadians would be very happy 
even with some action in terms of actually pushing to ensure that 
we follow the same initiatives as our trading partners in the EU 
and the United States. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We do not necessarily see this as an issue that has really 
caught on with respect to the public, even though the science is 
definitely very clear.  I say that with a little jest because the 
current government, as we were reviewing the Canadian 
Environmental Protection Act, built an environmental coalition 
with the Reform Party.  The Reform Party still disputes whether 
the science on climate change is real.  That party probably 
would, on a different day if it thought it was advantageous, 
argue that cigarette smoking was actually healthy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1987 a conference was held in Montreal, known as the Montreal 
protocol.  The Canadian government was the principal government 
in the world and led the world community in making firm 
commitments to the reduction of ozone depleting gases. 
That said, ozone depleting gases became something that was in the 
forefront.  The public mindset was that ozone depleting gases 
were a bad thing for our environment. The government has yet to 
make that kind of initiative in terms of getting this into the 
public domain in terms of the need to fight climate change and 
reduce gas emissions.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I thank hon. members for the opportunity to speak here this 
evening.  The Progressive Conservative Party will be supporting 
this motion by the member for Winnipeg Centre. 
<P><A NAME="LINK262"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gerry Byrne (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Natural Resources, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am delighted to rise 
to address the House on the motion put forward by the hon. member 
for Winnipeg Centre.  I want to thank the hon. member for 
bringing this matter before the House and commend him for his 
interest in energy efficiency. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a very important issue for all Canadians, for our 
economy, for our environment and indeed for our quality of life 
here in Canada.  It deserves the careful attention of this House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Canada and indeed around the world there is a growing 
awareness that we need to use energy more efficiently.  The 
combustion, the use of fossil fuels like coal, oil and natural 
gas produce greenhouse gas emissions that are contributing to 
climate change and to other environmental problems.  Unless 
action is taken now, future generations will be left with an 
unmanageable environmental and economic burden. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am pleased to say that Canada is a recognized world leader in 
energy efficiency.  Between 1990 and 1996, a period during which 
our economy and population grew significantly, efficiency gains 
by Canadians resulted in annual energy cost savings that reached 
$4 billion for the year 1996. Secondary energy use was 3.2% lower 
than it would have been without improvements in energy intensity. 
Of course that means carbon dioxide emissions were also lower 
than would otherwise have been the case. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In his motion the hon. member calls for the government to invest 
in a comprehensive energy efficiency strategy that will create 
jobs, lead to the development and export of innovative 
technologies and demonstrate federal leadership. I am here to 
inform the House that such a strategy is already in place and is 
having a clear and positive impact on Canada's economy and on the 
environment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Natural Resources is a champion of energy 
efficiency in the government and across the Canadian economy.  He 
has demonstrated this most recently by establishing a dynamic new 
organization, the office of energy efficiency, which is mandated 
to strengthen his department's leadership efforts in this 
particular area. This new organization is an important part of 
the government's initial response to meeting the greenhouse gas 
commitments made at Kyoto last December. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The office of energy efficiency is now delivering 18 programs 
designed to move the market toward increased energy efficiency, 
including three new programs launched this past April with a 
funding commitment of $48 million over three years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some of these programs provide Canadian consumers and industries 
with the information they need to become more energy efficient. 
Others regulate minimum energy performance standards for certain 
types of energy-using equipment or show leadership through 
action. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The office of energy efficiency also delivers a financial 
incentive program to improve the energy performance of commercial 
buildings. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But market transformation, the changing of attitudes and the 
removal of market barriers is only one side of the coin.  It is 
also critical that Canada develop technologies, processes and 
systems that will enable us to use less energy and produce fewer 
greenhouse gas emissions while maintaining our economic 
competitiveness in a changing world. Toward this end the energy 
technology branch of Natural Resources Canada delivers a wide 
range of programs to support the research, development and 
application of innovative energy efficiency technologies and 
processes in all sectors of the economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Every project undertaken by the branch is done in partnership 
with others in industry or the academic community so that 
taxpayers' dollars are being used to foster investments in energy 
efficiency. This is an excellent example of how federal spending 
in strategic areas can also provide value added benefits to 
society.

While the debate has been mixed in the House among those who 
disagree with the fact that we should be spending any time or 
energy on energy efficiency versus those who would suggest that 
we should spend more, Natural Resources Canada is providing a 
healthy balance in providing market forces and market driven 
activities which will lead to successful, innovative programs and 
results.

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>EMPLOYMENT INSURANCE 
</H4><P align=left>

<P><A NAME="LINK265"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvon Godin (Acadie—Bathurst, NDP):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have already 
asked a question in the House on this issue concerning women in 
my region. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They have crewed for their husbands for the past 8 years and 
have always qualified for employment insurance. In recent weeks, 
the Department of Human Resources Development has refused 
employment insurance benefits to 40 of these women because of 
the arm's length provisions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is cause for concern about the way the Department of Human 
Resources Development interprets the arm's length provisions 
when it comes to people working for a family member. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I said, these women have fished for their husbands for eight 
years.  They got up at 4 in the morning, and put in their  day 
of fishing, for 8 years. Suddenly the government decided to look 
into the situation and said “This is a matter of arm's length”. 
It was the same last year, and the year before that.  Then they 
ask them to repay $15,000 or $20,000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even today I asked a question in the House, during Oral Question 
Period.  The government keeps giving us the same answer, that 
78% of Canadian workers qualify for employment insurance. 
In the House they say things that are not true. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not true for the simple reason that only 38% of people 
paying into employment insurance qualify for it.  That is 
unfair.  That is why when I asked my question I had asked 
whether the government had something against women.  Is this now 
discrimination against women? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They not only checked women married to fishermen, but the 
daughters of fishermen in certain cases.  They did not check 
boys, sons working for their fathers.  Why do it for a daughter 
working for her father?  Why only the daughter or the mother? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This does not only occur in New Brunswick.  In the Magdalen 
Islands, a lot of women work with their husbands.  I find it 
really discriminatory to take it out on women the way they did. 
Even the investigators were saying it is a matter of time. Very 
soon, not one woman working for her husband now will get 
employment insurance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Fishing is essentially a family business.  Is the department 
telling fishermen they do not have the right to hire their 
wives?

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I find the way the government is going after these people 
completely intolerable.  They get up at 4 a.m. and head out 
fishing.  They stay out until 2, 3 or 4 p.m., and fishing is not 
easy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is one investigator who told a woman that she had not been 
out fishing on the morning in question, but never went to talk 
with her at the time.  How could he know whether it was a woman 
or a man under all that fishing gear?  How can they base a 
decision on someone telephoning them to say that the woman had 
not been out fishing, or whatever, without any proof? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government should conduct another investigation and allow 
these women to collect EI.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gerry Byrne (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Natural Resources, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the hon. member has 
raised an important question.  He has basically made the 
allegation that the Department of Human Resources Development 
Canada is discriminating against women, specifically in the 
choices it makes during the evaluation of eligibility for 
employment insurance benefits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The people involved in the member's concerns are a group of 
women who participated in the fishing industry in various forms. 
They basically came to the hon. member with what I would call a 
serious complaint.  They felt that they were not receiving due 
process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It may be worth pointing out that the people in question 
received what appears to be due process in that the Department of 
Human Resources Development Canada received complaints from 
members of the community in which the hon. member is actually a 
resident himself.  When there is an allegation that a person may 
not be fulfilling the requirements under the arm's length 
provisions of the employment insurance eligibility criteria, the 
department has a responsibility to review it.  It is quite often 
referred to Revenue Canada for investigation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Departmental notes show that under these circumstances the 
evidence did not indicate that there was full compliance with the 
requirements for insurable earnings.  Again, these allegations of 
abuse came from the community members themselves.  They were not 
generated by departmental officials per se, but in many instances 
came from the community.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Christiane Gagnon (Québec, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have only 
four minutes in which to speak about the aberrations of the 
employment insurance fund, in particular the aberrant responses 
of the Minister of Human Resources Development.  That is far 
from enough. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last October 20, I asked him how he was going to improve the 
program.  I also asked whether he was going to allow the 
Minister of Finance to dip into the employment insurance fund. 
I am sure he had given some thought to the response he gave us, 
because the Minister of Human Resources Development is a great 
thinker, such a thinker that he does not meet our expectations. 
He does not act.  I am certain that his inaction is evidence of 
his refusal to budge on the issue of the employment insurance 
fund surplus. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>His reply to me was that this new “employment insurance lite” 
met the needs of the unemployed.  He also told me that those who 
were not covered are those for whom the program was not 
intended, people who have not worked and therefore have not 
contributed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>According to Statistics Canada, 38% of the unemployed received 
employment insurance in 1997.  On the other hand, the Minister 
of Human Resources Development's magic figure is 78%, that 78% 
of those who have lost their jobs are eligible now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Looking at the table of employment insurance coverage, we can 
see that some people are excluded.  One hundred thousand are 
excluded because they left their jobs without valid grounds. 
The only reason that is accepted is sexual harassment, and even 
that has to be proved. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A total of 142,000 people are excluded because they do not meet 
the eligibility requirements and another 35,000 have exhausted 
their benefits.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know that many people are disqualified because of the tougher 
criteria. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So, all the while, there is $20 billion building up in the EI 
fund.  The government is quite happy to dip into this fund but, 
at the same time, it wants to give the rich greater tax breaks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we are asking is that the system be improved.  The Minister 
of Human Resources Development has been boasting about the 
millions of dollars he is putting into two programs.  He keeps 
telling us how wonderful the transitional jobs fund and the 
youth employment strategy are. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He has invested only $300 million over three years in the 
transitional jobs fund and another $150 million over three 
years, compared to the billions that are being taken from the 
employment insurance fund.  It is shameful.  That is what the 
great generosity of the Minister of Finance boils down to. We 
know very well there is a flow between the consolidated fund and 
the employment insurance fund. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I suggest to the Minister of Human Resources Development that he 
step down from his limousine and visit the ridings that are 
affected by employment insurance.  He will discover the welcome 
is not so warm and his answers to our questions are 
insignificant and insipid. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He is also telling us the Bloc Quebecois wants people to be 
unemployed. 
When we were defending economic issues in order to keep jobs in 
the Quebec City area, such as Quebec 2010, the Quebec-Nova Scotia 
gas pipeline and the cruise ship casinos, did we hear from this 
minister? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We did it to protect jobs in the region, not to make people 
unemployed, as the minister says in his senseless answers.  I 
could provide a few other examples, such as the shipping policy, 
MIL Davie, where the government showed up too late.  I could 
have used four minutes more.

<P><A NAME="LINK269"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gerry Byrne (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Natural Resources, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I think if we had 40 
more minutes there probably would not be too many more new ideas 
coming forward from the Bloc.  Members of the Bloc Quebecois have 
repeatedly tried to mix and match figures to suit their 
particular purposes when it comes to discussing this particular 
issue.  They have not wanted to look at the true facts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois fails to mention that the recent analysis on 
EI coverage clearly concludes that the EI program is indeed 
meeting its key objective of providing temporary income support 
between jobs to workers in Canada.  It concludes that about 78% 
of the unemployed who lost their jobs or quit with just cause 
were indeed eligible in 1997; not 43% or 42% as alleged by 
members opposite, but indeed 78%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The employment insurance system is a major tool to help 
unemployed Canadians, but it is just that.  It is a tool. 
Contrary to what the Bloc and the opposition insists, employment 
insurance is not a panacea and is not for all unemployed 
Canadians who are not automatically covered.  For example, people 
who are not entitled to EI are people who have never worked, 
people who have quit their job to go back to school, or people 
who are self-employed and do not pay EI premiums. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What the Bloc has consistently failed to mention is that in 
addition to the significant measures under the EI program to help 
put Canadians back to work who are indeed eligible for this 
particular insurance, the Government of Canada is also providing 
additional benefits and support through the youth employment 
strategy, through the Canadian opportunities strategy, through 
the transitional jobs fund, through the post-TAGS program in many 
areas of Atlantic Canada and the Gaspé of Quebec, and indeed 
active employment measures through the Part II funds of the 
Employment Insurance Act, as well as the new hires program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What members have failed to mention is that we are putting $1.1 
billion in employment insurance premiums back in—

<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The APEC issue is about the constitutional rights of Canadians; 
the right to speak out against injustice, the right not to be 
arrested for only political purposes, and the right to fair 
process before a tribunal.  These things have all been suspended 
by the government.  Now the fix appears to be in and the 
commission has been adjourned to November 16.  We do not know 
where this is going to go.  We need a judicial inquiry to clean 
up this mess.  What will the government do to restore the 
constitutional rights of Canadians that it has tossed aside?

<A HREF="#LINKT114"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Most Canadians are very familiar with the ongoing saga of the 
APEC inquiry.  The inquiry has been a sham since the outset, and 
today we know that the inquiry is in complete disrepute. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Reform is asking for an independent judicial inquiry and 
Canadians agree.  The only group that disagrees are the Liberals 
and perhaps they are too afraid of what might be uncovered at 
such an inquiry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The students who protested at the Pacific Rim summit of APEC 
leaders had every right under the charter of rights to do so. 
This was the premise of my question to the Deputy Prime Minister. 
The constitutional right of Canadians was suspended so the Prime 
Minister would not be embarrassed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>No place in the charter of rights and freedoms does it state 
that the rights of the prime minister supersede the rights of 
ordinary citizens.  In fact the charter is mainly there to 
restrain governments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Deputy Prime Minister in his response to me outlined that I 
should have praised the Prime Minister for his part in 
establishing the charter of rights and freedoms.  If the Deputy 
Prime Minister is so proud of the charter, perhaps he might want 
to go the next step and actually honour it, live by it, not just 
when it is convenient. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Section 2(b) of the charter speaks of freedom of expression.  It 
guarantees that everyone has the right to express thoughts orally 
or through writing or through pictures.  If the government 
restricts these thoughts it is trenching upon the guarantee. Many 
students had their banners torn down because the content was not 
in support of Suharto. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Section 2(c) of the charter speaks of freedom of assembly.  The 
rights of an accused cannot be restricted on a speculative 
concern of danger.  With the fear of something going wrong the 
RCMP used clean-up tactics the day before the motorcade event. 
This type of practice is commonplace in some other APEC countries 
but should not happen in Canada according to the law but 
apparently not Liberal law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Section 9 of the charter says everyone has the right not to be 
arbitrarily detained or imprisoned.  Law student Craig Jones was 
tackled, arrested and imprisoned for holding up a sign that said 
“free speech, democracy and human rights”.  It almost seems 
that every section of the charter was overridden to save the 
Prime Minister from embarrassment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the RCMP went in to deal with these protesters the charter 
of rights was tossed out the window.  Whether or not the Prime 
Minister gave the directive is a question Canadians hope will be 
answered in an independent judicial inquiry.  However, the Prime 
Minister has always supported the action taken by the RCMP and 
because of this support has told Canadians that he is above the 
law and the charter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me remind the government member who will be answering on 
behalf of the government that Canadians are interested in the 
truth.  They want to know that the charter of rights works for 
them, not against them.  Canadians want to know that they are 
able to speak their mind on any political issue without suffering 
punishment.  If the government is so proud of the charter then it 
should prove to the House that it works and prove that the 
students in Vancouver had the charter on their side. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The question remains:  What will the government do to restore 
the constitutional rights of Canadians that it has tossed aside? 
<P><A NAME="LINK272"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gerry Byrne (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Natural Resources, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the charter also 
protects parliament and the operations of parliament.  Quite 
frankly the public complaints commission was enacted and brought 
into being by an act of parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The allegations that are constantly being brought forward by 
this member and members of his party do not reflect the fact that 
a specific complaint was lodged against a specific police force. 
There is an act of parliament which governs, enshrines and 
protects the laws of Canada.  It has been brought into force to 
review the particular complaint in that situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are asking, and I am quite confident we have the backing of 
all Canadians, to let the commission do its work.  That is a very 
simple request.  It is within the scope and the purview of 
parliament.  It has been enacted by parliament.  It operates at 
arm's length from the government.  We have no active role.  That 
is all we are asking for, to answer to the specific complaints 
and the specific allegations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The posturing, the rhetoric and the ill conceived political 
grandstanding that have been constantly the trademark of the 
particular party across the way cannot interfere with the due 
process that must proceed and should proceed.  The process was 
formulated by parliament in a non-partisan way.  It was voted 
upon and enacted by parliament and should be outside the purview 
of parliament.  It should proceed on its own merit and in its own 
way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I simply ask for due process and justice to let the matter 
proceed.
