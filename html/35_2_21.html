	<B>Hon. David Anderson (Minister of Transport, Lib.)</B> moved 
that Bill C-14, an act to continue the National Transportation 
Agency as the Canadian Transportation Agency, to consolidate and 
revise the National Transportation Act, 1987 and the Railway Act 
and to  amend other acts as a consequence, be read the third time 
and passed.
<P>
	He said: Mr. Speaker, I rise today at third reading of Bill C-14, 
the proposed Canada Transportation Act. This is an important bill. 
It introduces new framework legislation that touches every 
transportation mode. It represents the culmination of several years 
of effort on the part of the Department of Transport.
<P>
	It has been at times, as all hon. members know well, a 
controversial bill. One of the first tasks that I set myself this year as 
the newly appointed Minister of Transport was to review the 
proposed legislation and assess for myself whether or not an 
appropriate balance had been achieved between the varied interests 
that are affected by the elements of the bill.
<P>
	After careful consideration and an analysis of the bill, I have 
concluded that it is a balanced piece of work. It clearly reflects the 
hours of consultation and careful analysis that have been invested 
in it over the past few years.
<P>
	On that basis, I am very pleased to move this bill forward today. 
It is an act which will truly bring the Canadian transportation 
industry into the 21st century.

	I think it is also important to set this bill in a broader context. It 
really lies within the scope of our government's policy strategy, 
which is to streamline and modernize our transportation industry.
<P>
	Given the importance of transportation in the Canadian economy 
and for Canada's competitiveness on the world markets, this bill 
will enhance the nature of trade, viability and competitiveness of 
transportation.
<P>
<B>(1010)</B>
<P>
	In drafting this bill, the government took into consideration 
reports from independent commissions, previous work of the 
Standing Committee on Transport and the report produced by a 
task force on marketing headed by the hon. member for 
Kenora-Rainy River, whom I wish to thank for his great work.
<P>
	To develop Bill C-14, the government asked itself what those 
concerned could and should do on the market, which issues would 
better be left in the hands of the regulatory body and which should 
be debated by elected representatives.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1210"> 1210 </A></B>
<P>
	The opinions weighed as part of this process were many and 
varied. Finally, the government decided on what it felt should be 
a new balance, a balance between regulatory protection and trade 
negotiation as well as between supervising an agency and giving 
transportation companies more freedom in managing their own 
business.
<P>
	Over the summer, the government heard from many 
stakeholders, who were concerned about certain aspects of the bill. 
Recognizing that any legislative enactment can always be 
improved on, it identified several potential changes.
<P>
	Then, the Standing Committee on Transport carried out an 
exhaustive review of the bill. It also heard evidence from many 
stakeholders at this stage. Nearly 100 testimonies were submitted, 
and I understand that an even large number of briefs were received. 
All those who took the time and made an effort to take part in this 
complex process deserve our thanks.
<P>
	I would like to emphasize the huge contribution made by the 
members of the committee and many other members who also 
participated in the bill's consideration during 55 hours of direct 
evidence.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	As evidence of this effort, over 80 amendments to Bill C-14 were 
made. Some were technical changes. Others were complex and in 
some instances they reflected differing and difficult choices among 
competing stakeholders' points of view. However, in all cases, 
these amendments reflected the careful thought and deliberation 
that members brought to the legislative process.
<P>
	As this effort indicates, it is an important bill. It updates or 
removes economic regulation of transportation modes. For 
example, alternative means of transportation have made additional 
regulation of northern air services unnecessary.
<P>
	We are also modifying the degree of regulatory oversight on 
northern marine services and regulation of commodity pipelines 
has been transferred to the National Energy Board.
<P>
	Turning to the rail sector, I must emphasize that enhancing the 
viability of the rail industry is a key objective of the legislation. It 
will set in motion the steps necessary to ensure an effective and 
viable rail system in this country.
<P>
	The rail elements of the legislative package complement the 
strategy of commercializing the CN but they are far broader than 
that single initiative. They are about enhancing the long term 
viability of the whole Canadian rail industry. It is important to note 
that this bill will affect the operations of approximately 31 railways 
currently operating in Canada.
<P>
	When the government took office two and half years ago, the 
two national railways were suffering the effects of a number of 
structural problems: low labour productivity, under capitalization, 
excess trackage, to name a few. This had occurred despite 
considerable work by both railways to reduce costs by various belt 
tightening measures. Despite being hampered by onerous 
regulations, both railways have managed to rationalize, reorganize 
and downsize since 1993.
<P>
	Outmoded employment security provisions were changed by an 
arbitration decision rendered last June. Some provincial 
legislatures have helped out, like my home province of British 
Columbia, among others. British Columbia recently passed 
legislation which significantly reduced provincial taxation on 
railways. Ontario has eliminated its successor rights provisions 
which applied to the sale of former federal track. I applaud those 
initiatives.
<P>
<B>(1015)</B>
<P>
	The federal government decided that it also had to act decisively 
to put the railways on a more secure financial footing. 
Commercialization of CN and more important, regulatory reform 
are directed to this goal. We are moving on this to ensure that we 
have a viable coast to coast system. In a country reliant on the 
export of resource materials, a healthy rail sector, the principal 
carrier of bulk commodities, is an extremely important key to our 
trading future. A healthy rail industry best serves all stakeholders, 
not just the railways themselves.
<P>
	The current system is overbuilt. CN and CP cost cutting efforts 
have been stifled by the regulatory hurdles that they must jump 
over to tailor rail line networks to their core markets. At the same 
time, there have been few incentives in the existing system to 
market little used lines to the newer short line railways.
<P>
	Railways must reduce trackage if they are to regain their true 
financial health. Eighty-four per cent of CN and CP traffic travels 
on one-third of their networks. It is estimated that some 50 per cent 
of current CN and CP track is surplus to the main carrier needs as 
they move to serve their core markets.
<P>
	The traffic density of the Canadian rail network is presently 
much less than that of the top seven United States railroads. This 
means that by moving to similar densities in the range of the United 
States companies, our major carriers could generate significant 
savings.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	One of the key objectives of this bill to put in place measures to 
streamline the current regulatory process in relation to the sale, 
lease or abandonment of lesser used lines. An equally important 
objective will be the incentive effect it will have on the legislation 
to establish shortline railways at a lesser cost on many of these 
lines.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1211"> 1211 </A></B>
<P>
	The dramatic increase in the number of shortline railways in 
the U.S. is one of the major economic achievements of the 1980s. 
Nothing stops this scenario from being repeated in several regions 
of Canada, once those elements of the railway transportation 
legislative framework that did not foster the creation of shortline 
railways have been removed.
<P>
	These past 10 months, the concerns raised by shippers and by our 
two main railway companies have been at the centre of the debates 
on the transportation bill.
<P>
	The bill before us today is the product of the contributions made 
by various stakeholders-officials, interested parties, my colleague 
the former Minister of Transport, and more recently, the members 
of the standing committee-toward striking the right balance 
between their respective interests.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Have they succeeded? This is a question I have asked myself in 
reviewing this very complex legislative initiative in the two months 
since I became minister.
<P>
	First and foremost, Bill C-14 preserves all the key shipper rights 
won through the National Transportation Act, 1987. These rights 
are unique to the rail mode and are more extensive than the rights 
available to shippers in other jurisdictions, particularly in the 
United States.
<P>
	To illustrate, the bill keeps regulated rates for captive shippers 
and adapts them for short line railways. The bill keeps the statutory 
right of a shipper to final offer arbitration, shortening the process at 
the shipper's request and extending it to cover rail passengers and 
commuter service. This bill keeps the provision for confidential 
contracts between a railway and a shipper.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The decrease in railway prices-nearly 30 per cent since these 
rates were introduced in 1987-show how much shippers have 
benefited.
<P>
<B>(1020)</B>
<P>
	In addition, the bill preserves the traditional obligation of 
carriers to provide an adequate level of service, or what is 
commonly referred to as mass transit conveyance obligation, 
specifying the duties to be fulfilled by a railway in terms of traffic 
accommodation.
<P>
	If a complaint is filed, the agency can always order the railway to 
take corrective measures. No other mode of transportation has this 
kind of obligations.
<P>
	The bill also preserves the statutory right of a federal railway to 
operate on tracks other than federal tracks. This right enhances 
even more the competitive access of shippers.
<P>
	Still, in spite of all these measures, shippers have asked the 
government to make more changes to the bill.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	It is well known that shippers wanted section 27(2) deleted, 
whereby the agency would take into account whether a 
complainant would suffer substantial commercial harm in deciding 
whether a regulated remedy was warranted. Because many shippers 
objected to this provision, the government advanced amendments 
which replaced the term ``significant prejudice'' which was 
formerly used with the term ``substantial commercial harm''. Other 
amendments clarify the intent and application of the new 
terminology. These were two main concerns of the shippers.
<P>
	Shippers also wanted section 34(1) deleted. This section 
stipulated that any party to a dispute, which would include 
railways, must pay the costs if the complaint or behaviour during 
the conduct of the proceedings was found by the agency to be 
frivolous or vexatious. Again amendments were made to address 
the shippers' concerns.
<P>
	Section 27(2) was rewritten and clarified by government 
members of the committee and was subsequently adopted 
unanimously by the standing committee.
<P>
	Section 34(1) was dropped.
<P>
	Shippers also wanted section 113, which is now section 112 of 
Bill C-14, to be deleted whereby the agency would be required to 
set rail rates and conditions that are commercially fair and 
reasonable. I find it very hard to accept any argument that a 
regulated result should not be commercially fair and reasonable. 
This section however was subsequently clarified to specify that the 
result must be commercially fair and reasonable to all parties.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Initially, some shippers also wanted to extend to provincial 
railways the compulsory and mandatory running rights. We have 
concluded that this was both problematical and unnecessary, and 
could hinder the development of shortline railways.
<P>
	I am convinced that this long process has provided an 
opportunity to review carefully all shippers' concerns and that 
action was taken regarding several of these concerns. I think that 
the outcome will be profitable to shippers as well as railways.
<P>
	We must bear in mind some of the principles underlying the bill. 
Regulation should be a last resort, since solutions that are freely 
and mutually agreed upon are the best. A balance must be struck 
between sometimes incompatible concerns.
<P>
	Railway companies have one main goal: viability, a goal which 
is also in the best interest of shippers and-I must say-in the best 
interest of Canadians as well.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1212"> 1212 </A></B>
<P>
	Our common goal is to have a viable railway system, consisting 
of main carriers and shortlines, which will ensure that railway 
service will continue to connect as many communities as possible 
across the country.
<P>
<B>(1025 )</B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	To sum up, the objectives for rail which the bill meets 
successfully are: to promote the long term viability of railways; to 
foster the creation of short lines; to preserve key shipper rights; to 
preserve rail service to communities to the extent possible; and to 
reduce the regulatory burden on railways. It has been an enormous 
undertaking.
<P>
	In easing the regulatory burden that had been placed on rail in 
the past, over 1,000 pages in various statutes have been reduced to 
just 100. In doing so the bill lifts regulatory intrusions into the 
railways' day to day business affairs. Most important, the bill 
streamlines the rail line rationalization process. This is the most 
effective legislative means of bolstering the railway's efforts to cut 
costs.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	This way, if a buyer comes along, a railway can sell one of its 
lines without delay to another railway, which will continue to 
operate it. In the absence of an immediate buyer, the bill provides 
for a simple process to dispose of surplus rail lines, by encouraging 
their sale or lease to shortline railways.
<P>
	However, if sufficient notice has been given and no private or 
government buyer wants to buy the line, the railway will be 
authorized to sell it as it pleases.
<P>
	All concerned, including main railway lines, will benefit from 
efforts to foster the creation of shortline railways.
<P>
	The public interest will be protected since the government will 
have the option of buying a line that no one else wants to operate 
for rail purposes. This is indeed the best way to promote the 
continued operation of a viable system from coast to coast.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	During the committee's review of the bill, concerns were raised 
by some about the length of time for governments and others to 
react when a line might be discontinued. These concerns have been 
addressed through amendments to lengthen somewhat the time 
lines at the beginning and the end of the process. For instance, each 
level of government will now have up to 30 days to purchase a line 
rather than 15 days in the original bill. Amendments such as the 
example I have cited demonstrate the government's flexibility and 
resolve to make this important piece of legislation both effective 
and fair.
<P>
	I feel that the bill as now drafted represents an admirable 
balance. The standing committee and all its members from all 
parties in the House is to be commended for its excellent work. It is 
an example of how well the standing committee process can work 
and how it can handle extremely complex legislative tasks.
<P>
	The bill will now be considered by the Senate and I look forward 
to the outcome. Bill C-13 complements other transportation reform 
initiatives that the government has introduced. The Canadian 
transportation system must be dynamic and as unrestricted as 
possible if it is to meet the demands of our changing economy. This 
legislation, once passed, will achieve this. I am proud to have had a 
part in its progress at the third reading stage.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Mercier (Blainville-Deux-Montagnes, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I believe everyone agrees that the principle of Bill C-14 is 
a good one: rationalizing, unifying and modernizing the existing 
legislation on public transportation, most particularly rail 
transportation.
<P>
	No one can be against these goals of unification, modernization 
and rationalization since no one, even the official opposition, can 
be against virtue. We are, therefore, in favour of the principle. We 
also consider some of the clauses to be good ones, but others are so 
bad as to be unacceptable.
<P>
	The amendments we moved to correct those shortcomings have 
all been defeated. For these reasons we are opposed to Bill C-14 
and will vote against it.
<P>
<B>(1030)</B>
<P>
	The key reasons why we are opposed to Bill C-14 can be 
summarized into four points. The first deals with the creation of the 
short line railways, which represent the secondary elements of the 
system. Because the system's future depends on them, their 
creation ought to have been facilitated. The minister has just 
pointed out that, very recently, such secondary lines have 
multiplied greatly in the U.S.A., to the public's benefit.
<P>
	The second reason why we are opposed to this bill is that the 
procedure for a company to abandon a trunk or other line looks at 
virtually nothing except profit issues and goals, whereas the public 
interest ought to hold far more importance.
<P>
	Third, the bill maintains privileges for the west which accentuate 
or maintain the differences we are already used to between the west 
and Quebec.
<P>
	Fourth, and most important, despite all the talk about 
decentralizing powers, we see that the government has not been 
able to resist the ingrained habit, any time new legislation is 
introduced, of taking advantage of the opportunity to nibble away 
at provincial powers, as well as to ignore the provinces when their 
interests are quite obviously concerned by the measures planned.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1213"> 1213 </A></B>
<P>
	The first point, then, is the creation of short line railways. I 
would remind my listeners that these are entities whose 
development can ensure the survival of the secondary part of the 
system, which, it must be pointed out, has been scandalously 
neglected from the maintenance point of view. This has been both 
scandalous and profitable, perhaps, since the objective was to 
obtain permission to abandon the lines in question. In order for 
them to be abandoned, they have not to be used anymore. In order 
for them not to be used anymore, they need only not be properly 
maintained, and the result is achieved. Except that now certain 
sections of this secondary network are in bad shape.
<P>
	Buyers, generally small companies with little capital, are being 
asked to take these sections in their existing bad state. Because the 
legislation governing the railway companies resulted in the 
network's being in such bad shape, we asked for but failed to get a 
mechanism from the federal government whereby railway lines 
would be repaired before being put up for sale, since local 
companies potentially interested in taking over the lines generally 
have little capital. Our request was not met. The SLRs that might 
have been the future of the secondary network are getting no help 
in setting up.
<P>
	The other reason we will be voting against this bill is because the 
abandonment procedure follows market logic only. In the past, 
when a company wanted to abandon a section of rail line, the 
National Transportation Agency had to call public hearings. I recall 
having testified before agency commissioners in defence of a 
section. Public hearings are no longer held. If a railway company 
finds that a section of line is not profitable enough, it declares its 
intention to abandon it. It is true, and this is a good point, that the 
bill requires a company now give longer notice in announcing its 
intention to discontinue service and that it be according to a plan 
previously drawn up and made public.
<P>
<B>(1035)</B>
<P>
	But once the information procedure relating to the sale of a 
section of the network is completed, the rest is pure mercantile 
logic. If there is no buyer, well, there is no buyer. If there is no 
buyer, public authorities at the municipal, provincial or federal 
level are given some time to express their interest in buying it.
<P>
	Of course, there is hardly enough time for these authorities, and 
especially municipalities, to organize public hearings. Up until 
now, we were happy with the current procedure whereby the 
Canadian Transportation Agency held public hearings before 
allowing companies to abandon rail lines.
<P>
	The third reason we oppose this bill is that it perpetuates a 
system that is biased in favour of the West and that constitutes 
another example of the imbalance in the treatment of Western 
Canada, on the one hand, and Quebec, on the other hand. This bill 
contains a number of clauses we want to see deleted. Clauses 147 to 
155  amend but also restore certain privileges for Western Canada.
<P>
	These clauses set a maximum rate and special conditions 
applying to the transportation of western grain. These provisions 
were introduced in the National Transportation Act in 1987, when 
the Western Grain Transportation Act or WGTA was repealed and 
the subsidy eliminated.
<P>
	At that time, western farmers were compensated generously, to 
the tune of $3 billion, for the elimination of the subsidy and the 
abrogation of the WGTA. In its bill, the government reintroduces 
the provisions that were originally in the National Transportation 
Act, 1987. Yet, western farmers were generously compensated, 
unlike their counterparts in Quebec. In fact, dairy producers 
received no compensation whatsoever for the recent elimination of 
their subsidies. Western farmers should therefore be in a good 
position to face the new transportation conditions in Western 
Canada and to adjust to a commercially oriented rail system, since 
we are told that the main purpose of the bill is to commercialize the 
network.
<P>
	Giving unequal treatment to western and eastern shippers, as 
these eight clauses tend to do, can only lead to inequitable 
development of the rail system by adversely affecting the resources 
carriers can invest in the eastern network.
<P>
	But what is really telling, although it was to be expected, is that 
the government and the minister are giving themselves 
discretionary powers in this bill, without even providing for 
consultations-and I mean mere consultations-with the 
provinces, in situations where the provinces should obviously be 
consulted.
<P>
	There are several examples of that. Take clause 7, which deals 
with the Canadian Transportation Agency, formerly the National 
Transportation Agency of Canada which, incidentally, also has a 
new role. Clause 7 provides that the governor in council shall 
appoint not more than three members for a term of not more than 
five years. The expression ``not more than'' means that there could 
be one, two or three members appointed. The minister may 
also-he may but he does not have to-appoint three temporary 
members, for a term of not more than one year, from the roster of 
individuals established by the governor in council.
<P>
	This is not a criticism, just a comment in passing. If there are 
three members for a maximum of five years, and if the minister 
may appoint other members, it seems to me-unless I do not 
understand French-that the CTA could be made up of only one 
individual. This is indeed a possibility, given the wording used.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1214"> 1214 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1040)</B>
<P>
	The provisions on the CTA's membership include no criteria, 
benchmarks or obligations for the minister regarding the various 
interests of carriers, users and the general public. The whole 
process is discretionary.
<P>
	Yet, it might have been appropriate to appoint members from a 
list of names submitted by interested parties. There are not even 
geographical criteria. Imagine that there are four members. I am 
just making a point but, strictly speaking, all four could come from 
the same region. There are no criteria and we want to at least 
correct that situation by saying that members, whether temporary 
or not, should be appointed on the advice of the four regions. Ten 
provinces was too much. We had defined four regions: the Atlantic 
provinces, Quebec, Ontario and the Western provinces. That was 
rejected out of hand and it is now up to the government to choose 
the members of the CTA.
<P>
	One good thing is that the bill provides for situations that it 
defines as extraordinary, in which the governor in council may take 
special decisions recommended by the minister to cope with 
situations that require urgent action or for which there is no 
particular provision in any other act of Parliament that would offer 
a solution.
<P>
	In this case, situations defined as urgent are those that could 
endanger the interests of the operator, all the interests of users and 
the public interest, with the exception of strikes.
<P>
	In such situations, the governor in council can take special 
measures. But, if an urgent situation arises in a province, how can 
provincial authorities be left out of it? In addition, how can the 
matter not at least be referred to the Standing Committee on 
Transport? None of this is covered. We have the government 
arbitrarily taking control, setting itself up as the sole arbiter.
<P>
	Another measure, good in principle, contained in the bill is the 
provision requiring that the legislation be reviewed after four 
years. However well thought out a piece of legislation is, the final 
test is obviously how well it stands up to real events over a period 
of time, before a decision can be taken to leave it as is or to 
introduce amendments. It is therefore a very good idea that the bill 
includes a provision from the outset for a review of this legislation 
in four years.
<P>
	All this is fine and well, but who will review the legislation? It 
will be reviewed by individuals appointed by the minister. Once 
again, we are not told that these individuals will be chosen with the 
approval of the provinces or from lists prepared by the interested 
parties. No, not at all. The bill provides for a review after four 
years. There is no guarantee that all interest groups will be called 
upon to give their opinion on the legislation because shortcomings 
have shown up in practice. They say that the communities will be 
consulted, but this is obviously very vague.
<P>
<B>(1045)</B>
<P>
	We wanted the agency to be consulted, and the provinces, but 
there is nothing new. The omniscient, and therefore omnipotent 
government, as infallible as the Pope, will decide.
<P>
	The bill provides for the construction of new rail lines, which is 
not something that happens much these days. In particular, we 
ought not to expect to see HSTs in the near future. Soon we may be 
the only country, with the possible exception of Zimbabwe, not to 
have high speed trains. However, the legislation does provide for 
the construction of new lines. The agency will grant authorization 
to a company requesting to build a new line, if it meets certain 
criteria, and if the route appears to serve the interests of the carrier, 
the users and the regions it crosses.
<P>
	But-and this is truly incredible-the province concerned is not 
even asked for its opinion. If there is one field that is really specific 
to the provinces, it is the development of their territory. Either the 
province exercises that right directly, or the municipalities do so on 
its behalf. This is an exclusively provincial area.
<P>
	In Quebec, the municipalities draw up land use plans for 
authorization by the province. These then lead to zoning plans. 
Imagine, a new line is to be constructed in a municipality. It is 
possible that the zoning plan, the land use plan, did not include the 
route of that line. Thus, we must trust the federal government's 
wisdom not to trash the zoning plan and the land use plan by 
putting the line through. It is absolutely incredible that putting in a 
new line-part of the development plan of a region-does not 
require consultation with the province, yet this is a specifically 
provincial jurisdiction.
<P>
	And now for the icing on the cake: centralization disguised as 
decentralization. Clause 89, against which we tabled amendment 
No. 17. I must read it, because it is such a juicy tidbit.
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>89. If the construction or operation of a railway is authorized by a Special Act 
passed by the legislature of a province and the railway is declared by an Act of 
Parliament to be a work for the general advantage of Canada, this Part applies to 
the railway to the exclusion of any general railway Act of the province and any 
provisions of the Special Act that are inconsistent with this Part.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	This is absolutely typical. It would, however, have been simple, 
rational, and respectful of the provinces to state in a general and 
unrestricted way that a railway constructed by a special act of a 
provincial legislature remained under provincial authority. That 
would have squelched the federal government's hunger for power, 
which is totally contrary to what it is saying.
<P>
<B>(1050)</B>
<P>
	Sadly, I must conclude that, with Bill C-14, railway 
transportation is losing some of its noble mission of public service. 
Essentiality, railways are intended to serve the public. Rail 
transportation is tending to become a  business like any other, 
serving not so much 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1215"> 1215 </A></B>
<P>
the public as the political interests in power. The state has bowed to 
market pressures.
<P>
	I must thank the government for again giving Quebecers, in this 
bill, one more demonstration that there is absolutely no hope within 
the federal framework of one day seeing the logic of public interest 
cease to be constantly subordinated to political or profit making 
imperatives.
<P>
	With Quebecers at least, Bill C-14 will have that one positive 
aspect. Thank you for that, Mr. Minister of Transport.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Gouk (Kootenay West-Revelstoke, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker it is an irony speaking today on Bill C-14. The hearings are 
finished, the amendments are finished. They were voted on last 
night.
<P>
	All we will do today is have a post-mortem on what has taken 
place, a eulogy for the things that might have been much better in a 
bill that has a lot of good merit in it.
<P>
	There are a lot of good points in this bill, but it could have been 
much better. There are several areas where the government has 
either included things that should have been taken out or failed to 
inject things that should be in the bill.
<P>
	I will deal with both the things that should have been taken out 
and with the things that should have been in such as protection for 
utility companies or municipalities with regard to their 
infrastructure systems, sewers, water, roads and so on.
<P>
	Before I get into that, I find myself in the strange position of 
defending the government. There are some good things in the bill. 
We have heard in debate from the NDP objections to some of the 
very things that give the bill some merit.
<P>
	NDP members talked at length about the abandonment 
procedure and tried very hard to put in a bunch of amendments 
which would have basically cancelled the changes that took place. 
They lacked a basic understanding of the entire abandonment 
procedure, both the old one and the new one.
<P>
	NDP members claimed during debate that they have been talking 
in the coffee shops of Canada. I do not doubt they have. It is too bad 
they did not know what they were talking about when they were 
doing it.
<P>
	The Canadians I have talked to both inside and outside 
Parliament want a continued rail service, period. They would like 
to have the service we have now continue, but short lines are 
certainly a viable alternative.
<P>
	I have to reiterate what I said in debate about how the old 
procedure worked and what the problems were. If a rail company 
wanted to abandon any rail line, short line, main line, it does not 
matter, the procedure for  abandonment of a rail line was that it first 
had to prove financial hardship.
<P>
	Before it made that application, and rail companies would be 
loathe to admit this but we all know it is a fact, it made sure that if 
financial hardship did not already exist it created it.
<P>
	The way it creates financial hardship if it does not already exist 
is by demarketing the line, by going to the shippers on the line and 
providing some alternative method of shipping their goods to 
market or at least to a railhead.
<P>
	This happened in my riding in the Slocan Valley where there was 
one primary shipper, Slocan Forest Products. CP Rail, in its 
intention to abandon that line, went to Slocan Forest Products and 
wrote a confidential trucking contract, we presume at very 
favourable rates, perhaps even below its cost, to ship its goods to 
the nearest reload centre in Nelson, B.C. where rail lines still exist.
<P>
<B>(1055 )</B>
<P>
	It also did absolutely minimal maintenance on that line. That is 
not to say it did anything illegal or that it ran a line that was unsafe, 
but it ran it at absolute minimum standards. The evidence of that is 
by the time abandonment was actually approved, we had trees 
growing in the middle of the rail line. That does not happen on a 
well maintained line.
<P>
	As a result the line was abandoned, but no short line operator in 
its right mind would bid to preserve and operate a line which had 
no customers left and which would cost a fortune in repairs and 
upgrades, when normally the rail line would have been maintained.
<P>
	With the new procedure a rail company does not have to prove 
financial hardship. It can apply to abandon whatever line it wishes 
but it has to go through a very set procedure.
<P>
	First it has to publish on a three year planning list which lines it 
wishes to abandon. It is not committed to abandoning them, but 
they would be lines under investigation or under scrutiny by the rail 
company with the possibility of divesting itself of those lines.
<P>
	If it wishes to proceed, it has to offer in a prescribed manner 
those lines for sale with all kinds of published information to the 
general public so that short line operators or those that wish to 
become short line operators could consider purchasing them.
<P>
	After the set period of time, if the company has not succeeded in 
selling the lines, it then has to offer them, in turn, to the federal, 
provincial, local, municipal and regional governments at their net 
salvage value. This gives every possibility of preserving those lines 
because the lines have not necessarily been demarketed or brought 
down to the lowest possible maintenance standards.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1216"> 1216 </A></B>
<P>
	We believe these measures will enhance the ability of short line 
operators to take over the operation of rail lines.
<P>
	I have spoken to several short line operators and they are 
aggressively looking to increase their operations and take on new 
lines. This is a very positive move to enhance the viability of short 
line operations, which may be a viable alternative to rail operations 
in marginal areas.
<P>
	The amendments put forward by the NDP, though well meaning, 
may have harmed rather than helped the situation. I will now deal 
primarily with Reform motions which would have either added 
things that are missing from the legislation or taken things out 
which should have been out in the first place.
<P>
	Three Reform motions deal with municipal government and 
utility company protection. We heard from representatives of the 
Federation of Canadian Municipalities and various utility 
companies regarding their concern about the infrastructures of their 
sewers, water, gas and power which pass in most cases under, and 
in some cases over, rail rights of way.
<P>
	The problem is that if a line is sold or ultimately abandoned, in 
most cases there is no registered easement for the companies or for 
the various municipalities. This is a problem for municipalities 
which have designed their whole infrastructure systems for the 
crossings. They would like to have something in the bill which 
would ensure the protection of the lines for all the people they 
serve in the various communities in their areas.
<P>
	I do not think that is a particularly unreasonable request. It is not 
a cost factor to the rail companies. Those who would argue against 
this would say the municipalities or the utility companies can 
expropriate. They can in many cases, but that costs money. In the 
end those costs fall to the very people who use these services, the 
taxpayers.
<P>
	Again I am defending the Liberal government. The Liberal 
government needs the Canadian taxpayer to have as much money 
as possible in order to pay all the Liberal bills generated by the 
government. I truly am looking out for the best interests of the 
Liberals with these motions.
<P>
	Unfortunately the Liberals rejected every one of the motions that 
would have protected the municipalities. They would have 
protected all the towns and villages that rail lines go through and all 
the infrastructure systems that go under or over the rail rights of 
way. The Liberals turned their back on them.
<P>
<B>(1100 )</B>
<P>
	I hope those people will remember that when the Liberals start 
trying to get even more tax dollars out of them and there are 
problems at the municipal level because of these rights of way.
<P>
	Another Reform motion that is missing from the legislation is 
some measure of protection for Atlantic  Canada. Motion No. 38 
was a Reform motion that provided one of those protections. This 
was an amendment that would have seen a five-year guarantee that 
the CN Rail line from Montreal to Halifax would continue in 
operation. This goes back to Bill C-89 which was the CN 
privatization bill.
<P>
	People from Halifax, the port authorities and other 
representatives from Atlantic Canada came before the committee 
with regard to Bill C-89 and asked for a 10-year continuance of that 
line. They put forward some very good and sound arguments.
<P>
	I put that amendment at committee level and it was supported by 
at least one Liberal member of the committee from Atlantic 
Canada. In fact the vote was a tie and the Liberal chair of the 
committee had to break the tie and did so by voting against Atlantic 
Canada. The same people came before us with regard to Bill C-89 
and Bill C-14 or Bill C-101 at that time, saying they still need this. 
They said they could live with five years and cut their request in 
half.
<P>
	Ports commercialization or privatization is coming in. All the 
ports will have to look out for themselves, raise their own capital 
on the marketplace and be responsible for it. The federal 
government is not going to guarantee the loans. I do not have a 
problem with that. These ports should stand on their own. They 
should operate on a commercially viable basis. The ports that came 
before us on this issue said they were prepared to do that.
<P>
	However, they cannot go to investors and ask them to put money 
in if they cannot ensure those investors that while they are 
developing their post-Panamax facilities to get ready for the 
coming generation of new and larger freighters, they do not have 
some guarantee that they are going to be able to transport those 
goods from Atlantic Canada into central Canada and the American 
midwest.
<P>
	As it happens Halifax is the ultimate best port for not only 
reaching central Canada but for reaching the American midwest. 
This does not take away from any of the inland ports, for example, 
Montreal or the Lakehead, because if these post-Panamax ships do 
not come to Halifax they are going to the New England states or to 
New York. It is Halifax or it is somewhere outside of Canada. The 
ports need the CN Rail line with its connection through the Sarnia 
tunnel to get to the American midwest market.
<P>
	If I were going to invest in the infrastructure of the Halifax area I 
would want some assurance that the rail line was going to stay 
intact until such time as these post-Panamax facilities were 
developed, the market was there and the goods were being shipped. 
At that time the port will be prepared to stand on its own.
<P>
	Liberal members were asking why Reform was interfering with 
the free enterprise of CN Rail by saying it had to do something for a 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1217"> 1217 </A></B>
<P>
five-year period of time. The  Reform Party is supposed to be the 
free enterprise party so why is it trying to bring in such an 
amendment?
<P>
	I pointed out that for 80 years successive Liberal and 
Conservative governments had interfered with the marketplace, 
specifically with CN Rail, by having this crown corporation doing 
things that were far removed from normal commercial practices. 
All I was asking for was a five-year transition period while it went 
from this crown entity to the private sector.
<P>
<B>(1105 )</B>
<P>
	The head of CN Rail, Mr. Paul Tellier, appeared at the hearings 
on Bill C-14. I asked Mr. Tellier that as he was required under the 
act to provide a three-year plan was he looking beyond that to four, 
five or six years? He said that he was. I then asked if he had any 
plans over the next five years to discontinue the line between 
Montreal and Halifax. His response was, no, absolutely not because 
CN had made a lot of investments in Atlantic Canada in facilities 
and there were no plans to do that.
<P>
	The Liberals could have accepted the amendment that I brought 
forward so that Halifax could go to the investors and say: ``There is 
your guarantee that the rail line will remain''. It would not have 
cost CN or the government or the taxpayers anything. In fact, the 
only thing that could cost the taxpayers money is if Halifax has 
trouble raising capital in order to do its post-Panamax facility 
upgrades and loses the traffic to the United States. This was a win, 
win situation but the Liberals said no to Atlantic Canada.
<P>
	Last night we had a standing vote on Motion No. 38 and one by 
one, each and every Liberal in this place rose and voted against 
Atlantic Canada. Why did they do that? Could it be that they 
simply do not want Atlantic Canada to develop any form of 
financial independence? There can be no other explanation.
<P>
	Clause 27(3) would not have been required at all. The Reform 
Party tried to amend it but that would not have been needed if the 
Liberals had done the right thing with clause 27(2) but they did not. 
This does not fix clause 27(2). I have to make that clear. Our 
motion tried to make it slightly more acceptable.
<P>
	The main source of the items we listed in our amendment to try 
to better define what is significant commercial harm was provided 
by the NTA representative stating items that would clarify clause 
27(2) so we put those in.
<P>
	I am going to mix a couple of things together here because clause 
27(2) is strongly entwined with this. The minister said this morning 
that clause 27(2) got unanimous support at committee. Unlike Bill 
C-89 which went to committee after first reading, we supported it. 
The Liberals said this would make it more amendment friendly. 
They were not telling an accurate story, shall we say. When it got 
there we did propose amendments after listening to the various 
people who came before us. The  Liberals rejected each and every 
amendment out of hand with very little discussion. After the fact, 
we discovered that they would have been much better off had they 
brought in at least the majority of those amendments. The 
government knows that now. Maybe it knew it then, but for 
whatever reason it chose not to listen.
<P>
	The Liberals had a change of heart on Bill C-14. They seemed to 
be much more open to amendments and they did support a 
tremendous number of Reform amendments which were brought 
forward. They went so far as to ask me what I would like to see in 
the bill. That is very hopeful for the future if they are prepared to do 
this.
<P>
	The Liberals did accept a lot of our amendments. Unfortunately, 
a couple which they did not dealt with clause 27(2) and 27(3). One 
thing that I tried to do was recognize that if the government does 
not want to take clause 27(2) out it is going to be passed because 
after all it has a majority and can pass anything it wishes.
<P>
	At committee level I tried, first, to make the clause a little more 
palatable with an amendment which would define much more 
specifically exactly what was then referred to as significant 
prejudice. In part, the agreement I made verbally was that if the 
government accepted this, I would support clause 27(2) at the 
committee level, knowing full well that we still had report stage to 
deal with this after I had another opportunity to speak to the various 
shippers who were concerned about this.
<P>
<B>(1110 )</B>
<P>
	What the government did was a little sneaky. Perhaps I should 
have said that it had broken its agreement and therefore I no longer 
had an obligation but I stuck with it.
<P>
	I put forward an amendment that would define the meaning of 
clause 27(2). The government pre-empted it with one of its own, 
which was much softer than mine. Once the government's 
amendment was in, there cannot have two amendments proposed 
on the same clause at committee stage, so it took precedent over 
mine and mine was not considered. That was the same amendment 
that I brought forward at report stage.
<P>
	The government should have supported my amendment as it was 
proposed, as I did what I had agreed to and that was support clause 
27(2) at the committee stage provided the government amended it.
<P>
	Reform supported two amendments which removed 
objectionable clauses from this bill. I would like to discuss the one 
that deals with clause 11(2), commercially fair and reasonable. At 
the committee hearings I asked the NTA representative to define 
commercially fair and reasonable. The following is a quote from 
the testimony before the Standing Committee on Transport, 
November 7, 1995 by Mr. Ashley of the National Transportation 
Agency responding to my inquiry.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1218"> 1218 </A></B>
<P>
	Mr. Ashley stated: ``What is commercially fair and reasonable 
is I suspect consistent with what is competitive. What is 
competitive in any circumstances depends on product market, 
geographic market, the elasticities of demand for that product, 
temporal aspects, production efficiencies, market structure, market 
conduct and market performance''.
<P>
	``I can tell you that on the street it would mean covering the fixed 
cost long term average variable cost, contribution to fixed cost and 
perhaps a return on shareholder equity. But to say today that in the 
future it will be what the agency does in every case would be 
wrong''.
<P>
	``The competition people have appeared before you. The law is 
predicated on competition in the marketplace. If you look at case 
law under the Competition Act, the courts would have stated that 
even a non-compensatory rate, a below cost losing rate, can be a 
commercially fair and reasonable competitive rate. Perishable 
goods, production oversupply, the jurisprudence under the 
Competition Act shows that a commercially fair and reasonable 
rate can be many things in many circumstances and what is 
commercially fair and reasonable today may not be tomorrow''.
<P>
	Responding to Mr. Ashley I said: ``Let me point out what you 
have just said. When I asked you about the meaning of significant 
prejudice you said `it could be argued'. When I asked you about the 
meaning of commercially fair and reasonable you said `I suspect it 
means'. That is little comfort to the shippers. If this is what the 
NTA does, if this is how they decide, it is no wonder the shippers 
are worried. `I suspect', `it could be argued', that is no comfort at 
all, Mr. Ashley''.
<P>
	Continuing, I asked: ``Can I then surmise from what you are 
saying that you don't necessarily agree with these provisions but 
you are going to work with them to the best of your ability. These 
things are highly subjective and the NTA, soon to be the CTA, will 
have to deal with them as best they can''.
<P>
	Mr. Ashley's response was: ``That is correct, sir''.
<P>
	I responded again: ``You can see where my concern is. The lack 
of objectivity in this is telling me that they're'', and this is referring 
to the shippers, ``probably are right to be worried''.
<P>
	That is the reason we are concerned about that particular clause 
and why we supported trying to take it out. Let there be no 
misunderstanding of what the government is saying. That is from 
the NTA.
<P>
	Clause 27(2) is undoubtedly the most controversial part of the 
entire bill. It should have been taken out. This is what is referred to 
as significant prejudice throughout the hearings and later changed 
to substantial commercial harm.
<P>
	I think there was a possible ploy on the part of the new Minister 
of Transport. Several shippers' groups visited with the minister and 
the new chair of the Standing Committee on Transport last week 
and brought forward their concerns about clause 27(2) and what 
this would do for them. The minister responded: ``I was not aware 
of those aspects. That is really interesting. In light of this I will 
have to reconsider the government's position on clause 27(2)''. 
This was echoed by the chair of the transport committee.
<P>
<B>(1115)</B>
<P>
	I asked how I could co-operate with them to ensure the matter 
was properly addressed. I told them I did not want to make a 
political football out of the matter, that I did not want to score 
political points, I simply wanted the bill to be good.
<P>
	I offered to make an agreement to send the bill, or at least clause 
27, back to committee where all committee members could 
reconsider and make changes so that it would not be a government 
response to a Reform amendment. They overwhelmingly rejected 
my offer. Up until the eve before debate they were very open, 
saying they were considering these things. The morning of debate it 
was gone from the table.
<P>
	Since then shippers have told me they think they were set up. 
They think the minister gave them that hope to keep them quiet so 
they would not give a press release against what the government 
was doing. Once debate began, when it was too late to do any of 
these things, the government cut them off at the knees. I did not 
suggest this to the shippers, it came from them. I believe they were 
right.
<P>
	There were many witnesses at the committee level. We had long 
hearings which lasted well into the evenings on several occasions. 
Most of the witnesses strenuously objected to clause 27(2). If we 
will not listen to the people who come before these committees, the 
overwhelming majority of them, why do we go through the cost of 
interpreters, technicians, research people, the clerks, the offices 
and all the other costs? Why do we have the expense of all these 
people coming to Ottawa to testify before the committee if we will 
not listen to them? Attempts to fix clause 27(2) were not accepted 
by these shippers.
<P>
	Bill C-101, as it was first known, was basically lost from the 
Order Paper with the prorogation of the House. The government 
obviously wanted to bring it back, which it ultimately did. It tried 
first to bring it back in the old accepted way, by unanimous 
consent.
<P>
	Moya Greene, who was an assistant deputy minister in the 
transport department, called me in British Columbia to ask if I 
would agree to unanimous consent to bring this bill forward. I said 
I would provided they take clause 27(2) out of it. She asked why I 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1219"> 1219 </A></B>
<P>
wanted clause 27(2) taken out. I said it was because there was such  
overwhelming to it. She replied that they had fixed it. I said that I 
would give her the greatest deal ever: ``Of all the people who 
objected strenuously on record to clause 27(2), if you can find me 
two or three who are prepared to say they objected to it but now 
accept it, I will reconsider my position''. She did not know if she 
could do that. I suggest, as I did to her, that it has not been fixed.
<P>
	As I have said, the minister led many concerned shippers to 
believe he would reconsider clause 27(2). I did everything I could 
to accommodate this. I brought forward a request to seek the 
unanimous consent of the House to do that so that it could be done 
in a non-partisan manner with all of the House agreeing to it. The 
government rejected my offer.
<P>
	Who is really against clause 27(2)? The farmers and their 
organizations are against it, the grain companies are against it, the 
mining operations, sawmills, pulp and paper producers, chemical 
companies, manufacturers. Who really benefits? The two rail 
companies obviously benefit a little, but I do not believe they are 
the real beneficiaries.
<P>
	I refer again to testimony of the NTA on November 7, 1995. In 
this text the term ``significant prejudice'' is used. This term was 
later amended to ``substantial commercial harm''. All shippers I 
have consulted with agree this change of words has not 
substantially changed the intent of this clause, if at all.
<P>
<B>(1120 )</B>
<P>
	I asked the witness, Mr. Ashley from the National Transportation 
Agency, what ``significant prejudice'' meant. I asked him to define, 
from the NTA's point of view, what would happen to me if I were a 
shipper coming before it and it had do something for me or throw 
me out the door, depending on how it interpreted ``significant 
prejudice''.
<P>
	Mr. Ashley's response was: ``I will tell you what I expect the 
agency will hear by way of arguments as to what it will mean. On 
one end of the spectrum it could be argued, and I assure you it will 
be argued, that it is the mere inability of a shipper to get his goods 
to market because of the railway's refusal to grant a CLR that is, by 
definition, significant prejudice of the ability of the shipper to get 
his goods to market.
<P>
	``On the opposite end of the spectrum, it will be evidence in 
argument tendered to the effect that in a shipper's inability to get 
his goods to market the test of significant prejudice will only be 
met if that shipper has to close his plant''.
<P>
	My response to Mr. Ashley was: ``You can see where the 
problem is. You have just given me an incredible range, including 
the possibility that a shipper has to go bankrupt before this thing 
may be decided in his favour. We have to sort of say to shippers `do 
not worry about clause 27(2), it is great. It will not harm a damn 
thing as  long as you are prepared to go bankrupt'. I find that 
absolutely astounding''.
<P>
	I continued to ask Mr. Ashley the following: ``If we do not have 
clause 27(2) does it stop you from doing your job? In the last eight 
years have you had a problem doing your job?'' Mr. Ashley's 
response was: ``The answer to that, sir, is no''.
<P>
	Who really benefits from this, as near as I can see, are lawyers. 
This is according to the testimony of Mr. Ashley, himself a lawyer. 
Why would the government be interested in doing something that 
will benefit primarily lawyers?
<P>
	I have an astounding list in my hand. It points out that the Prime 
Minister is a lawyer, the government House leader is a lawyer, the 
minister of agriculture is a lawyer, the Minister of Health is a 
lawyer and the Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern 
Development is a lawyer. There is a lawyer's growth industry right 
there. When the member became the Minister of Indian Affairs and 
Northern Affairs some aboriginal people he had been working with 
as a lawyer said: ``I thought I had died and gone to heaven''.
<P>
	The Minister of Industry is a lawyer, the Minister of Natural 
Resources is a lawyer, the Minister of Justice is a lawyer and the 
President of the Treasury Board is a lawyer. The Minister of 
Human Resources Development is a lawyer. He is the former 
Minister of Transport who introduced and helped draft this 
legislation. Now we know who is benefiting from this.
<P>
	Clause 27(2) is a deal killer for the Reform Party. Even though 
there are other objectionable inclusions or exclusions in the bill, 
there would be enough value in it to recommend its passage if it not 
for clause 27(2).
<P>
	The government had the opportunity to improve the bill but did 
not take it. We all know it has the power to pass absolutely anything 
it wants whether it is in the public interest or not. Let us chalk up 
another win for an autocratic Liberal government and another loss 
for democracy.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bernie Collins (Souris-Moose Mountain, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am pleased to speak on Bill C-14, previously known as 
Bill C-101, as it has some direct impact on the western provinces 
and certainly my province of Saskatchewan.
<P>
	I believe the proposed legislation is very constructive, creative 
and in a manner allows for unnecessary regulations and overlap to 
be removed. It places greater reliance on parties to negotiate their 
own solutions on commercial and economic issues and reduce, 
wherever possible, reliance on regulatory decision making in such 
matters.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1220"> 1220 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1125)</B>
<P>
	In my view, this wisely places the matters of competition and 
monopoly in the realm of other appropriate legislation such as the 
Competition Act.
<P>
	A number of places were uncovered where general business laws 
such as the Canada Business Corporations Act would be used 
instead of having specialized laws for transportation and 
companies. We wanted to reduce overlap and regulation. These 
matters were covered adequately by some other body.
<P>
	This also makes it simpler for stakeholders who might otherwise 
be faced with confusion or who are burdened with many different 
pieces of legislation or regulation. Overall the new act will reduce 
the costly burden of excess regulation and will ensure the long term 
viability of Canada's transportation system.
<P>
	First and foremost in my mind is the concern of my constituents 
about the rail sector. In this area alone, the legislation will reduce 
government intervention for approvals and decisions on railway 
actions, limiting them from 200 to approximately 40.
<P>
	Although the bill is not completely satisfactory to either the 
railways or the shippers, it serves after months of public and open 
consultation to strike a compromise.
<P>
	The amendments brought to the bill were after considerable 
work by the Standing Committee on Transport. Considerable 
consultation was undertaken with all the stakeholders. Because of 
the consultation, equilibrium and balance has been achieved. The 
bill has effectively addressed the need for balance between the 
marketplace and government policy issues and what must remain a 
matter for the regulator to be involved in.
<P>
	I turn to some matters that drew considerable attention and fire 
during the debate from western stakeholders. I do this to 
demonstrate to the House that concerns have been listened to and 
changes have been made and to reassure western constituents they 
have not been hung out to dry in the process.
<P>
	I wish to focus on three clauses that got the most attention while 
I travelled throughout the riding and when witnesses appeared 
before the standing committee. They were clause 27(2), formerly 
known as significant prejudice; clause 34(1), frivolous and 
vexatious arguments or applications; and clause 113, now known as 
clause 112, which obligated the agency to ensure any rates or 
service levels it sets are commercially fair and reasonable.
<P>
	Let me deal first with clause 27(2). The clause was reworded, 
although some have missed it, to clear up what had been a problem. 
It provides guidance to the agency in ultimately rendering 
decisions. It does not act is a pretest as some had thought. The 
words ``significant prejudice'' were replaced by the words 
``substantial commercial harm'', terms that are more understood in  
law. The new clauses 3 and 5 clearly signify and make clear that 
this does not apply to final offer arbitration.
<P>
	In standing committee transcripts Cargill, a major shipper, was 
asked if these changes would satisfy it. Cargill responded 
positively. These amendments were adopted unanimously by all 
the parties in the standing committee.
<P>
	Regarding the phrase ``frivolous and vexatious arguments'' 
many people in shipping organizations raised concerns. That clause 
has been removed from the bill.
<P>
	The third major concern is clause 112. ``Commercially fair and 
reasonable'' is a phrase that has been heavily investigated and 
debated throughout the process. There are some concerns raised by 
the pools. I recall there was a question of commercially fair and 
reasonable to whom and in whose perspective? The government 
motion at report stage now adds some clarifying words to this 
provision. The words ``to all parties'' answer the questions of the 
shippers. This underscores the obligation that the agency's set rates 
must meet the test of fairness and provide the users with rail 
service.
<P>
<B>(1130)</B>
<P>
	I do not want to leave the House with the impression that I have 
conveniently grabbed all of these clauses and I quote them simply 
to support the position of the government. I have consulted widely 
with stakeholders and with my constituents on the issue. I feel 
confident that now is the time to move forward with the bill.
<P>
	Let me quickly say a few words about the provisions of the bill 
as they relate to the grain interests in the country. Many witnesses 
who came forward to the standing committee were pleased that the 
government seemed to recognize that competition and market 
forces were not perfect in the grain sector and that a period of 
transition was needed. The changes that were made, especially in 
section 27, go a long way to remove the remaining fears of 
shippers, including grain shippers, about the issue. As well as the 
protection afforded all shippers under the new legislation, grain 
shippers will enjoy extra provisions such as maximum rates and a 
comprehensive hopper car allocation.
<P>
	The Minister of Transport has indicated that the government 
intends to sell the 13,000 hopper cars which are presently owned by 
the department. He indicated that the department is inviting 
proposals to assess and determine the financial arrangements and 
the terms and conditions of sale. The interests of all stakeholders, 
including producers, will be taken into account in this process.
<P>
	In closing, I will touch on the positive attributes of the 
legislation. While I was a member of the committee listening to the 
hearings and particularly presentations from the west, section 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1221"> 1221 </A></B>
<P>
27(2), section 34(1) and also  section 113 which is now known as 
section 112 were also major concerns. What happened with those?
<P>
	We altered the wording in section 27(2) to meet the needs of 
shippers. Also section 34(1) which said ``frivolous and vexatious 
arguments'' was dropped completely, and I think correctly so. In 
section 113, which is now section 112, we have amended the 
wording to deal with those people who will be affected by it.
<P>
	The shippers and rail companies and all who will be involved 
with new Bill C-14 have to come to the position of making it work. 
If they want it to work, it will. If they do not want it to work, they 
will use every effort in their power so that it will not work.
<P>
	In my opinion, we have set legislation which is a compromise 
and in the final analysis will meet the needs of shippers, railways 
and all Canadians.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean-Guy Chrétien (Frontenac, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I will 
use my 20 minutes to speak to Bill C-14.
<P>
	I am keen to speak on this bill, which is intended to update 
legislation on railway transportation, to redefine the mandate of the 
National Transportation Agency and to further deregulate air 
transportation.
<P>
<B>(1135)</B>
<P>
	Obviously, I will not be debating the entire bill, but rather setting 
out for you certain points that are of particular interest to me. We in 
the Bloc are opposed to Bill C-14 for a number of reasons. The 
provinces are not consulted on a number of points in the bill, 
including one of special interest to me-the environment.
<P>
	As my colleague for Blainville-Deux-Montagnes, the former 
mayor of the beautiful municipality of Blainville, said yesterday in 
this House, clause 98 of Bill C-14 is incomplete, because it does 
not oblige the Agency to do an environmental impact study before 
authorizing the construction of a rail line, and this is totally 
unacceptable. I would remind you here of the unfortunate case of 
the <I>Irving Whale</I>.
<P>
	In 1970, the <I>Irving Whale</I> sank off the Magdalen Islands and 
Prince Edward Island. It was, of course, the Liberals who were 
running the country at the time. Are we going to entrust the 
environment, as in the construction of a huge rail line or a major 
section, to a government that showed no environmental concern in 
the infamous case of the <I>Irving Whale</I>?
<P>
	In 1994, we had a sort of committee, known as the 
Easter-Gagnon committee, that went around the Gaspé, Quebec 
and the Maritimes. Two backbenchers spent several thousand 
dollars of taxpayers' money for a political promotion. This was 
followed by the Department of the Environment's official 
consultation when the decision was made to raise the barge. The 
result was an outpouring of over $20 million, and the <I>Irving Whale</I> 
remains on the bottom.
<P>
	You will ask me what all this has to do with the National 
Transportation Agency. The point is simply to show the danger of 
giving the federal government total jurisdiction over the 
environment. In fact, the environment is not covered by the 
Constitution and, until proof is provided to the contrary, it comes 
under provincial jurisdiction. Clearly, the construction of a railroad 
changes the rural and urban landscape.
<P>
	The environmental impact must therefore be seriously 
considered and, moreover, the provinces should be consulted, since 
land use is their responsibility.
<P>
	There is nothing surprising in this. It is one of many examples of 
the Liberal government's effrontery in pushing the provinces out of 
their own fields of jurisdiction.
<P>
	I would be remiss as well if I did not talk about unfairness, since 
recently I have had a number of opportunities to raise this issue and 
today will be no exception. Like my colleague for 
Blainville-Deux-Montagnes, responsible for transportation issues 
at the federal level, pointed out earlier, eastern Canada faces a very 
serious problem-the abandonment of several shortline railroads. 
These sections were left discarded by the federal government and 
are now in bad shape, for the most part.
<P>
<B>(1140)</B>
<P>
	As you can easily imagine, once these lines are taken over as 
short line railways, operating them will not be so profitable, 
especially since the financial situation of short line railways is 
rather precarious because of the level of debt and because of the 
condition of the railways and bridges.
<P>
	Eighteen months ago in my riding, in the great region of the 
Eastern Townships and Chaudière-Appalaches, the Quebec 
Central Railway abandoned the Chaudière-Vallée line, which 
goes from the city of Sherbrooke to Lévis and Lac-Frontière 
through Saint-Georges-de-Beauce, a distance of 382 kilometres.
<P>
	The Quebec Central Railway gave such poor service and charged 
such high prices in its last 20 years of operation that it lost almost 
all its customers. Of course, it went before the National 
Transportation Agency, which gave it permission to abandon the 
line simply because it was not profitable.
<P>
	At this point, I would like to remind you that, in the west, it is not 
necessary to demonstrate that a line is not profitable. Rather, it 
must be demonstrated that the line is not in the public interest. 
Since that is much harder to prove given the very large number of 
grain producers, it is much easier to abandon lines in the east than 
in the west. Once again, we are up against a double standard.
<P>
	In the long term, this situation will lead to the failure of several 
projects and the abandonment of several rail lines. That is why a 
railway rehabilitation program would  correct this situation, espe-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1222"> 1222 </A></B>
<P>
cially in the west and, of course, in the east. In the west, however, 
they speak a very different language. I often talk about the 
advantages given to western Canada, including the compensation 
offered western farmers after the WGTA was repealed and their 
subsidies eliminated.
<P>
	While western farmers received nearly $3 billion in 
compensation, their eastern counterparts were forgotten. This is a 
perfect example of inequity and injustice. Once again, shippers 
must face the new transportation conditions in the west and adjust 
to a commercially oriented railway system. Giving unequal 
treatment to eastern and western shippers is dangerous, as an 
inequitably developed rail network will adversely affect the 
resources carriers can invest in the eastern network.
<P>
	I have here two short sentences that add to the inequities between 
eastern and western Canada, including the abrogation of the WGTA 
announced last year. Maximum rates can be frozen until 1999. In 
concrete terms, for western grain producers, the ceiling set in 1995 
will apply. Railway companies cannot increase it; it is frozen at the 
level it was at when the WGTA was repealed.
<P>
	In addition, for over 15 years, these same producers have been 
allowed to use the government's fleet of hopper cars for free and, if 
they bought the 10 hopper cars for the transportation of grain, I am 
sure they would pay a reduced price.
<P>
<B>(1145)</B>
<P>
	Should we wish the same for Quebec? I doubt it. Quebec is a 
much larger territory than its neighbour, Ontario. Yet, the length of 
railway lines in Ontario is twice that of Quebec. Lines twice as long 
in a province almost half the size means there is actually four times 
more railways in Ontario. So, the inequity does not go back to this 
government coming to office: it existed long before 1867 and even 
before 1841.
<P>
	Let us now look at construction and maintenance costs. Clause 
103(3) provides that the owner of the land shall pay the costs of 
constructing and maintaining the crossing. Here is what this really 
means. I own a piece of land and there are 832 feet of railroad over 
it, cutting it in two. Since I have to cross from the west side to the 
east side of the railroad, the costs of maintaining the crossing are 
paid by the owner of the railroad. Now, under this bill, such costs 
would have to be paid by the owner of the land.
<P>
	This makes no sense. Property rights pertaining to my farm 
existed long before the railroad was built. They go way back. 
Consequently, that clause alone is sufficient reason for me to 
condemn and to oppose that bill. Farmers who are listening to this 
debate on Bill C-14 must realize that if they use a private road to go 
from one side of their farm to the other, they will now have to 
maintain the crossing. The federal government just gave  you a new 
responsibility, even though this area comes under provincial 
jurisdiction.
<P>
	As I said earlier, the owner did not ask the railway company to 
encroach on his land. Consequently, the costs of constructing and 
maintaining the crossing must be paid by the company. After all, it 
uses the land. The same goes for fences. Not more than two weeks 
ago, it was reported in the newspapers that in Saint-Étienne, close 
to Quebec City, coyotes or stray dogs chased a herd of cattle over a 
railway fence and the CN convoy killed 49 animals.
<P>
	Under this bill, fences would become the sole responsibility of 
the farmer. If you are a farmer and if a railroad runs over your land, 
you alone will have to pay for the whole fence, on both sides of the 
railroad, to keep your cattle from going on it. To those who might 
think this is fair, let me just say that Quebec's municipal code 
provides that the construction, maintenance and overall 
responsibility for fences are equally shared by the two owners. Any 
good notary knows that.
<P>
<B>(1150)</B>
<P>
	In its wisdom, the federal government is deciding that from now 
on you will have to put up your own fences. This will not do. It 
makes no sense.
<P>
	Another point. When I was mayor of my municipality, I told you 
that each farmer had 832 feet, unless they had more than one piece 
of land. Over the years, a problem began to develop with drainage. 
As mayor, I met with the authorities of Quebec Central Railway, 
and it was mutually agreed that they would install two large 
culverts under the track. There was no problem. Do you know that, 
with Bill C-14, this would become the responsibility of the farmer? 
That does not make any sense either.
<P>
	I would like to conclude with a look at the issue of running 
rights. In its present form, the bill allows a short line to transport 
merchandise to the nearest rail head, regardless of the national 
carrier chosen by the shipper. By giving provincially licensed 
railway lines running rights on federally licensed lines, a short line 
could deliver its freight to the rail head of any federally licensed 
company.
<P>
	By transporting its freight over a greater distance, a short line 
would generate higher revenues, as well as offering improved 
service to its customers and cutting down on freight transfers. This 
is a logical and efficient improvement with respect to the running 
lines situation. And if the government is serious in saying that it 
wants to encourage the development of short lines, it must approve 
this proposal, which comes from our party, and in particular from 
the hon. member for Blainville-Deux-Montagnes.
<P>
	In conclusion, I would like to pay tribute to a businessman in my 
riding of Frontenac, Jean-Marc Giguère, president of Marco 
Express. For several years now, Mr. Giguère has been negotiating 
with the head  office of Canadian Pacific to buy 382 kilometres of 
track linking Sherbrooke, Vallée-Jonction, Lévis and le lac 
Frontière, via Saint-Georges de Beauce.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1223"> 1223 </A></B>
<P>
	Like many of his fellow citizens from Beauce, Mr. Giguère is a 
courageous and persistent fellow, and he has not given up yet. 
Every week he heads for Toronto to pursue the negotiations. It is a 
slow and difficult process. In the meantime, the track continues to 
deteriorate. Almost one mile of rails and ties was stolen right 
outside Bishopton. By a fluke, the thief was caught. He went to 
court and was ordered to reimburse just the value of the old iron, 
$5,200. How much is it going to cost the promoters to rebuild one 
mile of track?
<P>
	That aside, I pay tribute to Jean-Marc Giguère and wish him 
every success in his efforts to buy and operate this new short line in 
the Eastern Townships.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ronald J. Duhamel (St. Boniface, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
would like to make some comments and to ask two questions in 
particular. My colleague spoke of inequity. It seemed to me that 
this bill involving many key players is trying to strike some 
balance. Maybe my colleague would like to comment on this.
<P>
<B>(1155)</B>
<P>
	I would like to add that the byelection results last night, not only 
in Ontario and in Newfoundland but also in Quebec, show that 
Canadians think that the government of Jean Chrétien is quite 
equitable, fair and responsive.
<P>
	I believe my colleague was not too ``chrétien'' on two aspects. 
For example, he said that this bill did not require an environmental 
study of its impacts and so on. As far as I know, he is mistaken. 
Such a study is mandatory under the Canadian Environmental 
Assessment Act. An environmental study is required before any 
approval, and this is the case here.
<P>
	The second thing I want to say is this. If I understand correctly, it 
is not true, for example, that the damage caused to a land when a 
railway company proceeds with some construction project is the 
responsibility of the owner of the land. It is the responsibility of the 
railway company, not of the owner of the land.
<P>
	I would like to know whether the member would comment on 
that. Did I misunderstand what he said? Maybe he thought he 
should exaggerate things. I would like him to clarify what he said.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chrétien (Frontenac):</B> Madam Speaker, I find the 
comments by my distinguished colleague from St. Boniface very 
pertinent. But before talking about environmental assessment and 
the construction of entrances, fences, and drainage culverts in 
farmland, I would like to get back to yesterday's election results, 
since he raised the question.
<P>
	Last night on CBC, my dear colleague from St. Boniface also 
probably watched a special two-hour  program on the state of the 
nation. Did he look at the poll results on voters' intentions at the 
federal level? His party would get 50 per cent of the votes across 
Canada, but only 35 per cent in Quebec, less than what it got in 
1993. The Bloc Quebecois would get 53 per cent, or 4 points more 
than in 1993. What is going on? I do not want to be called a racist, 
but he knows where his party's strength is in Quebec. In 
francophone ridings, it gets walloped.
<P>
	Look at what happened in the riding of Lac-Saint-Jean with a 
22-year old candidate. Whether you like it or not, Madam Speaker, 
he is going to be the youngest member in this House. He got 76 per 
cent of the votes. It is a lot more than your leader in the riding of 
Saint-Maurice where he got a mere 54 per cent, in spite of his 
joining forces with the Conservatives.
<P>
	Just yesterday, a liberal member who worked tirelessly in the 
riding of Lac-Saint-Jean told me: ``Of course, we do not expect to 
win, but it will be a good indication. Watch the results in 
Lac-Saint-Jean, the Liberal Party is going to shoot up''. It did not 
shoot up, it slipped on a banana peel.
<P>
	In Quebec, the Bloc Quebecois is working hard, with dignity and 
modesty. This is the reason why-
<P>
	<B>Mr. Duhamel:</B> I rise on a point of order, Madam Speaker.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chrétien (Frontenac):</B> He is wrong, Madam Speaker, do 
not listen to him.
<P>
	Madam Speaker, my colleague asked me a question on the 
election results, I am answering him.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Duhamel:</B> I rise on a point of order, Madam Speaker.
<P>
	I also asked two specific questions of my colleague who 
suggested that there was no need for an environmental assessment. 
He is wrong. But, of course, he does not want to talk about that, he 
wants-
<P>
<B>(1200)</B>
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Ringuette-Maltais):</B> That is not a 
point of order. The member for Frontenac has the floor.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chrétien (Frontenac):</B> Madam Speaker, you understood 
that I was about to get to that. But beforehand I wanted to tell my 
colleague from St. Boniface that we, from the Bloc Quebecois, are 
representing our province, our country, Quebec, in the best and 
most faithful way. That is why the opinion polls are so 
encouraging. I hope our standing will not drop.
<P>
	I invite the Reform Party to do a good job in showing opposition 
in this House. They could, as well, kick the Liberal Party out of the 
other provinces. In Quebec, we are taking care of it. We will take 
care of the Liberal Party in Quebec. Fairness, that is what 
Quebecers want.  They are frustrated by unfair treatments and have 
a hard time forgetting them.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1224"> 1224 </A></B>
<P>
	My hon. colleague seems to have misinterpreted Bill C-14. 
Maybe it is not the same in English and in French. Personally, I 
read the French version, and it clearly says that railway companies 
have no obligation to maintain crossings, make fences or install 
drainage culverts under the railway once is constructed.
<P>
	I remind the member for St. Boniface that, as mayor of my 
village, Garthby, I had to negotiate with Quebec Central Railway. I 
reread Bill C-111, which became C-101, which became C-14, and 
that is how I discovered this shortcoming.
<P>
	My colleague, the member for St. Boniface, should read 
carefully the legislation, perhaps in both languages, because the 
translation often leaves little shortcomings that can change the 
interpretation.
<P>
	I conclude rapidly on the issue of environmental assessment. For 
your party, the past is no guarantee for the future. Take the <I>Irving 
Whale</I> for example. Early next September it will have been sitting 
on the ocean floor for 26 years, rusting away and leaking 
contaminated oil. We spent over $20 million last year, the 
government organizing three so-called environmental public 
consultation sessions to end up with nothing, absolutely nothing. 
We will start all over again this year.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ron MacDonald (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister 
for International Trade, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, this is a very 
important piece of legislation, one that has had its roots way back 
in the first session of this Parliament and perhaps even further back 
than that.
<P>
	For years the country has debated the future role of its 
transportation sector generally and quite clearly since the 
mid-1980s, 1986 or 1987, the future of rail. As everyone knows, it 
was on the promise of access to markets by way of rail that was one 
of the most compelling reasons the colonies, upper and lower 
Canada and the maritime provinces, came together and formed 
Confederation.
<P>
	The debate may go on for a long time as to whether that ribbon of 
steal was actually a cause for the expansion of the economy like we 
wished to see in the Atlantic provinces, but I will not argue that 
today. I am sure my comments have been heard in that regard in 
other debates in the past.
<P>
	Suffice it to say one of the things that has happened in the last 
number of years is that we are no longer dealing with a domestic 
market in the transportation sector which we can protect. 
Protectionism has gone the way of the dodo bird. In the last dozen 
years we have seen an explosion of competitiveness.
<P>
<B>(1205 )</B>
<P>
	Canadian businesses have had to become more competitive. It 
does not matter which sector we are dealing with. We have had the 
free trade agreement, we have had the NAFTA, we have had the 
GATT. There have been agreements under TRIP on intellectual 
property. Every country that seeks to expand its economy has had 
to look outward.
<P>
	The transportation sector is really no different. In the past we 
have hung our hat on public interest and public policy in order to 
protect these industries. There were so many regulations dealing 
with rail and air transportation that they would literally choke a 
stable of horses, not just one horse.
<P>
	Clearly one of the things this government and the previous 
government, to give it a little credit, saw was there had to be a 
reduction in the regulatory burden in the transportation sector.
<P>
	In 1987 when the government came out with the new National 
Transportation Act there was great debate about whether when we 
deal with rail line abandonment or rail line sale the argument would 
still be made that a line should be kept because it was in the public 
interest. I have debated that with myself and with others over the 
last number of years, in particular since I was elected to the House 
of Commons in 1988. One of the concerns I have had is that we still 
are able to maintain a national rail line from coast to coast.
<P>
	One of the problems we have had, however, in the rail line is that 
both lines, Canadian National, a crown corporation recently 
privatized, and Canadian Pacific, were not as competitive as they 
had to be. One of the reasons they were not as competitive as they 
should have been is they had some protected markets.
<P>
	They had an onerous regulatory burden that in my view led to 
some industries' in Atlantic Canada being less competitive on the 
international market, in particular the U.S. market, than they had to 
be to maintain their market share, to do value add in their industrial 
sector and continue to employ Canadians.
<P>
	What has happened in the rail sector? Over the years we have 
seen both of our national rail lines, Canadian Pacific and Canadian 
National as a crown corporation, losing enormous amounts of 
money. It seems that when the economy goes into a cyclical 
downturn, and we can almost project when those things will 
happen, the bit of money made by these two very large and 
important companies during the good years is more than lost, many 
times over, in the bad years.
<P>
	Over the last number of years both of these companies in the bad 
times have lost over $4 billion. For Canadian National Railroad, 
which was a crown corporation, the Government of Canada 
repeatedly has had to recapitalize that business.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1225"> 1225 </A></B>
<P>
	When we came into power we said we had to have a national 
rail system. I come from a part of the country where a national 
rail system is essential. It has been there for many years. 
Unfortunately that national rail system has not allowed my part 
of the world to be as competitive with its industries as it should 
be.
<P>
	Perhaps it is because both those large railroads, Canadian 
National and Canadian Pacific, when they were covered and 
wrapped in the warmth of burdensome regulations which protected 
both of their markets for that sector of the transportation business 
did not allow my part of the world to be as competitive as it should 
be.
<P>
	A few years ago when I was in opposition I was fortunate enough 
to visit Hamburg. I visited with some interests promoting rail lines, 
both CP and CN. The thing that absolutely astonished me was when 
I looked on the wall of the office there was an ad from Canadian 
National: ``Canadian National, serving Canada from Montreal to 
Vancouver''. Somebody had forgotten to tell them there was 
another part of Canada, the closest part of Canada to Europe, 
Atlantic Canada.
<P>
	The rail line at that point was still in place from Sydney to 
Montreal and somebody had forgotten to market the line. CN, it 
might be argued, in the past had selectively and intentionally 
demarketed the line from Montreal east.
<P>
	Then this bill came in. In the past session of Parliament it had a 
different number. In this session it is Bill C-14. I was fortunate 
enough to sit on the privatization task force of CN, 
commercialization as we called it at the time. One of the things we 
heard over and over again when we spoke to shippers, when we 
spoke to provincial ministers, provincial governments and 
municipalities is that if rail is to continue to have relevance two 
things had to be done.
<P>
	First, we had to recognize that rail in Canada could no longer be 
protected from outside forces, in particular the United States. Rail 
in the United States had undergone a renaissance. It had by and 
large been privatized. It had gone through shrinking and now is in 
an expansion mode.
<P>
<B>(1210)</B>
<P>
	It had been recapitalized primarily by the private sector and was 
competing on a daily basis through its connections with U.S. ports, 
particularly on the east coast but also on the west coast around 
Seattle and on the south Pacific coast around San Diego for 
Canadian bound traffic.
<P>
	If the Canadian transportation sector in rail was to remain 
competitive, something had to change. CN again last year had a 
good year, it made some money, but that has not been the recent 
history of CN. It was clear to me that within a very short period of 
time, if it was still a crown corporation, CN would have to dip back 
into taxpayer pockets and would have to be recapitalized.
<P>
	Quite clearly the government does not have the funds to do that. 
Members from all sides, particularly from the Reform Party, like to 
tell us all the time we have to accelerate our withdrawal from 
certain areas the government has traditionally supported. We have 
to leave it up to market forces. I believe that has to be the case.
<P>
	The change in the regulatory burden the bill sets is important. 
When dealing with some aspects of rail line abandonment or 
conveyance in the past under the old bill there were over 200 
different types of initiatives needing government approval. The 
new bill drops it to 40 or 50, in that area.
<P>
	Reducing the regulatory burden means companies that are 
regulated will be more efficient. More than that, by putting this bill 
into place and by reducing the regulatory burden, by making it 
easier for short lines to be established in Canada, we should be able 
to reduce the overall cost of rail transportation. We should be able 
to make businesses that rely on rail transportation more 
competitive.
<P>
	I come from a part of the world, around Atlantic Canada, 
Halifax, which has a brilliant future. In Atlantic Canada our future, 
particularly in Nova Scotia, will be based on our ability to trade. It 
will be based on our ability to very quickly let go of industries 
which are no longer competitive, which have had to rely for far too 
long on government support to maintain the jobs.
<P>
	We have to find out what we can do best in a place like Halifax. 
In Halifax the thing we will do best is trade. Before Confederation 
Atlantic Canada and her ports were among the busiest in the new 
world. They were busy because we traded. That is why we were 
there. We had the best port in the world, the port of Halifax. It does 
not require icebreaking or dredging, but in order to get to its 
markets it requires a rail line and a road transportation system.
<P>
	Provincial governments work on their road transportation 
systems. There have been many announcements in New 
Brunswick. The premier announced in the last year over $350 
million in highway construction.
<P>
	In Atlantic Canada, in Nova Scotia, we have had to refocus our 
efforts on what we do best, utilizing our location. In real estate they 
say the most important thing is location, location, location. At the 
port of Halifax location is our most important asset. We are the 
closest ice free port to the huge European market. We have a skilled 
workforce. We have plenty of industrial land. We have a reasonable 
taxation regime; it is not an onerous burden.
<P>
	Nova Scotia is the only province that does not charge provincial 
tax on diesel fuel used in rail. In Nova Scotia we are trying to 
refocus.
<P>
	When the privatization of CN first came to the task force, I admit 
I had grave concerns. I still have some  concerns. CN had to be 
privatized. CN had to rely on market forces and it has to be as 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1226"> 1226 </A></B>
<P>
competitive as it could be to keep the business it has to keep for its 
new shareholders.
<P>
	Privatizing CN also meant that CP, its main competitor in 
Canada, had to become more competitive. Those two rail lines 
becoming more competitive with each other also means they will 
be more competitive with other modes of transportation and other 
rail lines which are capturing Canadian bound traffic through U.S. 
ports and running over U.S. rail lines.
<P>
	Deregulation had to take place. We had to take that onerous 
burden off both those rail lines. This bill seeks to address some of 
the concerns of an onerous regulatory burden. I have watched what 
CP has done in Canada. I am not going to criticize it but CP has 
made a very strategic decision to abandon its eastern Canadian 
operations. It had a rail line that went into the port of Saint John. 
That rail link was essential to the port generating the net revenue 
and the jobs it had done in the past. The port of Saint John is not 
doing the business it had been doing when CP still had a rail line.
<P>
<B>(1215)</B>
<P>
	CP made a decision that it was going to go through a U.S. port of 
call. It bought the D and H rail line down through the United States. 
One of the states had given it $5 million, $10 million or $15 million 
to upgrade it but CP made a strategic business decision to abandon 
the line in maritime Canada. I have a concern that CN Rail will 
make the same business decision.
<P>
	Clearly I would have liked to have seen in this legislation a 
requirement that under a privatized CN Rail for a specific period of 
time, be it three years or five years, the newly privatized 
corporation would not be able to abandon the line. If it did abandon 
the line, that line would have to come back to the federal 
government and the responsibility would lie with the federal 
government. Why did I think that was important during the task 
force deliberation? It was important for two reasons.
<P>
	First I know we can compete in Atlantic Canada. The port of 
Halifax will be able to generate the new revenue, the new traffic 
required but I know it is going to take a little bit of time. It is not 
going to happen overnight nor is it going to turn on a dime, it is 
going to take some time.
<P>
	My concern then and what still concerns me is that over a period 
of time, over the first two or three years with a privatized company 
with CN, decisions will be made which may not be similar to the 
decisions CP made and would put the very existence of that rail line 
in doubt.
<P>
	I do not think we need special treatment in Atlantic Canada. We 
have to pull ourselves up by our own bootstraps and we can do that. 
The port of Halifax is experiencing a growth in traffic, not because 
of  government subsidy, but because we have the best darn location 
to be found on the eastern seaboard of North America for that type 
of business.
<P>
	Second we are going to succeed down there because increasingly 
as we get more trade from Europe and as post-Panamax vessels 
start plying Atlantic waters as they are currently doing in Pacific 
waters, there are very few ports on the eastern seaboard of North 
America that can handle those vessels. Halifax can handle those 
vessels.
<P>
	We have reduced our costs of operating the port of Halifax. My 
government has come in with a marine transportation policy which 
will have a local port authority established, something I have 
begged the previous government for. The member for Thunder Bay 
knows that from the past Parliament. I said to let us do what we can 
do best, let us compete.
<P>
	My port has said that on port fees it is prepared to have user pay 
as long as it is reasonable, transparent and that the government 
provides its service that it is paying for as cost competitively as 
possible.
<P>
	I look with a great deal of optimism on the future of rail in 
Atlantic Canada but those concerns I have just expressed are ones I 
will continue to be very vigilant about. If I do see that the recently 
privatized Canadian National starts talking about making decisions 
similar to what CP has made which would jeopardize the main rail 
line from Halifax to Montreal, I give a guarantee to my constituents 
and I give notice to my government. I will be the first on my feet in 
this place and any other public forum to make sure that the 
privatization of CN, along with the very good provisions of Bill 
C-14 which have reduced the owners regulations, are not used by a 
newly privatized company, CN.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hermanson:</B> You will have zero impact. You will be a big 
zero.
<P>
	<B>Mr. MacDonald:</B> The big zero is on the other side and perhaps 
he can ask the question when I am finished my speech.
<P>
	Somewhere you have to have a little faith. This issue has been 
one where it has been difficult for me to put faith in a large 
privatized corporation.
<P>
	Over the last number of years, as we all change when we are 
exposed to new things, I have changed a great deal. When I started 
in politics in 1988 I really believed that government had a large 
role to play in my economy in Atlantic Canada than what I do 
believe today. I know that governments in the past through 
protectionism, through regulation, through transfers, through 
regional development programs and policies have tried to do 
something to create economic growth but by and large they have 
failed.
<P>
<B>(1220)</B>
<P>
	In places like Atlantic Canada far too often we see the wonderful 
entrepreneurial spirit which built that part of  the country over 
hundreds of years crushed because of inappropriate government 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1227"> 1227 </A></B>
<P>
supports and transfers. Clearly, the people in my part of the world, 
my sons, daughters and family want to be able to work and live in 
Atlantic Canada. In order to do that public modes of transportation, 
all modes, be they rail, road or air, must be as competitive as 
possible. As a government or a Parliament we may think we can 
protect those industries, but we cannot protect them from the 
competition from south of the border and competition which is now 
upon us from all over the world.
<P>
	I know we can succeed in Atlantic Canada. This bill is a step in 
the right direction. The reduction of regulation and the 
privatization of CN both will inevitably lead to a more competitive 
CP. The recently constructed Sarnia tunnel means we will be able 
to attract a volume of traffic necessary from the Chicago markets to 
come in through Halifax instead of Baltimore and New York and 
thus create jobs in Halifax and along the Canadian line down into 
the Chicago markets. In order to do that we must increase our 
volume so that we will have full train loads leaving Halifax and 
going straight to the yards in Chicago.
<P>
	We have some way to go, but I am absolutely confident that 
those who are responsible for public policy and those responsible 
for the entrepreneurial zeal in Atlantic Canada will seize the 
opportunity and CN will see the rail line from Halifax to Montreal 
as an important profit centre, not as a cost centre.
<P>
	With the advent of things such as short line operations, because 
the bill allows for easier establishment of short line operations than 
did past legislation, it will ensure that there is a competitive rail 
link. A rail link is absolutely essential to the economy of places like 
the port of Halifax.
<P>
	Nearly $400 million a year in annual net revenue is generated in 
a city of 320,000 people by the fact that container traffic and bulk 
cargo comes into our port. It is not for distribution to local markets 
but serves central Canadian and northeastern and central U.S. 
markets.
<P>
	In the tough times of the recession we did not shrivel up and die. 
CN was not competitive. Rates were too high because of regulatory 
burden. We have succeeded in the tough times. In the good times 
that are to come through expanding trade this type of legislation 
will assist my part of the country to take its rightful place as an 
entry and exit point to the North American market. Maybe the bill 
will go a long way to establishing a dream worth pursuing, the 
establishment of the port of Halifax as the NAFTA port north.
<P>
	I support the bill with some reservations. However, I will be 
vigilant during the years ahead to make sure that this newly 
privatized company does not abuse the new regulations it has been 
given, but that they are used to ensure that the line between Halifax 
and Montreal is as competitive as possible.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Gouk (Kootenay West-Revelstoke, Ref.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I would like to ask one question dealing with the hon. 
member's concerns he expressed at length about the CN rail line 
from Montreal to Halifax.
<P>
	I do not know if the hon. member heard my speech this morning 
when I talked about my concerns. The people of Halifax came to 
the committee first on Bill C-89, the CN privatization and later on 
Bill C-101, the new Canada Transportation Act. They asked, 
begged and implored the committee and Parliament to offer some 
guarantee of continuance for a period of time for the reasons the 
member stated, so that the line would not disappear before the 
post-Panamax traffic was in place.
<P>
	They wanted assurance for investors that they could invest in the 
newly privatized or commercialized Halifax port which does not 
get government support for these loans. I have no problem with that 
and they did not either, but they said to at least give them the tools 
to develop their financial self-sustaining characteristics. This is 
something which will not take traffic away from interior ports such 
as Montreal or the lakehead because post-Panamax freighters 
cannot and will not go up the St. Lawrence. They either go to 
Halifax or they go to the United States. Those are the two choices.
<P>
<B>(1225)</B>
<P>
	I talked to the president of CN Rail. I asked him if it would be a 
hardship for him if this was put in. His response was that it would 
not be.
<P>
	What the hon. member should know is that the Bloc Quebecois 
has a private member's motion coming up on April 19 or 
thereabouts, because CN is not living up to its responsibilities to 
repair and rebuild the bridge which links the north shore to the 
south shore. If CN does not do that, if it is allowed to let it run 
down to the point where it is no longer practical to run it, that rail 
line will be gone.
<P>
	We proposed in Bill C-89 on behalf of the member's people in 
Halifax that there be a 10 year continuance. That is what they asked 
for. The Liberals shot it down.
<P>
	They asked for it again when Bill C-101 was in committee. They 
said: ``We have cut our plea to the minimum. We can live with five 
years. We would like to have 10, but we can live with five. Please 
give us the five years we need''. I reiterate, it is at no cost to 
anyone. It is not a cost to the internal ports of Canada. It will not 
take business away from them. It is not a cost to CN Rail. The 
president of CN Rail said it would not be a problem. I introduced 
this as Motion No. 38 which was voted down by the Liberal 
government.
<P>
	The hon. member said that he would rise after the fact and speak 
on behalf of Halifax. It is too late. He either speaks now or 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1228"> 1228 </A></B>
<P>
whatever benefit this may have brought Halifax will be gone. No 
matter what he says, it will be gone. He should know that one 
backbencher rising in Parliament after the fact will not make a 
difference. He  should have been there when we were trying to put 
this through for Atlantic Canada.
<P>
	Is the hon. member categorically stating that the Liberal 
government made a mistake in not passing Motion No. 38 which 
would have allowed that five years of continuance at no cost to 
anyone? Is he prepared to stand in the House today to say that he 
supports the motion now, even though it has already been defeated, 
against the position of the Liberal government which has turned its 
back on Atlantic Canada?
<P>
	<B>Mr. MacDonald:</B> Madam Speaker, we have been listening to a 
speech from a Reform member whose party has been basically shut 
out in Atlantic Canada because of its harsh slash and burn policies 
toward regional development. It wants to privatize everything that 
walks, moves and crawls, yet the hon. member suddenly rises and 
pretends he has the interests of the people of Halifax at heart.
<P>
	I do not need to take lessons from him or from anyone else in the 
Reform Party with respect to looking after the interests of Atlantic 
Canada. In the last Parliament 48 sets of questions were asked of 
the Tory ministers of transportation with respect to the 
competitiveness of the port of Halifax. Those questions came from 
the member of Parliament for Dartmouth. There were probably just 
as many questions asked by the member of Parliament for Halifax 
in the last Parliament.
<P>
	In this Parliament it was the member of Parliament for 
Dartmouth who visited the Minister of Finance on a number of 
occasions to seek changes to the Customs Act and the Income Tax 
Act which would allow a port such as the port of Halifax to become 
a de facto duty free, value added trade centre.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hermanson:</B> You are avoiding the question. You do not 
have the courage to answer the question.
<P>
	<B>Mr. MacDonald:</B> If the member wants to talk about courage, I 
will talk about courage. The courage is that in the past I have stood 
in my place here, in my place in my riding and in my place in my 
caucus and I have never been afraid to speak up for the people in 
my area. I have done something which members opposite have not 
done. I have been able to impact in a positive way public policy for 
the benefit of the people who live in Atlantic Canada.
<P>
	We need no lessons from the Reform Party. The Reform Party, in 
the last few weeks of the campaign in Labrador, suddenly found out 
that Labrador existed. The Reform Party gets up every day in the 
House to talk about cutting social transfers to the poorest 
provinces. However, when it is on the election campaign in 
Labrador it talks about paving the Labrador highway at a cost of 
$1.1 billion. We need no lessons on this side of the House from 
those members opposite.
<P>
	As the member of Parliament for Dartmouth, I raised with the 
task force on a number of occasions my concern that the rail line 
should be protected. I still had the concern that rail line should be 
protected.
<P>
<B>(1230)</B>
<P>
	Unlike members on the other side who do not think their voices 
count in this place, I happen to think the voices on this side are 
listened to by the front benches. I have received commitments not 
just from the front benches but from people like Mr. Tellier, the 
president of Canadian National. If we go back to the committee 
record, when he was asked the question he said that CN had no 
problem with the continuation of the rail line because CN was not 
going to abandon the investments it had made in Atlantic Canada, 
that it saw Atlantic Canada as a future profit centre for the 
operation.
<P>
	To answer my hon. colleague's question of whether I give my 
unequivocal support, no I do not. Am I concerned about a 
privatized company, whichever it is, coming forward and changing 
its corporate direction? Yes, I am. However, am I confident that a 
rail line from Halifax to Montreal will be maintained as a viable 
entity, either as part of the main line or part of a short line, which I 
would support although I do not know if the hon. member would? I 
am confident that will continue because business goes where there 
is opportunity. There is no greater place in the transportation sector 
in Canada for new opportunities than there is at the port of Halifax.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Elwin Hermanson (Kindersley-Lloydminster, Ref.):</B> 
Madam Speaker, I will ask a brief question of the member for 
Dartmouth.
<P>
	He began his speech by talking about a new trading agreement. 
He talked about NAFTA, GATT and the like. I remember before the 
1988 election when the Liberals were fighting the NAFTA 
agreement, they had advertisements in which they erased the 
boundary between Canada and United States. Now he has the gall 
to stand up in the House and support NAFTA, saying how 
wonderful it is. That is a big flip-flop on the part of the Liberals.
<P>
	The transportation act we are dealing with, Bill C-14 replaces the 
old WGTA. The minister of agriculture stated as late as November 
1994 that the Crow benefit was going to remain intact, that he had 
no intention of abolishing it. Three months later, in the 1995 
budget, the Crow benefit was gone, another big Liberal flip-flop.
<P>
	The member is praising the privatization of CN. Reformers have 
always been on the record as favouring privatization where the 
private sector can do a better job than the public sector. History is 
proving that position is right. I would like to remind the hon. 
member that his party's position was the opposite. It said that 
privatizing CN was despicable. I believe those were the words 
Liberals used. Now he is praising the privatization of CN. That is 
the third flip-flop.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1229"> 1229 </A></B>
<P>
	The fourth flip-flop is that he said there should be a guarantee 
that the CN line remain between Montreal and Halifax. This 
member is from Dartmouth. He should have the interests of his 
constituents in mind, yet he is not supporting Motion No. 38 put 
forward by the member for Kootenay West-Revelstoke, a motion 
that would have put that in the legislation.
<P>
	My question is really simple. Why should we believe anything a 
Liberal says?
<P>
	<B>Mr. MacDonald:</B> It is unfortunate Reform Party members do 
not know whether they are punched or bored, which is part of their 
problem. The Reform Party opposite cannot believe for a second 
that the actions of the government have led to unprecedented 
popularity and support for our policies.
<P>
	In Atlantic Canada, including Nova Scotia, the place Reformers 
are so concerned about in terms of transportation policy, the people 
are so certain they have made the right decision, in the latest public 
opinion polls 74 per cent said that they would continue to support 
initiatives like this and the privatization of CN because they know 
these initiatives mean economic growth and jobs in Atlantic 
Canada.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Elwin Hermanson (Kindersley-Lloydminster, Ref.):</B> 
Madam Speaker, thank you for the opportunity to speak to Bill 
C-14. I hope I remember to call it Bill C-14. This bill had another 
title in the last session, Bill C-101. It is one of the bills the 
government brought back at its original stage. I talked about 
flip-flops earlier. The reinstatement of bills is another Liberal 
flip-flop. They said it was an abhorrent practice while in opposition 
yet they have followed that same practice themselves.
<P>
	It is rather amazing we are already at the third reading debate of 
Bill C-14 on this Tuesday morning. I left on Thursday and was back 
in my riding over the weekend to attend to commitments. There 
were no sign that Bill C-14 would come up for debate. However, 
the government suddenly decided to slip it on to the Order Paper on 
Thursday and the House was doing report stage on Friday and 
Monday. One has to wonder about the motivation of the Liberal 
government in bringing this bill in around a weekend and trying to 
move it quickly through the House. I believe there is a little bit of 
mischief involved in the scheduling of Bill C-14.
<P>
<B>(1235)</B>
<P>
	What I will be talking about is primarily the rail transportation 
component of Bill C-14, although the bill is broader. I would like to 
bring to the attention of the House, and particularly to the attention 
of Liberal members, the market difference between rail 
transportation and other modes of transportation.
<P>
	The best illustration that I can offer is the difference between rail 
and air transportation. When I want to fly home to Saskatchewan I 
go to the airport where I have access to more than one airline. I can 
decide what time I  want to fly and which airline to use, based on 
the schedules and services they provide. Madam Speaker, when 
you want to fly back to New Brunswick you have some of the same 
opportunities. I suggest that when the Minister of Transport flies 
back to his riding in Victoria he also has a choice of airlines and 
times that he can fly. The same is true of the minister of agriculture 
when he flies back to Regina.
<P>
	My constituents and thousands of prairie producers in the grain 
growing region of Canada are dependent on transportation for their 
very livelihood. However, they do not have the same options and 
opportunities as the Minister of Transport, the minister of 
agriculture or even you and I have, Madam Speaker, as to how we 
are going to get from here back to our ridings.
<P>
	Prairie producers have to ship their commodity, primarily grain, 
through rail as it is the only commercially feasible means of 
transportation that they have. They are captive to two railways and 
at most times one railway. They have no opportunity to take their 
commodity down to the station to decide on which rail line they 
want to ship their products. That puts them in a category which is 
classified as being captive shippers.
<P>
	It creates real problems for the industry if there is not legislation 
in place that ensures balance and fairness when disputes arise 
between the shipper and the transporter of these goods.
<P>
	A couple of clauses in Bill C-14 are particularly obnoxious to 
shippers, primarily in the prairies but also right across the country. 
The most odious of these clauses in the bill are subclauses 27(2) 
and 27(3). The other clause that has caused a great deal of 
consternation is clause 112.
<P>
	If it was just myself who was standing here and complaining 
about these clauses, perhaps members might question whether or 
not the concern was a significant factor. However, group after 
group appeared before the transport committee and talked about the 
inadequacies of Bill C-14 and particularly the clauses that I 
mentioned.
<P>
	A number of shippers appeared before the committee. I have a 
partial list of those shippers which is a who's who of the shipping 
industry and farm organizations across the country. I am going to 
list a group of organizations which has stated their public concern 
or opposition to subclauses 27(2) and 27(3).
<P>
	They include the Alberta Wheat Pool, the Saskatchewan Wheat 
Pool, the Manitoba Pool Elevators, the United Grain Growers, the 
Canadian Wheat Board, the Pioneer Grain Company, Cargill, the 
Western Canadian Shippers Coalition, the Canadian Dehydrators 
Association, the Canadian Fertilizer Institute, the Western Grain 
Elevator Association, the Canadian Federation of Agriculture, the 
Saskatchewan Association of Rural Municipalities, the National 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1230"> 1230 </A></B>
<P>
Farmers Union, Southern Rails Co-operative, the Canadian 
Chemical  Producers Association, the Atlantic Provinces 
Transportation Committee, the Ontario Ministry of Transportation, 
the Chamber of Maritime Commerce, Wabush Mines, Great 
Western Rural Development Corporation, Novacor Chemicals 
Limited, Luscar Ltd., Stelco. The list is longer but this is a who's 
who of shippers in Canada that have expressed opposition to 
subclauses 27(2) and 27(3) of Bill C-14.
<P>
<B>(1240 )</B>
<P>
	The shippers hoped they would have an opportunity to see the 
bill amended. They wanted to see clause 27 deleted from the bill. 
They asked the government to do that. The former Minister of 
Transport and the Liberal members on the committee refused, in 
spite of an overwhelming cry from people against this clause in the 
bill.
<P>
	There was a cabinet shuffle and a new session of Parliament 
started after the Christmas holidays and the new year break. Hope 
was rekindled in the hearts of many farmers in western Canada and 
many shippers across the country that perhaps with this change of 
leadership in the Department of Transport, new members on the 
transport committee and time for the government to digest all of 
the opposition to Bill C-101, which became Bill C-14, that it might 
change its attitude and become more concerned about some very 
real problems that occurred with the bill.
<P>
	Many people had an opportunity to contact the new minister and 
ask him, a western Canadian minister, to reconsider Bill C-14. As 
the member for Kindersley-Lloydminister on behalf of my 
constituents I wrote a letter to the minister on February 8. 
Unfortunately the minister has not even seen fit to answer my 
letter. I have not received a response even though it was written a 
month and a half ago. There seems to be no concern on the part of 
Liberal ministers to whether they answer their mail.
<P>
	In my letter I stated: ``A number of farmers in the livestock 
industry in British Columbia have expressed some concern over 
legislation initiated by the previous Minister of Transport. Under 
Bill C-101'', and that is the number of the old bill, ``grain destined 
for export would be under a freight rate cap, whereas freight rates 
for grain intended for domestic use in British Columbia would not 
be capped. It has been suggested that rail rates to the lower 
mainland of British Columbia for grain would be approximately 
$10 a tonne higher than grain destined for the export market. The 
livestock industry feels that the $10 a tonne price difference will 
have a detrimental impact on farmers facing increased costs.
<P>
	``As well, there is some concern by prairie producers that a 
two-tiered freight rate may instigate allegations from outside our 
borders that the lower rate is a subsidy unacceptable under GATT. 
A further concern expressed in no uncertain terms by shippers and 
producers of goods shipped by rail was a strong opposition to 
clause 27(2) of  Bill C-101. It was argued that this clause provided 
the railway with an unfair advantage when challenged by shippers 
over unfair, insufficient or overpriced service. This factor is 
extremely important to shippers of prairie grain who are captive to 
the railroads.
<P>
	``With that said, the Prime Minister's decision to prorogue 
Parliament has resulted in Bill C-101 dying on the Order Paper. If 
you intend to reintroduce similar legislation in the new session of 
Parliament, I would call on you to make the necessary changes to 
alleviate the discrepancy in freight rates and remove clause 27(2) 
from the bill''.
<P>
	I felt that this would be just one more letter that would perhaps 
tip the scales in favour of the shippers to provide more neutral 
legislation, better legislation for the Canadian economy but the 
minister did not even have the good sense to answer my letter.
<P>
	Mine was not the only letter. Other letters went out from 
shippers asking the minister to take this opportunity to reconsider 
the bill. In fact, the minister said: ``Come and talk to me. I am open 
to changing the bill. There is a good chance that we will change 
some of the more reprehensible clauses in the bill''.
<P>
	A number of shippers came to Ottawa and met with the new 
Minister of Transport. They were very disappointed in the results 
of that meeting. I have a copy of a letter written to the minister by 
Mr. Alex Graham, president of the Alberta Wheat Pool. He is also 
the chairman of Prince Rupert Grain and Pacific Terminals:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The competitive access provisions provided in the legislation include the 
right of shippers to obtain a ruling from the Canadian Transportation Agency on 
rates or service, where the shipper has access to only one railway. As we said 
during our meeting, subsections 27(2) and (3) inject subjective language into 
the agency's decision-making process.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Our legal counsel advises us that any time subjective language is placed in 
legislation, it results in legal challenges to define the language. We have been 
told that the legislative requirement for the agency to be satisfied that the 
shipper will suffer ``substantial commercial harm'' could result in as many legal 
actions as there are negotiations with the railways.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Mr. Minister, during our meeting, and for the first time since this debate 
began, we were optimistic that our message was actually being received by the 
government. We were encouraged by your stated commitment to investigate 
fully our claims that these sections will result in increased litigation around 
applications to the Canadian Transportation Agency, and to take action if you 
found the claims to be valid.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>However, as report stage debate began in the House of Commons this 
morning, without any indication of additional amendments to address our 
concerns, it appears that there was really no intention to address them in the first 
place.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>As we said in our meeting, subsections 27(2) and (3) fly totally in the face of 
the intent of Bill C-14, which was to create a more commercial transportation 
environment, and to facilitate direct commercial negotiations on rates and

<BLOCKQUOTE>The government's approach to developing this legislation also flies in the face 
of its promise to enhance the ability of Canadian industry to compete on world 
markets. As has been pointed out on many occasions, all of the major shippers in 
Canada called for the removal of subsections 27(2) and (3), citing the disastrous 
effects these subsections will have on their ability to negotiate with carriers, and to 
remain competitive. They were supported by four provincial governments, and by 
a number of industry and municipal associations. We are perplexed and disturbed 
that the government chose not to respond positively to this overwhelming 
consensus.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>As long as this bill is before the House of Commons, Mr. Minister, you have 
the opportunity to make it right. In the interests of Canada's shippers, and the 
Canadian economy, we urge you to do so by removing subsections 27(2) and (3) 
or at least refer it back to the Standing Committee on Transport for specific and 
narrow examination before we all suffer the consequences.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
	That is a strongly worded letter from a respected person in the 
grains industry, someone whose constituency's livelihood depends 
on its ability to ship products at a fair price from the prairie region 
to port.
<P>
	I also have a news release issued by United Grain Growers. It 
strongly condemns the government for the way it handled Bill C-14 
with its heavy handed approach to saying it is interested in making 
some changes to the bill to make it more balanced as it relates to 
both shippers and the railroads, and then throwing dirt in its face, 
more or less, by slamming the door and saying it will not submit 
this bill to any changes whatsoever.
<P>
	The government is ramming it through at report stage without 
considering any of the good amendments put forward, several by 
my colleague, the member for Kootenay West-Revelstoke, and by 
other members, which would have made the bill far more 
acceptable to the shippers.
<P>
	To help us realize how important this is, the rail transportation 
sector, particularly in the prairies, used to be governed by the 
Western Grain Transportation Act, the WGTA. This legislation was 
considered to be shipper friendly. That is one reason the 
government brought in legislation that tipped the balance to being 
railway friendly, Bill C-14.
<P>
	Under the Western Grain Transportation Act railways made their 
profits, guess where, shipping western grain. Here we had a piece 
of legislation that was shipper friendly and yet it was the shipping 
of prairie grain that was regulated under the act which provided the 
railways, CP and CN, with some of their largest profits.
<P>
	It boggles my mind to think how we could tip the scales in 
favour of the railways and introduce and pass railway friendly 
legislation to allow the railways not only to make more money but 
to hold a hammer over the industry in such an unfair manner. For 
the Liberal government to be so unconcerned about that is beyond 
belief.
<P>
	The people who presented the briefs to the transport committee, 
the many delegations that came as witnesses, must be shaking their 
heads. I read the list of the organizations that made submissions to 
the transport committee and said they had very grave concerns with 
this bill.
<P>
	They must wonder why they bothered coming to Ottawa. There 
was clear consensus that there needed to be changes to this bill. 
This is one of the most clear indications of concern in a bill that I 
have seen since I have been here after first being elected to the 
House in 1993.
<P>
<B>(1250 )</B>
<P>
	I have never seen such a strong, united effort on the part of the 
grains industry. One criticism of the industry is that it never gets its 
act together. One group will tell Ottawa it must do this, and the next 
group will say no, it has to go in the other direction. This did not 
happen in this case.
<P>
	The groups that appeared for the transport committee were 
almost united in the their condemnation of clause 27(2) and clause 
112. Yet the government chose to ignore them. It did not seem to 
care. Perhaps adding 5 cents more in value to CN shares it was 
selling was more important than the entire western grains industry; 
not only western grain but potash, iron ore and coal.
<P>
	We have talked a lot about Atlantic Canada. Some Liberals from 
Atlantic Canada who just toed the party line as they had been told 
have asked why we suddenly have an interest in Atlantic Canada. 
One group that appeared before the committee was Wabash Mines 
from Labrador. It told us the bill was flawed and needed to be 
changed. It was not only western Canadians who were concerned; 
the concern came from across the country.
<P>
	Did the members who serve that part of the country speak on 
behalf of the livelihood of their constituents, the job creators in 
their constituencies? No, they were silent. They let the flawed 
legislation progress and did not even speak against it. This is truly 
unfortunate.
<P>
	Now we are at third reading. This is our final chance to debate 
Bill C-14. It cannot be amended in any substantive way. We can no 
longer delete clauses. We have gone past that stage. It is very sad to 
realize that so many people were opposed to a piece of legislation 
and the government would not budge. In the past significant 
concessions have usually been made when there was general 
opposition to a bill not only from members across the floor but 
from the public at large. However, in this case the government 
chose to have deaf ears and not hear what Canadians were saying.
<P>
	This is extremely unfortunate. It means the bill will have to be 
changed in the future and it will be a lengthy process. I assure the 
House that there are members on this side listening to Canadians. 
We are taking notes and there will be a day of reckoning for the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1232"> 1232 </A></B>
<P>
arrogance of the  Liberals and their inability to hear the concerns of 
Canadians.
<P>
	I am thankful that through the democratic election process we 
will have a chance in the future to redress these wrongs.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ghislain Lebel (Chambly, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, this 
morning, I heard the minister praise Bill C-14, which is only Bill 
C-101 reinstated under that new name after the hearing in 
committee.
<P>
	The minister presented that bill as something totally new, 
something we could never hope for, something never yet 
submitted. The bill as such is not a bad one. I think we must be 
honest and, even if we are the opposition, admit that the minister 
meant well when he created what we will now call the Canadian 
Transportation Agency.
<P>
	But, we are conferring powers to that office and this is where the 
minister should have paid attention to the recommendations of the 
opposition. Members of the opposition, even if they are Quebecers 
and sovereignists, are well aware of the fact that rail transportation 
in Canada, as air and sea transportation, has a great impact on their 
daily lives.
<P>
	For example, the Reform member just spoke about mining 
companies owning private railways, such as the Wabush Mine and 
Iron Ore Company of Canada in Sept-Îles which also serves 
Labrador through the Quebec North Shore and Labrador Railway. 
So there are railways in Canada that will be affected by the 
provisions of the bill and by the regulations which will stem from 
it.
<P>
	On that point, the minister should have listened to members of 
both opposition parties who made recommendations, because the 
Reform members also raised serious objections just as the 
members of the official opposition did.
<P>
<B>(1255)</B>
<P>
	Since party line rules in these committees, none of the proposals 
of the official opposition, none of the some 35 motions that we 
introduced, were accepted. Yet, they would have improved the bill 
and the transport industry in Canada, whether it be rail, air or 
maritime transport.
<P>
	Personally, there is one thing I would like to tell the Minister of 
Transport. In the old days, last century, an independent colony had 
been set up because of the vastness of the country and, at the time, 
settlers were promised a dreamland, a country where remoteness, 
for example, would no longer be a problem.
<P>
	They wanted to build a country then. Therefore, those who 
agreed to go further north, farther into the cold or into difficult 
terrain, in areas barely accessible, were told that people in large 
urban areas like Montreal, long before Toronto, were going to help 
pay the additional costs incurred because of the vastness of the 
country.
<P>
	That view of things prevailed until recently, I would even say 
until today, but at least until 1987. Consequently people in remote 
areas knew that, despite everything, they would be in constant 
communication with the heart of the country, that is Montreal, 
Toronto or Ottawa, at a relatively reasonable cost. Of course, the 
real cost of operation was not fully reflected in what they paid since 
the community as a whole had chosen to assume a large part of 
these costs because people in remote areas were opening up new 
territories.
<P>
	We know that an east-west railway was a main concern of the 
British government which feared at that time that Americans would 
push into Canada, court the settlers, and try to create a huge 
American entity. That was the main concern of the British 
government.
<P>
	As you know, following the Halsbury Treaty of 1843, the British 
government had clearly defined borders between Canada and the 
United States. However, that border was contested especially in the 
west. American presidents who had expansionist views wanted 
their rights recognized, precisely at a time when the French 
speaking population-the friends of the hon. member for St. 
Boniface-was rebelling.
<P>
	Even then, the Fenians, Irishmen living in the United States, had 
extremely expansionist designs. They tried to convince the 
American president to push toward the west, toward the 
north-west. That is what prevailed during the establishment of our 
railway system, our railways and much later, of course, air 
transportation.
<P>
	Today this bill might be an attempt to achieve greater 
effectiveness. It is understandable that because of the globalization 
of markets-it is one of its effects-in order to be competitive we 
must-to put it rather inelegantly-``flush remote communities 
down the toilet'' because they cost too much. The cost of serving 
them is invariably or inevitably reflected in average administrative 
costs and our transportation costs are a little bit higher than those of 
our neighbours. This is reflected in our production costs and our 
products as well.
<P>
	It is probably in order to respond to market requirements under 
all kinds of treaties, dictates of trading in the year 2000, of modern 
trade, that the Canadian government, through this bill, is making a 
clean sweep of its past, completely denying the very rationale for 
our railway system.
<P>
<B>(1300)</B>
<P>
	I want to talk about the more legal aspect of the bill, because my 
colleagues, the hon. member in front of me and my friend from 
Blainville-Deux-Montagnes, have amply demonstrated the flaws 
in this bill. Without underestimating the seriousness of their 
judgments, which incidentally I agree with, I would like, neverthe-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1233"> 1233 </A></B>
<P>
less, to talk about the perhaps more regulatory or legislative aspect 
of the bill.
<P>
	The government is creating a commission or at least is 
transforming a commission that already existed with certain 
powers, giving it a new name. Then it says clearly in the bill that 
this agency will have the powers of a court. This is not bad in itself. 
In our parliamentary system, there are many agencies that have 
quasi-judicial powers. But, to reinforce these powers, the bill says 
that the agency's decisions may be approved by a superior court in 
a province, for example, the Superior Court of Quebec, the 
supreme courts of the maritime provinces, for instance, the 
Supreme Court of Nova Scotia, and the other Supreme Courts of 
British Columbia.
<P>
	So, the agency was given teeth, was given the power to use its 
teeth and also the power to regulate, to legislate, a delegated 
legislative power. Where I have something against this procedure, 
which tends to extend to almost all government services at the 
present time, is that, once the agencies are created, parliamentary 
control is non-existent. Parliament does not have control over its 
agency any more.
<P>
	The agency may edict regulations and determine whether they 
are appropriate or not. In short, an agency is asked to do the 
legislative work instead of the legislator. Within the bill, the 
minister still retains the power to intervene, perhaps in a slightly 
arbitrary manner, because he would not be called on to intervene by 
this House, but at his own discretion. He is the only judge of the 
appropriateness of the intervention; only he can decide whether the 
intervention is justified or not. He may, through the governor in 
council, make regulations or directions for the Canadian 
Transportation Agency, but without consulting the House in any 
way.
<P>
	This is where it becomes sad. When we look at this, after the 
bills that were introduced last session-I am thinking specifically 
of Bill C-62 on regulation, and also Bill C-84, which amended the 
Statutory Instruments Act-we see that the government is showing 
great single-mindedness. All it is trying to do at this point is to push 
aside those who were elected to think, to discuss, to develop, to set 
objectives. It is faster to push us aside, thus allowing them to move 
forward without being tripped up.
<P>
	Although this may sometimes be desirable, what will happen to 
Canada's railway system 15 or 20 years from now, for example? 
Even the minister would be unable to tell us, because he has no 
vision, no long term policy for developing Canada's railways. I 
think this government is showing us that it has thrown up its hands. 
It is selling off Canada's railways a little more slowly so as to save 
the best assets, but still moving inexorably toward their total 
dismantling. The government does not, however, have the courage 
to admit this to the people. The government goes all over the place 
boasting about this great country with communications from coast 
to coast, from east to west, from north to south, when it is in fact 
systematically shutting down our railway system.
<P>
<B>(1305)</B>
<P>
	I was looking at clause 25. Here we have a legal device of which 
we are becoming increasingly aware. The government creates an 
agency that is responsible for developing policies and regulations 
and, by virtue of its status as a superior court, judging those who 
could violate or be subject to these regulations. So, this court is no 
longer independent. It is losing its independence because it is 
responsible for both making legislation and enforcing it.
<P>
	In our parliamentary system, we all know that when questioning 
the validity of a law, we can go before a tribunal that hopefully is 
independent. It is a bit like a divorce, where one party wishes to 
appear before the divorce court having jurisdiction in the area, 
while the other says: ``Oh no. We will not take this matter to a 
common law court, but to my mother. She is the one who will 
decide who is right.''
<P>
	Can you imagine where this could lead? We could end up with 
decisions that would be legal monsters. This is precisely what we 
are about to do with this agency, with the new powers we are giving 
it, powers that are completely unlimited.
<P>
	The Standing Joint Committee on Scrutiny of Regulations is 
specially appointed by the Speaker of the House and mandated by 
Parliament to study subordinate legislation. It acts as a watchdog 
for rights conferred by statute.
<P>
	This committee has no interest in having a regulation quashed, 
replaced or enforced. Its only purpose is to verify compliance 
between regulations and the statutes that have been adopted and 
enacted by Parliament. For 20 or 25 years, this committee has 
reported regularly to the House, and the government has responded 
to its reports. Not so long ago, as we were submitting a report to the 
House, ministers wrote us saying: ``Yes, we do realize that such 
subordinate legislation is justified, or is not justified''.
<P>
	Here, it is no longer possible. What monitoring power does 
Parliament have over an agency whose decisions are final and may 
not be appealed, as per clause 25? None. There is no such power 
left. Is the government trying to render Parliament ineffectual? Is it 
trying to transform it into an empty shell? Is it trying to turn the 
300 or so members in this House into insignificant bystanders?
<P>
	Everything will be decided by a few ministers who are close to 
the Prime Minister. From now on, these people will control 
practically all of Canada's economic, social and political 
development. We must put a stop to that. This can no longer go on. 
Where will this take us?
<P>
	Earlier, we referred to Bill C-62. Public servants, we do not 
know which ones exactly-either at the top or the bottom-had the 
power to set standards that could be complied with, or not, subject 
to an exemption or a fee, or provided an alternative solution could 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1234"> 1234 </A></B>
<P>
be found. This  opened the doors wide to the lobbyists in Canada, 
and was unheard of.
<P>
<B>(1310)</B>
<P>
	Some weeks or months before, the Prime Minister had talked 
about introducing a bill. That was done with Bill C-41, which dealt 
with lobbyists on Parliament Hill. So, there is an incredible 
discrepancy between the statements made by ministers taken 
together, and those made by a minister alone. There is something 
wrong.
<P>
	If government members will not do it officially, I ask them to at 
least tell their ministers, in caucus, that they have to shape up 
because the situation no longer makes sense.
<P>
	In the end, we will hear about bills and acts of Parliament by 
reading about them in the newspapers, and the decisions will have 
been made by a handful of people. Consultation and democracy are 
on the way out in this country. So, as far as the regulatory powers 
are concerned, they will have to be reviewed, frankly, because we 
are in the process of making terrible mistakes.
<P>
	I would like to deal briefly also with clause 104 and the 
following clauses of the bill. When the bill deals with mortgages, it 
is to allow mortgaging by SLR, the definition of which escapes me, 
but it relates to small, secondary railways.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> Short line railways.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Lebel:</B> Exactly, short line railways. We know that they are 
owned by groups of business people, often with limited financial 
resources, who have joined forces to buy a section of railway from 
the CN, the CP or some other railway company. Those railways are 
then given the right to mortgage the rolling stock. However, the bill 
is very evasive about the mode of publication of the mortgage or 
about its rank when there are several mortgages. If there are two, 
three or four, which one comes first? Will mortgage rank be 
determined by precedence of registration or of publication? The 
bill is totally silent on that.
<P>
	With regard to the mortgage on movable property, there are 
provisions about that in Quebec legislation, but the bill is silent on 
that. So, railway cars could be seen as movable property. In 
Quebec, immovable property by destination has been eliminated 
under the new Civil Code. So, one could register in the registry of 
real or personal property in Montreal a mortgage on railway cars, 
whereas someone else would register the same property pursuant to 
clause 104 at the office of the registrar. Which one would take 
precedence? That is something that was completely overlooked, 
and I would like the minister to reply on these points.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ronald J. Duhamel (St. Boniface, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, 
I want to make a few comments and ask a few questions. You will 
remember that, earlier today, I  pointed out to one of my colleagues 
from the same political party that he had made a mistake and I 
would like to quote the exact clause we were talking about. Then, I 
will tie up my comment to what my colleague just said and which is 
unfair and incorrect.
<P>
	Clause 102 reads as follows:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>102.If an owner's land is divided as a result of the construction of a railway 
line, the railway company shall, at the owner's request, construct a suitable 
crossing for the owner's enjoyment of the land.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	And then in clause 103, it says:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>103.(1) If a railway company and an owner of land adjoining the company's 
railway do not agree on the construction of a crossing across the railway, the 
Agency, on the application of the owner, may order the company to construct a 
suitable crossing if the Agency considers-</BLOCKQUOTE>
	I made the same comment this morning, because the hon. 
member's colleague who spoke before said something else. I do not 
mean to say that he did not tell the truth, since he may have made a 
mistake, but what he said in the exact opposite of what I just said.
<P>
	Having said that, I now worry about the Bloc members, because 
my colleague talks about a court which would not be unbiased. I 
find this shocking.
<P>
<B>(1315)</B>
<P>
	Then he says that Parliament gives it directions it must abide by, 
but then he argues that the court is not free, or rather that it is free, I 
do not know what his argument was all about. It is all very 
conflicting.
<P>
	For my colleague's information, I would like to quote the 
following: ``A direction issued under subsection (1) shall not affect 
a matter that is before the Agency on the date of the direction and 
that relates to a particular person''. And then: ``A direction issued 
under section 43 is not binding on the Agency until the expiration 
of the thirtieth sitting day of Parliament after the direction has been 
laid before both Houses-''
<P>
	This is a clear indication that there is a process in place, that the 
process is open and public, that it will be referred to Parliament, to 
a committee for further debate, etc.
<P>
	If I had listened to every member of his party, I would have 
found similar mistakes. This morning, when I quoted from the 
document, why did his colleague not mention this mistake, why 
does he not recognize that we have an unbiased court and an open 
process, that what we are doing is both honest and right? Why are 
they always so negative when they do not need to?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Lebel:</B> Madam Speaker, the hon. member for St. Boniface 
quoted the first paragraph of clause 103, but he should have quoted 
up to and including the third paragraph. It is said that we should 
always assume that things are done in good faith but I am 
wondering if this applies in the hon. member's case.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1235"> 1235 </A></B>
<P>
	The hon. member for St. Boniface should read clause 103(3):
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The owner of the land shall pay the costs of constructing and maintaining the 
crossing.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	<B>Mr. Duhamel:</B> If he buys a second piece of land.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Lebel:</B> The hon. member says: ``If he buys a second piece of 
land.'' Maybe he had too much beef from England to eat, too much 
British cow.
<P>
	It is specified in clause 103. The hon. member for St. Boniface is 
a sly one. He rises in the House to add or remove from the bill as he 
wishes.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Duhamel:</B> That is it. I am writing my bills on the spot.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Lebel:</B> The hon. member quoted the first two paragraphs of 
a clause, completely ignoring the third, which is precisely the one 
that the hon. member for Frontenac objected to this morning.
<P>
	Partial as he is, not only does he not read between the lines but he 
does not even read the lines themselves. That is what I blame him 
for.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Duhamel:</B> I do not doubt it.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Lebel:</B> The hon. member for St. Boniface has interrupted 
me so much that he has finally succeeded in making me lose all 
concentration. I am still wondering where he was going with his 
second question and even what this question was. But I can tell you 
that the hon. member for Frontenac had raised this issue in good 
faith. He had also spoken of the environmental study. The member 
does not want to go back over that. Regarding the environmental 
assessments, nowhere is it mentioned in this bill that the person 
must conduct these assessments before getting the certificate of 
fitness required to operate a railway. It is not mentioned anywhere.
<P>
	I agree with the member for St. Boniface that there is an act 
which requires the conduct of environmental assessments when the 
federal government and a province are involved. But it is far from 
being obvious that the environmental assessment act would apply 
to a SLR, a railway constructed and operated by an individual like 
the member for St. Boniface or myself.
<P>
	The member for St. Boniface knows that very well. He does not 
mention it because it does not bring grist to his mill.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Duhamel:</B> Is the court unbiased?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Lebel:</B> Take an act, any act. Parliament enacts it and the 
court has to monitor its enforcement. But if the court establishes its 
own rules and says to the taxpayer that he did not comply with it, I 
would say to the member for St. Boniface that it is clearly in 
conflict of interest! What else does it take to make him understand 
the difference between a conflict of interest and impartiality?
<P>
<B>(1320)</B>
<P>
	<B>Hon. Charles Caccia (Davenport, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, first, 
I would like to congratulate you on your appointment to a position 
of responsibility. I am sure you will fill it with honour and a great 
sense of responsibility and wisdom.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	I will say a few words on sustainable transport. The bill, which is 
former Bill C-101, lends itself very much to some considerations 
that ought to be related to the overall context of sustainable 
transport. In the 1993 red book as a party platform we devoted an 
entire chapter to sustainable development. Therefore, it is 
appropriate that we endeavour to launch new policies, including 
transportation policies within that overall concept.
<P>
	This is not a new thought. It was adopted in Bill C-46 when the 
new Department of Industry was launched a couple of years ago. 
The same happened by incorporating a reference to sustainable 
development in Bill C-48 which bill created the new Department of 
Natural Resources. More recently the House debated and approved 
the creation of the position of the Commissioner for Sustainable 
Development which I believe was followed by a proclamation in 
December.
<P>
	Therefore, it would make political logic to also insert the 
concept in the National Transportation Act and consolidation of the 
Railway Act and to put forward some thoughts on sustainable 
development. I will do that very briefly.
<P>
	I congratulate the former minister who produced the bill, a 
massive effort no doubt, and for having decided that this aspect of 
our economy needs rationalization. We fully agree with him.
<P>
	There is something which would have carried the matter a step 
further and would have been desirable. In section 5 of the act under 
the declaration section a reference is missing, one that would refer 
to the need for our national transportation system to be operated 
and developed in keeping with the principles of sustainable 
development. It is unfortunate it has not taken place yet. Those 
principles can be found in the legislation I referred to a moment 
ago which will be guiding the activities of the Commissioner for 
Sustainable Development in the auditor general's office. It is a set 
of principles which would be extremely useful within the context 
of national transportation.
<P>
	Let me explain what sustainable transportation really means. It 
means a number of things. It means finding ways of reducing 
carbon dioxide emissions, keeping in mind the commitment we 
made internationally of stabilizing our carbon dioxide emissions 
and reducing them after the year 2000. It means keeping in mind 
that damage to the atmosphere is caused by air traffic in particular, 
which is an issue that needs to be addressed and is a matter of 
increasing urgency. It means that  within the context of ground 
transportation we want to encourage movement of people with the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1236"> 1236 </A></B>
<P>
least consumption of energy, with the least production of pollution, 
with the least congestion of traffic. We want to find ways of 
transportation that move people with the lowest energy 
consumption per unit.
<P>
<B>(1325)</B>
<P>
	Finally I might add the necessity of conducting research for 
alternative fuels for the ones we are presently using. Research 
badly needs a shift in emphasis from the one we have so far applied 
when it comes to the energy sector.
<P>
	The Ontario Round Table on Environment and the Economy has 
produced a number of interesting sectoral task force reports. 
Carbon dioxide emissions related to transportation account for 31 
per cent of all emissions. Of this 31 per cent, the largest 
component, to the extent of 81 per cent is attributed to road 
transportation.
<P>
	Imagine the importance of short, medium or long distance 
railway transportation in relation to the impact it could have in 
reducing the dependence on road transportation. This debate is not 
new on this continent but it has to be raised at every opportunity 
which is what I am doing today.
<P>
	Rail transport produces significantly lower emissions per tonne 
of freight carried than does road transport. Tables and studies have 
been produced to this effect. For every tonne of freight switched 
from road to rail, energy used is reduced by some 86 per cent which 
is a considerable amount.
<P>
	The ``Green Paper on the Impact of Transport on the 
Environment: A Community Strategy for Sustainable Mobility'' 
was produced by the Commission of European Communities. It 
confirms the results of the Ontario round table to which I referred 
earlier.
<P>
	In December 1995 the Standing Committee on Environment and 
Sustainable Development produced a report entitled ``Keeping a 
Promise Towards a Sustainable Budget'' and dealt with the 
question of transportation and sustainable development albeit 
perhaps in a superficial manner. We came to the conclusion that the 
transportation system in Canada is currently not sustainable and 
requires significant changes. I refer particularly to pages 23 to 27 
of that report.
<P>
	We were quite struck by the submission by a witness on behalf of 
the Transportation Association of Canada who stated that the 
playing field in transportation is anything but level. I quote: ``It is 
tilted in favour of the automobile and there are many reasons for 
this. Our cities have been designed for cars. Cars would never have 
gained the popularity they have today if it had not been for roadway 
infrastructure provided for by the public purse. We need to tilt the 
playing field away from the single occupant auto and more in the 
direction of other means of transportation including of course 
railway''.  This is what the Transportation Association of Canada is 
advocating.
<P>
	Two of the witnesses before our committee said that the laws 
should be changed and a tax exemption made for employer 
provided transit passes. Around Montreal, Toronto and Vancouver 
there are a number of short railway systems which move 
commuters in rush hour and therefore the question of transit passes 
is relevant. Such a move, namely the employer provided transit 
pass, would encourage employees to use public transit rather than 
single occupancy automobiles. This would reduce energy 
consumption, decrease atmospheric pollution, reduce traffic 
congestion and the like. An initiative of this kind would send a 
strong signal to employers and to society in general about the need 
to change attitudes toward urban transportation.
<P>
<B>(1330)</B>
<P>
	The recommendation which emerged as a result of the 
consultation was that the Income Tax Act be amended to provide a 
tax exemption for employer provided transit passes to encourage 
people to use public transit rather than private automobiles. The 
change would apply to any future taxation year. The applicability 
of this would not be for rural Canada but for urban Canada and the 
transit railway systems that surround and feed into our major 
metropolises.
<P>
	It would also be interesting to put on the record another 
recommendation to the effect that the federal government put in 
place a surcharge on the purchase of new fuel inefficient vehicles 
and redirect the revenue to a fund dedicated to improving the 
sustainability of Canadian transportation. This may sound a bit like 
pie in the sky but nevertheless it is a germ of an idea whose time 
will come and which could be implemented with perhaps some 
modification.
<P>
	Another recommendation on the subject of sustainable transport 
is directed to the Minister of Finance and the Minister of Transport. 
They are being asked to re-evaluate the subsidies that are being 
directed to the railways and to road construction and maintenance 
in the context of sustainable transportation. They are being asked to 
determine whether a new allocation of resources between rail and 
road funding is needed and desirable at this time.
<P>
	No doubt it is good that we have a bill to streamline rail 
regulations and promote the formation of short line railways. The 
question, however, which arises in this debate is whether we have 
the environmental and economic impacts available of the proposed 
short lines and have these impacts been studied.
<P>
	These are factors of some importance because of the carbon 
dioxide emission issue, per tonne of freight in this case, and 
because of the fact that the emissions by the railway system are 
much smaller per unit transported than the emissions by road.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1237"> 1237 </A></B>
<P>
	Taking this fact into consideration, environmental and economic 
impact studies are needed to ensure that the lines proposed by this 
bill will not result in greater road transport and hence greater 
carbon dioxide emissions because this would be contrary to 
everything we are trying to do under sustainable development.
<P>
	I appreciate the fact that this debate on road transport versus rail 
transport is one which has bedevilled the imagination and skills of 
many governments and politicians before. It is not the first time it 
has been raised. However, it is becoming more and more relevant 
because of the urbanization of Canada and the increase in 
concentration of people in our urban centres, therefore, the 
transport requirement by rail and ground that follow this type of 
human settlement which is converging into our urban centres.
<P>
	This kind of debate would have been much less significant 100 
or even 50 years ago but it will be extremely relevant in the decades 
ahead.
<P>
<B>(1335 )</B>
<P>
	I congratulate the government on this initiative. However, I 
would urge it to develop a sustainable transportation policy which 
would take into account the impact of carbon dioxide emissions on 
climate change. We must come to grips with those modes of 
transportation which are more energy efficient than the ones we 
presently have.
<P>
	I would also urge the government to identify subsidies which are 
not desirable in the achievement of sustainable environmental 
goals and to identify modes of transportation which are less 
consuming and less polluting than the ones on which we rely today.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Williams (St. Albert, Ref.):</B> Madam Speaker, it is a 
pleasure to speak to Bill C-14. I note that this is a rehash of Bill 
C-101 which the government forced back into the House after it 
died on the Order Paper when Parliament was prorogued. It is a 
travesty of the democratic process, but nonetheless we are talking 
about it once more.
<P>
	Unlike the previous speaker, I cannot find it in my heart to 
compliment the government for introducing the bill. I believe it has 
some serious shortcomings. However, our role is to be critical of 
legislation introduced by the government and the Reform Party has 
been doing an excellent job in that role.
<P>
	Hon. members may have noticed the results of the byelections 
last night. The Reform Party gained considerable ground in 
Atlantic Canada and in Etobicoke North. Obviously the people are 
quite concerned about the message being delivered by the 
government. The way it is running the country is coming under 
closer and closer scrutiny. At the next election, when Canadians are 
given a real choice, they will choose something else, such as 
Reform.
<P>
	The intention of the government in Bill C-14 is to regularize or 
streamline the process by which the main railway companies can 
abandon rail lines. I am thinking about the government's platform 
of jobs, jobs, jobs. With this bill it is creating an easier opportunity 
for the rail companies to abandon lines instead of maintaining 
them. All the jobs that go along with those lines will be lost.
<P>
	The communities served along those lines will be diminished. 
Rural Canada will find it more difficult to maintain itself on a 
sustainable basis when competing with urban centres.
<P>
	However, the government finds it quite appropriate to introduce 
rules and regulations which will make it easier for those companies 
to abandon lines. They will still have to justify what they are trying 
to do, but the government has given them a mechanism whereby 
they can say: ``We will allow this line to deteriorate and we will 
abandon it without any real public input''. It is shocking because 
this is the government that ran on jobs, jobs, jobs.
<P>
	From the Reform point of view, a job in the country is every bit 
as important as a job in the city. Rural Canada is in jeopardy. It 
would have been a great opportunity for the government to protect 
and sustain rural Canada and rejuvenate the small cities and towns 
which have a way of life that is fading fast. It is a way of life that 
has produced great Canadians. It provides an opportunity for 
parents to raise their children without concerning themselves with 
crime and other things that little kids should not be getting into. It 
was a wonderful opportunity, but it is gone.
<P>
<B>(1340 )</B>
<P>
	Let us look at the other side of the coin. If it is the government's 
intention to allow the railroads to abandon tracks, why is it not 
coming up with a plan to encourage small business entrepreneurs to 
operate these branch lines?
<P>
	Unfortunately these small entrepreneurial companies do not 
seem to be of any concern to the government. It is just concerned 
with the big picture. As long as it can say that jobs, jobs, jobs are 
being created, it does not care about the small business 
entrepreneur who could help achieve that objective. The 
government has done nothing to create an environment in which 
these entrepreneurs could compete successfully by taking up the 
challenge of rejuvenating branch lines which are being abandoned 
by the major railroads. It is a great opportunity missed totally and 
completely by the government which does not seem to care.
<P>
	Some branch lines in Alberta are run by small organizations. The 
member for Crowfoot has a branch line going through his riding. It 
is working profitably. It provides much better service that the 
major railroads. It is responsive to clientele. Its frequency is much 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1238"> 1238 </A></B>
<P>
improved. It does not wait until there are 100 cars before it sends a  
train down the line. If there is grain to be moved the train is there.
<P>
	It is time for us to recognize that small business entrepreneurs 
are capable of running railroads every bit as good as the large 
monoliths that are now being given the opportunity to abandon rail 
lines across the country. These railroads have been instrumental in 
the development and building of our nation. It is tragic to see them 
go.
<P>
	The elevators are going along with them. My eldest son laments 
every time he hears about a grain elevator being demolished 
because he sees it as a part of our history disappearing. He is only 
17, yet he realizes they are part of our history and will never return, 
again courtesy of this government. It does not have the foresight 
and the vision to realize that jobs can be created and protected.
<P>
	I will now discuss another area of concern to my riding, the 
alfalfa business. I have been critical of the government in its 
treatment of the railroads by allowing them to abandon Canadian 
jobs. The alfalfa business is being treated in exactly the same way.
<P>
	The alfalfa business has over 1,000 directly related jobs, yet the 
government ran roughshod over the entire industry when it 
cancelled the WGTA program. It did not give a hoot about the 
industry and how it will work in the new environment which has 
been forced on it.
<P>
	As I have said, over 1,000 jobs are directly maintained in rural 
Canada. They are dependent on the alfalfa business, not to mention 
those spin-off jobs related to repair and maintenance. It is a $100 
million export business. It generates the better part of $100 million 
in revenues although the government does not seem to care.
<P>
	When the government eliminated the WGTA, the subsidy 
program for the railroads from which the alfalfa industry obtained 
a benefit, it did not consider the specific concerns and needs of the 
alfalfa industry. Alfalfa is a high volume, low value product. It is 
not like cereals which are low volume, high value. Yet the alfalfa 
industry has been eliminated from the subsidy entirely. Therefore, 
the elimination of the subsidy will cause the cost of transportation 
to increase much more dramatically for the alfalfa industry than for 
the grain growers.
<P>
<B>(1345 )</B>
<P>
	We know the grain growers received $1.6 billion as a final 
settlement. The alfalfa people are going to get $40 million. 
However, it does not stop there. The $1.6 billion being paid to 
farmers allows them to reduce the capital cost of their land and 
therefore is non-taxable. They are allowed to keep the money.
<P>
	Because land is not a depreciable asset, farmers can leave that 
reduced capital cost sitting on their financial statements until they 
retire. Then of course there is the $500,000 capital gains exemption 
for farmers when they  sell out at retirement. This $1.6 billion is by 
and large going to flow through to farmers tax free.
<P>
	This is not so in the alfalfa business because those people are not 
really in the business of land ownership. They will have to pay tax 
on this money if it is income, and there is a reasonable chance 
Revenue Canada will declare this to be income rather than a capital 
cost subsidy. If it does that at a 50 per cent tax rate, the $40 million 
subsidy becomes a $20 million subsidy because the government 
will claw $20 million of the $40 million right back into its own 
pocket. That is not going to do the alfalfa industry much good.
<P>
	On the other hand, the government may say that this can be 
applied to capital. Unlike the farmers who can reduce their land 
values, they will have to acquire depreciable assets. This means 
they will be denied capital cost allowance by virtue of the grant and 
over the next few years will be paying higher taxes.
<P>
	Again the government will get the $20 million back and not one 
penny of it will benefit the alfalfa industry. This is Canada we are 
talking about, a country in which this government does not seem to 
care about the small entrepreneur, the railroads.
<P>
	This government does not seem to care about the small plants in 
my riding that generate jobs in rural Canada which are seriously in 
jeopardy because this government, even though it ran on the 
platform of jobs, jobs, jobs, is sitting back while its policy changes 
are putting these jobs in jeopardy, if not destroying them. It does 
not seem to care.
<P>
	That is the type of legacy this government is leaving for 
Canadians. I and the people in my riding do not like it one bit. I can 
assure the government that there is absolutely no support from the 
people in the alfalfa business in Legal, Alberta, which is part of my 
riding.
<P>
	The alfalfa people have been asking for about a $70 million 
subsidy. They feel that on a pro rata basis that is much more 
appropriate than the $40 million less tax being handed out by this 
government. That is why they are asking for $70 million and that is 
why they are asking that this amount be given as a prescribed 
amount, which allows it to be income tax exempt and allows them 
to get the money on the same basis as the farmers are getting.
<P>
	If that type of insult were not enough, when the minister of 
agriculture announced the cancellation of the WGTA program and 
the introduction of the final payment, rather than paying the final 
payment on arable acres, he decreed that it was to be paid on land 
where cereals are being grown. Therefore the payment was denied 
to farmers who were growing alfalfa in that particular year.
<P>
	I listened to the previous speaker tell us how concerned he was 
about sustainable development. Sustainable development is good 
but sustainable farming includes growing alfalfa periodically. 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1239"> 1239 </A></B>
<P>
Because farmers were maintaining a policy of sustainable farming, 
the minister of agriculture said: ``Tough if you happen to be 
growing alfalfa this year because you are not going to participate in 
the final payout under the WGTA that every other farmer who was 
growing cereal that year was able to participate in''. If one member 
of the government speaks about sustainable development, we 
should also hear from the minister of agriculture and everyone else 
on the other side of the House.
<P>
<B>(1350)</B>
<P>
	We in the opposition agree with sustainable development and 
sustainable agriculture. Canadians agree with it. Why do we not 
hear from the minister of agriculture? Does he not care about the 
small alfalfa plant which generates $100 million worth of exports 
for this country, sustains 1,000 jobs in this country and pays taxes 
in this country like everyone else? He does not seem to care.
<P>
	It is a disgrace for me to stand and accuse the minister of 
agriculture in that way but the unfortunate news is it is true.
<P>
	I could go on about the alfalfa business, but the point is it is 
entitled to a fair shake. As farmers, as producers, as rural 
Canadians, as people who are participating in this economy and as 
people who are trying to make a living in Alberta while this 
government keeps pulling the rug out from underneath them, surely 
they deserve the same type of treatment as cereal growing farmers 
and as the railroads which are being allowed to abandon entire 
branch lines, perhaps even the branch line that services the alfalfa 
plant. Who knows, maybe in five years even it could be gone.
<P>
	Finally we have the announcement by the Minister of Finance in 
the budget that he will be selling off these railway cars. He will 
allow a surcharge of 75 cents a tonne for the movement of 
commodities. Who will get hurt the most? Again, it is the alfalfa 
industry. It has high volume and low value. It has to move its 
product from the prairies to the coast for export to Japan which is a 
large consumer of the alfalfa pellets. What do we have? Another 
charge being levied on it.
<P>
	It has not even had the opportunity to adjust, reinvest and 
improve its productivity to accommodate the elimination of the 
WGTA. Now it will get hit with a 75 cent a tonne surcharge, 
compliments of the Minister of Finance. After having dealt with 
the minister of agriculture, the industry now has another minister 
coming at it. Where will it stop? Is it the intention of this 
government to beat it into the ground, suffer the losses of jobs, 
suffer the decline of rural Canada and allow the railroads to dictate 
the policies of this government by asking for the authority to 
abandon lines as they so desire?
<P>
	The government has a lot to answer for. With a bit of homework 
it could do a lot better. I expected that with this bill we could have 
had a lot better.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Mercier (Blainville-Deux-Montagnes, BQ):</B> 
Madam Speaker, I would like to put a question to my colleague 
from the Reform Party on the part of his speech which focuses on 
short lines.
<P>
	It is not frequent for a member of my party to agree with a 
member of the Reform Party, so I did not want it to go unnoticed. It 
so happens that my honourable colleague rightly says that the bill 
does not give enough support to small businesses which intend to 
take over parts of the lines the big companies wish to abandon. He 
also says that these small businesses can manage the lines as well 
as the big companies.
<P>
	I would even go further. Often times, they can manage them 
better because they succeed where the big companies have failed 
and, as the minister himself said this morning, in the United States, 
it is these short lines that truly saved the American network. Just 
like small streams feed big rivers, short lines feed larger ones.
<P>
<B>(1355)</B>
<P>
	Our party was suggesting two things to help the SLRs. First, we 
suggested that loans be given to small companies so they could 
rehabilitate the lines. As the hon. member probably knows, the big 
companies did not maintain short lines hoping that the service 
would deteriorate and that as a consequence people would stop 
using them which, in turn, allowed them to ask that the lines be 
abandoned. Today, when the National Transportation Agency 
authorizes a company to abandon a branch line, we can find buyers 
for that line but it is usually a small company which is not strong 
enough or does not have the money necessary to rehabilitate the 
line that was deliberately neglected.
<P>
	I would like to ask my colleague what he thinks of our two 
suggestions which are: First, to give interest-free loans to small 
companies that want to buy branch lines, provided they rehabilitate 
those lines; and second, that the federal government creates its own 
branch line rehabilitation program since it is responsible for the 
present state of those lines.
<P>
	What does the hon. member think of our suggestions? Does he 
himself have suggestions to help SLRs?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Williams:</B> Madam Speaker, I would like to respond to and 
agree with the points raised by the hon. member.
<P>
	We are fully aware that in many cases, years before a line is 
finally abandoned, the railroad sets it apart, ignores it and allows it 
to fall into disrepair and decay. After that, it can come before the 
National Transportation Agency and say: ``Look how much money 
it will cost to fix it up. Look how little traffic  there is. This line is 
uneconomical and we want to close it down''.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="1240"> 1240 </A></B>
<P>
	Lack of maintenance, management and marketing leads to the 
decline of that particular line and the community which goes along 
with it. Therefore I think the hon. member has made a good 
suggestion. If we were to ask the railroads to finance, interest free, 
the rejuvenation of these branch lines then it would ensure that the 
railroads would not allow the lines to fall into a state of disrepair to 
begin with.
<P>
	I do not see that the onus is on the government to pick up where 
the responsibilities of the railroads left off. I would think we would 
want to put it right back squarely in the lap of the railway 
companies to ensure they realize their responsibilities are to 
maintain adequate rail service in the country.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> It being about 2 p.m., we will now proceed to 
Statements by Members.

	Liberal patronage opened the way for the election in five safe

members of the Canadian Police Association are in Ottawa this

grievance process that involves an independent third party.
<P>
	We in the New Democratic Party support this idea now just as we 
did last year after hundreds of RCMP officers gathered on 
Parliament Hill calling on the government to withdraw Bill C-58 
which would have weakened the labour rights of RCMP officers 
rather than strengthen them.
<P>
	Other police forces in Canada enjoy collective bargaining rights 
without undermining the special functions of police officers in our 
society. There is no reason that RCMP officers should be denied 
their basic labour rights.

Commission and to begin the process of developing legislation to 
grant RCMP officers what is after all only their right.

	<B>Mrs. Georgette Sheridan (Saskatoon-Humboldt, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to the efforts of Walter 
Gumprich, a CESO volunteer who lives in my riding of 
Saskatoon-Humboldt. He has just completed his assignment with 
the Vologda regional government in Russia.
<P>
	CESO is supported by CIDA, the Department of Indian Affairs 
and Northern Development and Canadian corporations and 
individuals.
<P>
	Speaking with Walter this morning, I learned that he had held a 
seminar for 150 government, business and farm personnel on 
consumer driven economics. I also learned of how he assisted 
Russian farmers with management issues such as operations, 
financial management and marketing. Before conducting such 
seminars, Walter spent time in the area to familiarize himself with 
the reality of farming in Russia in 1996. I was struck by his 
comment that there is little value in fine marketing theories when

	The Brandon Police Service has developed an innovative

<P>
	In January 1995 to increase informal accessibility of police

in the halls which provides students with the opportunity to interact 
with the officer at whatever level they choose.

efforts to bring policing closer to the communities and are working 
with the communities to address issues relating to crime 
prevention.

	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, Statistics Canada is preparing for its census, and is 
therefore recruiting a number of census commissioners and census 
takers in each riding. To fill these positions, the Minister of 
Industry has asked each MP to provide the name of one volunteer 
to recruit potential census commissioners.
<P>
	Will the Minister of Industry confirm that, in nearly all ridings 
represented by opposition members, additional lists of candidates 
have been provided by the Liberal Party of Canada?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry, Minister for the 
Atlantic Canada Opportunities Agency, Minister of Western 
Economic Diversification and Minister responsible for the 
Federal Office of Regional Development-Quebec, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, as the hon. member knows since he also received an 
invitation to name a contact person in his riding, that contact 
person is a source of names for the appointment of census 
commissioners. The same invitation was provided to all members 
of Parliament. Experience has shown that it is not adequate to 
generate all of the names required because the people whose names 
are submitted must submit themselves to testing, both written as 
well as interviews.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1244"> 1244 </A></B>
<P>
	As the names have come in, in fact, I have noticed that in the 
ridings represented by the party of the hon. Leader of the 
Opposition, 134 of the recommendations were accepted out of 754 
referrals, a proportion which is not dissimilar to the experience 
of others. I must say it is somewhat better than some of my 
colleagues have experienced.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Leader of the Opposition, BQ): </B>Mr. 
Speaker, I would like to find out from the Minister of Industry why 
his office, or Statistics Canada, seems to be asking for additional 
lists in ridings represented by opposition members far more often 
than in ridings represented by Liberals.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry, Minister for the 
Atlantic Canada Opportunities Agency, Minister of Western 
Economic Diversification and Minister responsible for the 
Federal Office of Regional Development-Quebec, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, if the Leader of the Opposition would like to take it up 
with some of my colleagues, he is welcome to do so. If he asks 
them he will know that additional names have been sought by 
Statistics Canada other than those submitted by political parties in 
all parts of the country. This has been necessary in order to ensure 
that census commissioners are those who are the best qualified.
<P>
	Those who have been named have had to pass what is a rather 
difficult test of their skills. Very often, names submitted by the 
representatives or by the contact persons named by members of 
Parliament have been inadequate in number to fill the jobs. 
Therefore, they have been recruited from Canada Employment 
Centres, ads in newspapers and virtually any other source. They 
rebut them. They were all subject to the same testing procedure. If 
the member finds that unfair, I fail to understand it.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Leader of the Opposition, BQ): </B>Mr. 
Speaker, I accept the Minister's explanations but I would like to ask 
whether he will confirm that, under the system set up by his office, 
by his department, there appears to be two kinds of lists, a regular 
list and a priority list?
<P>
<B>(1420)</B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry, Minister for the 
Atlantic Canada Opportunities Agency, Minister of Western 
Economic Diversification and Minister responsible for the 
Federal Office of Regional Development-Quebec, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, to be perfectly clear on this, the lists of names submitted 
for the position of census commissioner have come from a number 
of sources.
<P>
	With respect to the Liberal Party, of 2,199 names referred for 
census commissioner across the country, only 569 were actually 
recommended, fewer positions than there are. Obviously names 
come in from a variety of other sources in order that the census is 
well performed.
<P>
	Certainly political sources have been used in order to obtain 
names of people for testing. Those sources have been, in each 
riding, first of all suggested by the member of Parliament of 
whichever party. The success rate for all parties is well below half, 
including overall the governing party.
<P>
	There is also a recruiting process to select census 
representatives. There are over 35,000 of these people being hired 
to work on the census across Canada. They will be subject to 
testing. If the member has any names that he would like to submit 
for those positions, I would be happy to receive them and we will 
see that they are in.

<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am sure the minister will be happy soon.
<P>
	The practices the Minister of Industry established for the 1996 
census leave us somewhat perplexed. There are regular lists and 
there are priority lists.
<P>
	Could the minister tell us whether the priority lists are the ones 
provided by the Liberal Party of Canada?

its activities and its operations tell us his criteria for determining 
whether a list is a priority one rather than a regular one?

<P>
	<B>Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry, Minister for the

Speaker, I hope I understand the hon. member's question correctly. 
Let me make sure we set out the process.
<P>
	In the appointment of census commissioners, I wrote to every 
member of Parliament and invited them to submit a name as a 
contact person. From those names, Statistics Canada solicited 
possible people to serve as census commissioners. In many cases 
the contact person submitted their own name.
<P>
	All those people were subject to very thorough testing at two 
stages. They were required to write a written test and they were 
required to submit to an interview process conducted by public 
servants who were regular or term employees of Statistics Canada.
<P>
	From that, over 2,000 census commissioners across Canada were 
hired. Subsequent to that, there is a request for further names for 
census representatives.
<P>
<B>(1425)</B>
<P>
	As I explained a moment ago, 35,000 across the country is not a 
bad number. I am forwarding any names left over or which come to

member if he has some names to submit them to me. I would be

	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, every senior government in Canada with the exception of 
the federal government is now committed to deficit elimination and 
balancing its budget.
<P>
	Eight jurisdictions are expected to balance their budgets this 
fiscal year or post surpluses. This means that a number of 
provincial jurisdictions are getting close to being able to offer tax 
relief to their people. Their concern is that the federal government, 
still running a $30 billion deficit, will cancel out provincial tax cuts 
with federal tax increases.
<P>
	Will the finance minister today assure his provincial 
counterparts that his government will not raise federal taxes when 
provinces cut theirs?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the leader of the Reform Party has a tendency, I am sure due to a 
difficulty in the research department, to ask the same question time 
and time again.
<P>
	He has asked this question before. I have said to him that at the 
last meeting of the finance ministers we discussed this very issue 
and their was complete agreement on the need for co-ordination, 
that it made no sense for governments to fill in tax room, one on the 
other in either way. We will continue to co-operate in that way.
<P>
	Eight provinces have either balanced their budgets or are looking 
to balance their budgets, absolutely. One of the reasons is that in 
the transfers to the provinces established by the federal government 
we have provided a formula for growth.
<P>
	If the federal government had followed the policies of the 
Reform Party to slash and eviscerate those transfers, those 
provinces would not be able to balance their books.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, one of the biggest problems the provinces are having in 
balancing their budgets is the drastic reduction in transfers 
instituted by the government, exactly opposite to what the minister 
said.
<P>
	These are not unfounded fears. Despite the minister's assurances 
that this has all been discussed with provincial counterparts and 
that there is agreement, there is not agreement. If the minister is so 
confident this agreement can be reached would he be prepared to 
enter into a formal federal-provincial tax relief agreement to ensure 
that tax relief measures adopted by either level of government are 
passed on to the long suffering Canadian taxpayer?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
we have made it very clear that with the provinces we are prepared 
to sit down and take a look at the whole area of federal-provincial 
tax co-ordination. We have made it very clear and we will be 
discussing it at the next meeting.
<P>
	I find it very difficult to understand how the leader of the Reform 
Party could stand up not one minute ago and say that one of the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1246"> 1246 </A></B>
<P>
problems is the drastic reductions we have imposed on the 
provinces when in fact his budget  from last year had reductions 
that made ours look like a peanut hill; they were enormous.
<P>
	Why will he not be consistent? How can he stand up here one day 
and say one thing, then stand up the next day and say another? Is 
there no coherence in the Reform Party at all?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the statements by the finance minister concerning 
Reform's budget are false.
<P>
	This is not an academic matter. The finance minister will recall 
that his predecessor, Michael Wilson, in the late 1980s attempted to 
reduce federal taxes and managed to do that in a couple of years. 
However, the provinces, particularly the Liberal provincial 
government in Ontario, increased provincial taxes to sop up the tax 
relief granted by the federal government, and the taxpayers never 
saw any of it. Now people are afraid the same thing will happen in 
reverse.
<P>
	I ask the minister again for a yes or no answer. Will he enter into 
a federal-provincial tax relief agreement to ensure that tax relief 
given by one level of government is not taken away by another 
level of government?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
have answered the question. I said that what we want to do and 
what the provinces have agree to do is sit down and take a look at 
the way the provinces and the federal government tax the same 
taxpayer. We have agreed to co-ordinate.
<P>
<B>(1430 )</B>
<P>
	Perhaps I should remind the leader of the Reform Party that in 
our first budget there were no increases in personal taxes. In our 
second budget there were no increases in personal income taxes. In 
our third budget there were no increases in personal taxes, 
corporate taxes or excise taxes; there were no increases in taxes at 
all.

	<B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier-Montcalm, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, we know that the Minister of Industry, who is responsible 
for the census, has introduced a system of lists and names having 
priority in the hiring of census representatives at Statistics Canada.
<P>
	Does the minister confirm that it is up to his own office to decide 
which lists have priority?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry, Minister for the 
Atlantic Canada Opportunities Agency, Minister of Western 
Economic Diversification and Minister responsible for the 
Federal Office of Regional Development-Quebec, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I think I have  answered that question. Let me answer a 
different question.
<P>
	If the hon. member is asking whether as minister responsible for 
Statistics Canada I am involved in staffing the census positions, the 
answer is yes. Under the Statistics Act the minister responsible for 
Statistics Canada is authorized to appoint the staff required to 
conduct a census.
<P>
	However, the way we have gone about doing this in order to 
provide as many names as possible so that the most qualified 
people could obtain jobs was to use the political process as a source 
of names.
<P>
	As I have told the member, with respect to census 
commissioners, that has been done through all members of 
Parliament providing a contact person. In the case of 
representatives from the Bloc Quebecois, from the Reform Party, 
from the NDP and from the Liberal Party, many people did not 
successfully qualify for the position.
<P>
	Consequently, with respect to the 35,000 positions for census 
representatives, we have asked that, being subjected to testing first, 
people who have been submitted through my office be hired if they 
are qualified.
<P>
	I am prepared to do that for any member of Parliament who 
indicates, as many official opposition members have, that they feel 
their people were better qualified than the testing revealed them to 
be on the first go-round. They are perfectly welcome to submit 
names.
<P>

	<B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier-Montcalm, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, that was a long answer to a question that was quite simple.

question.
<P>

	<B>Mr. John Duncan (North Island-Powell River, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the Nisga'a deal transfers ownership of a section of the 
public highway from Terrace to New Aiyansh and Greenville to the 
Nisga'a.
<P>
	The minister knows that road blockades in B.C. have revolved 
around legal ownership of right of way at Adams Lake and Apex 
Mountain. These disputes remain unresolved and the minister 
conveniently has washed his hands of responsibility.
<P>
	Why is the minister promoting an agreement that removes 
longstanding public ownership of public highways when he knows 
the precedent is a recipe for future problems?
<P>
<B>(1435 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Hon. Ron Irwin (Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern 
Development, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, dealing specifically with 
access, which was the point of the question, I am very proud of the 
access provisions of the agreement.
<P>
	They provide public access to Nisga'a lands for hunting, fishing 
and recreation. The Nisga'a will regulate access based on safety, 
environment, cultural and historic sites and habitat. The province is 
to maintain the roads. The federal and provincial governments can 
acquire Nisga'a land for fair compensation for access. It is a very 
modern approach to access which the province of B.C., the Nisga'a 
and the federal government are quite proud of.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Duncan (North Island-Powell River, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the minister is continuing to perpetuate myths which do 
not stand up to scrutiny in the agreement.
<P>
	Recently in the House the minister said there was no 
constitutionally protected commercial fishery in the Nisga'a deal. 
This same claim was made in some B.C. government ads which led 
to complaints. This resulted in the provincial aboriginal affairs 
minister's withdrawing the ads because they were inaccurate and 
misleading.
<P>
	Will the minister follow the lead of his provincial counterpart 
and do the honourable thing by rescinding and withdrawing his 
earlier misleading statement?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Ron Irwin (Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern 
Development, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the only thing mystical in the 
Nisga'a deal is the absence of the member of Parliament from the 
area on an invitation to the signing.
<P>
	Concerning the fisheries, there was quite a bit of negotiation on 
the commercial aspect of the fishery and whether it would be 
constitutionally protected. The Nisga'a demanded that it be 
constitutionally protected. In the end this was withdrawn.
<P>
	The commercial aspect of the fishery is not constitutionally 
protected. It is defined annually by a committee or commission of 
two Nisga'a and two federal representatives and reports directly to 
the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans.

guilty to that accusation.
<P>
	The system in place is based on testing and qualification by 
public servants evaluating the lists of names submitted for census 
commissioner by contract persons and other sources from all 
members of the House of Commons.
<P>
	The second process is with respect to the hiring of the census 
representatives. There are over 35,000 of these people across the 
country subject to a two stage testing process.
<P>
	In reflection of the fact that members of Parliament from all 
parties expressed some frustration that not all the people they 
considered qualified had succeeded in being chosen as census 
commissioners, we have asked Statistics Canada to give priority to 
those candidates who were tested and proven to be qualified for the 
census representative position who were referred through the 
minister's office. That includes names given by members of

employee have unreported contact with targets of the service, 
travel to another region to meet a CSIS source without 
authorization, have tens of the thousands of dollars in unexplained

minister. Why on earth were the members of the CPA not well 
informed of the situation?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney General 
of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the case to which I referred made 
the point I wanted to express, namely, that not all those persons 
serving time for murder are career criminals, are dangerous 
offenders and there are exceptional circumstances. The case to 
which I referred was just that, an exceptional circumstance.
<P>
	In the course of my address yesterday before the police 
association I told its members that I am working with the solicitor 
general on proposals which we are going to bring to caucus and 
then to cabinet to change section 745 to deal with the issues that 
have been raised in the public debate that has gone on now for some 
months in this country.
<P>
	We have not ruled out the repeal of the section but I made the 
point yesterday that if we were to simply repeal, as the Reform 
Party would have us do, many people contend it would overlook 
the hard fact that serving time for murder are people in exceptional 
circumstances. That is exactly the illustration I made with the case 
to which the hon. member has referred.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Randy White (Fraser Valley West, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
would inform the justice minister that it is not just the Reform 
Party that wants the section repealed.
<P>
	In fact, yesterday the Canadian Police Association told the 
minister it would not support anything short of an absolute repeal 
of section 745, and that includes many other people in this country. 
No amendments will be supported.
<P>
	Why does the minister continue to tinker with this ridiculous law 
in the face of mountains of petitions, loud and persistent requests 
from victims, from police and from a majority of the members in 
the House of Commons?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney General

told the House, and as I told the police association yesterday, we 
are bringing forward proposals for discussion in caucus and in 
cabinet that will meet the issues that have been raised.
<P>
	It is important for at least the members of this party, if my hon. 
friend is not able to do it, to draw distinctions and to look at cases 
that are different. As we consider section 745 we shall consider all 
of its implications.
<P>
	The simple point that I made yesterday, I make today: all of 
those serving murder sentences are not necessarily in identical 
circumstances and we should bear that in mind as we look at 
section 745.

<P>
	On January 31, 1996, the following recommendation was made 
on page 55 of the report by the task force examining part I of the 
Canada Labour Code: ``That the government undertake an 
examination to determine the appropriateness of allowing RCMP 
officers to unionize and to conduct collective bargaining under 
legislation other than the Canada Labour Code.''
<P>
<B>(1455)</B>
<P>
	Yesterday the Solicitor General told the Canadian Police 
Association that he was refusing to allow RCMP officers to 
exercise their legitimate right to unionize. Does the minister not 
acknowledge that he has thus rejected out of hand the process of 
public consultation announced by the Minister of Labour 
concerning RCMP unionization?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Herb Gray (Leader of the Government in the House of 
Commons and Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the Sims committee had a very narrow term of reference which was 
to receive representation on the working of Part I of the Canada 
Labour Relations Act.
<P>
	Part I deals only with people who are working in the federally 
regulated private sector and does not deal in any way with public 
employees. While the Sims committee had some comments on the 
matter of labour relations and the RCMP, as far as I can see, it was 
not within its terms of reference.
<P>
	The section in the report did not deal with such things as the 
existing labour relations system within the RCMP, whereby the 
rank and file elect their own representatives to deal with RCMP 
management on such matters.
<P>
	Finally, I might add that any matter with respect to a change in 
what is currently in the RCMP act would be a matter to be brought 
to and considered by cabinet, then brought forward as legislation to 
this House. It is not a matter for a decision by me personally.
<P>
	As I also told the Canadian Police Association, there are a large 
number of legislative items to be dealt with in the House. Whether 
some people agree or not, these are the priorities of the 
government.

	<B>Mr. François Langlois (Bellechasse, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
only things the government has done since its election with respect 
to the RCMP have been to confirm the RCMP Commissioner's

prevent the RCMP from unionizing and, finally, to thumb its nose

with all due respect to the hon. member, I would like to correct 
something he said.

	The RCMP does not have the status of separate employer, which 
is a very specific situation. It is being looked into in consultation 
with the elected representatives of the rank and file of the RCMP.
<P>
	I would say further that one cannot overlook the existing labour 
relations structure within the RCMP. It appears there are those who 
do not agree with this but I have not received any information to the 
effect that it does not continue to be supported by most of the rank 
and file members of the force.
<P>
	Certainly we have great respect for all the members of the force 
and the important role they play in our society. Their well-being 
and their working conditions remain of great concern to the

the most open and liberal foreign ownership regimes in 
telecommunications of all countries in the world. We wait with 
impatience for some other countries to actually deliver on their 
promises of reciprocity which they have made so often.
<P>

if we take a look at the DTH decision which was made last week 
and the fact that cabinet was not prepared to overrule the policy 
decision which the CRTC made, basically what happened was that 
cabinet put the Canadian industry at a disadvantage to the 
American industry.

posing a question like that.
<P>
	Last year when we as a cabinet gave direction to the CRTC to set 
a framework which was going to lead to competition, it was that 
party which rose repeatedly to say we were interfering with the 
CRTC. It criticized us. It was not willing to take a stand with us in 
favour of competition.
<P>
	We walked a very careful line in deciding how we would 
formulate our direction to the CRTC. We stayed within the law in 
giving direction on policy matters. The CRTC implements those

chairman and all members of the House who bring this very 
important matter to the attention of the government.

	<B>Mr. Vic Althouse (Mackenzie, NDP):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for either the minister of trade or the minister of 
agriculture.
<P>
	The U.S. has claimed in arguments before the special trade panel 
now sitting that Canada was fully aware that its conversion of 
import quotas on supply managed products to tariffs violates the 
NAFTA, even though tariffication is permitted under the GATT and 
the World Trade Organization. Canadian officials say there is no 
evidence of intergovernmental memos on this issue.
<P>
	Can the minister give his word to the House that there is no 
documentation of any kind to prove the U.S. assertions, neither 
from a minister of the crown, past or present, nor from 
departmental officials, past or present, nor a statement issuing from 
any department which may jeopardize Canada's position vis-à-vis 
the U.S. in this dispute?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Ralph E. Goodale (Minister of Agriculture and 
Agri-Food, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, certainly to the very best of my 
knowledge and belief, no such documents exist. I have already 
asked my officials to confirm that to my satisfaction.
<P>
	I can tell the hon. member what I do know exists. It was 
delivered to me in Geneva in December 1993 when the initialling 
of the WTO agreement took place. It was a very clear, very strong 
legal opinion on behalf of the legal counsel acting for the 
Government of Canada that our position with respect to supply 
management was not only fully consistent with the WTO which 
was about to come into effect, but was also fully consistent with all 
of our obligations under the NAFTA.
<P>
<B>(1505 )</B>
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> My colleagues, this would bring to a close the 
question period, but I have notice of a point of order by the member 
for Skeena.

	<B>Mr. Mike Scott (Skeena, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of 
order. During the course of question period the Minister of Indian 
Affairs and Northern Development made a statement to the effect 
that I had refused an invitation to attend the Nisga'a signing 
ceremony on Friday of last week at Aiyansh. The minister knows 
this is totally false and I would ask him to withdraw this statement. 
It is not a matter of debate but a matter of record.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> I do not know exactly where this is going but the 
hon. minister is here. Perhaps he could clarify this situation.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Ron Irwin (Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern 
Development, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I was told by the Nisga'a

he was not invited, I am prepared to accept his word.

[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="CANADATRANSPORTATIONACT">CANADA TRANSPORTATION ACT</A></H3>
	The House resumed consideration of the motion that Bill C-14, 
an act to continue the National Transportation Agency as the 
Canadian Transportation Agency, to consolidate and revise the 
National Transportation Act, 1987 and the Railway Act and to 
amend or repeal other acts as a consequence, be read the third time 
and passed.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, indeed I think it important to put all arguments to the 
House when a bill is being studied, and the point of this one is to 
bring legislation on rail transportation up to date.
<P>
	In order to analyze this bill, I decided to use a specific example, 
because part of this bill concerns all of us and has a particular effect 
on certain regions of Quebec and Canada. I am talking about rail 
transportation and the sale of rail lines to private interests.
<P>
	The example I would like to use is that of the line between Gaspé 
and Matapedia, in the Gaspé region of eastern Quebec. For a 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1253"> 1253 </A></B>
<P>
number of years the fate of this line was up in the air, because there 
was some doubt as to its continued maintenance.
<P>
	Under the old way of doing things, under the present legislation, 
there must be public hearings. The government, when it wants to 
close a line, has to go through the transportation agency, hold 
hearings and get opinions.
<P>
	Under the new bill, and this is very important for the future of 
these lines, there is no provision for public hearings where people 
can come and present reasons why a rail link is important to their 
community. For example, the year after we were elected, there was 
a rumour the Gaspé-Matapedia line would be closed. Public 
hearings were held. Hearings were even organized by community 
groups and, as the result of representations made, we succeeded in 
keeping the line running.
<P>
	Today, under the new legislation, things would read differently: 
the owner would simply have to announce its intention to divest 
itself of the line, and the people in the community would have only 
two weeks for consultations on the merits of buying the line.
<P>
<B>(1510)</B>
<P>
	We are confronted with a situation where negotiations could 
easily be conducted behind the scene, which could favour private 
owners. We have a very real case in point here. The rumour has it, 
and there have been reports in the press these past few days saying 
that the Gaspe-Matapedia line may be sold to a company like 
Irving, which already owns several similar properties.
<P>
	In the meantime however, the local population does not know 
how to react, for lack of information on whether or not the line is 
for sale.
<P>
	The bill provides that railway companies shall prepare a three 
year plan concerning the lines they intend to sell, but this provision 
is of no use in 1996. The companies have not yet been asked to 
table these plans. Assuming that the bill became law by the end of 
the current session and that the companies prepared their 
plans-because they are required only to prepare plans, to have 
them on file, not to file them-the stakeholders are in no position 
to prepare their case, to determine if there would be any potential 
local buyers. Instead, this will encourage the bringing of railway 
lines under the control of foreign interests or big money.
<P>
	Therefore, there is no guarantee that the line will remain open in 
the medium term. Let us take a case like that of Irving, a company 
involved in many areas, such as lumbering, automobile gasoline 
and rail transportation. At times, its interests may conflict with that 
of the local population.
<P>
	The bill, as it stands, does not provide well enough that the local 
population, those who live in that part of the country will have the 
opportunity to thoroughly analyze the situation, take their 
responsibilities, and find out if local interests would offer to buy.
<P>
	In this case, the example of the Gaspe-Matapedia line could be 
taken one step further by asking ourselves: providing sufficient 
notice was given, what would keep the solidarity fund recently 
established for the Lower St. Lawrence and Gaspesian Peninsula 
from being used to enable a consortium of local interests-this 
money could be put together with money from other local sources, 
local interests-to buy the facility and give it a future. Let us stop 
throwing back into question, year after year, the future of this line.
<P>
	I notice one disappointing fact and that is the fact that the current 
federal government does not care the least for regional 
development. It has really given in to market forces as we see in all 
the legislation it introduces, of which this is but one example. They 
say they will let the market forces come into play as much as 
possible, and under the guise of deregulating, they are tolerating 
things that do not promote regional development in Quebec and 
Canada.
<P>
	I believe it would be in the interest of the Liberal majority, in 
particular members from the regions, to amend this bill so as to 
give people in the areas more time to find out about the sale of a 
rail line, about sale conditions, about the cost and about what kind 
of development can take place around the line in question.
<P>
	Other points could be raised. Before, carriers could enter into 
secret deals to provide services at the lowest possible prices in an 
effort to stay competitive. They could then remain on the market. 
However, the law required these agreements to be submitted to the 
National Transportation Agency. This requirement will be 
eliminated. Owners of short line railways will no longer have some 
kind of guarantee that they will have access to major national 
railways.
<P>
	In our opinion, this should be corrected to give equal 
opportunities to owners of short line railways, as there is an 
increasing number of such railways. We must ensure that these 
short line railways have a future, that they have the same 
opportunities as major carriers, so that these people are not sold 
out.
<P>
<B>(1515)</B>
<P>
	The other point I wanted to raise is that there is no assurance that 
there will be a requirement that short line railways be connected to 
the major networks. I think the bill should be amended to allow for 
the smooth operation of short line railways. These railways are of 
local or regional interest and would help develop the whole region.
<P>
	This bill has another flaw: it says that, in the future, any short 
line railway can be declared to be in the general interest of Canada. 
This situation could hurt short line railway owners, since they must 
co-operate with major railways such as Canadian National and 
Canadian Pacific, and since that decision would not give these 
owners the leeway that they would otherwise have if they were  
regulated only by provincial laws. This would in fact make a lot 
more sense, considering that almost all short lines are sections of a 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1254"> 1254 </A></B>
<P>
railroad in a province. Therefore, they should really be governed by 
provincial legislation. However, the federal government is giving 
itself the right to rule that any short line is beneficial to Canada. In 
so doing, it more or less duplicates the legislation governing 
owners.
<P>
	Sure, it is necessary to update the legislation on railroad 
transportation. However, the bill does not adequately take into 
account the experience gained over the last 5, 10, 15 or 20 years 
regarding the abandonment of railway lines.
<P>
	All these obstacles and difficulties have helped us develop an 
expertise. In fact, local groups that have developed some expertise 
in the submission of briefs opposing the abandonment of lines are 
being somewhat deprived of that expertise, since the bill will no 
longer allow them to use it in the same fashion. These groups will 
no longer have adequate information to help local authorities 
decide what to do when faced with this kind of situation.
<P>
	I should also point out that clause 99 does not stipulate that the 
agency must conduct an environmental study before authorizing 
the construction of a railway line. This seems unusual, given an 
increasing awareness in Quebec and in Canada regarding the need 
to assess the environmental impact of any decision of an economic 
nature.
<P>
	In short, this is more or less an omnibus bill dealing with several 
issues. My main concern is with the railway sector. I believe we 
must use concrete examples, such as the Gaspe-Matapedia line, to 
show that the bill will become acceptable, if some amendments 
allow local interests to be well informed about the decisions that 
will be made by current owners. Furthermore, we must ensure that 
they have time to draft counterproposals, so that these lines can be 
taken over as quickly as possible by local interest groups, thus 
avoiding the situation that we are currently experiencing with the 
sale of CN.
<P>
<B>(1520)</B>
<P>
	As we are now finding out, because of insufficient control over 
the sale of shares, an architectural work of art like the Quebec 
bridge is now owned in part by American interests. In any 
discussion about cultural heritage, whether in Quebec or in Canada, 
it is important to prevent anything of the sort from happening 
again.
<P>
	I would urge the government to make sure that the final version 
of the bill provides for a more transparent process. We all agree on 
the need for planning and for companies to make plans, saying: 
``Over the next three years, we intend to get rid of such and such a 
line'', but they should be required to submit their plans to the 
National Transportation Agency, not just keep them on  file. 
Second, we should have access to this information as quickly as 
possible so that the public is kept informed.
<P>
	Time frames of 15 days or 60 days, at present, are inadequate. 
More time is required, again, to protect local interests.
<P>
	Let us hope that the approved version of the bill will include 
these changes and that, if the Gaspé-Matapédia line changes 
hands, this will be in the best interests of Gaspesians, Quebecers 
and the people of eastern Quebec and all of eastern Canada, 
because this is a high quality line. This line, which once provided 
Gaspesians with their only means of travel in the summertime, has 
become a major touristic tool. It is therefore important that those 
who want to ensure its continued development have the opportunity 
to buy it, in order to avoid unpleasant surprises like seeing the new 
owner close down the line just a few years from now for reasons 
that do not necessarily take into account the interests of the region.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay East, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, one of my 
constituents involved in the tourism industry suggested that rather 
than me being referred to just as the member for Kootenay East, I 
be referred to as the member from the part of the beautiful, 
fabulous, magnificent, sensational, thrilling Canadian Rockies.
<P>
	I had a look at the old Bill C-101, which was the evil twin of this 
bill, and found a speech which I had actually prepared for Bill 
C-101. The design of the bill at first reading was rather interesting 
because it was designed at a time when it was going to go to a 
committee. There were things in the speech where we were 
basically saying: ``The difficulty is that we really cannot trust the 
Liberals in this process because of the way they have been seen to 
use pile drivers to put nails into boards. We really cannot believe 
that they are really to be open to the amendments that are 
required''.
<P>
	What is particularly scary as I reviewed this speech, which I 
should note I never had the opportunity to give, is that I realized 
that virtually everything in this speech came to pass. Therefore I go 
ahead.
<P>
	I come from a riding which relies heavily on rail transport. 
Mining and forestry combine to make up a substantial part of the 
economy in Kootenay East. It is understandable that when I had my 
office contact companies in my constituency for their opinions on 
the bill we were inundated with responses. I have compiled a 
substantial amount of information. We received from some 
companies detailed amendments to the bill which I will outline in 
my remarks.
<P>
	Before I carry on, as I say, this was a speech which was intended 
to be made at first reading in the hopes that the Liberals would 
actually follow through on their word and would make this a 
workable process and make the legislation better. However, they 
did not. All of the companies responding to our request for 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1255"> 1255 </A></B>
<P>
information  made it clear they feel strongly that the bill is vital to 
maintain and enhance competition in Canada's railways.
<P>
<B>(1525)</B>
<P>
	One forest product company in my riding told our constituency 
office that it no longer ships its plywood and lumber by rail. Rather 
than be captive to rail, this company trucks its plywood to Calgary. 
From there, it is shipped down east by rail but the company has a 
choice of railways in Calgary.
<P>
	For the past several years this company has shipped its lumber 
by truck south to the U.S. to be loaded in rail cars there. It is just a 
matter of 30 miles south of the U.S. border, which is the bottom of 
my constituency, where there are two U.S. rail companies that have 
freight yards.
<P>
	The person we talked to said that it was cheaper to go through 
that whole process than to simply put the wood on rail cars to the 
point of origin. Lumber is also shipped east directly by truck.
<P>
	I do not blame this company for taking these measures to 
maintain and retain its position as a viable company. However, 
having said that, I have to point out the pounding of our park roads 
and the pounding they are taking in my constituency.
<P>
	In my constituency I have Yoho National Park and Radium Hot 
Springs. They sit adjoining Banff and Jasper Parks. Highway 1 
goes through there and the amount of traffic that goes across there, 
plus Highway 16 through Jasper, is growing. It is absolutely 
immense. The pounding that is going on on those roads is beyond 
all comprehension. However, the companies are forced to take 
these moves, to do these things which are really deleterious and 
detrimental to the parks and to the environment of the parks 
because of the ongoing legislation of the Tories and the Liberals.
<P>
	This issue happens to fit hand in glove with the issue of funding 
our national parks. As a critic of the heritage department, one of the 
largest concerns I have is how we will continue to fund these roads 
and continue to make them safe. That is an issue which is directly 
related to the issue of rail and this rail act.
<P>
	In the southeast corner of British Columbia, the out valley in my 
constituency, coal country, there is deep concern about the proposal 
to eliminate the railway statutory common carrier obligations. The 
people vehemently oppose this proposal since it would practically 
render competitive access provisions ineffective. It is extremely 
important that legislative reform allow Canadian shippers to have 
access to a truly competitive transportation environment so that our 
goods can get to world markets at globally competitive prices.
<P>
	Another coal company in the same area said that the threat to 
competitive rail prices lies in the overtaxation taking place on rail 
companies. This example could also be attributed to the forest 
product company that I mentioned earlier. Canadian railways are 
taxed at a rate of 53 per cent more than the U.S. and this bill does 
nothing to address this serious problem.
<P>
	As a Reform MP, I am dedicated to give credit for any positives 
if they exist. In this case there are a few places where I can 
comment on the brighter aspects of this bill. My understanding is 
that one aspect of the bill, actually supported by a majority of 
shippers and the Reform Party, is the ability of railways to abandon 
track that is no longer economically viable. The reason for this is 
that shippers hope that a more cost efficient railway will eventually 
translate into benefits for them.
<P>
	We could also see smaller private rail companies pick up these 
abandoned tracks and operate them with low overhead and a higher 
rate of return. However, there are many negatives. As mentioned, 
smaller private rail companies could take over the operation of 
smaller track lines. However, this could mean tracks located within 
provincial boundaries would not fall under the new Canada 
Transportation Act but instead be regulated under provincial 
jurisdiction.
<P>
	A classic example, in this case in my constituency, is where the 
CP Rail track comes through the Crow's Nest Pass, passes through 
Sparwood on its way to Fernie on its way to the coast. The 
difficulty is that the spur line which services three mines, two of 
which are not associated with CP Rail, would be at the mercy of the 
following little activity.
<P>
	If CP Rail said it wants to abandon this line and does so and a 
subsidiary of CP Rail picks up the line, then these two companies, 
which are not associated with CP Rail, would come under the direct 
power of the subsidiary company of CP Rail. This would mean that 
it would be able to charge the rates it wanted to and the Canada 
Transportation Act would not apply. They would come under 
provincial jurisdiction. There is much concern on the part of the 
people in my constituency over that little sleight of hand.
<P>
<B>(1530)</B>
<P>
	Unfortunately, many provinces have no or inadequate legislation 
to deal with rail transport. This bill has made an attempt to deal 
with this problem but it has been unable to rectify it. Smaller rail 
lines or short lines would be of possible benefit in regard to service 
and rates but there remains the fact that short lines will still have to 
feed on to the main line of CP or CN Rail. These companies 
therefore do not lose the traffic, just the costs of running it, over the 
now abandoned or sold lines. This leaves the shipper now having to 
negotiate rates with two separate companies. In the example I just 
gave we can see how that could become very convoluted and 
anti-competitive.
<P>
	A final concern on short line operators is the possibility of main 
line railways using the availability of abandonment as a threat 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1256"> 1256 </A></B>
<P>
during rate negotiations. This would leave the shipper forced to 
make a deal rather than lose access to the main line.
<P>
	Other concerns have been outlined for us with respect to the 
increasing lack of recourse a shipper has at its disposal to obtain 
relief to a transportation rate or service.
<P>
	In section 27(2) a shipper is required to demonstrate that it will 
suffer significant prejudice if the relief sought is not otherwise 
available. There is concern first that the term ``significant 
prejudice'' is not defined in the bill, nor is it a term which has been 
introduced or verbalized in the previous railways legislation.
<P>
	I see from my notes that in spite of the fact that shippers have 
lobbied hard to have this clause deleted from the bill and the 
government had recently seemed to be coming around on this 
concept, it nonetheless quickly extinguished Reform's motion at 
report stage which called for the deletion of section 27(2). As I said 
at the outset of my speech, the difficulty we on this side of the 
House have is that the words of the Liberal government very 
frequently do not match the reality of what it actually follows 
through on.
<P>
	Further, section 34(1) of the proposed legislation enables the 
agency to award damages against a shipper should it be found that 
an application is frivolous or vexatious. Unfortunately, this will 
leave many shippers spending a lot of time and money trying to 
determine whether or not there is a valid argument.
<P>
	Section 40(3) of the National Transportation Act, 1987 enables 
the agency to grant an interim injunction in an appropriate case. 
This provision does not appear in the bill. If this provision is not 
included in the bill, and it is not, it will mean that unsatisfactory 
service will remain intact until a final determination is made by the 
agency.
<P>
	I also note that clause 112 of the bill does not clearly define the 
terms of commercially fair and reasonable. The language of this 
clause should be defined as a rate which does not cause either party 
to operate below cost. The reality is that the government has been 
unwilling to amend or delete this clause. A motion put forward at 
report stage to delete clause 112 was also shot down by the 
government despite the vocal concerns expressed by the shippers.
<P>
	It really makes me wonder. In this and in past debates I have 
observed the Liberals consistently talking about how they would 
change the system to make it fair, balanced and equitable. They 
have said they would expedite the system, when clearly all they do 
is turn around, give us the words and give us the very old Liberal 
actions which date back to 1867.
<P>
	One forest company in my riding said that it spent $6 million a 
year on rail transportation. It fears because of the points I have just 
raised that it will be at the mercy of  the rail line which will most 
likely face increased rates with the implementation of this bill.
<P>
	This was the concluding paragraph in my previous speech: In 
conclusion, it is important that we see substantial amendments
<P>
some of which are included in the legislation. However, because of 
the intricacies and potential impact of this legislation, and the fact 
that this Liberal government has yet to exhibit an ability to listen 
and understand the concern of Canadians, the legislative process 
for this legislation is suspect. We are hoping we are wrong, but fear 
we are right. One thing Canadians can count on, as Canada's 
national opposition, the Reform Party is going to become extreme 
in its vigilance to see that the government really listens.
<P>
<B>(1535)</B>
<P>
	We tried. We really did try as we try on so many issues. No 
matter what the issue is, we try to make the government listen but 
the government will not listen. It has an aggressive growing 
arrogance. Sooner or later, Liberal members are going to be 
revealed for the people they truly are.
<P>

legislative process it went through was a joke.

<P>
	<B>Mr. Ménard:</B> Pardon me, Mr. Speaker, but there has been a 
misunderstanding. I thought the government majority wanted to 
debate this bill, especially since we support this measure. I would 
like to speak to Bill C-3 if I may, Mr. Speaker.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> Dear colleague, as I understand it and you must 
understand, we have already dealt with this bill, this motion. We 
are now debating Bill C-7. I believe you wanted to discuss Bill C-3. 
No member rose to speak. You may seek unanimous consent. Do 
you wish to do that?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ménard:</B> Mr. Speaker, I simply want to say that I find it 
strange that the House is debating a bill at third reading and the 
government does not even bother to discuss its own piece of 
legislation. It was agreed that we would have one speaker from 
each side. If it is too late,  then it is too late. However, this is a 
strange way of conducting the business of this House.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Robichaud:</B> Mr. Speaker, I did hear you ask if there was a 
debate, but I think that members thought that the House was ready 
for the question. We said ``question''. You put the question and we 
voted on it.
<P>
	I am sorry. I do not want people to think that members from this 
side of the House refused to discuss the bill. I believe you were 
very clear. You asked if we wanted to debate the bill and no one got 
up. Consequently, we voted on it.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Harvard:</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise on the same point of order. We 
had a long debate on Bill C-7 yesterday. The government spoke and 
members of the opposition parties spoke. As far as I am 
concerned-
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> We are on Bill C-3.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Harvard:</B> We are on Bill C-7, are we not, Mr. Speaker?
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> In answer to your question, we are to be on Bill 
C-7 but we are now discussing Bill C-3.
<P>
	The hon. member for Hochelaga-Maisonneuve understood that 
he would be speaking on Bill C-3. When I called for debate, I 
looked around the House and there was no one rising. Therefore, I 
put the question and it was passed. That seems to have been the 
agreement of the House.
<P>
	I have explained that to the hon. member who has raised some 
objections. However, it has passed. I asked the hon. member if he 
would like to ask the House for unanimous consent. He said no, or 
at least that is what I understood. Therefore, we will proceed with 
Bill C-7.
<P>
	We are now on Bill C-7 and I am asking if there is any debate on 
Bill C-7.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Question.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> If there is debate, we will hear it.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Roger Pomerleau (Anjou-Rivière-des-Prairies, BQ):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I will share my time with a colleague.
<P>
	I am pleased to discuss Bill C-7, which is the former Bill C-52. 
As my colleagues pointed out on numerous occasions during the 
previous debates on this legislation, the Bloc Quebecois' position 
is based, as with many other bills debated in this House, on the 
government's alleged transparency or, rather, on its lack of 
transparency.
<P>
	During the last election campaign, the Liberal Party of Canada 
used its now famous red book as its book of promises.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1258"> 1258 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1545)</B>
<P>
	But we know that the government has broken its promises more 
than once, and I give one example that  comes to mind. Most of my 
Liberal colleagues campaigned on a promise of scrapping the GST, 
and we know what became of that promise. The GST is still with 
us, and it will still be around for the next election, where it may 
become yet another promise.
<P>
	As the members on this side of the House take a malicious 
pleasure in quoting from the red book in order to remind the 
government of its broken promises, I would like to read from it two 
brief passages. The first is on page 92 and reads as follows:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>In the House of Commons, a Liberal government will give MPs a greater role 
in drafting legislation, through House of Commons committees. These 
committees will also be given greater influence over government expenditures.</BLOCKQUOTE>
A little later, on page 95, we read:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>We will take an approach of openness in decision-making.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	These passages are short, but they speak volumes about the 
willingness of the government to keep its election promises. And 
yet, during the last election, transparency and the openness of the 
decision making process to all levels was a real profession of faith 
with the Liberals.
<P>
	It is my contention that the government has failed, in Bill C-7 
before us today, to put in place a mechanism for demonstrating the 
full transparency of the government. There is no longer any doubt 
that the government is making no effort to keep its promises, as can 
be seen with what happened to the GST. A point by point analysis 
of the bill confirms this. You can hear every note of the lullaby the 
government is hoping to lull us off to sleep with.
<P>
	Let us keep in mind that the government opposed the motion we 
proposed on public funding of political parties. It was my hon. 
colleague, the hon. member for Richelieu, who proposed at the 
beginning of the session that the same thing be done in Ottawa as in 
Quebec City as regards public funding of political parties, so that 
the Liberals would no longer be funded by business, but rather by 
individuals.
<P>
	To quote an expression that is very popular in Quebec, ``He who 
pays the piper calls the tune''. This government, this party is 
funded by major companies, banks, organizations of all kinds, to 
the tune of $25,000, $30,000 or $50,000. So the ties between these 
two groups are quite obvious. But it was the Liberals who 
campaigned with the promise of cleaning up Canadian politics by 
eliminating this rather questionable cronyism. Yet this government 
has demonstrated to us, unequivocally, its intention to preserve the 
privileges it holds with those who contributed to its campaign 
coffers.
<P>
	The best example came very recently, in the last budget, when 
the Minister of Finance announced the creation of a technical 
committee on business taxation, at least five members of which had 
together contributed over $80,000 to the party's coffers. The entire 
question  of tax havens is being studied by those who are 
themselves the heaviest users of them. Are we to conclude that the 
government adopted a transparent approach here? Hardly.
<P>
	Let us keep in mind as well the famous bill on lobbyists. It was 
meant to make the relationships between them and the government 
more transparent. Here again, the Liberals bowed to the lobbyists, 
who managed to amend the bill aimed at controlling their own 
influence. Are we to conclude that the government adopted a 
transparent approach here? Hardly.
<P>
	We know that the Department of Public Works and Government 
Services we are dealing with here is one of the hugest and most 
influential departments, controlling as it does the procurement of 
federal goods and services-we are, of course, dealing in billions 
here. It administers all contracts entered into by the government, 
and has one of the biggest portfolios around.
<P>
	It is therefore up to the government to take all necessary 
measures to ensure that the money spent through this department is 
spent in accordance with our laws and regulations and, if possible, 
in a transparent way.
<P>
	The Liberals promised members of Parliament that they would 
be allowed to monitor government spending much more closely. 
This is another red book promise. Well, it is in this very area that 
members of Parliament should get involved.
<P>
<B>(1550)</B>
<P>
	It would be logical, cost effective and desirable for us, the 
elected members of this House, to have the right to monitor this 
government's numerous expenditures, but this right is not spelled 
out. The federal government should follow the example of the 
Quebec National Assembly, which demonstrated how effective 
such a monitoring process can be.
<P>
	Unfortunately, we must recognize once again that the 
government made some very nice promises that it has no intention 
of keeping. Today during question period, we talked about the 
appointment of census representatives. We are being asked to 
provide the names of people in our ridings who could help conduct 
the census but they will, of course, come after the priority lists 
drawn up by the department. So much for transparency.
<P>
	Also, as elected representatives of the people, we have a right to 
find out about the money spent in our ridings. We have a duty to 
check if the expenditures ordered in our ridings by departmental 
officials are really justified. Otherwise, how can we know if they 
are useful? Should we not find out if these expenditures are 
legitimate? Is this not the reason why we were elected? Why should 
the people elect members of Parliament if we have no say in how 
taxpayers' money is spent? We might as well have only a govern-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1259"> 1259 </A></B>
<P>
ment and get rid of the opposition, because  monitoring the 
government's spending powers is one of our basic duties.
<P>
	It is deplorable that we as members of the official opposition 
have to raise this point, when we should be granted such a basic 
right without having to ask for it. As elected members of 
Parliament, we are accountable to the people so long as we have a 
say in public matters.
<P>
	We are consulted, we are asked to vote on a considerable number 
of issues, yet we are denied the means to check in the field if the 
government's decisions are consistent with the recommendations 
made and legislation passed by this House.
<P>
	Of course, elected members have the power to question the 
government on all public expenditures. But how can we carry out in 
good faith our duties in this House without the means to really find 
out about the activities of the federal public service? That is the 
basic question.
<P>
	There is another point to consider: the accountability of our 
officials. As you know, the federal public service is the largest 
employer in Canada. Day in day out, public officials make 
decisions that have or could have financial implications. The costs 
involved, as minimal as they may be individually, add up to a huge 
amount.
<P>
	In times when we have to put our fiscal house in order, it is 
imperative that we get a grip on government expenditures. And I 
will remind you that, at the very beginning, the Bloc Quebecois 
asked that an ad hoc committee be established to review 
government expenditures, item by item, but we never got an 
answer on that.
<P>
	The public administration must conduct a self-examination to 
assess the expenses incurred by the various departments, including 
the one at issue today, namely Public Works and Governmental 
Services Canada.
<P>
	As I said earlier, this department handles most of the federal 
government's goods and services procurement contracts. We must 
therefore make sure that it does not make any excessive or 
unnecessary expenditures. Judging from the auditor general's 
report, year after year, I would say that many expenditures are 
questionable.
<P>
	The Bloc Quebecois had suggested putting in place a system 
whereby public servants could blow the whistle on squandering. If 
implemented, that solution might result in significant reductions in 
government spending in the short, medium and long terms. As for 
the public servants who oppose that measure, they should be told 
the facts. They should know that it is in their best interest to 
participate in this type of exercise if they want the government to 
rely more on them, instead of contracting out. It would also be in 
their interest to participate, because budgets are being reduced and 
departments must face cuts, because of the ever increasing deficit 
and debt.  This is not very reassuring in terms of their long term job 
security.
<P>
	As regards contracting out, over the last few years, there has 
been a definite trend showing that the federal public service is 
relying increasingly on that process.
<P>
<B>(1555)</B>
<P>
	The government contracts more and more outside the public 
service. If it results in savings for the government and, indirectly, 
for taxpayers, and if it stimulates the private sector, so much the 
better. However, we should be able to know for sure that it does not 
promote patronage and the awarding of contracts to friends of the 
government. This is why much greater transparency is required and 
why opposition members, regardless of their allegiance, must have 
much more direct access to information.
<P>
	The total figure for such contracts from the Department of Public 
Works and Government Services is several billion dollars every 
year. Such a level of spending should be subject to clear and fair 
guidelines. The stakes are too high for federal public servants, 
contracting firms and Canadians.
<P>
	The government will soon have to tell us what it intends to do 
about the contracting out process. It had a chance to do so with Bill 
C-7, but it did not. I cannot understand why the government did not 
take this opportunity to innovate. Measures must be taken to avoid 
the wasting of public funds. The government probably thought that 
we would turn a blind eye on that bill, since it is supposedly just a 
bill establishing a new Department of Public Works and 
Government Services.
<P>
	We see nothing in this legislation that will make the contracting 
out process more transparent, and that will make us, members of 
Parliament, more responsible, since we do not have the necessary 
information.
<P>
	With this bill, the government distances itself from its election 
commitment and its red book promises. It distances itself from its 
obligation to ensure maximum transparency in all its activities. We 
will continue to strongly condemn that as long as we are in this 
House. If the government is afraid to give greater transparency to 
its actions and decisions, then it is hiding things from the public.
<P>
	If the government has things to hide, then it is doing things that it 
should not be doing. We have no choice but to come to that 
conclusion. Some day though, we will know what is going on with 
this government.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Laurin:</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. Just before 
we begin to discuss Bill C-7, it seems to me that there was 
confusion among certain members, both in the opposition and in 
government. Each had at least one speaker on Bill C-3 and it 
appears that when you invited the speakers to take the floor, neither 
of the two speakers heard you.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1260"> 1260 </A></B>
<P>
	We wonder what has become of Bill C-3, since we have not 
voted on it, nor have we spoken to it. We are wondering, from 
a procedural point of view, how you see this bill, because we never 
voted on it, you never asked if we were for or against, in any case, 
we said nothing. First of all, I would like your answer to this 
question so that we can determine if there should not be some sort 
of solution to satisfy government as well as opposition members.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Ms. Marlene Catterall (Ottawa West, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, on 
the same point of order, may I suggest that it is entirely clear that 
the Speaker did call for debate. Seeing no member rising for debate 
the Speaker called the question. The question was carried and the 
Speaker so announced.
<P>
	I am aware that my colleague on the other side of the House is 
disappointed. A colleague from our side is prepared and would like 
to speak on the bill. If the opposition agrees, we are quite prepared 
to give consent to go back to Bill C-3 for one speaker only from 
each party, provided that we proceed with and complete the 
business on Bill C-7 first. Then my colleague from the other side 
may put his request for unanimous consent to the House. We will 
be quite pleased to give it.
<P>
<B>(1600 )</B>
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> We have a situation where I need unanimous 
consent. I want everybody to know what is going on. We are now 
debating Bill C-7. But for one second I am going to put that to one 
side.
<P>
	I have also a point of order. I am going put it aside until I know 
what I am doing.
<P>
	I have been asked by the whip of the Bloc Quebecois to return to 
Bill C-3, notwithstanding that the bill has been passed, so that one 
of their members can put his speech on the record.
<P>
	At this point we have had an intervention by a member of the 
Liberal Party saying, yes, that party is prepared at some time, 
which I will clarify in just a minute, to go back to Bill C-3 for one 
speaker from each party. That is where we are right now.
<P>
	I have not heard at this point from our colleagues from the 
Reform Party. I presume they are in agreement. Is that correct?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stinson:</B> The bill has already been passed, Mr. Speaker.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> All we are asking is for unanimous consent to 
have one speaker from each party, if each party so desires, to go on 
the record with a speech. Do members understand what is in front 
of us?
<P>
	<B>Ms. Catterall:</B> Yes.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> Is it the pleasure of the House to allow, at a future 
time which I will describe in just a minute, for one speaker from 
each party to make one speech on Bill C-3? Is that agreed?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Catterall:</B> Mr. Speaker, I indicated quite clearly that my 
party would give consent following the passage of Bill C-7. I would 
ask my hon. colleague opposite to withdraw his request for consent 
until we have completed consideration of Bill C-7 in order to not 
further confuse the business of the House.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> It was not my intention to intervene immediately. 
It was my intention to finish up with Bill C-7. That is what we are 
doing. Then at the end of Bill C-7, I will invite the hon. whip of the 
Bloc Quebecois to put his motion for unanimous consent, as I have 
described it here. That is what we are going to do.
<P>
	Right now we have a deal. I know you will go with the deal after. 
But right now I am staying on Bill C-7. That is where we are. Bill 
C-3 is going to come after Bill C-7. All right, we all understand the 
rules.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Fillion:</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order.
<P>
	In the misunderstanding that arose over Bill C-3, you must, at 
some point, have asked the Bloc Quebecois, through our speaker 
just a moment ago, the hon. member for 
Anjou-Rivière-des-Prairies, to speak to Bill C-7, when normally, 
if procedure had been followed with Bill C-3, I would have had the 
floor for 20 minutes.
<P>
	Given the situation, will you allow me to speak for 20 minutes 
on Bill C-7?
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> Yes. That is understood. And the hon. member 
who preceded you was also entitled to 20 minutes. So you have 20 
minutes. You have the floor.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilbert Fillion (Chicoutimi, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to speak to Bill C-7, which is a resurrection of Bill C-52, an 
act to establish the Department of Public Works and Government 
Services and to amend and repeal certain acts.
<P>
	The purpose of this bill is to join the former Department of 
Public Works and the Government Telecommunications Agency.
<P>
<B>(1605)</B>
<P>
	This bill could have done a lot more, however, for the people we 
represent, especially as regards the transparency the government is 
supposed to display before its electors. I see no transparency in the 
bill before us, on the contrary.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1261"> 1261 </A></B>
<P>
	Since its election, the Bloc has been asking the government to be 
totally transparent in connection with its expenditures. The 
Department of Public Works and Government Services is the 
department where the federal  government should be cleaning 
house from top to bottom. It is a shame this bill does not improve 
transparency or access to information. Yet this is what the 
government promised in the red book, but, as we know, the 
promises in the red book fade.
<P>
	I would first like to raise the matter of the awarding of federal 
contracts. At the moment, anyone outside the government or the 
public service trying to submit a bid must deal with a very 
cumbersome system. The department has set up a series of 
impressive obstacles to confound those trying to understand how 
contracts are awarded under the federal system.
<P>
	There are in fact innumerable contractors who are looking for 
contracts from the department and who initially fail to discover and 
subsequently fail to understand all the intricacies of the 
government structure. I should have kept track of the number of 
constituents who complained either to me or to my staff about this, 
since the elections in 1993. Things are so complicated, the federal 
government itself paid agencies in order to understand how this 
administrative approach works.
<P>
	Here is an example that I personally consider a good one. Last 
year, the centre d'incubation technologique d'entreprise-Cité 
2001-in the Outaouais region trained some 40 business 
executives to enable them to find their way round the chaos of 
federal contracts. The centre had noted that only 1 to 5 per cent of 
federal contracts awarded in the region, totalling some $2 billion, 
had been awarded to Quebec contractors. Not a very high 
percentage.
<P>
	So, Cité 2001 studied the computerized federal bidding system 
for these 40 businesses. The results were decisive, and a number of 
these firms now do business with the government. However, we 
have to ask ourselves why these people did not bid previously. Why 
were they not doing business with the federal government? Were 
things too complicated, was there too much paperwork or were bids 
made and then dropped because the criteria were too difficult to 
target?
<P>
	So a publicly funded pilot project was needed in order to look at 
the system and understand how it works so people could deal with 
the federal government. If ridicule could kill, I know a lot of people 
who would be out of it.
<P>
	Not all regions were as fortunate as the Outaouais. On the other 
hand, the Outaouais is not fortunate enough to be represented by 
members of the Bloc Quebecois. So much for that. In regions some 
call remote, just imagine the hard time our businesses have in 
dealing with the federal government. Of course they complain to 
their MPs about the process, eligibility criteria, or the awarding of 
contracts they consider unfair. This is the case in my riding.
<P>
<B>(1610)</B>
<P>
	As for transparency, in 1994, my colleague from Richelieu 
wanted the federal government to pass a law similar to that of 
Quebec concerning political party funding. Of course, the Liberals 
refused to go along with this.
<P>
	Even though it was rejected by the House, the Bloc Quebecois 
adopted these measures for its own funding. Yet, voters expect 
elected representatives to serve the common interest, not those of 
some privileged few. This bill would deny businesses the right to 
finance political parties.
<P>
	Voters who give political parties $5, $20 or $40 know very well 
they can expect nothing in return. But no one can convince me that 
a business is giving the party $50,000 just because it likes the MP's 
looks. How can a $3,000 a plate dinner bring together people who 
expect nothing in return? What goes up must come down.
<P>
	This political practice hides many dangers. One of them 
certainly is that friends of the government may be made aware in 
advance of contracts to be awarded by the Department of Public 
Works. The same logic applies to lobbyists. Lobbyists have much 
influence on the government because the companies or interests 
they represent are more often than not committed to a political 
party and, therefore, the government owes them something.
<P>
	Nothing in this bill would add to the openness of the contract 
awarding system. I hope the new minister will not follow in the 
footsteps of her predecessor as regards information given to 
members.
<P>
	The Bloc Quebecois believes it is very important to encourage 
accountability of members, to keep them informed and to consult 
them regarding the awarding of departmental contracts in their 
ridings. Indeed, whatever their political affiliation, members are 
elected to represent their ridings in Parliament.
<P>
	MPs, or at least we members of the Bloc Quebecois, know 
perfectly well that our responsibilities are not limited to legislative 
considerations. We have to study the country's affairs. We have to 
vote on a considerable number of things, but when it is time to 
check what is going on in our ridings to see if decisions made by 
the government comply with what was voted in the House, of 
course we are denied this right.
<P>
	A number of my colleagues have already mentioned the fact, 
because I am not the only one concerned with matters of openness, 
as you very well know. I want to quote again part of the letter the 
previous Minister of Supply and Services sent me when I requested 
a detailed list of all contracts over $100,000 awarded in my riding 
since October 1993.
<P>
	The minister replied that his department could not produce 
statistical data on contracts broken down by riding and that no 
document could provide the information I wanted. Finally, the 
minister said that, in order to answer my questions, he would have 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1262"> 1262 </A></B>
<P>
to make thorough searches in various sectors of his department and 
that, by and large, this would entail an excessive workload for his 
department's employees.
<P>
	Is this not the admission that this department's files are an 
incredible mess? It is also an obvious lack of collaboration and 
openness. The government could put in place a public monitoring 
body whose mandate would be to scrutinize contracts and thus 
ensure transparency.
<P>
	Such a body would be asked to list, on a monthly basis, all 
government contracts, in a simple, accessible and easy to 
understand manner. These lists would always be available. This is a 
step a government serious about transparency would take.
<P>
<B>(1615)</B>
<P>
	As an elected representative, it is my duty to know what the 
federal government is doing. How can an MP do his job seriously 
and earnestly in the House if he is denied the means he needs to 
check if the decisions made here reflect what is going on in the 
field. Believe me, sometimes, a lot is going on in our ridings.
<P>
	Giving members on all sides this kind of tool would restore the 
credibility of the political world, a world which has an urgent need 
to regain some prestige these days. This would provide people with 
a new instrument. At long last, the federal government would 
become accessible to all. I do not know if members opposite work 
this way, but for my part, when I think that something could be 
good for them, I tell them as soon as possible.
<P>
	It is desirable, on both sides of this House, I am sure, for people 
to have confidence in their elected representatives. Accordingly, 
the government should make sure such confidence is truly 
deserved.
<P>
	I find it deplorable that we, the members of the official 
opposition, have to intervene on such a fundamental issue. Our 
position is clear, and I believe it to be extremely important, since it 
shows the concern we have, and must have as elected 
representatives, with regard to controlling public expenditures, 
useless public expenditures which have such an impact on the 
government's economic health.
<P>
	We should never forget that we have an inheritance to pass on to 
our children. It must be worthwhile. It is not by throwing money 
out of the window, by wasting public funds that we will deal with 
the problem. In a way, we must, all of us, become auditors of 
government spending. We must do all we can to stop the 
haemorrhage that now characterizes this spending. I really do not 
understand why the government will not innovate. I also fail to 
understand why it will not seize the opportunity this bill provides 
and finally practice transparency.
<P>
	One of the principles we should all consider is the possibility of 
public servants blowing the whistle on the squandering of public 
funds. They know about most of the goods and services acquisition 
contracts. There is often some waste, it can go unnoticed. 
Therefore, we must implement a mechanism whereby public 
servants would have the right to blow the whistle on the 
squandering of public funds and whereby that right would be 
recognized and valued. Government expenditures are, for a good 
part, generated by public servants and that is quite normal given 
their role within the public service. However, the government 
machinery is not perfect. The annual report of the auditor general 
makes very disturbing revelations in that area.
<P>
	Public servants know very well that decisions are made but that 
they may be questionable. Let me give you a small example. This is 
something a public servant told me last week. The Canada Post 
Corporation launched a complete restructuring of post offices in 
my riding. They centralized all of their operations in one building. 
The old post office building will be disposed of. In addition to post 
office employees, there were also human resources development 
employees working in that building and they too will be relocated 
in a few weeks. Last week all the interior doors of the offices of that 
building were replaced. Where is the logic? The civil servant who 
mentioned it to me was shocked by that, and he was right. Why is 
the federal government doing such things? Because this civil 
servant fears reprisals, he does not intend to go any further in his 
whistle blowing.
<P>
<B>(1620)</B>
<P>
	This is a very simple example, a very small one. One can easily 
imagine that there are many more cases of the same nature.
<P>
	We can also question all the moves that are planned in various 
Quebec ridings by the Department of Human Resources 
Development. The minister responsible announced the closing of 
employment centres in several ridings. What will such moves cost? 
In my riding, there will be a refitting of the building where these 
civil servants will be housed. Are we saving money? Are we 
consulting the people involved in order to get the best prices? Of 
course not. Everything is done on the sly. Even managers, those 
who are supposed to make decisions, very often do not know what 
is going on: guidelines come from higher up.
<P>
	Civil servants also deplore another situation, and that is 
contracting out. In 1992-93, Treasury Board valued at $5.2 billion 
service contracts awarded outside the federal government. In my 
opinion this is enormous.
<P>
	The Bloc Quebecois would have liked the department, in its Bill 
C-7, to establish provisions forcing the government to regulate 
contracting out in a proper way. Public servants would agree with 
such a code. It would guarantee that when the government 
contracts out it does so only after having exhausted all its 
resources.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1263"> 1263 </A></B>
<P>
	How can you ask a company to put all its people to work on 
a project when public servants are being fired or shunted into a 
siding? It makes no sense.
<P>
	The government must therefore put in place a mechanism to 
respond to the people's expectations in terms of contracting out. In 
the present context, government employees and their unions 
certainly see contracting out as the evil thing to kill. If employees 
see contracting like this, it is because it is done any which way. The 
government must therefore clearly set out its policies concerning 
contracting out and how it uses it.
<P>
	If such a mechanism is put in place, I am convinced public 
servants will no longer see contracting out as another way of 
stealing their jobs. Contracting out is necessary, but I repeat, it 
must be used advisedly.
<P>
	Since you are signalling me that my time is up, Mr. Speaker, I 
will conclude by saying that the Bloc Quebecois, during the study 
in committee, made some proposals that were worthy of 
consideration. Naturally, the Bloc Quebecois is concerned with 
transparency. The government should take in consideration what 
the official opposition put to it. It would feel that much better for it.
<P>
	Access to information is crucial to the public, businesses in 
general and elected representatives. It would be a proof of good 
faith if the government were to accept putting these principles in its 
bill, but it refuses to listen. I am forced to believe that it is satisfied 
with the system. It had condemned it when the Conservatives were 
in power, but now that it is in control, it is going overboard.
<P>
	I truly hope that the people will remember that the government is 
refusing to give them information about its spending. I also hope 
the people will remember that it voted for a legislation that put it in 
competition with their businesses.
<P>
	Like the people of Lac-Saint-Jean, I do not trust this bill. It does 
not respect the most fundamental principles of democracy. It does 
not respect the moral values that must be part of each and every one 
of us. Worse still, this bill gives more power to a minister who 
already had too much.
<P>
	Since I was elected to defend the interests of the people I 
represent, I cannot accept that they be tricked by supporting a bill 
such as this one. I will vote against the bill, and I invite my 
colleagues to do the same.
<P>
<B>(1625)</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Roger Pomerleau (Anjou-Rivière-des-Prairies, BQ):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, because of a misunderstanding I spoke before my 
turn, but my colleague pointed out the difficulty companies, in 
Quebec in particular, but I suppose it is the same in Canada, have in 
negotiating with this department. This department has even to 
some extent paid people so it could understand what it was doing.
<P>
	The question is often raised in my riding as well: Why is it that it 
was so difficult to deal with this department? We note, and perhaps 
this is part of the answer, in the case of the task force on taxation 
that was established, that the people who will be paid to study the 
impact of tax havens are in the first place the main users of those 
tax havens and major contributors to the Liberal Party.
<P>
	In fact I think the difficulty in gaining access to this department 
has something to do with whether or not one contributes to the 
campaign fund. My colleague also pointed out that we-I think it 
was the member for Richelieu-had already introduced a bill a few 
years ago relating to party funding by the people. The Parti 
Quebecois for example is funded under this formula, in other words 
companies cannot make political donations, and the amounts 
individuals can give are limited to a maximum and the names of all 
people who contributed are made public.
<P>
	We know that the Bloc Quebecois is doing exactly the same 
thing. Even if the law allowed us to do otherwise, we voluntarily 
agreed to restrict our fund-raising to the private sector, to avoid 
business contributions, and to solicit relatively small amounts.
<P>
	I know that, like myself, my colleague is currently raising funds. 
We know what this means. It means that, night after night, we go 
door to door to solicit donations of $10, $15, $20 or $100 if we are 
lucky from the 200,000 members of the Parti Quebecois or the 
100,000 members of the Bloc Quebecois until we reach the goals 
we have set for ourselves.
<P>
	In this context, I would like to ask my colleague who knows 
about such things whether he feels like me that this fund-raising 
formula for political parties, which was never adopted and against 
which the Liberals voted-even those from Quebec who are 
familiar with the impact of this legislation in that 
province-increases transparency and allows people to buy their 
own freedom to a certain extent by helping fund political parties in 
this way.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Fillion:</B> Mr. Speaker, the hon. member first raised the issue 
of businesses which, through public works, should normally be 
able to bid and participate. As we can see, Bill C-7, clause 16 in 
particular, creates all sorts of difficulties for businesses wishing to 
deal with the federal government. Remember that this department 
handles more than $10 billion a year in supplies, services, 
equipment, and so forth for the federal government.
<P>
	No doubt small businesses, whether they are architect or 
engineering consultant firms, have a very hard time doing business 
with the government. But if you look elsewhere, you realize that 
some businesses having many more employees, larger companies, 
through lobbyists and employees they pay just to gain access to 
government, go all out to negotiate contracts involving large sums 
of money and contribute, through lobbyists, to party election funds. 
Eventually, the party's coffers are well  filled, so members of this 
governement do not have to beg for $2 here or $5 there to fund their 
activities.
<P>

<P>
<HR>

<P>
	My mother used to say: ``They were born with a silver spoon''.
<P>
<B>(1630)</B>
<P>
	The Bloc Quebecois gave itself a transparent way of getting 
funds, which allows people to contribute minimal donations. Our 
money comes from the grassroots. As donations must come from 
individuals and not businesses, companies cannot interfere in the 
contracting process. The same situation does not apply to 
companies contributing to the Liberal or Conservative election 
funds, because these companies expect their favour to be returned 
some day. For Canadian and Quebec taxpayers, this is where their 
money goes down the drain.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Laurin:</B> Mr. Speaker, I do not wish to comment on my hon. 
colleague's remarks. I rise instead on a matter of procedure. Shall I 
wait that my hon. colleague's time be expired?
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> I would prefer that the 
questions and comments period be over before we go on to 
something else. We will come back immediately after to the 
question you want to raise.
<P>
	Any other questions or comments? Then I recognize the hon. 
member for Joliette.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Laurin:</B> Mr. Speaker, since we have yet another member 
slated to speak to Bill C-7, I would like to know whether it will be 
possible for us later on, for the time remaining, to organize things 
in such a way that we can share our time, as was asked by the other 
member, with unanimous consent. Would it be possible to do that 
again?
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Before reverting to the 
question about unanimous consent on Bill C-3 agreed on earlier 
today, I will nonetheless ask the House whether there are other 
members wishing to speak to Bill C-7.
<P>
	The hon. member for Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup has the 
floor.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, Bill C-7 seeks to establish the Department of Public 
Works and Government Services and to amend and repeal certain 
acts. Why was this department set up? It is probably in order to 
improve its services, increase its efficiency and allow it to operate 
in the most appropriate way in the future.
<P>
	However, this piece of legislation does not contain any change to 
deal with the very blatant flaws currently found in the system. As a 
new member of the committee on government operations, I was 
able to how centralized the procurement operation of the federal 
government.
<P>
	Granted, they are trying to find ways to ensure that procurement 
is made at the lowest cost. They are also trying to ensure some 
openness in the procurement process. However, they forgot a very 
important concern: is that process to the benefit of Quebec, of 
Canada and of the various regions of this country and does it allow 
for development of those regions on a fair basis?
<P>
	In committee, I was told, for example, that the figures on the 
actual breakdown of government procurements between the 
various provinces were not available.
<P>
	This to me is a major flaw because, while they put forward a 
reform of the unemployment insurance system, while they say they 
will try to find ways of helping the regions hardest hit by the 
reform, regions with seasonal economies or with an economy 
dependent on natural resources, they cannot put forward real 
measures devised to give new impetus to these regions in 
diversifying their economy. One of the more concrete ways to do so 
would be for the government to ensure that its procurement 
program has some impact throughout the country and that it can 
efficiently assess this impact.
<P>
<B>(1635)</B>
<P>
	During the 1970s, the federal government opened a number of 
offices, for instance to process tax returns and other similar 
information, which had some kind of synergic effect in some areas, 
but we do not see that anymore and we cannot even get this kind of 
information nowadays.
<P>
	Another element which we think is being somewhat overlooked 
in this bill is the fact that federal members of Parliament from all 
political stripes should be consulted and kept informed of any 
government contract awarded in the federal ridings they represent.
<P>
	Right now, there is no systematic information mechanism to 
ensure that the public is made more aware of what is going on. One 
criticism that we can make-and I have seen this in my riding in 
the last few months-is the following: what process do small 
businesses have to follow to be eligible to join the bidding process 
and to be included in the computerized contractors system. It is 
very complicated and very hard to gain access to this network but 
even tougher to reach the insiders, those who know how the 
procurement system really works. Let me give you a very concrete 
example by telling you about an experience a company in my 
riding went through.
<P>
	There was a call for tenders for the building of fibre glass 
shelters. Upon seeing the ad in the newspapers, a company in my 
riding decided, all in good faith, to request all the information it 
needed. After reading the documentation-and I have seen all of 
it-it dawned on us that it was impossible to develop a proposal 
based on the information made available to companies.
<P>
	To make things worse, the company called to get additional 
information but could not get any. That came about because the 
project was developed with a particular company in mind, and even 
though the government  called for tenders, it was in fact already a 
done deal. Under such circumstances, it is impossible to compete 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1265"> 1265 </A></B>
<P>
because the companies are not even provided with all the 
information they need.
<P>
	So, with this bill, the government would have had a great 
opportunity to act on this issue and on the creation of the 
department, and to provide for transparency and get rid of the old 
myth that government procurement is always based on patronage 
and also to deal with the whole issue of administrative contracts. 
There is still a lot of room for improvement. The government could 
have done a lot more to better target its action.
<P>
	They could also have tried to make public servants more aware 
of the money they were spending. We are often told, these days, 
that calls for tenders are done correctly and in such a way that 
anyone can bid on them, but the government never tried to have a 
real impact on the development of small or medium size businesses 
in our regions. What would be more meaningful in an area with 
high unemployment than to inform businesses in that area and to 
have federal civil servants going on a tour of these businesses to 
make sure that they can take part in the procurement system, have 
the chance to know exactly how it works and submit proposals, 
answer calls for bids and get contracts?
<P>
	We have seen this as members of Parliament for the last two 
years and a half. The system is often made in such a way that 
people with a lot of potential and capabilities and who are already 
part of the system get the information they need and are 
encouraged to perform even better. But our responsibility in 
government is not only to make sure the strong and the rich get 
what they need, but also to see to it that new types of small and 
medium size businesses can take off, develop as well as create and 
maintain jobs. The federal government has still a lot to do in that 
regard. I think some progress was made in recent years to make 
tendering more available. There remains much to do but I can see 
no will to do it in the bill before us.
<P>
<B>(1640)</B>
<P>
	The Bloc Quebecois' approach is based on government 
transparency and that of its administration. Currently, anyone 
trying to deal with the government or the public service is 
confronted with a colossal maze preventing them from getting 
more information.
<P>
	If the example I gave earlier was an isolated case, we could say 
that it is an exceptional case, but there are also others. In my riding, 
well known businesses, medium size and large ones that have been 
operating for many years are having a lot of difficulty finding their 
way around in the government procurement process, and I believe 
that there is work to be done in this regard.
<P>
	There is an element which, of course, cannot be solved by the 
bill on the public works department, but which is always present in 
these situations. It is the question of the  political party fundraising. 
As you know, Quebec has a law which provides that only 
individuals can make donations to a political party. No bank, no 
union, no community association, no foundation can make 
donations and claim a deduction.
<P>
	In the federal government, things are different. Businesses, 
unions, community groups, everybody can make donations to a 
political party. This does not necessarily mean that businesses are 
dishonest, but it can give rise to conflicts of interest. I believe that 
if we change the law governing contributions to political parties 
along those lines, there would be more openness and transparency 
in the awarding of contracts, and I believe that would be much 
more appropriate.
<P>
	Another element the Bloc Quebecois considers as important is 
the establishment of a code for contracting out that would force the 
government to adequately monitor the use of outside contractors 
and to make the process transparent. The monitoring process 
should be acceptable for all the parties involved in this important 
question. The contracting out process is a current issue and it is a 
dynamic process which can be very profitable. On the other hand, 
as public organizations, we must ensure that we do this with 
enough visibility, allowing people to see that their money is spent 
properly.
<P>
	I would like to come back on the consultations, on the 
information required by the contracting out process and on the role 
MPs must play. A federal member of Parliament, regardless of his 
or her political affiliation, is someone who has been elected and 
who is responsible for representing his riding as far as legislative 
issues are concerned. But he has more than legislative 
responsibilities. Administrative decisions have impacts which are 
very real, and one of them has to do with public procurement. 
There are public expenditures of this kind.
<P>
	The elected representative has the power to question government 
on all its expenditures. However, can we do that job properly if we 
do not have the necessary tools to really know what the federal 
public administration is doing in our riding? That kind of 
information would be very useful and could even help in the 
elaboration of economic development strategies for a given region. 
An area that does not benefit from a lot of government investments 
could think of attracting some or decide to continue looking for 
other kinds of investments. If it does not benefit from that kind of 
investments, it could try to find out why not.
<P>
<B>(1645)</B>
<P>
	How could we do things otherwise? Could we have federal civil 
servants give business owners up-to-date information? There could 
be another reason. Perhaps some ridings do not get many federal 
contracts, not only because the necessary information is not 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1266"> 1266 </A></B>
<P>
available, but because they do not try hard enough to get it. There is 
an  interesting economic potential that could be developed at a very 
low cost.
<P>
	The government is constantly seeking ways to create jobs. Well, 
one of the ways to do it would be to make sure that its purchasing is 
done fairly and appropriately in all areas of the country. So there 
has to be a process where everyone has a chance to compete and to 
be awarded a contract.
<P>
	We, in the Bloc Quebecois, would also like to have a mechanism 
for blowing the whistle on any waste of public funds. It is not a 
matter of hitting people over the head. Perhaps we should follow 
the example of municipal governments. If you talk to a councillor 
or a mayor in a small municipality, you can be sure that, when 
money is spent on things that are not really necessary, they know it 
quickly because people see those things in their daily life; they see 
the work done at the street corner, they see everything. That is 
probably why municipal governments follow what goes on very 
closely.
<P>
	At the federal level, governments may not have been as vigilant 
as they should have in the past, as is shown by our deficit. We can 
easily imagine the kind of unnecessary expenditures that are made 
regularly. In the fight against the deficit, if we did things right, if 
we followed the situation more closely, we could put less pressure 
on social programs and stop chasing unemployment insurance 
recipients. Instead of that, we could try to find the major elements 
that we have to work on in order to save money.
<P>
	So there could be significant cuts in government spending. I 
think that it could imply greater accountability for public service 
employees. The area of government procurement may be a priority 
area where, in creating the department, the government could have 
clearly shown its desire to improve the situation in this regard. 
However, we do not find these elements in the bill as it stands.
<P>
	There is another issue of interest to us, and it is the issue of 
advance payments by the government. This practice is used by 
public service employees and managers. These people are afraid of 
having their annual budget cut if they do not use all the resources 
allocated to them. In other words, when the end of the fiscal year is 
near, suddenly the money has to be spent to be sure that next year's 
budget will not be cut. We all have heard about that, we all have 
seen it in the departments. I think the government should have done 
something to provide for better control in this area.
<P>
	Finally, the Department of Public Works is responsible for 
processing requisitions from other departments. Maybe there is a 
period during the year where the department should be particularly 
vigilant to see if these purchases are really necessary. Do they 
really need these things? Is it not at the beginning of the year that it 
is finally realized that the full amount budgeted is not really 
needed? The unnecessary purchases and horror stories  we hear, 
which often take place at year's end, would be avoided.
<P>
	The Department of Public Works must therefore be a credible 
watchdog over advance payments by departments. This department 
spends over 50 per cent of government commitments. In each 
department, the amount that can be authorized is minimal and 
responsibility rests with the department of public works. This is 
therefore very important because we are reviewing the act 
governing this department.
<P>
	It is therefore very important to be sure, at this stage, that the bill 
contains all the means necessary to carry government purchasing 
into the 21st century, allows a sufficient degree of transparency 
and, above all, ensures that government spending benefits regional 
development.
<P>
<B>(1650)</B>
<P>
	For these reasons, I think that the government will have to 
review its bill and see whether amendments are not required.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Is the House ready for the

	<B>Ms. Marlene Catterall (Ottawa West, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
rise on a point of order. Pursuant to discussions earlier today, of 
which I am sure you are aware, I think you would find unanimous 
consent that the House return to Bill C-3 only for the purpose of 
allowing one speaker from each party on the bill.
<P>
	This is on the understanding that the vote has already been taken 
on the bill. It has been approved by the House on the understanding 
as well that there will be no questions and comments and that the 
remaining time between now and 5.30 p.m. will be divided equally 
between the three parties for purposes of speaking. Should the 
debate conclude before 5.30 p.m. we would agree to call it 5.30 
p.m. and proceed with the sounding of the bells for the vote at 5.30.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Laurin:</B> Mr. Speaker, we agree with everything suggested 
by the government deputy whip, except for the allocation of time. 
There has been consultation on this matter. Considering the time 
needed by the three speakers, I believe you will find there is 
consent to give ten minutes to the speaker from the government 
side, five minutes to the speaker from the Reform Party and the rest 
to the speaker from the Bloc Quebecois, for a total of 15 minutes.
<P>
	The speaker from the government side told us that he would 
probably need only ten minutes and the speaker of the Reform 
Party said that five minutes will be enough. The rest of the time 
could be allocated to the Bloc Quebecois and if the debate ends 
before 5.30 p.m., we are ready to accept that the division take place 
at that time and that the debate cease at the same time. In other 
words, we will be ready to say that it is 5.30 p.m.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Johnston:</B> Mr. Speaker, we agree to those terms.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> The terms are clearly set out 
in requesting unanimous consent. The question has been put. Bill 
C-3 has been adopted. We are going back to simply put things on 
the record.
<P>
	I will try to follow this as closely as possible with all of you. I 
would hope the member participating on behalf of the government 
would take approximately 10 minutes during his intervention, that 
the member for the Reform Party would take approximately 5 
minutes, and that the remaining time would go to the member from 
the Bloc Quebecois. If it should all end before 5.30 p.m., I would 
see it as being 5.30 p.m.
<P>
<B>(1655)</B>
<P>
	In essence, I will follow that rotation. To facilitate the debate, I 
will go to the government, to the Reform Party and conclude with 
the member from the official opposition. Is there unanimous 
consent?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
	<B>Mr. George Proud (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Labour, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, this took a little while in arriving. We 
had a little juggling to do in the exchange of some different points 
of view. Finally we have agreed to end the day before 5.30 p.m., 
closing the debate on Bill C-3.
<P>
	My remarks will be short. During the debate on Bill C-3 one 
aspect all hon. members will agree on is the desirability to 
administer labour law in Canada as efficiently as possible.
<P>
	The government is committed to providing Canadian employers 
and workers with a stable environment in which to conduct labour 
relations. These goals are in essence the reason we have the 
legislation before us today.
<P>
	Flexible federalism allows us to smooth out the rough edges 
where administrative difficulties arise. Ontario Hydro is a publicly 
held corporation constituted under the Ontario Power Corporations 
Act. It is the division of the enterprise responsible for the 
construction and operation of nuclear facilities in the province.
<P>
	Currently this division includes Darlington, Pickering and Bruce 
generating stations and a number of other facilities.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	This division groups together the three main power stations of 
Darlington, Pickering and Bruce and a number of other facilities.
<P>
	Before the Supreme Court ruling in 1993, it had always been 
believed that the employees of Hydro Ontario nuclear power 
stations were governed by provincial labour standards.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Before the 1993 Supreme Court decision it was always believed 
that employees of nuclear facilities of Ontario Hydro were subject 
to provincial labour laws. This was not the case. Consequently the 
province and employees of the nuclear facilities found themselves 
in a complicated situation.
<P>
	In effect 42 per cent of Ontario employees are subject to federal 
labour law while the remainder are subject to the labour laws of 
Ontario. As members of the House we are in a position today to 
enable both federal and provincial governments to untangle and to 
dispense with this dilemma.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1268"> 1268 </A></B>
<P>
	At the same time it is certainly reasonable for hon. members 
to want a clear understanding of the effects these amendments will 
have. In 1993 the Supreme Court found that part I of the Canada 
Labour Code which governs industrial relations is applicable to 
employees of Ontario Hydro's nuclear facilities.
<P>
	As a result of the decision it became clear that parts II and III of 
the Code and the Non-Smokers' Health Act also applied to these 
workers. Part II of the Code addressed occupational safety and 
health and Part III deals with labour standards, hours of work and 
such like.
<P>
	The Supreme Court decision created a complicated and 
exceptional situation as employees, the company and unions must 
conform to two comparable but slightly different labour relation 
regimes. For example, Ontario Hydro and the unions must deal 
with two conciliation processes during the negotiation of collective 
agreements. In addition, they must conform with slightly different 
occupational safety and health regulations which provide 
essentially the same protection for workers. The provisions of the 
bill demonstrate the government's commitment to provide the 
parties with a stable labour relations environment.
<P>
<B>(1700)</B>
<P>
	Here is how the bill eliminates the problem of a split jurisdiction 
at Ontario Hydro. First, the company is exempted from having to 
comply with the Canada Labour Code. At the same time, the 
company is made subject to provincial labour laws which are 
incorporated by reference through federal regulation.
<P>
	The mechanism may be triggered by passing regulations dealing 
with industrial relations, including ad hoc or emergency 
legislation, occupational health and safety matters, labour 
standards or workplace smoking rules and regulations. Once the 
regulations are in place, provincial laws can be applied to nuclear 
facilities.
<P>
	In the case of collective bargaining, any bargaining agent that 
was recognized under part I of the Canada Labour Code would 
remain the bargaining agent under the provisions of the bill. This 
was a question that we were asked by the power workers of 
Ontario: would we guarantee that this would be the case? We said 
we could guarantee that it would be the case during the transition 
period and during the life of the agreement. That is all we can do. In 
fact, that is all anybody can do. It ensures successor rights to the 
bargaining agent and it prohibits other unions or associations from 
applying to represent that bargaining unit outside of regular 
procedures.
<P>
	As I said, any collective agreement concluded under part I of the 
Canada Labour Code will continue in force until the life of the 
contract expires. That ensures that the rights, the privileges and the 
duties of both parties to the collective agreement remain intact. The 
solution is clear and it makes sense.
<P>
	It is the desire of the government and the Government of Ontario 
to have all provincial labour laws apply to the province's nuclear 
facilities. Both governments agree that from a practical standpoint 
it is logical to have all legislation related to labour law at Ontario 
Hydro under one roof.
<P>
	Since early 1994 both levels of government have been 
examining various ways of accomplishing this. Much discussion 
led to the development of Bill C-3.
<P>
	However, the story does not end here. Nuclear generating 
stations in the provinces of New Brunswick and Quebec were also 
affected by the Supreme Court decision. The Point Lepreau 
generating station in New Brunswick and Quebec's Gentilly 2 
appear to be in a legislative void for the purposes of labour law.
<P>
	After crown immunity is lifted, the provisions of Bill C-3 can be 
applied to these nuclear facilities, thus eliminating the legislative 
void and providing a mechanism whereby provincial labour law 
may apply.
<P>
	In addition, the mechanism may be applied to uranium mines in 
Saskatchewan which are also regulated by the Atomic Energy 
Control Act. The province of Saskatchewan has for many years 
been delivering its occupational safety and health programs to 
uranium mines in Saskatchewan. Strictly speaking, these mines are 
subject to the Canada Labour Code. There is no formal agreement 
between the two levels of government concerning the situation and 
the federal government would like to formalize the arrangement.
<P>
	The way to do that would be to follow a similar route to that 
which is being done with Ontario Hydro, namely: to exempt these 
mines from application to part II of the Canada Labour Code; to 
incorporate Saskatchewan occupational safety and health laws into 
federal regulations; and to contract with the province of 
Saskatchewan to deliver its programs to these mines. There is a 
mechanism in part II of the code which could be used to achieve 
this, but only with respect to the occupational health and safety 
laws.
<P>
<B>(1705 )</B>
<P>
	I want to stress that the passage of this bill will have no effect on 
the mandate of the Atomic Energy Control Board. The board has 
sole authority to ensure that the use of nuclear energy in Canada 
poses no undue risk to health, safety, security or to the 
environment.
<P>
	For these reasons I ask all here today to support the bill. I know 
they will.
<P>
	Before I sit down, I would like to thank all those who took part in 
the process. I thank members of the Bloc and the Reform Party who 
worked on the bill in the subcommittee. I thank the chairman of the 
subcommittee and other members, the clerk and the people from 
the department and the witnesses who appeared before us.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1269"> 1269 </A></B>
<P>
	This bill simplifies the process. There is no need to have two 
or three jurisdictions looking after basically the same legislation. 
I thank all those who were so co-operative in helping me get 
passage of this bill.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dale Johnston (Wetaskiwin, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am not 
sure if we are making parliamentary history today. It is the first 
time that we have debated a bill that has already passed through the 
House. Certainly, in my former life as a farmer I became 
accustomed to this sort of thing on occasion. Many times I closed 
the gate after the calves got out.
<P>
	I am speaking to Bill C-3. Of course, this is precipitated by the 
fact that the Supreme Court in 1993 rendered a decision on labour 
relations in Canada that threw the atomic workers into a state of 
flux.
<P>
	At Ontario Hydro, for instance, 42 per cent of the workers were 
under federal jurisdiction while the remaining 58 per cent were 
subject to the Ontario labour code. Workers in Quebec and New 
Brunswick were caught in a very similar bind. Needless to say, the 
situation led to more and more confusion and duplication, all of 
which was unnecessary and not conducive to good working 
relationships.
<P>
	The importance of nuclear safety cannot be stressed enough. 
Indeed, it was a concern expressed by the Supreme Court and it is a 
concern to everyone who works at the nuclear facilities, to their 
families and all Canadians. A stable work environment will help to 
alleviate the uncertainty caused by this split jurisdiction.
<P>
	The Reform Party does not oppose this bill. I would encourage 
the minister not to wait for future court rulings, but to move 
forward with the devolution of federal control in labour matters, 
devolving them to the provinces.
<P>
	Part I of the labour code is currently under review and it would 
be an appropriate starting point for the minister, who I know is 
anxious to do away with duplication of service. The government is 
strapped with a $580 billion debt. I know the minister will do what 
is necessary to eliminate all duplication and overlap in order to 
downsize, and do his part to get the debt under control.
<P>
	The minister will find that the workers, management and the 
people in my party would be most supportive of the direction taken 
by him.
<P>
	I believe that labour and management have a common goal in 
maintaining a productive workplace and we as legislators should 
do all we can to advance that goal. We can facilitate this by 
relinquishing control over the bureaucratic regulations that stand in 
the way of sound labour relations. Bill C-3 is a step in the proper 
direction.
<P>
<B>(1710 )</B>
<P>
	I encourage the minister to immediately convene negotiations 
with those provinces whose nuclear workers are caught in this 
legislative vacuum and allow these  employees to be brought under 
provincial governance as soon as possible. I believe the 
government owes the nuclear workers of Canada that much.
<P>
	When we were talking about the division of time I suggested that 
I would be very brief and I am going to be true to my word. I 
believe that one should be frugal with one's words as well as one's 
mind.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> I thank the hon. member for 
his co-operation.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Réal Ménard (Hochelaga-Maisonneuve, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, as you know, today has been a very eventful day. So I 
would like to thank our collaborators behind the scenes, especially 
Sylvain Gauthier, who kept his cool under pressure.
<P>
	As the parliamentary secretary knows, we support Bill C-3. It 
might be useful to remind those listeners who have just tuned in 
that the purpose of Bill C-3 is to devolve responsibility for labour 
relations to the provinces that will ask for it through regulatory 
negotiations. I think we should also remind them that bills such as 
this one are related to the Canada Labour Code, an area from which 
the federal government is willing to withdraw.
<P>
	This bill results from a ruling made by the highest court in the 
land, the Supreme Court. In 1993, the Supreme Court ruled in 
response to an appeal filed by the union that part I of the Canada 
Labour Code governing labour relations applies to the employees 
of nuclear plants, including Ontario Hydro.
<P>
	It is important to keep this in mind because Parliament has a duty 
to adjust to court rulings. Through this bill, Parliament is 
correcting a situation that would have been extremely harmful as it 
would have created a legal vacuum. The parliamentary secretary 
referred to it in the case of New Brunswick and Quebec. This 
situation would have put us in an uncomfortable situation that no 
one wants by allowing two different labour systems to coexist.
<P>
	We must remember that it makes a lot of sense to ask the 
provinces to define, frame and apply provincial legislation in this 
area, as the Ontario government has done for 50 years in the area of 
nuclear energy, for example. So we must commend what the 
federal government has done by trying to maintain the status quo.
<P>
	We must acknowledge that Bill C-3 concerns not exclusively but 
mainly Ontario. I would like to remind you that, of the 10,000 
nuclear workers across the country, there are 6,000 to 8,000 in 
Ontario, 700 in Quebec, about 500 in New Brunswick and 500 in 
Saskatchewan's uranium mines.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1270"> 1270 </A></B>
<P>
	The situation was particularly worrying for Ontario. That it why 
they followed the work of the parliamentary committee very 
closely. Both parties were heard, since  the nuclear industry 
accounts for 60 per cent of electricity generation in Ontario.
<P>
	I am not saying that we did not try to introduce amendments to 
Bill C-3. Although we agree with the principle of devolving 
responsibility for this area-and we hope that this will extend to 
other areas and that the Minister of Labour can influence the 
minister responsible for intergovernmental relations and other 
ministers in this cabinet to transfer certain areas of 
jurisdiction-this bill nonetheless does not meet with unanimous 
approval.
<P>
	It does not meet with unanimous approval first of all because 
Ontario Hydro union members are not too crazy about being 
subject to provincial labour legislation in light of the Harris 
government's shift to the right.
<P>
<B>(1715)</B>
<P>
	Even so, we, in the official opposition, did not succumb to the 
temptation of seeing things the same way as workers who did not 
have an overall view. The government took the overall view of 
withdrawing from the area of labour relations in the nuclear 
industry because the provinces, and Ontario, New Brunswick and 
Quebec in particular, had respectively 15, 30 and 40 years 
experience in that area.
<P>
	I am thrilled at the thought of being able to rely on the support of 
the Minister of Human Resources Development, whose global 
outlook on things make him take an interest in matters as diverse as 
unemployment and energy, which in his mind are both explosive 
issues.
<P>
	That said, let me remind you that we suggested amendments that 
the government rejected, with a rare elegance mind you, but 
rejected nonetheless. I owe to the truthfulness of our deliberations 
to remind you that the Quebec government had contacted the hon. 
member for Saint-Léonard and Minister of Labour, requesting that 
the applicable Quebec legislation be referred to specifically in his 
bill.
<P>
	It must be understood that, while we agree in principle with the 
bill, we would rather this not be done through regulations but 
through references in the act instead. I understand the minister for 
giving in to his officials, explaining that he was not comfortable 
with the idea of yielding to Quebec's demands, because of the risk 
of creating a precedent that could have been detrimental to New 
Brunswick, Ontario and Saskatchewan.
<P>
	At any rate, Quebec's position concerning Bill C-3, which, I 
remind you, we agree with in principle, would have been that it 
should refer directly to provincial legislation rather than to 
regulations and that it should state that, as soon as the act came into 
effect, after receiving royal assent, all provincial legislation 
regarding those employed by the companies governed by the 
Atomic Energy Control Act will become applicable.
<P>
	For information, the legislation provides that, when the 
Government of Canada, through its minister responsible, the 
Minister of Labour, and his Quebec counterpart have negotiated an 
agreement, no third party will be authorized to request that the 
legislation apply on that territory. Naturally, the authority to 
negotiate rests with the province or the provincial government.
<P>
	I think that it is important to remember that, in Quebec's case, 
six pieces of legislation are involved, including the act respecting 
labour standards, the Quebec equivalent to the federal 
government's Labour Code, Part III, and the act to ensure that 
essential services are maintained. We always refer to this 
legislation with great pride, because it was passed in Quebec by the 
government of the late René Lévesque and is definitely the answer 
to our labour relations problems. The Minister of Labour should 
follow that model, so as to have similar provisions in the federal 
labour code.
<P>
	The measures that will also be applied through regulations are, 
of course, the provincial labour code-it is essential to the 
bill-Quebec's occupational health and safety act, its charter of 
rights, as well as all the regulations governing the construction 
industry.
<P>
	You would have been touched by all the excitement around the 
Minister of Labour. His whole staff was mobilized. This bill is a pet 
project of the minister. His staff was truly excited and wanted to 
make sure that we could pass the bill as quickly as possible. I can 
understand the minister's enthusiasm; indeed, promoting 
democracy is always an exciting moment in the career of a public 
figure. This is the first bill sponsored by the new Minister of 
Labour in this House. Still, it would have been nice if he had 
accepted the amendments proposed by the opposition. As you 
know, one would be hard pressed to find a single one of these 
amendments that is either unreasonable or unjustified.
<P>
	Yet, our amendments were rejected. Nevertheless, we will 
support the bill, but we feel it would have been appropriate to refer 
directly to the act, instead of going through a regulatory framework 
which has a major drawback in that it does not get Parliament 
involved.
<P>
<B>(1720)</B>
<P>
	In the case of a bill on labour relations, it is vital that Parliament 
be involved.
<P>
	In any case, the debate is over and the issue has been dealt with. 
As a democrat, I accept the parliamentary rules and I will abide by 
the decision made by the sub-committee.
<P>
	I also want to remind this House that, should a labour conflict or 
an emergency situation occur, it will incumbent on each 
participating province to ensure that the situation or conflict is 
resolved under provincial laws.
<P>
	In spite of the labour minister's enthusiasm because of the 
imminent passing of Bill C-3, the real test for him will definitely be 
the anti-scab legislation. As you know, consultations were held 
across the country and the Sims report was tabled, so as to 
immediately give an indication of what the government should do 
regarding Part I of the labour code.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1271"> 1271 </A></B>
<P>
	I think the government will have to introduce an anti-scab bill. 
This will be a test of political courage. As you know, in politics, 
courage is a rather rare commodity; moreover, it is unevenly 
distributed. Mr. Speaker, I would go so far as to say that it is 
generally more prevalent on your left than on your right, but I 
realize you cannot do anything about that.
<P>
	Again, the real test will be the anti-scab legislation. We urge the 
government to introduce this legislation. I even told the minister, in 
sub-committee, that if he wishes so, we are prepared to continue 
our work until the government can propose a model.
<P>
	What does an anti-scab bill entail? The Quebec government 
provides a very eloquent example. We are talking about an 
instrument of last resort-after all, a strike is also an ultimate 
means, not a marginal one. Yet, for reasons that are often related to 
the deterioration of labour relations, a power struggle ultimately 
results in a strike action. Consequently, it is necessary to have a 
tool to alleviate tensions under such circumstances.
<P>
	This instrument helps labour relations in such a context, because 
workers who go on strike, usually on the advice of their union, are 
aware that even if they walk out they will not lose their job once the 
conflict is over.
<P>
	I will conclude by saying that we will support this bill, that the 
work in committee was rather pleasant, in spite of the fact that the 
very reasonable amendments proposed by the Bloc Quebecois were 
rejected. I remind the minister that we hope to work on an anti-scab 
bill. This will be the true measure of his ability to deal with labour 
relation issues.

	<B>Mrs. Sharon Hayes (Port Moody-Coquitlam, Ref.)</B> moved:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That, in the opinion of this House, the government should recognize the 
onerous burden of taxation upon the Canadian family, and the pressures that 
such taxation places upon the family, and that this government take immediate 
measures to provide the family with tax relief, including balancing the federal 
budget.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	She said: Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak on Motion No. 148 
which highlights the issue of the level of taxation that the Canadian 
family faces and recommends the course the government should 
pursue to relieve the financial and tax burden on families.
<P>
	The debate today is particularly relevant in light of the federal 
budget tabled earlier this month. I introduced this motion to 
highlight the issue of taxation and the family. Normally the 
taxation issue is associated with individuals or with corporations. 
Rarely is this issue ever associated with the family in this place.
<P>
<B>(1800)</B>
<P>
	It distresses me to say that it has certainly not been a theme of 
this government to recognize families in its policy development 
beyond its perfunctory rhetoric.
<P>
	I recall my beginnings as a politician. In the town of Coquitlam, 
there was a forum called together of federal candidates before the 
last election. At that forum were the candidates from all parties and 
members of our community. It was sponsored by a local communi-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1274"> 1274 </A></B>
<P>
ty  newspaper, the <I>Tri-City News</I>, that wanted to find out what the 
issues were in our area.
<P>
	Candidates from all parties were there: the NDP incumbent, the 
Liberal candidate who was the provincial president for the Liberal 
Party and many others. They were called on to answer to the issues 
that were important to our community. There was free discussion. 
It was all on tape. The report of that discussion went into the 
newspaper the following week.
<P>
	At that time I did not have much experience in politics. 
However, I did have experience as a community volunteer, a 
community member, a teacher and a mother.
<P>
	The issue of family distress, the monetary and cultural pressures 
on the families that I saw in my community, brought me to consider 
that perhaps change might be possible in the political process. That 
is what brought me to the political arena.
<P>
	That afternoon in that setting the issue of the family was 
primary. People talked about high taxes, their hopes for the future, 
the choice for young mothers to stay at home, the value of 
parenting and less government intrusion into families. Those were 
the topics of discussion chosen by the people in my community.
<P>
	That day I was able to answer their questions with conviction 
because that is exactly where I come from and that is exactly why I 
aligned myself with the Reform Party. The Reform Party listens to 
the individuals, the families and the grassroots of the community. 
That day again affirmed my decision to take on the risk of political 
life.
<P>
	Those families are not skilled at the lobby table. They are not 
well funded to be able to bend the ears of politicians, to organize or 
to pressure policy direction. However, the well-being of families is 
what is in the hearts of Canadians and that well-being will predict 
the strength of the future of the country.
<P>
	By introducing this motion, I wish to establish the fact that the 
Canadian family has been affected by the overspending and 
resulting over-taxation of previous and present governments and is 
in desperate need of tax relief. It is a fact that the federal 
government can provide the Canadian family with tax relief by 
balancing its revenues and spending.
<P>
	Even as I stood as a candidate for the Reform Party, it proposed a 
zero in three plan to balance the budget. Through reasoned 
spending priorities and choices, if Reform had been elected in 
1993, this year's budget would not have been looking at a projected 
deficit of $25 billion but would have seen us making decisions on 
how to allocate a budget surplus. The books would have been 
balanced and debt reduction and/or tax relief would have been a 
reality.
<P>
	As my motion indicates, it is through a balanced budget that tax 
relief for families will be realized.
<P>
	How is it that we got where we are? The inability of governments 
to address the real security of Canadians through proper fiscal 
management has a very long history. Thinking back to 1972, the 
then Liberal government came into power with a debt load of $16 
billion. It was voted out of office in 1984, 12 years later, leaving 
behind it the travesty of a $160 billion federal debt which has been 
a millstone to the prosperity of our country and to every citizen.
<P>
	The Tories could not rein in their spending and again the debt 
grew, first to $200 billion in 1988 and then to $485 billion in 1993.
<P>
	Today, still with no firm commitment to deficit elimination by, 
once again, a Liberal government, the security and future of every 
man, woman and child stands at the mercy of an incredible $578 
billion debt which is projected to increase to $620 billion by 1997.
<P>
<B>(1805 )</B>
<P>
	Meanwhile, political parties of all persuasions throughout the 
provinces have recognized the need for deficit elimination. Even 
the separatist government in Quebec now recognizes the need to 
balance its provincial budget with a stated goal of a balanced 
budget only four years away.
<P>
	Not surprisingly, the results of overspending over the last 30 
years by successive Liberal and Tory governments have produced a 
record of continually increasing taxes on the Canadian family. For 
instance, from 1961 to 1994, taxes on the Canadian family rose 
some 1,167 per cent. The rate of those tax increases far outstrips 
the corresponding increases in the cost of food, shelter and clothing 
over the same period.
<P>
	In 1994, the average Canadian family earned $46,488. The 
Fraser Institute's Tax Facts 9 outlined the tax bill that this average 
Canadian family faced by categorizing the taxes by type. This is 
what it found.
<P>
	Income tax, perhaps the most easily identifiable tax, accounted 
for $8,250. Another continual frustration to families are the sales 
taxes which take another bite of $3,278. Excise taxes gobble up 
another $973. Then there is the auto fuel and motor vehicle taxes of 
$709.
<P>
	There is a big bite with social security, medical and hospital 
taxes of $3,817 and property taxes of $1,848. There are import 
duties of $331, a profits tax of $1,306, natural resource taxes of 
$354 and all the other types of sundry taxes not included in the 
above are $361.
<P>
	If these are added up, the total taxes paid by the average family is 
$21,228. That works out to 46 per cent of its cash income. It means 
almost half of the working hours are spent on behalf of various 
levels of government or others.
<P>
	It is little wonder that increasing numbers of Canadians are 
suffering from tax fatigue. For instance, in the Angus Reid survey 
in 1990, 45 per cent of Canadians  expressed their concern of being 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1275"> 1275 </A></B>
<P>
financially under stress, while in 1989 that figure was only 38 per 
cent; still a large number.
<P>
	According to a 1995 Angus Reid poll, over half of Canadians 
stated that they were finding it harder to make ends meet than just 
five years before that.
<P>
	Tragically, this financial stress is especially common among 
young families. A two-year project entitled ``Prospects for Young 
Families'' found that in the 1970s, families headed by a person 
under 25 had a median income of 80 per cent of the income of all 
family groups combined. By 1992, however, young families had a 
median income of only 54 per cent of the income of all other 
families.
<P>
	There is something wrong with this picture when hard working 
families find that the harder they try, the farther behind they get. If 
this is a land of opportunity and the envy of countries around the 
world, why then do we rob our families of hope or achievement as 
they continually run harder to accomplish less?
<P>
	The effect of this level of taxation leaves the family with less and 
less after tax income. According to StatsCan, since 1989, after tax 
family income has dropped some 6.5 per cent. If we go back a full 
10 years, the picture is no better.
<P>
	The StatsCan study found that the average family's after tax 
income in 1984 was $43,204. In 1993, the figure was $43,225. That 
is a long time for the average family after tax income to rise by just 
$21-10 years.
<P>
	With declining disposable income, families are left with less 
money to spend on their children and less money with which to 
realize their dreams and secure their futures. It has been 
demonstrated that it takes twice the working hours now to support a 
family as in the 1970s. The opinion of Canadians again reflects this 
reality. Fifty-two per cent of Canadians surveyed believe ``it is just 
not possible to support a family on one income any more''.
<P>
	There is a direct correlation between the levels of taxation and 
the resulting loss of net income in families and the rise of dual 
income earner families. For instance, in 1967, 58 per cent of 
Canadian families had one income earner. By 1991, however, only 
19 per cent of families were classified as traditional earner families 
while dual earner families had skyrocketed to 61 per cent.
<P>
<B>(1810)</B>
<P>
	Negative societal effects resulting from the rise of the dual wage 
earner family have just begun to be reported. Particularly 
distressing are the effects on children who with both parents 
working are placed in institutionalized day care.
<P>
	A recent study by Dr. Mark Genuis of the National Foundation 
for Family Research and Education demonstrated that non-parental 
care of children  undermines the bonding between a parent and a 
child. The study concluded that ``insecure bonding to parents in 
childhood is a direct cause of clinical levels of emotional and 
behavioural problems in adolescence''.
<P>
	There are negative effects on families themselves. Thirty-five 
per cent of homes with both parents working outside the home with 
children under six experience moderate to severe levels of stress. 
Those attempting to balance those same pressures while coping 
with toddlers under three similarly report severe stress.
<P>
	Excessive taxation does hurt families. What has been the 
response of the government since being elected in 1993? What is 
the Liberal approach to home economics? Their record is simply a 
continuation of neglect and disregard for the financial challenges 
of the Canadian family. It is a record of sly and subtle tax increases 
in spite of the finance minister's rhetorical pronouncements to the 
contrary. In short, it is a record that has failed to recognize the tax 
burden that families face.
<P>
	Let me list some of the examples of tax increases the 
government has and will be implementing. The full fiscal impact of 
the 22 tax increases from all its budgets will be to suck 
approximately $8.8 billion from the pockets of Canadians and their 
families.
<P>
	For instance, recent proposed changes to the RRSP rules of 
reducing the age of mandatory withdrawal from 71 to 69 will net 
federal coffers some $100 million by the year 2000. Freezing the 
RRSP dollar contribution to $13,500 until 2003 will garner the 
federal government some $215 million more over the next three 
years.
<P>
	RRSPs are fundamental to a family's savings and wealth. 
Families use them not only for retirement purposes but also for 
purchasing homes and other investments. Instead of changing 
RRSP rules to further line its pockets, the government should 
empower families to have greater control over their private savings 
and finances. Reform's super RRSPs would do just that. It would 
empower families and give them greater control over their personal 
finances.
<P>
	Other examples of Liberal tax increases include excise taxes 
which will amount to almost $1.7 billion over the next three years. 
Not to be forgotten of course is the government's failure to abolish 
the GST which will be another $17.9 billion tax grab in 1996-97 
alone.
<P>
	In spite of the increased revenue gouging by this government, it 
has no plans to offer Canadian families the tax relief they deserve 
and desperately need. It still has not committed to deficit 
elimination. The finance minister has even stated that there will not 
be any tax relief for some time.
<P>
	Rather than recognize the contribution and importance of 
families and the incredible tax load they carry, the government has 
other priorities. One of those is the federal plan for gender equality. 
Millions of family tax dollars are being poured into every federal  
department to fund gender analysis where the goal of all women 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1276"> 1276 </A></B>
<P>
must be to pursue economic autonomy and their value is 
determined by their activity in the paid workforce.
<P>
	Recent government initiatives in employment equity, pay equity 
and day care are going to cost Canadians billions of dollars and in 
the meantime remove value and choice from some of our most 
fundamental institutions. This is all predicated on a warped and 
intrusive government priority agenda.
<P>
	The government's mindset of neglect and disregard for the 
family is also reflected in other misguided spending priorities. This 
is illustrated in the comparison of federal spending on major 
diseases in our society.
<P>
<B>(1815 )</B>
<P>
	In 1994-95 the federal government spent $43.4 million on the 
national AIDS strategy, yet in the same year it spent only $4 
million on breast cancer. Considering that one in nine women will 
experience breast cancer in her life compared with approximately 
2,000 deaths by AIDS each year, Canadian families have a right to 
demand an explanation of how government determines and 
prioritizes the allocation of their hard earned tax dollars.
<P>
	These examples of overtaxation and misguided spending 
priorities assault the sensibilities of families. In spite of the 
observations I have made, there are policy alternatives. Less, not 
more government is one of the solutions. Social policy spending 
must be targeted to those most in need and public policy should 
promote choice and empower families.
<P>
	Income splitting is one practical solution. The Reform Party's 
taxation task force is examining this concept to better the economic 
and tax status of families. Presently two incomes of say $30,000 
receive much better tax treatment than a single income of $60,000. 
Tax treatment to allow spouses to declare and split their household 
income would level the playing field between dual and single wage 
earner families. Income splitting would level the taxation field by 
recognizing and valuing the idea of a home team.
<P>
	The child care expense deduction could also be reformed. 
Presently this income tax provision allows parents to deduct 
expenses incurred for child care that is non-parental. The effect of 
this is that parents who send their children to camps or daycare 
facilities, or who hire a nanny can deduct that amount from their 
income tax. However, parents who stay at home with their children 
are not eligible for this deduction.
<P>
	This deduction could be converted into a child tax credit that 
would expand choice and opportunity for families. In the last 
budget this government instead raised the age eligibility limit for 
children from 14 to 16. The result is that parental and 
non-institutional child care options are still not recognized in our 
tax law, but what is  recognized is the subsidization of child care for 
a 16 year old teenager.
<P>
	Recognizing this tax inequity and the unfair tax treatment 
families face, my colleague from Calgary Centre introduced a 
private member's bill in the first session of this Parliament which 
would have provided a tax deduction for all parents regardless of 
their income status or method of child care chosen. What was the 
response of this government to this innovative proposal? The 
proposal was dismissed out of hand and relegated to the 
overcrowded never never land of private members' business.
<P>
	Earlier this month I joined with the member for Mississauga 
South to support another private member's bill that would convert 
the child care expense deduction to a $5,000 tax credit for parents 
with children under the age of seven and a $3,000 credit for 
children between the ages of 7 and 13.
<P>
	This proposal was developed in conjunction with Dr. Mark 
Genuis of the Calgary based National Foundation for Family 
Research and Education. This proposal will expand choice and will 
recognize the importance and value of parenting and family in our 
income tax law. It is innovative proposals such as this one that can 
and should be implemented immediately.
<P>
	Reformers believe that just as a family must balance its books, 
so too must the federal government. With this approach in mind we 
developed our zero in three proposal which we presented to the 
public prior to and during the last election campaign.
<P>
	In February 1995 we presented our taxpayers budget which was 
designed to balance the federal budget within three years and 
implement measures to prevent future deficits and secure the 
interests of taxpaying families. Reformers believe that balancing 
the federal budget is the primary means by which tax relief can be 
offered and realized for families in the long term.
<P>
	It is no accident that the wording of this motion we are debating 
today includes specific reference to deficit elimination. To date this 
government has failed to present any plan to balance the federal 
budget.
<P>
	Government priorities in spending must also recognize not only 
special interests but the best interests of families and thus the best 
interests of society as a whole. Finally, the bias and discriminatory 
aspects that impact negatively upon the family could and should be 
eliminated from the Income Tax Act and its regulations.
<P>
<B>(1820 )</B>
<P>
	In conclusion, it is crucial for the future of the family that 
government acknowledge and recognize the burden of taxation it 
has placed on the Canadian family. It must realize that this burden 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1277"> 1277 </A></B>
<P>
impacts the viability and the contribution of this fundamental 
institution. It must realize that a dollar left in the hands of a 
taxpayer is  better than a dollar in the hands of a bureaucrat or 
politician. It must realize that decisions made by parents are better 
than decisions enforced through programs designed by bureaucrats 
in Ottawa and funded by those parents' taxes.
<P>
	I call on the House to design and implement new priorities; 
priorities that will expand choices for families rather than constrict 
them; priorities that will provide social and economic security for 
families, both for parents and their children; priorities that will 
provide economic social security for future generations; priorities 
that will empower families to realize their dreams and allow them 
to become a vibrant part of the future success of this great land of 
ours.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Sue Barnes (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
National Revenue, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to address 
Private Members' Motion M-148. It is a motion that asks the 
government to recognize the onerous burden of taxation on the 
family and to take immediate measures to provide the family with 
tax relief, including balancing the federal budget.
<P>
	Let me start by underscoring that the government fully 
understands the impact of Canada's level of taxation on many 
families. Unfortunately, what the hon. member fails to appreciate 
are the dramatic actions we are taking to put the country's finances 
in order. And she overlooks the measures we have introduced to 
provide targeted tax relief for families.
<P>
	It is because we are acting not with quick fixes but through a 
strategic approach that will deliver sustained and permanent fiscal 
progress that I must oppose this well intended but precipitous 
motion. Allow me to outline how the government is addressing the 
fiscal and tax burden concerns raised in this private members' 
motion.
<P>
	First let us remember not to put the cart before the horse. The 
fact is that we cannot begin serious tax reduction until the deficit is 
under control. To cut taxes in any other way would simply mean an 
even higher deficit and that simply guarantees that taxes would go 
back up again in the near future because it is the taxpayer who has 
to pay the interest on government borrowing.
<P>
	Again, let me make the relationship clear. It is because we have 
had too many years of high deficits that our tax burden today is so 
high. We are paying for the borrowing appetite of the past. That is 
why we have moved on deficit reduction with courage and 
commitment. But we have not acted in a way that will do more 
damage than good. That would be the result if we took a slash and 
burn approach to eliminate the deficit in just a year or two. We 
would see too many Canadians facing real hardship, too many valid 
government programs virtually eliminated.
<P>
	That is not our approach because that is not what the majority of 
Canadians want. Their choice is for a firm,  balanced progress and
<P>
that we are delivering. That approach was again emphasized earlier 
this month when the Minister of Finance delivered his third budget. 
It is the third step in a comprehensive and determined effort to 
restore fiscal health to the country.
<P>
	The budget plan shows that the government is staying on course 
to eliminate the deficit and put the debt to GDP ratio on a constant 
downward track. The fact is the government bettered its deficit 
target for 1994-95 and it is now clear that the deficit target for 
1995-96 will be achieved or again, bettered. We are on track to 
reach our 3 per cent of GDP target for 1996-97. The budget even 
announced actions to reach a new deficit target for 1997-98 of $17 
billion or 2 per cent of the gross domestic product. Indeed, these 
actions will enable us to move beyond the 2 per cent target toward 
budget balance.
<P>
	These actions build on the major deficit reduction measures 
announced in the government's first two budgets. They include 
further cuts in federal departmental spending amounting to almost 
$2 billion. These cuts will take effect in 1998-99. For most 
departments this means further budget cuts of 3.5 per cent in 
1998-99 and for some departments the cuts are even higher.
<P>
	These measures together with the spending cuts announced in 
our first two budgets add up to a dramatic decline in federal 
government spending. In the 1993-94 time period, government 
spending on programs was $120 billion. By 1998-99, after six 
consecutive years of absolute spending declines, we will have 
reduced it to $105.5 billion.
<P>
<B>(1825)</B>
<P>
	In relation to the size of the economy the scale of this 
achievement is even more evident. Program spending that 
accounted for close to 20 per cent of the gross domestic product a 
decade ago will be reduced to 12 per cent of the GDP. This will be 
its lowest level in 50 years. These spending cuts will also reduce 
the amount of new money the government must borrow on 
financial markets every year.
<P>
	In 1993-94 Canada's borrowing requirements were $30 billion or 
4.2 per cent of our economy. By 1997-98 our actions will have 
reduced this requirement to just $6 billion, or only .7 per cent of 
GDP. This represents major progress in tackling our fiscal 
problems.
<P>
	In 1997-98 the federal government's borrowing requirements 
will be at the lowest level in almost 30 years and lower than those 
projected for the central government of any other G-7 country.
<P>
	As hon. members know, this government has focused on 
spending cuts not tax increases to restore the country's fiscal 
health. Over the three budgets taken together we will have cut 
seven dollars in 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1278"> 1278 </A></B>
<P>
spending for  each one dollar in new revenue. Most important, 
there have been no increases in personal income tax rates.
<P>
	This should prove that our government is very conscious of the 
tax burden on Canadians. Indeed our whole program of fiscal 
measures is designed to achieve two payoffs. The first is to secure 
the future viability of key Canadian social programs such as 
medicare and our public pension programs. The second is to reduce 
taxes for Canadians.
<P>
	This government believes that it would not be responsible to 
introduce major tax cuts before the country's fiscal problems are 
resolved. Nevertheless in the 1996 budget we have been able to 
provide targeted tax relief to families that most need it. We have 
not done this though at the expense of progress in reducing the 
deficit; rather we have reallocated revenues within the tax system.
<P>
	Low income families with children are a priority concern for our 
government. In the 1996 budget we introduced several changes to 
address the needs of these families in particular.
<P>
	First, we introduced a new child support system that includes 
guidelines to ensure fairer and consistent child support settlements, 
measures to help ensure that child support orders are enforced and 
a change in the tax treatment of child support. The new tax rules 
apply to new and amended child support awards beginning May 1, 
1997.
<P>
	Under these rules child support will not be included in the 
income of the recipient for tax purposes, nor will it be tax 
deductible for the payer. This will ensure that children who need 
the support most get it. It will also eliminate the need for complex 
tax calculations and planning by parents. Our approach will treat 
spending on children the same for separated parents as for intact 
families.
<P>
	Second, to increase support for children the budget proposes to 
increase the working income supplement under the child tax 
benefit. This supplement assists low income parents to meet work 
expenses such as child care, transportation and clothing. It also 
helps to make up for the benefits lost by parents who leave social 
assistance and re-enter the workforce. The maximum annual 
benefit will be doubled in two steps. It will increase from $500 to 
$750 in July 1997 and to $1,000 in July 1998. When fully phased 
in, it will increase support by $250 million to about 700,000 low 
income parents.
<P>
	Third, the budget proposed additional support to parents through 
an increase in the age limit on the child care expense deduction 
from 14 years to 16 years. This will be of particular benefit to 
single parents whose jobs require them to be away from the home 
at night.
<P>
	Fourth, the government proposes to provide additional 
assistance to Canadians who provide in-home care for adult 
children and other relatives with disabilities. The  value of the 
infirm dependant credit will be increased from $270 to $400 and 
the income threshold for the reduction in this benefit will be raised 
from $2,690 to $4,103.
<P>
<B>(1830 )</B>
<P>
	Fifth, the government introduced several measure in the 1996 
budget to increase support for students and their families. These 
measures provide an additional $165 million in support over three 
years so that students and their families will be better able to deal 
with the increased costs of education.
<P>
	The education credit will be increased from $80 to $100 per 
month. This credit recognizes the non-tuition costs of schooling. 
The limit on the transfer of the tuition and education credits will be 
raised from $680 to $850 per year. This will provide a transferable 
credit against costs of $5,000 per year, up from $4,000 under the 
current rules. This measure will assist parents and spouses who pay 
the education costs of students.
<P>
	Again, the annual limits on contributions to registered education 
savings plans will be increased from $1,500 to $2,000 and the 
lifetime limit from $31,500 to $42,000. This will assist parents to 
save for their children's education.
<P>
	Finally, single parents attending school full time will be able to 
deduct child care expenses against unearned income and the 
deduction will apply to those completing high school. This will 
assist parents to undertake education or retraining.
<P>
	In summary, I feel I have demonstrated that this government is 
taking responsible steps to put the country's finances in order and 
so provide a sound platform for future tax cuts. At the same time, 
the government is acting to provide targeted tax relief for families 
that need help the most.
<P>
	Accordingly, I urge this House to withhold support for private 
member's Motion No. 148.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Richard Bélisle (La Prairie, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the hon. 
member for Port Moody-Coquitlam is asking the members of this 
House to support motion M-148 which reads as follows: ``That, in 
the opinion of this House, the government should recognize the 
onerous burden of taxation upon the Canadian family, and the 
pressures that such taxation places upon the family, and that this 
government take immediate measures to provide the family with 
tax relief, including balancing the federal budget''.
<P>
	This motion has two important components: family income and 
balancing the federal budget. These two components can, in certain 
cases, be at odds. In fact, one of the ways of balancing the federal 
budget could well be to increase the tax burden on families. The 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1279"> 1279 </A></B>
<P>
other possible  ways of balancing the federal budget would be to 
increase the tax burden on businesses, or to cut spending.
<P>
	For the Bloc Quebecois, the only real way to reduce the tax 
burden on individuals, in addition to balancing the budget without 
cutting social programs, is to find new sources of revenue. In all 
their interventions in this House for over two years, Bloc MPs have 
always made it clear that these new sources of revenue, this new 
money in the federal coffers, called for an immediate, in-depth 
review of business taxation.
<P>
	Reformers, true to their own brand of logic, as always, are again 
suggesting spending cuts as the sole means of balancing the budget. 
We must remember, however, that federal spending consists 
primarily of transfers to individuals and to provinces, the latter 
amounts going a long way towards paying for the provinces' social 
programs. Spending cuts hit individual taxpayers the hardest and 
do not produce the desired results. We are therefore opposed to 
balancing the budget solely through cutbacks in federal spending, 
the approach now being taken by the federal government.
<P>
	The Reform motion emphasizes the family aspect of taxation. 
Here, Reformers are making the same mistake as the Liberals, who 
are now basing the new seniors benefit on the family income of 
couples. When the family income has been established, the 
government will divide the amount of the monthly benefit into two 
equal parts. Is this the Liberals' way of lightening the tax burden on 
families? By limiting their suggestions to spending cuts, Reformers 
are on the wrong track. By targeting family income as the basis for 
government assistance to seniors, the Liberals are also on the 
wrong track.
<P>
	We in the Bloc Quebecois want the budget balanced, but not at 
the expense of families and seniors.
<P>
<B>(1835)</B>
<P>
	The Bloc Quebecois is totally opposed to the government 
initiative to base old age pensions on family income. Taxation 
reform must address individual or business revenue, not family 
income.
<P>
	For cohesiveness, the Reform motion would require a business 
tax reform. Successfully balancing the budget requires business tax 
reform rather than merely tightening up on expenditures, which 
will impact upon the transfer payments to individuals and to the 
provinces.
<P>
	Given the size of transfer payments to individuals and provinces, 
major cuts in expenditures will, of necessity, impact upon those 
same individuals and families.
<P>
	Essentially, these transfer payments comprise the old age 
pension, the guaranteed income supplement, spouse's allowance, 
unemployment insurance benefits, and the taxation agreements, 
health insurance and health care, the Canada assistance plan, 
education support, family allowances and the child tax credits, 
along with a variety of other transfer payments.
<P>
	It can be seen that most of these are aimed at young people, 
seniors and low income families. Interfering with them would 
place the incomes of the least advantaged members of our society 
at risk. Balancing the budget cannot, therefore, go the route of 
cutting transfer payments, at least not in our opinion.
<P>
	Between 1990 and 1995, these transfer payments accounted for 
between 67 per cent and 71 per cent of federal program 
expenditures. Their importance is therefore obvious, when we 
realize that the only other equally large government expenditure 
besides program expenditures is servicing the debt, which remains 
untouched. Other revenues must therefore be found.
<P>
	On the other hand, individuals are already paying more than their 
share of taxes. Between 1990 and 1995, personal income taxes 
accounted for between 78 per cent and 87 per cent of federal tax 
revenues, while corporate taxes for that same period accounted for 
between 11 and 20 per cent.
<P>
	In order to lighten the tax burden on families and balance the 
budget at the same time, we must look at the business tax aspect 
before making heavy cuts to the assistance available to individuals, 
which would only add to the pressure already being felt by our 
families.
<P>
	We know what a heavy burden families have to bear, and we 
know that the only way to balance the budget without increasing 
the burden of individual taxpayers or making drastic cuts in social 
programs, as the Liberal government is doing, is to review the 
corporate tax system to collect the government's missing revenues 
from those who do not pay their fair share.
<P>
	On March 6, in the budget speech, the finance minister 
announced the creation of a committee to review the tax system. 
Some members on this committee are experts in tax evasion: one is 
a representative of Price Waterhouse, a firm with several branches 
in countries considered as tax havens, such as the Bahamas, the 
Caiman Islands, and Switzerland; and one is a representative of 
Ernst &amp; Young which is also a great user of tax havens.
<P>
	For the past two years, the Bloc Quebecois has been demanding 
a true reform of business taxation, the only way to lighten the tax 
burden on Canadian and Quebec families while making it possible 
to balance the budget.
<P>
	The business taxation review process must be public. Input from 
opposition members must be allowed to make the process as open 
and transparent as possible.
<P>
	The government is promising there will be public consultation 
once the experts issue their report; in other words, people will have 
their say once the decisions are already made. Business taxation 
must be streamlined and businesses must be made to pay all the 
taxes they are exempt from. In 1994, tax expenditures on Canadian 
corporations amounted to $9 billion.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1280"> 1280 </A></B>
<P>
	Before the budget, the government was saying it wanted to get 
businesses involved; the Prime Minister challenged them to create 
jobs. This rallying theme seems to have disappeared somewhere 
in between the throne speech and the budget. Businesses are yet 
to be put to task.
<P>
<B>(1840)</B>
<P>
	I fear that the Liberal government is once again going to ignore 
the necessary contribution of businesses to the tax system of this 
country, which badly needs it both to balance its budget and to 
lighten the tax burden on families.
<P>
	Up to now, the only fiscal effort on the part of some corporations 
has been to contribute to the Liberal coffers; as we know, six of the 
eight members of the business taxation review committee come 
from businesses which contributed to the Liberal Party's coffers to 
the tune of $80,000 in 1994.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gary Pillitteri (Niagara Falls, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to speak tonight to the private members' Motion No. 148 
which calls for the House to recognize the heavy burden of taxation 
placed upon Canadian families.
<P>
	This motion also calls for immediate action to be taken to 
provide the Canadian family with tax relief, taking into 
consideration the continuous reduction and balancing of the federal 
budget debt.
<P>
	In my opinion this motion is not very clear. It does not propose 
specific measures. However, the motion does call for tax relief for 
families and a move to a balanced federal budget, a very 
commendable goal.
<P>
	However, the government should not support this motion. The 
Liberal government, in its March 6 budget, has taken several steps 
and measures to address the serious concerns that must have 
prompted this private members' motion.
<P>
	We have seen that the budget does not increase taxes on the 
family. With serious and well balanced measures, the federal 
budget continues to provide expenditure restraint that will 
eventually lead to a balanced budget. This in turn will bring about a 
reduction in the broad based taxes paid by families.
<P>
	The budget has shown that the Liberal government cares about 
families and the welfare of children. This can be seen, for example, 
through measures such as the doubling of the working income tax 
supplement. The child tax benefit will increase to its maximum 
level from $500 to $1,000.
<P>
	These are measures that show how much our government cares 
for families in our society. By restoring a climate of financial 
health, we are paving the way for more dynamic job creation in our 
economy.
<P>
	It is well known that by lowering the deficit we will obtain lower 
interest rates. This in turn will create growth and investment which 
will lead to more jobs and a flourishing economy.
<P>
	We know that the Canadian tax system is effective and fair. 
According to a recent survey taken by the OECD, Organization for 
Economic Co-operation and Development, we rank 14th in the 
world. This means that there are 13 industrialized countries where 
the tax burden is much higher than that of Canada. Our country 
enjoys one of the highest standards of living of all the 
industrialized countries in the world.
<P>
	We have learned that Canada has the highest index of human 
development. Of 173 countries around the world, Canada ranked 
first in terms of longevity, average income, spending for education 
and health care. This is according to the human rights development 
report prepared and published every year by the United Nations.
<P>
	This means that in Canada our tax dollars are well spent. We are 
all receiving an exceptionally high value for the taxes we pay. With 
the new budget, the government has proven that it is meeting the 
fiscal targets it set.
<P>
	After a lower than projected deficit last year, the government is 
now on track to meet or better the target of $32.7 billion in 1995-96 
and 3 per cent of the GDP in 1996-97.
<P>
	The budget also announced $1.9 billion in spending cuts for 
1998-99. This, together with actions introduced in the last two 
budgets, will ensure that the deficit will continue to decline for 
years to come.
<P>
	This motion asks for the relief of pressures that taxation places 
on Canadian families. The budget has already done this. Let us look 
at the support for families.
<P>
<B>(1845)</B>
<P>
	The Liberal government is moving ahead with improvements to 
the child support system in Canada. This strategy announced with 
the budget includes guidelines for setting child support, fairer 
taxation of support payments, better enforcement, and increased 
income supplements for working families.
<P>
	The current system places the tax burden on the custodial parent 
and provides a deduction for the non-custodial parent. Under the 
new child support strategy, custodial parents will no longer pay 
income tax on child support payments and non-custodial parents 
will no longer claim a tax deduction.
<P>
	These new tax rules will apply to agreements and court orders 
made on or after May 1, 1997. They will not apply to existing 
orders unless the orders are varied by the courts or unless the 
parties have agreed to the changes. This means children will 
benefit from a fairer and consistent child support which will be 
paid in full  and on time. In addition to these measures, the parents 
<P>

<B><A NAME="1281"> 1281 </A></B>
<P>
will be allowed to file a joint election with Revenue Canada to 
apply the new tax treatment.
<P>
	Moreover the current age limit of 14 years for children with 
respect to whom the child care deduction may be claimed does not 
recognize the need of many parents, especially the single ones, who 
work at jobs which require them to be away from home at night. 
Accordingly, our government proposes to raise the age limit for 
eligible children to 16 years. This measure will complement the 
other changes made to the child care expense deduction and it will 
without any doubt assist single parents and support learning.
<P>
	The increased assistance is important to the many Canadians 
who are caring for and supporting adult children and other relatives 
who have moderate to severe medical conditions. I am aware of 
many constituents in Niagara Falls and Niagara-on-the-Lake who 
are providing home care for invalid members of their families. 
These families will find relief in the government proposal to 
increase the value of the infirm dependant credit from $270 to $400 
and to raise the dependant net income threshold for the phase out of 
benefits from $2,690 to $4,903.
<P>
	The measures proposed in the budget promote fairness: fairness 
to the Canadian taxpayer who complies with his obligations under 
the Income Tax Act; fairness that will ensure everyone shoulders 
their fair share of the tax burden. These are reasons enough for me 
to vote against this motion.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> There being no further 
members rising for debate and the motion not being designated as a 
votable item, the time provided for the consideration of Private 
Members' Business has now expired and the order is dropped from 
the Order Paper.

[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	A motion to adjourn the House under Standing Order 38 deemed 
to have been moved.
<P>
<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="UNEMPLOYMENTINSURANCEREFORM">UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE REFORM</A></H4>
	<B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, in the context of the adjournment proceedings, I would 
like to go back to a question that I asked the Minister of Human 
Resources Development in early March. It referred to the fact that 
the minister had acknowledged that the bill on unemployment 
insurance reform, known as employment insurance, would penalize 
several workers if thorough changes were not made.
<P>
	Essentially, what we would like to know is what are the changes 
that the minister will put forward. The committee has now been 
sitting for a few days on the subject and the minister has given us 
very vague  indications. On every occasion, on amendment 
proposals coming from the Liberal members, they were always 
talking about very cosmetic, very technical changes. These are 
minimum changes that do not go to the heart of the issue.
<P>
<B>(1850)</B>
<P>
	Essentially, the real question is this: Will the minister be able to 
change budgetary parameters? In the unemployment insurance 
reform, the government expects to use the surplus in the UI fund to 
compensate for the federal deficit. Even though the UI fund money 
is provided totally by workers and employers, the Liberal 
government expects to use the money that is in the surplus. It is $5 
billion for this year alone. Yes, $5 billion.
<P>
	Will the minister to able to do anything to ensure that the reform 
will be changed root and branch? Because the one that is presently 
on the table has been condemned everywhere, by all people 
involved in this reform.
<P>
	Will the minister be able to do anything in the budgetary 
parameters? Will there be a strategy for regional economic 
diversification? It is one thing to try to put the burden of the 
unemployment issue on the unemployed, but seasonal workers do 
not want unemployment. These are people who are caught in a 
seasonal economy, an economy of regions that live on natural 
resources. They have the jobs that they can, and if they could have 
more, they would take them.
<P>
	In the reform project, it would be important that the minister 
gives up this principle that is found in the documents saying that 
seasonal workers are lazy. That is essentially what is being said. In 
all testimonies, we have seen that does not reflect reality.
<P>
	In conclusion, will the minister be able to come back to common 
sense? Will he use the fact that there was a change in ministers to 
thoroughly change the unemployment insurance reform, to put 
back on the table the main things that concern him and to ensure, 
once and for all, that there is a reform, but a reform that will really 
make it possible to fight unemployment and allow more people to 
get jobs?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. George Proud (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Labour, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, employment insurance reform was 
designed to minimize the number of people who will not be eligible 
for income benefits. In fact, the new hours based entrance system 
opens up eligibility to people who were previously not covered by 
unemployment insurance.
<P>
	In addition, while some individuals receive benefits for shorter 
periods, more individuals will have increased duration. This will 
have a net positive impact on social assistance.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="1282"> 1282 </A></B>
<P>
	The family supplement means benefits will increase by 7 per 
cent on average for claimants in low income families with 
children. By protecting those most in need, impacts of the reform 
on social assistance will also be lessened.
<P>
	HRD has estimated the impact of employment insurance reforms 
on social assistance across the country will be in the order of $75 
million by the year 2000. However, this impact will be offset by 
both the $300 million jobs transition fund and the $800 million 
reinvestment in direct re-employment assistance. About 45 per 
cent of current social assistance clients will meet the new 
eligibility requirements for these measures.
<P>
	I would like to remind the hon. member that these employment 
benefits will give people meaningful employment and keep it. By 
doing that, the reforms will again reduce, not increase, the burden 
to provincial social assistance.
<P>
	Further, the government realizes the interaction between 
employment insurance and social assistance clientele is a complex 
one. Departmental officials are now in the process of talking to the 
provinces in order to get their feedback on this impact analysis. 
They have now met with five provinces and will meet with the 
remaining five over the next two weeks. A key purpose of this 
reform is to create needed jobs and help people increase their 
employability.
<P>
	Another issue that the legislation addresses is that of a business 
environment that is conducive to job creation. Lowering premiums 
for employers and employees is a step in that direction. That, when 
considered with the job and growth agenda, will help create more 
jobs and this will further reduce social assistance rolls.
<P>
	Over all, many elements of the new employment insurance 
legislation benefit low income Canadians. Therefore, I urge the 
hon. member who professes to be concerned about the fate of this 
group to support the legislation and thereby be of real help to 
Canadians most in need.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> The motion to adjourn the 
House is now deemed to have been adopted.
<P>
	Accordingly, this House stands adjourned until tomorrow at2 p.m., pursuant to Standing Order 24.
<P>
	(The House adjourned at 6.54 p.m.)
