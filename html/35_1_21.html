	The House resumed from February 9 consideration of the 
motion that Bill C-9, an act to amend the Income Tax Act, be 
read the second time and referred to a committee.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dennis J. Mills (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister 
of Industry):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am happy to have the opportunity 
to speak on Bill C-9.
<P>
	I would like to begin by informing the people who have tuned 
in to the debate today of the contents of this bill. A lot of the 
implementation measures in this bill came from the 1992 fiscal 
statement from the previous government and also the budget of 
April 26, 1993. As a government we recognized some of the 
constructive initiatives the previous government put forward 
and these are examples of legislation we supported.
<P>
<B>(1105) </B>
<P>
	I can remember discussing many of these measures when I 
was the opposition party critic for small business. I do not want 
to suggest that the implementation of these measures represents 
support for the previous government in its total economic thrust, 
but part of its tax amendments, especially those related to small 
business, we did our best to support when we were in opposition 
and made sure they went through the House as quickly as 
possible. I hope we can continue with that approach.
<P>
	In the measures from the economic and fiscal statement 
touched in this legislation, our number one priority is the 
unemployment insurance premium relief for additional jobs. It 
provides a refundable tax credit in respect of an increase in 
unemployment insurance premiums payable by certain 
employers in respect of 1993.
<P>
	The second measure is the temporary small business 
investment tax credit. It provides a temporary 10 per cent, 
non-refundable small business investment tax credit for eligible 
machinery and equipment. It is very important when 
manufacturing companies are  attempting to modernize and 
upgrade so they can become globally competitive and is an 
inducement to make such purchases.
<P>
	The extension of the small business financing program 
extends to the end of 1994. Under this program a small business 
in financial difficulty may refinance up to $500,000 of debt at 
low interest rates. It is very important right now, as I am sure 
many members would agree-and I am going to deal with this a 
little later in my remarks-especially when we are having such 
difficulty in shifting the attitudes of banks toward small 
business.
<P>
	The bill repeals the penalty tax on excess small business 
properties held by RRSPs and registered retirement income 
funds from October 31, 1985. Another component of the bill is 
the labour sponsored venture capital corporations. This adds 
preferred shares to the list of eligible investments for these 
corporations and it facilitates the issuance of shares to RRSPs.
<P>
	Flowthrough shares allow 100 per cent of the first $2 million 
of oil and gas development expenditures to be deducted by 
shareholders. That should certainly be supported by most of the 
Reform members.
<P>
	The removal of mandatory deduction of Canadian exploration 
expenses allows corporations carrying on a resource business to 
choose to deduct lower amounts of Canadian exploration 
expenses in order to utilize non-capital losses before they 
expire.
<P>
	Improvements to the tax credit for scientific research and 
experimental development introduces a simpler method of 
calculating the credit and allows for partial credits and clarifies 
definitions and improves administrations.
<P>
	Three major measures came from the budget. The annual 
investment tax credit limit repeals the annual investment tax 
credit limit for taxation years that begin after 1993. It is 
basically housekeeping. The investment tax credit for scientific 
research and experimental development extends the 35 per cent 
tax credit to Canadian controlled private corporations with prior 
year taxable income under $400,000 and provides a phase-out 
of the $2 million expenditure limit. Last is the instalment 
payments of income tax. Individuals generally have to make 
quarterly instalment payments of taxes if the difference between 
the tax payable and the amounts withheld at source is greater 
than $2,000 in both the current and either of the two preceding 
years. The previous amount was $1,000. Close to 300,000 senior 
citizens with very low incomes had to make quarterly  
instalments which were a tremendous burden for them. When 
the bill is implemented it will be an added convenience or it will 
take the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1278"> 1278 </A></B>
<P>
burden of quarterly instalments away from over 300,000 low 
income senior citizens.
<P>
<B>(1110) </B>
<P>
	Essentially that represents the specific amendments in this 
implementing legislation. As I stated in my opening remarks, 
this is an example of legislation we got behind when it was 
introduced in the budget statement and the fiscal statement 
pre-Christmas last year. We are extremely sensitive. I believe 
actually all members of this House are extremely sensitive that 
we have to do things quickly to help motivate and mobilize the 
entrepreneurial spirit today.
<P>
	All of the measures in this bill are important but I believe they 
are only going to be effective if the partnership of the financial 
institutions with small business starts working again.
<P>
	It was interesting this morning when I came in from Toronto. 
On my desk was a speech that my colleague, our whip, gave at 
Memorial University in Newfoundland on the weekend. The 
whole theme of his speech was how the relationship between 
small business and financial institutions had broken down and 
how we, as members of Parliament, have to take a much more 
aggressive approach in trying to rebuild that relationship.
<P>
	In his remarks he talked about how easy it was for the 
Reichmanns to have access to so much bank financing. Much of 
the money did not even have security and they got it so easily. 
This is a difficulty I have as a member of Parliament, with not 
just the Reichmanns, and I am not singling them out in a 
personal way, but I will give a more current example.
<P>
	We have all read in the papers the last two or three days about 
the proposed takeover of Maclean Hunter by Rogers. About a 
month ago we were reading articles in the newspapers about how 
they were having such cash flow difficulties. They were looking 
for bridge financing to help them get through the next quarter 
and were looking for a couple of hundred million dollars. They 
were having great difficulty because of their debt load.
<P>
	All of a sudden Rogers makes an offer to take over Maclean 
Hunter and the banks are throwing money at the company. An 
article which I am sure members read stated that close to $2 
billion to $3 billion worth of commitments from all the 
chartered banks have lined up to try to help Rogers.
<P>
	I met with one of the vice-presidents of the Rogers 
corporation Friday morning. The very first thing I said to him 
was: ``How do you guys do this? How do you go from having a 
cash flow crunch of $200 million a month ago and now all of a 
sudden you have banks giving you over $2.5 billion? What is 
your trick? What is your secret? Tell me what it is so I can 
communicate what your trick is to the million small businesses 
that seem to be having such difficulty in getting access to 
capital''.
<P>
<B>(1115 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Adams:</B> What was the answer?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mills (Broadview-Greenwood):</B> The answer was what 
he just said, that we are in an industry that has a lot of current 
appeal, the cablevision and electronic highway business. Right 
now that is the issue that is turning on the leaders of the financial 
institutions.
<P>
	The bottom line was they did not really have a reason why all 
of a sudden the banks were throwing money at them. I do not 
begrudge them. If they can make that kind of situation happen, it 
is in the spirit of entrepreneurship and free enterprise. As long as 
it is not too much of a concentration in power then I really do not 
have too much of a problem with it.
<P>
	What I do have a problem with-
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gagliano:</B> Why can't the banks do the same thing for 
small business?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mills (Broadview-Greenwood):</B> Exactly.
<P>
	When I review, reflect and take a look at this piece of 
legislation that we are going to be talking about here today-I 
presume there will not be too much difficulty in passing it-I at 
the same time have to ask myself this. What can we as members 
of Parliament do to not just give amended tax laws to small 
business? What can we as members of Parliament do to address 
their number one problem, access to capital?
<P>
	I am hoping that once again as we head toward a budget date 
and toward committees that all members can be seized with this 
notion of accessing capital to small business.
<P>
	Our party believes-it was part of our red book-that the 
greatest hope we have in this country for putting people back to 
work rests with the small businessmen and women who are the 
ones who take the chances. They are the ones who put their 
homes, savings and RRSPs on the line.
<P>
	I just wish there was a way that the financial institutions could 
realize that they are part of the responsibility of joining with us 
in facing the crisis of unemployment that is before us.
<P>
	I do not really have a lot more to add on this bill but I want to 
go back to the amendment which deals with senior citizens, the 
instalment payments of income tax.
<P>
	This is a very important amendment for our senior citizens. I 
am repeating this because, as many members have heard, the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1279"> 1279 </A></B>
<P>
parliamentary channel is watched by a lot of seniors in our 
country. I think this is a welcomed amendment.
<P>
	Many of our senior citizens were asked to make quarterly 
instalments on very low incomes because of a glitch in the way 
the legislation was written. With this amendment we will be able 
to correct that instalment payment process for about 300,000 
senior citizens.
<P>
	I want to state again that this is a constructive piece of 
legislation. It is geared primarily toward assistance for small 
business using the tax act. Philosophically of course I would 
prefer a different approach to helping small business if we could 
do it in a comprehensive way.
<P>
	I do not like using the tax act to run the economy. I prefer that 
we go back and have a total comprehensive review of our tax act. 
That of course is one of the reasons why I have been advocating 
for many years the idea of a single tax, a system where one 
basically takes the Income Tax Act, all of the 14,000 pages of 
exceptions to exceptions which by now most of us have had a 
chance to review because we have been here for almost a month. 
Special preferences are buried in that act. Most multinationals 
have the ability to benefit from the approach that exists in our 
current tax act. I am optimistic that many of those special 
preferences will be eliminated next Tuesday when the budget is 
presented. I am hopeful.
<P>
<B>(1120) </B>
<P>
	Is it not interesting that we are all being lobbied right now by 
different people for their particular measure to be attended to in 
the budget. I am sure many members have received the briefing 
from the Business Council on National Issues. In that briefing 
they talk about the fact that they want no new grants to business, 
no grants to business.
<P>
	I thought this was incredible. They think that grants are 
moneys received directly from line departments, whether it be 
industry, agriculture or whatever. The real grants that big 
business receives in this country are buried in this tax act. I just 
wish when the Business Council on National Issues says no new 
grants or cut back on grants that it would include all the ones that 
are buried in the tax act.
<P>
	I am happy today to at least acknowledge the fact that 90 per 
cent of the measures are for small business and I hope this bill 
goes through the House quickly.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Julian Reed (Halton-Peel):</B> Mr. Speaker, I commend 
the hon. member for his comments regarding small business and 
senior citizens. In the riding of Halton-Peel small business 
dominates. There is no large industry. Therefore, between farms 
and small and medium sized businesses, it looks after about 90 
per cent of people in those kinds of pursuits.
<P>
	Not being a financial specialist as is the hon. member, I have 
trouble keeping my household accounts in line. I would like to 
make one small comment regarding the flow-through shares 
issues and the resource industries that are going to be positively 
affected by this.
<P>
	Some years back flow-through shares were a common thing 
in this country. I do not recall what year they were done away 
with. We must remember that the technology of the mining 
industry has been centred in Canada, much of it in southern 
Ontario. Resource industries, which we tend to dismiss as we 
move into high tech and electronic highways and these types of 
things, still are the backbone of the economy of this country and 
will continue that way for many years to come.
<P>
	I wonder if the hon. member could enlarge on those elements, 
the flow-through shares and so on that are going to positively 
affect the mining industry.
<P>
	Being a layman, and probably many who are watching this on 
television will be lay people as well, I do not understand 
flow-through shares. I do not think many of us do.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mills (Broadview-Greenwood):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would 
like to first of all acknowledge the sensitivity of the member for 
Halton-Peel to the small businessmen and women in his riding. 
I have been through the member's riding many times. It is a 
vibrant riding. This is an example. If his community has 
incredible growth potential and if the small business sector gets 
ignited again, I know it can pick up a lot of the unemployed 
community that exists within the greater Toronto region.
<P>
<B>(1125 ) </B>
<P>
	I am not an expert on flow-through shares, so I do not want to 
get into this in a technical way without having all of the 
documents in front of me. I will give the member an undertaking 
that I will get the specific meaning on how this will help the 
mining industry. I will get it to him forthwith today.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ted White (North Vancouver):</B> I would like to thank the 
hon. member for his speech and ask him a question in line with 
the small business comments which he made. He mentioned 
small business a number of times in his speech.
<P>
	I am from the riding of North Vancouver where there is a 
pretty high concentration of small businesses and quite a large 
number of home-based businesses. They certainly are 
concerned about taxes and high tax levels. In fact I get a lot of 
feedback from them in line with the member's wish that the tax 
act be modified and moved toward a single tax of some sort. 
There is a lot of support for that.
<P>
	The other side of the equation is that the area of government 
expenditures and spending creates the need for more and more 
taxation. The hon. member mentioned that small businesses in 
his riding give him plenty of feedback on the tax issue. Could he 
tell me whether he receives regular feedback from small  
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1280"> 1280 </A></B>
<P>
businesses in his area that the government should cut its 
spending as well.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mills (Broadview-Greenwood):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
appreciate the comments of the hon. member for North 
Vancouver. They are always constructive.
<P>
	What I hear from the small business community in my city is, 
first of all, that the regulatory burden that exists for them, the 
paper burden, is number one. This is after bank financing. The 
overall complaint, of course, is access to capital. Then it is paper 
burden and tax reform.
<P>
	In terms of government spending, I hear from small business 
that what we have to eliminate duplication and eliminate 
government waste.
<P>
	If a program is meeting a good public policy objective and we 
are getting value for the money, most people I talk to can 
understand that. What they cannot stand and what they resent is 
government waste. I am totally in support of the member's 
concern for government waste. When we eliminate government 
waste we are cutting government spending. That type of 
government cutting I am totally in support of, as is our entire 
party.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Leon E. Benoit (Vegreville):</B> Mr. Speaker, I just have a 
few comments for the hon. minister and I would like his 
feedback on these comments.
<P>
	First, in terms of banks not lending to small business, I think it 
is understandable that they are not doing so as readily as one 
would expect them to. The reasons have been made clear to me 
in my constituency.
<P>
	My constituency also depends on small businesses, as do most 
across the country. These small business people are farmers and 
other types of small business people. They have told me that the 
biggest problem, as the hon. member alluded to, is 
over-regulation, too much paperwork, that it is too expensive 
just to set a business up and to operate a business because of 
regulation and, in particular, the new environmental 
regulations. Environmental reports that have to be filled out by 
banks to lend to a small business have made it too expensive for 
banks to lend.
<P>
	The second reason I am given for banks not lending to small 
business is that there is just not a high enough profit margin. 
Taxation in this country is too high. Too much of what would be 
profit and what is profit goes to taxes. They are too high.
<P>
	The third area is the lack of confidence that business people 
have in the economy. This lack of confidence is due, certainly in 
large part, to our incredibly large debt and our incredibly large 
annual deficit. If business people do not have confidence 
themselves why would banks have confidence enough to lend to 
them?
<P>
<B>(1130) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mills (Broadview-Greenwood):</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the member for Vegreville for his question.
<P>
	First on the issue related to environmental requirements I am 
totally in support of it. Any business person I have ever talked to 
who converted to green business movement has ended up 
making more money because of his commitment to the 
environment. I would not want a lesser commitment to the 
environmental sustainable development. I would want as much 
or more than we currently have.
<P>
	The second point in terms of the non-profitability of small 
business to banks I do not accept. Aside from clipping bonds for 
the Government of Canada, I think the small business 
community is the most profitable sector of all the banks with the 
spreads on interest and the service charges. It is unacceptable 
that a bank person would say there is no profit in the small 
business sector.
<P>
	Besides that the banks of the country have a unique banking 
charter organized by the Chamber under the Bank Act of 
Canada. It is not only to protect depositors' funds. We recognize 
that, but aside from protecting depositors' funds they are also 
mandated in that unique charter to lend to business. It is 
unacceptable if any bank person would say there is no profit in 
the small business sector. I hope the member for Vegreville 
would challenge the bank person who said that to him.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The time has now expired for questions 
and comments. Normally we would pass to the Reform Party but 
a spokesman for the party has indicated that its members have 
done all the speaking they wish to do on the bill.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. René Laurin (Joliette):</B> Mr. Speaker, when the hon. 
member for Scarborough East, speaking for the Minister of 
Finance, moved for second reading and referral to a committee 
of Bill C-9, he said: ``We have carefully reviewed the measures 
in this legislation and believe we can support them in their own 
right''. He added, however, that one of the measures in the old 
legislation had been dropped and that, as for the other measures, 
to quote the minister: ``Our primary criticism generally is that 
they represent only a small piecemeal effort by the previous 
government to deal with a large and pressing need in this 
country to strengthen the economy and to create jobs''.
<P>
	A little further the hon. member said the following: ``I ask my 
colleagues and my hon. friends opposite to consider this 
legislation not as an indication of the approach this government 
takes to economic management''.
<P>
	Since the Liberals have now been in power for four months 
and we still do not know what this government intends to do, 
perhaps I may comment and express some of the reservations we 
have about the economic measures this government intends to 
implement very shortly.
<P>
	The newly-elected federal government announced in the 
speech from the throne on January 18, 1994, that it attached the 
highest priority to job creation and economic growth. The 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1281"> 1281 </A></B>
<P>
government has said repeatedly,  both in the speech from the 
throne and in its red book, that it will focus on small and 
medium-sized businesses because they will be the decisive 
factor for economic recovery. So far, we have seen no 
significant measures to help small and medium-sized 
businesses, with the exception of Bill C-9, which was drafted by 
the now defunct Conservative Party and which, in the opinion of 
the hon. member for Scarborough East who introduced the bill, 
reflects an approach that combines slash and burn with 
ineffective tinkering.
<P>
<B>(1135) </B>
<P>
	It is high time the government recognized the considerable 
potential for job creation in the small business sector. In fact, 
small businesses as a whole continue to provide the jobs that are 
so badly needed in this country at a time when large companies 
are downsizing.
<P>
	From 1979 to 1989, companies with fewer than 50 employees 
represented 85 per cent of net job creation in the private sector. 
In 1990, although the country's economy was not doing well, 
small businesses with fewer than 20 employees took up the slack 
created by downsizing of large companies as a result of cost 
cutting and business closures.
<P>
	Net job creation by expanding and new small businesses 
represented practically all net job creation since the beginning 
of the recession in 1990.
<P>
	Even in 1991, when due to the recession more businesses went 
bankrupt than were created, net job creation by very small 
businesses with fewer than five employees helped cushion the 
impact of substantial job losses elsewhere in our economy.
<P>
	Canadian small businesses are ready and able to act as a 
springboard to a much needed economic recovery. They are 
better adapted to a changing economy where markets have 
become more specialized and decentralized. They represent an 
invaluable potential for job creation and economic growth. 
According to a survey conducted by Angus Reid for the 
Canadian Federation of Independent Business, these businesses 
survived the recession and are now ready to hire more 
employees. They will if small and medium-sized businesses are 
confident that conditions are improving. However, despite 
lower inflation and interest rates and the lower value of the 
dollar, they are still hesitant to make such decisions.
<P>
	Unfortunately, this attitude is reinforced by the increasing tax 
burden on consumers and small businesses, generated by all 
levels of government. The federal government particularly has 
shown during the past 20 years that it is incapable of or little 
inclined to control a steadily growing deficit.
<P>
	Now more than ever before, businesses want and need 
government policies that create a climate of certainty. They are 
justifiably afraid of being hit by more taxes, regulations and 
administrative red tape.
<P>
	The federal government has told everyone who would listen 
that it understands the needs of small businesses. However, it 
keeps drifting off course with measures that are the exact 
opposite of what small businesses feel they need, for instance 
fewer and less cumbersome regulations, which would provide 
relief for small businesses and consumers.
<P>
	Bill C-9 contains fiscal measures to help small and 
medium-sized businesses with the purchase of production 
equipment, including machines, materials, and so forth. We 
must not forget, however, that there is already a long list of 
federal and provincial programs to assist small businesses, all 
with more or less the same objectives. Just to illustrate my point, 
I will give a non-exhaustive list of federal and Quebec agencies 
in charge of helping small and medium-sized businesses 
modernize and conduct research and development.
<P>
<B>(1140) </B>
<P>
	At the federal level we have the Federal Business 
Development Bank, the National Research Council, the 
Department of Industry and the Federal Office of Regional 
Development for Quebec.
<P>
	In Quebec we have the following agencies: Centre de 
recherche industrielle du Québec; Fonds de développement 
technologique; Société de développement industriel; ministère 
de l'Industrie, du Commerce et de la Technologie; Caisse de 
dépôt et de placement du Québec.
<P>
	I should say that these are only the main agencies. We could 
add a lot of sectoral organisations, or municipal, regional, 
semi-public or non-profit organizations.
<P>
	I excluded from the list the provincial tax incentives to 
encourage investment, and the federal and provincial programs 
for export, computerization, automation, expansion, growth or 
marketing. Job training or retraining programs are also 
excluded, as well as those dealing with technology transfer, 
start-up and general financing.
<P>
	As you can see, Mr. Speaker, there is quite an array of 
programs which overlap or offer the same services in the various 
departments or the different levels of government.
<P>
	The situation is so complex and so confusing that small and 
medium-sized businesses would require the services of 
consultants or tax experts that most of the time they cannot 
afford to find the programs which could best answer their needs.
<P>
	I recognize that small businesses need help, but to make all 
the measures at their disposal effective and efficient, we urgent-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1282"> 1282 </A></B>
<P>
ly require serious thinking in order to try to eliminate overlaps 
and duplication, and their tremendous cost.
<P>
	We should look first for a simpler way of qualifying 
expenditures to facilitate small business access to these 
measures; second, we should streamline aid programs to reduce 
their excessive administrative cost; third, we should have a 
single entry point for all forms of aid to small businesses, as 
suggested by the Montreal Chamber of Commerce; fourth, we 
should eliminate overlaps between the federal and provincial 
programs, by delegating to the provinces which apply for it, the 
management and preparation of business assistance measures.
<P>
	In the second part of my speech, I would like to focus on 
another amendment to the Income Tax Act proposed by Bill 
C-9. This is the extension to March 1, 1994 of the home buying 
program. The amendment extends by one year the program 
which allows first time home buyers to use part of their RRSP to 
buy a new home.
<P>
	What I will say is largely based on an analysis of the program 
prepared by W. Paul McCrossan for the Canadian Real Estate 
Association.
<P>
	The federal government has often used housing programs to 
stimulate the economy during recession periods. This particular 
program was introduced in the February 1992 budget. It allows 
buyers to withdraw, tax-free, up to $20,000 from their RRSP to 
use as a downpayment when buying or building a new home. 
However, the money withdrawn must be returned to the RRSP 
by way of an equal payment plan over 15 years. Originally, 
people had until March 1, 1993 to take advantage of this 
measure, but now Bill C-9 extends the limit to March 1, 1994, a 
couple of weeks from now.
<P>

<P>
	On September 1, 1993, the Canada Mortgage and Housing 
Corporation published data showing that in 1992 consumers 
using the home buyers' plan accounted for 26 per cent of all 
sales at the national level.
<P>
	Department of Finance statistics show that during the first 
year of the plan, which ended on March 1, 1993, a total of 
153,452 persons benefited from the home buyers' plan. 
Moreover, according to raw data for the five months from March 
2 to July 29, 1993, the department has received 45,500 
additional requests for withdrawal of funds from RRSPs. These 
data clearly show that this plan is still fulfilling real and urgent 
needs.
<P>
	As I mentioned before, Angus Reid recently published the 
results of a vast survey ordered by The Canadian Real Estate 
Association, which clearly illustrate the relationship between 
the economic situation surrounding the usage of the home 
buying plan and the demographic characteristics, the attitudes 
and the views of those who take advantage of it.
<P>
	According to the survey, households withdrew on average 
$13,965 from RRSPs for a downpayment on a house. Almost 
half of the households, that is 47 per cent, used their RRSPs to 
buy their first home. More than a third, precisely 34.5 per cent, 
of the total amount invested by those who took advantage of the 
plan came from RRSPs. However, among families with a total 
income of less than $30,000, almost half the capital invested 
came from RRSPs, that is 46.8 per cent.
<P>
	Even if there are no restrictions in the plan for first home 
buyers, one of the social effects of the plan's provisions is to 
give those who otherwise would never be able to afford a house, 
the opportunity to buy one. Nearly half, that is 47 per cent, of 
those who took advantage of the plan were buying their first 
home.
<P>
	Furthermore, among first home buyers, 86 per cent mentioned 
that the plan was a decisive factor in their decision to buy a 
house. Analysis by income category also shows that middle and 
low-income Canadians were mainly the ones who benefited 
from the plan.
<P>
	Among users of the plan chosen at random for the survey: 28 
per cent were from the upper middle class with an annual income 
between $50,000 and $70,000; 23 per cent were of the lower 
middle class with an income of between $30,000 and $50,000; 
and 10 per cent were of low income, that is below $30,000. They 
are the ones who have the hardest time buying a house.
<P>
	The key question raised by the home buyers' plan is whether 
or not this plan supplements the existing system allowing for 
retirement income high enough to be taxable or if it encourages 
immediate goods consumption at the expense of retirement 
income security?
<P>
	Participants were asked to indicate on a one to seven scale the 
importance of various elements with respect to retirement 
income security. Ownership of a house came first with 6.1, 
followed by personal savings-5.8, RRSPs-5.7, Canada 
pension plan-4.5 and old age security-4.5.
<P>
	Not only do low income and lower middle class Canadian 
families consider owning a house as the single most important 
factor for their retirement income security, they also gave it the 
highest rating among types of incomes, that is 6.2.
<P>
<B>(1150) </B>
<P>
	Regardless of their age, all respondents said that owning a 
home was very important, 55 per cent said it was fairly 
important, 19 per cent found it to be important, and 13 per cent 
declared that it was important for Canadians as a whole, in terms 
of their retirement income security. The importance of owning a 
home for retirement income security was confirmed when 84 per 
cent of all respondents said that as far as they were concerned, it 
was from very important to rather important.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1283"> 1283 </A></B>
<P>
	Only 6 per cent of respondents believed that they could count 
on old age security or the Canada pension plan; 90 per cent were 
of the opinion that they would have to rely much more on their 
own resources in the future. This cynicism regarding 
government pension plans was more pronounced in the 25 to 35 
age group, 3 per cent of whom believed they could rely on old 
age security or the Canada pension plan, compared with 95 per 
cent who believed that they would have to support themselves.
<P>
	To conclude, in view of such attitudes and given how 
important owning a home is for these respondents to secure their 
retirement income, it is hardly surprising that the maximum use 
of the RRSP home buyers' plan is found in the 25 to 45 age 
group.
<P>
	As a result of these survey findings, I suggest that the 
government extend the home buyers' plan another year, or better 
yet, another three or five years. At the end of this period, the 
program should be reviewed, taking into account the suggested 
economic activity, the demographic characteristics of the home 
buyers, and the actual amount of loans paid back to the RRSP.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ian McClelland (Edmonton Southwest):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
have received many letters and on behalf of the constituents I 
represent I would like to underscore the member's comments 
with regard to the continuation of the RRSP program for home 
purchasers.
<P>
	I wonder if the hon. member could speak to some degree about 
the validity of continuing the use of RRSP money for major 
home renovations. That area is labour intensive and would be 
very good for the economy.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Laurin:</B> Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my hon. colleague 
for the interest he showed in my speech and tell him that having 
access to their RRSP, the only money most people managed to 
save allows them to tap their own savings to improve their way 
of life, prepare for their retirement, and invest in the only thing 
they still put their trust in.
<P>
	Each time we open the door so that these people have easier 
access, either to ownership or to home improvement, we give 
them a greater sense of pride, at no cost to the government since 
it is their own savings they are using. The money in an RRSP is 
money invested by savers. In fact, it is a form of tax deferral, 
money that will eventually be put back into the public purse; it is 
not lost for the government. In the meantime, let these people 
have access to it, as easily as possible.
<P>
	We could take additional measures. For example, the 
government is planning to eliminate the $100,000 capital gains 
exemption. The wealthiest members of our society already took 
advantage of the $500,000 exemption, which was brought down 
to $100,000, and only the middle class and the less fortunate 
members of our society could benefit from it. Unfortunately, the  
government is planning to do away with this exemption, 
penalizing once more the least fortunate. We objected to such 
measures and will continue to do so; we are hoping to get the 
support of our colleagues in the Reform Party, who should be 
equally interested in protecting the less fortunate members of 
society.
<P>
	I urge them to take a position in support of our action, and I 
hope that they will do so.
<P>
<B>(1155) </B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would 
like to ask the member to reconsider his position with regard to 
the capital gains exemption. As the member knows the $100,000 
lifetime exemption did come in under a previous government 
two Parliaments ago.
<P>
	There were two very serious flaws in regard to that 
exemption. First, it did not establish a V-day value for 
investments. Therefore anyone who had a holding gain prior to 
the introduction of that exemption got an automatic windfall. 
Second, it did not restrict the types of eligible investments under 
that exemption. Therefore investments in matters such as 
Florida vacation properties were eligible for an exemption. I 
have to ask the member whether he believes that kind of 
investment really benefits Canada.
<P>
	One has to consider whether or not there is a logical stopping 
point. There is no question that some have benefited from this 
exemption and there is no question that others would like to. 
Where do we stop the process? There is no logical ending point.
<P>
	The question therefore is if today we had no exemption would 
the hon. member consider introducing it as a measure which 
would benefit Canadians today? I think the answer is simply no.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Laurin:</B> Mr. Speaker, what I find surprising about my 
hon. colleague's comments is his belief that maintaining these 
exemptions would be dangerous. We have reached the point 
where it is members of the middle class and the less fortunate 
would could benefit from them.
<P>
	Why were these same concerns not raised when the wealthier 
members of our society were taking advantage of the 
exemptions? Why did we not criticize this mismanagement or 
these so-called new objectives which surprised us because the 
plan was not producing the anticipated results? And all the while 
we were trying to achieve objectives we did not want, we were 
letting the wealthy members of society benefit from them. Now 
that the wealthy class has filled its pockets, it is the turn of the 
middle class and the less wealthy to take advantage of these 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1284"> 1284 </A></B>
<P>
exemptions and here we are telling them: we have to put a stop to 
this. It is over. Your turn will never come.
<P>
	This is unacceptable. There cannot be a double standard in our 
system. While those with money were able to take advantage of 
these exemptions in the months and weeks following the 
introduction of the measures, unfortunately this was not the case 
for other people who had to wait and save their money before 
eventually making a profit.
<P>
	I am sorry to hear say that this measure must be eliminated 
because it is now the turn of the little people in our society. As is 
often the case, they will not get their kick at the can. Most of the 
measures we can expect to see in the government's upcoming 
budget could put us in the same situation.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dennis J. Mills (Parliamentary Secretary to </B><B>Minister 
of Industry):</B> Mr. Speaker, first I want to say that I listened to 
the question from my colleague from Mississauga South. He 
was not suggesting we should not be sensitive to middle income 
earners who have that exemption. He was saying we should 
make sure that tax measure is not designed in a way to encourage 
investment outside of Canada, such as Florida properties and I 
support the hon. member on that.
<P>
	The hon. member has made a compelling presentation today 
for first time home owners through the RRSP and I salute him 
for that. It is one of the best I have heard. We can only hope in the 
next couple of weeks that the member's recommendation is 
listened to.
<P>
	I want to talk about the point he made in the first part of his 
speech relating to the duplication of provincial programs for 
small business and Government of Canada programs for small 
business and the fact that we should streamline the process.
<P>
<B>(1200) </B>
<P>
	The member talked about decentralizing. Would he consider a 
decentralizing or streamlining of the programs if they were 
operated by the Government of Canada in the regions or in the 
provinces? Or, is the member advocating that the Government of 
Canada should just get out of the business of helping small 
business, period? What is the member's position?
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Laurin:</B> Mr. Speaker, I listened with a great deal of 
interest to the comments of my hon. colleague opposite, 
particularly when he said that the intention was not, apparently, 
to eliminate the $100,000 capital gains exemption, but rather to 
stop the flow of capital out of the country. If there were some 
way to do away with this irritant without denying the middle 
class and the less wealthy the opportunity to benefit from the 
exemption, then we would welcome this timely initiative and we 
would certainly support it.
<P>
	As far as decentralization and duplication are concerned, the 
Bloc Quebecois maintained throughout the election campaign 
that the federal government should withdraw from certain areas 
and leave responsibility for program administration up to the 
provinces. We have spoken at length about occupational 
training. This is a good example of an area from which the 
federal government should withdraw. Responsibility for 
manpower training should be left to the provinces because it is a 
matter of education and under the Constitution, education falls 
under provincial jurisdiction. If the present situation persists, 
there will continue to be unproductive duplication in this area.
<P>
	We could give other examples, health and research and 
development, for instance. It is unfortunate that we have not 
succeeded in eliminating duplication, the reason being that the 
federal government wants to maintain a high-profile in 
provincial areas of jurisdiction. And yet, every Quebec premier 
over the past 30 years, whether blue, red, separatist or 
sovereigntist, has called for responsibility for these areas to be 
handed over to the province. I think there is a major consensus 
within the province of Quebec, especially on this issue. And I 
hope the federal government ultimately recognizes this fact.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The time allotted for questions and 
comments has now expired. Resuming debate, since there are no 
more Liberals or Reform party members who wish to speak, I 
recognize the hon. member for La Prairie representing the Bloc 
Quebecois, the Official Opposition.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Richard Bélisle (La Prairie):</B> Mr. Speaker, the proposals 
contained in Bill C-9 implement measures announced, as you 
will all recall, by the previous government in its economic and 
fiscal statement and April 1993 budget.
<P>
	The new government, already short of ideas on new tax 
incentives to offer small business owners and workers, is 
borrowing ideas from an old government worn out by nine years 
in office.
<P>
	This bill in fact proposes 12 amendments to the Income Tax 
Act. As we all know, the first measure deals with unemployment 
insurance premium relief for additional jobs. It provides a 
refundable tax credit in respect of an increase in unemployment 
insurance premiums payable by certain employers for 1993.
<P>
	How much does it cost to administer this extensive red tape? 
That is the question. This kind of relief is reminiscent of GST 
refunds. The government collects some $13 billion in GST. 
Once you subtract all the associated administrative costs and 
refunds, you realize that this tax, while it was supposed to 
reduce the debt and eliminate the annual deficit, is really 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1285"> 1285 </A></B>
<P>
bringing in very little revenue because of the red tape and all the 
efforts put into levying it.
<P>
	It is the same thing with the unemployment insurance 
premium relief proposed in Bill C-9. What is the use of 
increasing taxes and premiums without eliminating loopholes? 
That is basically what is suggested here: reductions, relief for 
certain target groups. Why favour those groups over others? At 
the end of the day, all those taxes and premiums are of very little 
benefit to the community as a whole.
<P>
<B>(1205) </B>
<P>
	This morning I had before me a copy of the federal Income 
Tax Act. It is a four-inch thick document. The main objective of 
income tax should be to enable the government first to collect 
the money it needs to operate and second to redistribute the 
wealth among the population.
<P>
	Why all these tax credits, these extensions, these abolitions 
and so on, if not to feed and support the whole bureaucratic 
machine and all the professionals gravitating to it.
<P>
	A friend of mine who owns a small business was telling me 
last week: ``A small business with 20 employees must have a 
full-time person, I repeat full-time, just to fill out government 
questionnaires and forms, including the endless changes, like 
those proposed in Bill C-9, that the government is constantly 
making to its laws and regulations.'' This friend is the owner of 
a small business employing some 20 people.
<P>
	And to think that, during the last election campaign, one could 
read on page 19 of the Liberal Party's red book: ``Expenditure 
reductions will be achieved by cancelling unnecessary 
programs, streamlining processes, and eliminating duplication. 
This effort will take place in partnership with provincial 
governments''.
<P>
	Unfortunately, the red book does not mention that the 
government will stop constantly increasing taxes and expanding 
the tax base by always creating exemptions for various groups, 
as proposed in Bill C-9. If the government conducted cost 
benefit analyses before creating new taxes or raising 
contributions such as unemployment insurance premiums, it 
would know the real, net benefit from each type of tax or 
contribution.
<P>
	The tax or contribution collection costs should include the 
true cost of the bureaucracy needed to collect this tax, as well as 
the cost of all these relief measures, tax credits, tax deductions 
and program extensions such as those proposed in the bill before 
us today.
<P>
	If we add up all tax collection costs and all changes and relief 
measures to make taxes less regressive for the poor or less 
detrimental to investors or investments creating jobs, the real 
benefit of various taxes or contributions is often minimal in the 
end for the government.
<P>
	Bill C-9 is aimed at amending the very foundation of the 
income tax act. We in the Bloc Quebecois want to tell this to the 
current government: We already have in Canada a four-inch 
thick Income Tax Act. Let us stop making it more complicated 
and trying to make it more complex. What taxpayers want is 
simpler tax procedures. We should redesign this legislation 
from top to bottom and stop making it more complex, only to 
feed, as I was saying earlier, the whole bureaucratic machine 
and all kinds of tax consultants.
<P>
	If we read carefully the 12 changes proposed in Bill C-9, what 
do we see? The first measure provides for premium relief. The 
second one refers to a tax credit that, in fact, amounts to a 
temporary exemption for small business. It is a kind of tax 
shelter, another exemption. Why create so many tax measures 
when there are so many exemptions in the end?
<P>
	The third measure is also an extension for small business. 
This begs the question: Why do we always have to rescue fiscal 
lame ducks unable to make it on their own?
<P>
	The fourth measure abolishes a tax. The fifth concerns 
labour-sponsored venture capital corporations. It is another 
addition to the current Income Tax Act. The sixth measure also 
extends an existing plan. The seventh measure refers to 
flow-through shares. It is a tax deduction, another tax shelter. 
The eighth measure removes a deduction; it amends an existing 
measure. The ninth measure is also an improvement to an 
existing credit.
<P>
	The question we should be asking is this: Why all these tax 
shelters? On this subject, the economist Jean-Luc Migué tells 
us: ``Why subsidize investments? If they are profitable, they 
will be made; if not, they should not be made from an economic 
standpoint''.
<P>
<B>(1210) </B>
<P>
	These first nine measures of which I just spoke are taken from 
the former Conservative government's economic and fiscal 
statement, as was mentioned before. As I also said, did this 
government inherit its fiscal imagination from the former 
Conservative government?
<P>
	The last three measures were also announced in the former 
government's budget of April 26, 1993. Here again, measure 10 
is a tax credit, measure 11 is another tax credit and measure 12 
concerns instalment payments of income tax. These 12 fiscal 
measures are a heterogeneous assortment, with no overall 
vision.
<P>
	We would have expected imaginative, innovative fiscal 
measures that would have created jobs, but they give us 
adjustments to old tax measures that only further entrench this 
Tower of Babel which the federal Income Tax Act is.
<P>
	The Prime Minister and the Minister of Finance always tell us 
to wait for the next budget when we ask them what fiscal policy 
this new government intends to adopt.  Why have Bill C-9 when 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1286"> 1286 </A></B>
<P>
the next budget will likely change everything again on February 
22?
<P>
	I will let this House consider the study conducted by André 
Lareau and a team at Laval University, which says: ``If the 
government is not more imaginative, the reason is that the 
lobbying is done not by families but by companies. Thus, 
parents must pay tax on diapers, but there is no tax when you buy 
shares in a company''.
<P>
	We might also add that the lobbying is not done by 
middle-class individuals or the most disadvantaged people and 
this new government acts only in response to well-organized 
pressure groups, which explains an Income Tax Act that is 
changed and gets bigger in response to pressure from various 
quarters.
<P>
	In conclusion, I would like to emphasize that Bill C-9 says 
nothing about helping families who have to pay taxes, indeed 
income taxes.
<P>
	Mr. Yves Séguin, a former Minister of Revenue in Quebec, 
said in <I>La Presse</I> on February 6, 1994: ``Former spouses, in most 
cases ex-wives, who receive alimony must add it to their 
income. This alimony is calculated very strictly, on the basis of 
the children's needs, and gives the mother absolutely nothing. 
Instead of paying 25 per cent income tax, for example, in many 
cases she has to pay 37 per cent or more, perhaps $2,000 or 
more, and she does not have the money to pay it''.
<P>
	Finally, nowhere in this Bill C-9 do we see any tax measures 
directly for the people, individuals or families, but rather 
abatement measures intended for businesses, and most of these 
abatement measures are inherited from the former Conservative 
government.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jesse Flis (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Foreign Affairs):</B> Mr. Speaker, I was very interested in the hon. 
member's comments on clauses 9 and 11 that pertain to 
scientific research and experimental development. He did not 
like the changes being recommended in the bill.
<P>
	I thought any movement toward targeting money more 
efficiently for R and D would be welcomed by the hon. member. 
If he feels these specific clauses are not good amendments to the 
bill, I am wondering whether he would recommend alternate 
clauses to replace them.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bélisle:</B> Mr. Speaker, as I said during my speech, we 
would have liked to see in Bill C-9 some income tax measures 
affecting individuals and families more directly.
<P>
<B>(1215) </B>
<P>
	In Quebec, the provincial tax legislation contains a whole 
slew of measures designed to help parents more directly, 
especially parents of young children. One has to recognize that 
this bill contains provisions which are more directly targeted to 
businesses.
<P>
	The hon. member referred to measures 9 and 11 concerning 
research and development. I do hope that, for once, these 
measures can benefit Quebec. We know that in the last ten years, 
all the help provided to R and D has essentially benefitted 
Ontario, at the expense of Quebec. During the period from 1980 
to 1989, Ontario got most of the federal subsidies for research, 
namely 50 per cent. Historically, Quebec only received 17 per 
cent of federal grants for research and development.
<P>
	I do hope that this bill will, for once, benefit Quebec as much 
as the other provinces of Canada, especially Ontario.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
congratulate the member on his intervention in this debate on 
Bill C-9. I want to add some clarification.
<P>
	If I understood the member's statement correctly the GST 
revenue was somewhat less than $15 billion and after expenses 
it really contributed none.
<P>
	In fact in terms of gross collections by the government the 
GST contributed some $29.5 billion. However, that was reduced 
by the $10.7 billion which the government paid in rebates, 
particularly to exporters because the input credits exceeded the 
taxes collected on their sales to non exports. That was further 
reduced by the rebates paid to schools, municipalities, et cetera 
which generally get about a 50 per cent refund of GST paid. 
Finally, there was a deduction of some $2.5 billion which was 
paid to low and middle income Canadians as a GST credit. 
Therefore, on a net basis after all those expenses the GST 
revenue to the government was $14.9 billion for the year ended 
March 31, 1993.
<P>
	Having said all that we certainly do know the federal sales tax 
collected some $18 billion net. The GST has been a less efficient 
tax in terms of generating revenues for the government. Right 
now the finance committee has been working diligently looking 
into alternatives for replacing the GST to make sure there is 
efficiency and equity within our taxation system.
<P>
	I raise those points for the member to ensure there is no 
misconception by Canadians on the present state of affairs.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bélisle:</B> Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the hon. member for 
his comment. Indeed, I was referring to GST revenue, which was 
something like $13 billion or $14 billion, give or take a billion 
or a billion and a half.
<P>
	This tax brings in between $13 and $15 billion annually. This 
is more or less what I wanted to point out regarding Bill C-9, 
namely that the government should conduct cost benefit 
analyses or more in-depth studies before creating new taxes, 
and that it should also eliminate loopholes. I am not strictly 
referring to 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1287"> 1287 </A></B>
<P>
tax loopholes, but also to all those exceptions which are made 
whenever a new levy or tax is implemented.
<P>
	Of course, the government wants those taxes to be the least 
regressive possible. Reductions and exceptions are provided for 
the poorest individuals or households. In this case, I think you 
mentioned the figure of $17 billion for GST related credits to 
exporters, and 50 per cent of the GST for schools and hospitals. 
If you eliminate all that and add the cost of the administrative 
work done to collect the tax, you end up with $14.9 billion when, 
as you rightly pointed out, that tax initially brings in $29.5 
billion. Therefore, once all the exceptions have been taken into 
account, the tax does not even bring in 50 per cent of what was 
originally expected. Indeed, we start with an amount of $30 
billion and, once all those exceptions have been taken into 
account, we are left with $14.9 billion. And we are told that the 
previous federal tax, which did not have all these exceptions, 
used to bring in $18 billion.
<P>
<B>(1220) </B>
<P>
	So, all these efforts were made to create a new tax which, in 
the end, brings in $3 or $4 billion less in revenue. What I am 
saying is that before implementing a new tax measure or a new 
federal tax to replace the GST, some in-depth analyses and 
studies must be done to try to eliminate administrative costs to 
businesses.
<P>
	This $14.9 billion which we are left with in the end does not 
even take into account the efforts made by businesses to collect 
the tax by using new accounting techniques and computer 
systems. We are told that the previous tax used to bring in $18 
billion. However, the economy must be considered as a whole: if 
the government is not paying, then it is businesses, and the latter 
paid several billion to implement this tax; it is hard to figure out 
exactly how much, but it could be somewhere between $5 and 
$10 billion. So, in the end, we are maybe talking about $7 or $8 
billion in revenue for the government. Indeed, there may be only 
$4 or $5 billion left in the end. So, all these efforts were made to 
replace a tax which used to bring in four or five times more in 
revenue. Consequently, we must really be careful and conduct 
more in-depth analyses before implementing a new tax.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dennis J. Mills (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister 
of Industry):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like to congratulate the 
member on his sensitivity to the cost benefit analysis of the 
GST. I also share his view that the GST has been a disaster, 
especially for the 1.9 million registrants, most of them small 
businesses. It costs them about $3,000 to $5,000 a year just to 
administer it, not counting the paper burden.
<P>
	I want to deal with research and development. I know it is a 
sensitive issue with members from Her Majesty's Loyal 
Opposition. I want to recognize first that there is a little bit of a 
disadvantage on the pure dollars of research and development 
that do not go into the province of Quebec. The member quoted 
50 per cent, but when analysing the research and development 
component the  Ottawa region cannot be ignored. We had this 
discussion before.
<P>
	The Ottawa region includes many research and development 
facilities in which many constituents from the province of 
Quebec participate. When one sees the amount of research and 
development that goes into the Ottawa region one will find that 
on a per capita basis we are a lot closer to a more reasonable 
share of the research and development dollars.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bélisle:</B> Mr. Speaker, I listened with interest to the 
comment made by the hon. member to the effect that the figures 
may be distorted by the fact that a lot of investments in research 
and development are done in Ottawa and that, on a per capita 
basis, as he said, the gap between Ontario and Quebec would 
probably be much less significant. I do hope the hon. member is 
right and I will take another look at the figures. I want to point 
out though that instead of referring to Ottawa, it might be more 
accurate to say the national capital region, which also includes 
an important part of Hull, on the Quebec side.
<P>
<B>(1225) </B>

[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> We are back to debate now. I 
understand there are two people who wish to speak, the hon. 
member for Edmonton Southwest and the hon. member for 
Trois-Riviéres. There are no members to speak from the 
government side. By our principle of rotation we would go to the 
government side and then to the Reform Party so I think it would 
be fair for the hon. member for Edmonton Southwest to speak 
next.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ian McClelland (Edmonton Southwest):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
thank the House very much for the opportunity to participate in 
this debate. Through you, Mr. Speaker, I address my comments 
to the hon. parliamentary secretary to the Minister of Industry.
<P>
	Earlier today, the hon. member was speaking about the need to 
raise capital for small business. We recognize that capital for 
small and large business is difficult to raise. I wonder if I could 
get his comments in two areas.
<P>
	The first is the effective guarantees on the ability of small 
business to raise capital, specifically the use of joint and several 
guarantees. This has the effect of making whoever is signing a 
guarantee on behalf of a company with the deepest pockets to be 
the first the guarantor goes to in the event of default, even 
though there is the opportunity obviously in a guarantee position 
to limit guarantees. If there is one party to the guarantee with 
significantly deeper pockets that party is sometimes reluctant to 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1288"> 1288 </A></B>
<P>
get involved in guaranteeing a small emerging business. That is 
one item I would ask the government to consider.
<P>
	The other is the notion of extending the use of RRSPs beyond 
the traditional to the new and very effective use in home 
ownership. That would be under very strict controls, but 
consider the notion of extending the use of RRSP money and an 
arm's length transaction to supporting and providing capital for 
small and emerging private business as opposed to public 
companies.
<P>
	There is quite a distinction between a company that needs to 
raise $1 million and one that needs to raise $10 million. If 
businesses were able to raise money under very strict conditions 
on an arm's length basis by using their RRSP or RRSP 
contributions that could be a very significant capital pool for the 
use in developing small business and emerging new 
technologies in Canada.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> This is a switch. Normally it is the 
parliamentary secretary asking the questions which I think he 
will want to do now.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dennis J. Mills (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister 
of Industry):</B> Mr. Speaker, we have often stated this is going to 
be a Parliament of reform. This is true reform today because we 
are changing the normal process.
<P>
	Dealing with the joint and several guarantees, I share the 
member's view that right now when most financial institutions 
have a guarantor on the hook which has, to use the member's 
words, deep pockets, it tends to be the victim if there is default. 
The bank tends to go after the guarantor.
<P>
	We have to deal with this issue. Within the next couple of 
months the industry committee in deciding its first order of 
business will have a session to listen to all the Canadian 
financial institutions. They can talk about what they are doing 
for small business and the various structures the banks employ 
which inhibit capital getting to small business or people taking 
risks. I suggest the hon. member bring forward his concern to 
the bank presidents appearing before that committee and maybe 
we can get some amendment.
<P>
	On the second point, the RRSP conversion into small business 
is an interesting idea.
<P>
<B>(1230) </B>
<P>
	I have to say the Reform Party is always reminding us about 
how sensitive we must be of the treasury in terms of cutting and 
costs to the treasury. The member should realize that would be a 
cost to the treasury. It would probably be an enormous cost but, 
in the interest of getting small business moving again and 
inspiring more diverse ownership in small business, I would 
certainly think it should be something the Minister of Finance 
should consider.
<P>
	<B>Mr. McClelland:</B> Mr. Speaker, this is really and truly a debate 
because we are asking questions and getting feedback. I thank 
the member for his observations.
<P>
	I really have difficulty understanding how that would be an 
additional cost to the treasury. We would have to be concerned 
about the RSP money being used at an arm's length basis to 
finance small and emerging small business. Provided that 
money was already invested in an RSP vehicle, it would be 
money already in the financial system. Instead of being involved 
in mutual funds or a large public company this money would be 
directed to a smaller company.
<P>
	There would be the risk element involved, but we are trying to 
get more and more people involved in the lifeblood of the capital 
pool of our country. It would not take any more money; it would 
use existing money and move it into small business instead of 
move it into large business through stock.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mills (Broadview-Greenwood):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have a 
short response. I am glad the member clarified that this would be 
no new extension of the RSP, that it would be moneys existing. I 
think his idea is a good one and I hope the Department of 
Finance and the minister will consider it.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> I say to the member for Edmonton 
Southwest who I see is rising that unfortunately his time has 
expired. I think the last speaker in this debate among recognized 
parties is the member for Trois-Rivières.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Yves Rocheleau (Trois-Rivières):</B> Mr. Speaker, as 
industry critic for my Party, I am very pleased to take part in the 
debate concerning Bill C-9, an Act to amend the Income Tax 
Act.
<P>
	These amendments to the Income Tax Act implement certain 
measures announced in the Economic and Fiscal Statement of 
December 2, 1992 and the Budget of April 26, 1993.
<P>
	Overall, 12 measures are mentioned, nine of which come from 
the economic and fiscal statement and the last three from the 
budget. The first nine measures are as follows:
<P>
	1. Unemployment insurance premium relief for additional 
jobs;
<P>
	2. Temporary small business investment tax credit;
<P>
	3. Extension of the small business financing program;
<P>
	4. Abolition of penalty tax;
<P>
	5. Labour-sponsored venture capital corporations;
<P>
	6. Extension of the home buyers' plan;
<P>
	7. Flow-through shares;
<P>
	8. Removal of mandatory deduction of Canadian exploration 
expenses;
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1289"> 1289 </A></B>
<P>
	9. Improvements to the tax credit for scientific research and 
experimental development.
<P>
	As for the measures from the budget announced on April 26, 
1993, they are: first, annual tax credit limit; second, investment 
tax credit for scientific research and experimental development; 
and third, instalment payments of income tax.
<P>
	As you may have noticed, these measures are particularly 
involved. Just by listing them, you can see how complex they 
are, not only for the legislator, but also for the small business 
community.
<P>
	That is why we think it is erroneous and pointless to undertake 
a detailed analysis of these measures in the House. These 
measures should be referred to a committee, and undergo a 
judicious and in-depth analysis before any necessary 
recommendations can be made.
<P>
<B>(1235) </B>
<P>
	It is also clear a thorough review is needed of small business 
financial assistance programs, to identify any overlap in the 
administration of these programs and to simplify their 
implementation.
<P>
	We must realize what small and medium-sized businesses 
have to put up with from a government bureaucracy that often 
interferes with the way they manage their affairs, that sets 
deadlines, asks for explanations, even intimidates business 
owners, wastes the time of employees and acts as if small 
business was at its beck and call.
<P>
	Studies on the subject agree that at least 20 per cent of the 
time and effort that go into small business management and 
administration is spent dealing with government paperwork.
<P>
	That is both unacceptable and contrary to the goals of being 
competitive and efficient, the magic words government officials 
are so fond of repeating.
<P>
	We must help small business expand and not crush them under 
bureaucratic paperwork. We must help small businesses whose 
names are not on everyone's lips, which do not have an export 
plan or technology projects and whose equipment does not 
necessarily have to be updated, but which produce goods in 
response to local and regional needs. They are often 
well-managed or may experience problems but, most 
importantly, provide local jobs for 5, 10, 20, 40 or 60 employees 
who without this plant would be unemployed, unlikely to find 
another job and, as a result, have to live on unemployment 
insurance and then welfare.
<P>
	I am thinking of door and window manufacturers, machine 
tool shops, manufacturers of food products, clothing 
manufacturers and sawmills, for instance.
<P>
	We must acknowledge the fact that this type of business exists 
and help them consolidate their position, because they create 
and maintain the jobs in our regions that make it possible for the 
government, with the tax revenue from these businesses and 
their employees, to provide incentives for other businesses to 
either export or  update their equipment or get technological 
development projects.
<P>
	I would also like to take this opportunity to remind the 
government, considering the geopolitical changes that have 
taken place in recent years, of the importance of encouraging the 
conversion of our defence industries to the production of 
civilian goods. The government must help bring about this 
conversion, otherwise our entire industrial framework may lose 
its competitive edge to neighbouring economies.
<P>
	The red book makes this clear, and I quote: ``The defence 
industries today employ directly and indirectly over 100,000 
Canadians. The end of the cold war puts at risk tens of thousands 
of high-tech jobs. A Liberal government will introduce a 
defence conversion program to help industries in transition from 
high-tech military production to high-tech civilian 
production''.
<P>
	That being said, questions arise about the federal 
government's framework for acting effectively in terms of 
incentives to streamline operations.
<P>
	In Quebec, the agency closest to the customer is the Federal 
Business Development Bank which, oddly enough, reports to 
the Minister of Finance, although one could legitimately assume 
that industrial conversion programs would originate from and be 
inspired by Industry Canada, which has no regional offices, 
being mainly based in Montreal. One can hardly expect 
programs that are designed and administered well away from the 
potential user to be effective.
<P>
	One also wonders what the FBDB, the Federal Business 
Development Bank, is doing in the Department of Finance.
<P>
	To get back to the content of the bill as such, one of the items 
in the bill refers to labour-sponsored venture capital 
corporations. I am reminded of one particularly remarkable 
example, the Fonds de solidarité des travailleurs, a venture 
capital corporation founded 10 years ago this year by the Quebec 
Federation of Labour. Today, the corporation has 193,000 
shareholders with net assets of $797 million and an investment 
portfolio worth $414 million, invested in Quebec businesses. 
Shareholders have seen their businesses revive or expand 
considerably, thanks to the fund's assistance.
<P>
<B>(1240) </B>
<P>
	In 1993 alone, the fund was responsible for nearly $175 
million in new investments benefitting 43 businesses. The very 
existence of the Fonds de solidarité and its success illustrate the 
potential for creativity and innovation of Quebec and the people 
of Quebec, which in turn explains our confidence and pride in 
the economic potential of a sovereign Quebec.
<P>

[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jesse Flis (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Foreign Affairs):</B> Mr. Speaker, I listened very carefully to the 
hon. member. What caught my ears was his comments about 
small business being harassed by government bureaucracy.
<P>
	He mentioned that 20 per cent of energy went to fill out 
government forms and what not. He also mentioned that small 
businesses provided jobs on a local level. I could not agree with 
him more. If we want to kickstart the economy, if we want to 
stimulate the economy, we have to help small and medium sized 
businesses stimulate the economy and create jobs. Then I think 
we will see the recession behind us.
<P>
	In canvassing my riding of Parkdale-High Park, which is in 
the city of Toronto, the complaints I get from small businesses 
are about the lack of co-operation they get from the banks. Yes, I 
get some complaints about bureaucracy or red tape, but if they 
want to modernize their plants and expand to export their 
products-and he mentioned such products as doors, windows, 
et cetera-they go to the bank and the bank refuses them capital 
loans. Under the Small Businesses Loans Act small businesses 
can borrow up to $250,000 and 90 per cent of the risk is 
guaranteed by the federal government. Even with that 
motivation, that stimulus, the banks are not co-operating.
<P>
	Just yesterday an angry constituent with a small business in 
real estate called me. He had a client who used to pay him by 
cheque every month, a $1,000 cheque he would deposit in the 
bank. The service charge for that was 75 cents. The other day he 
was paid in cash. He took the cash to the bank and the bank had 
the gall to charge him $2.20. The principle is that small 
businesses get angry because of this kind of attitude on the part 
of banks in Canada.
<P>
	Is it just businesses in Toronto, businesses in my riding, that 
have these problems with banks? Or, does he experience the 
same difficulties with the banks as do small businesses? If so, 
would he have any recommendations? How can we get after 
these banks to co-operate in stimulating the economy and not 
throwing roadblocks in the way of small businesses?
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Rocheleau:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for his 
question. Having been involved in economic regional 
development for 25 years in my region of 
Mauricie-Bois-Franc -by the way, I take this opportunity to 
pay my respects to the people of that region as well as my 
constituents-I totally agree with the hon. member when he says 
that-and this matter was raised by the hon. member for 
Broadview-Greenwood in the Standing Committee on 
Industry-there is a discrepancy between what the presidents of 
the major banks are saying and the attitude displayed by local 
bank managers. Every one is looking after their own interests,  
but no one is there for the small businessman who is really the 
one taking the risks.
<P>
	More and more, especially in difficult times, banks have only 
one thing in mind, to look after their own interests, to protect 
what they have. Often they do not hesitate to pull the plug on the 
other party, that is to say the business, the industrial 
entrepreneur and the employees.
<P>
<B>(1245) </B>
<P>
	I think it is a matter of mentality, of attitude. Someone who 
had been studying the operation of European banks once told me 
that their attitude and approach with respect to private 
investment are totally different in the sense that the operating 
philosophy of the bank is to take a chance with the small 
business owner.
<P>
	Perhaps pressure should be brought to bear to foster a change 
in attitudes, in that respect. While the Canadian banking system 
is said to be one of the most performing and comforting in the 
world, there may be fundamental choices to be made by banks.
<P>
	We may come to realize that our system has its faults, its 
weaknesses, seeing that unemployment-because that is the 
ultimate result-is growing steadily from one decade to the 
next. When I was young, the unemployment rate was 3 per cent 
and now, I think that Statistics Canada is saying that the best we 
can hope for is 8 per cent.
<P>
	It may be this kind of management and operating philosophy 
that causes banks to gradually discourage people who start up 
businesses with potential: when the going gets tough, the bank 
loses any loyalty to its client. That is a question that will be 
examined by the standing committee on industry.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Pierre de Savoye (Portneuf):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have 
examined Bill C-9. I know there are people who are watching us 
on television. This is Bill C-9.
<P>
	There are all kinds of interesting things in this bill and one 
may think that, with its proposals, the government wants to 
increase business competitiveness and enable people to improve 
their situation. For example, it talks about reducing the 
unemployment insurance premiums to promote the creation of 
extra jobs. It is very interesting to see how the government is 
concerned with businesses.
<P>
	However, how are businesses going to learn that these new 
provisions will take effect? The day after this bill is proclaimed, 
will their accountant rush to the phone and tell them: ``Here, in 
your case, you really have a wonderful opportunity''? I doubt it 
and what saddens me is to see such nice intentions-the 
extension of the small business financing program, venture 
capital corporations for workers, the extension of the home 
buyers's plan-that will not necessarily be communicated with 
the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1291"> 1291 </A></B>
<P>
appropriate timing and in a usable way to businesses and 
individuals who could otherwise benefit from them.
<P>
	I would like my colleague from the Bloc to share his thoughts 
with me on this.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Rocheleau:</B> Mr. Speaker, I have to agree with my 
colleague that transmission of information gives rise to another 
kind of problem.
<P>
	On the one hand, there is so much government intervention, 
and on the other hand, the system is so complicated that even the 
government does not have the tools to deliver the information.
<P>
	Small business has to pay to set up a system whereby the 
information first goes through its tax expert, its accountant, who 
will hopefully make sure the information goes around. Such 
systems seem to work in a vacuum.
<P>
	In a sense, government and small business are essentially 
parallel organizations. They are like two different worlds that 
can only meet from time to time, according to the goodwill, the 
ability, the dedication and maybe also the fees of the specialists 
hired by the companies.
<P>
	Speaking of harassment, it seems that business is at the 
service of the government. In our economic system, things 
should be different, since the government is supposed to be at 
the service of the business community. There are undoubtedly 
changes to be made and we might begin by decreasing 
government interference in business management. That would 
go a long way to resolve many problems.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> As no hon. member wishes to take the 
floor, is the House ready for the question?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.

	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney 
General of Canada)</B> moved that Bill C-8, an act to amend the 
Criminal Code and the Fisheries Protection Act (force), be read 
the second time and referred to a committee.
<P>
	He said: Mr. Speaker, with the introduction of Bill C-8 the 
government proposes an amendment to section 25 of the 
Criminal Code that will bring to culmination a process of reform 
that started as long ago as 1969 with recommendations of the 
Ouimet committee.
<P>
	The subject of this amendment is the use of force by peace 
officers in dealing with persons who take flight in order to avoid 
arrest. In short, the proposed amendment will first of all 
recognize the right of peace officers to resort to force in such 
circumstances, including such force as may occasion death or 
grievous bodily harm to the person to be arrested.
<P>
	Second, it will introduce an element of proportionality 
between the threat of harm posed by the fleeing person and the 
degree of force that is permitted by law.
<P>
	Third, it will extend the concept of permissible force such as 
is reasonable in the circumstances to persons who perform 
similar duties on behalf of the public, including prison guards 
and those peace officers who attempt to stop foreign fishing 
vessels that are alleged to be breaching Canadian law.
<P>
	In introducing second reading of this bill, I would like to deal 
with three matters which the House may find useful as it 
embarks upon its considerations.
<P>
	First, the manifest unsuitability of the present section of the 
Criminal Code that deals with matters of this kind. Second, the 
process of consultation in which the government and the 
previous government engaged in order to bring forth these 
proposals. Third, the particulars of the amendment that is 
proposed that commend the amendment to the government and, 
I hope, to all members of this House.
<P>
	Let me first deal with the present state of the Criminal Code so 
far as it deals with the use of force by peace officers to detain 
persons who are fleeing to escape arrest. The provision is now 
found in section 25(4) of the Criminal Code of Canada and is 
known broadly as the fleeing felon rule. Indeed, the antiquity of 
that name itself indicates the time that has elapsed since we have 
methodically thought through the appropriateness of the present 
regime.
<P>
	The concept of course is quite sound. The concept is as sound 
today as it was when the provision was first enacted. It is 
appropriate for the legislature to acknowledge and give 
authority to the need for peace officers to use such force as is 
reasonably necessary to protect themselves and members of the 
public when confronted with a person who is fleeing to avoid 
lawful arrest.
<P>
	The fact of the matter is that the present section of the code is 
overly broad. It discloses on its face a lack of the kind of 
proportionality that legislatures and courts have worked toward 
in more recent enactments. For example, on its face the existing 
section of the code would permit an officer to use deadly force to 
detain someone who was fleeing to avoid arrest for shoplifting.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1292"> 1292 </A></B>
<P>
	I hasten to add that police forces themselves, both in their 
training and in their procedures and practices, have shown both 
professionalism and restraint in the way they have used the 
discretion and authority conferred by the present section.
<P>
<B>(1255 ) </B>
<P>
	This is in terms of the training that officers receive at the 
police colleges, in the manuals of procedure that are made 
available to forces as they work, and in practices adopted by 
police officers individually and by forces across the country.
<P>
	One can see a recognition on the part of police officers 
themselves that the present section is not sufficiently subtle or 
flexible. It does not deal with the right proportionality to reflect 
a balancing of the competing interests that are presented in 
circumstances of this kind.
<P>
	Indeed, in the 1989 report of the Ontario Race Relations and 
Policing Task Force it was observed that the police themselves 
are uncomfortable with the broad discretion provided at present 
by section 25(4) and the police college instructors caution new 
police officers not to take the powers literally.
<P>
	There has been concern expressed about the present provision 
by minority groups across the country. Always keenly aware of 
their relationship with police forces, they have expressed worry 
that the section does not expressly contain the kind of criteria 
that should reasonably be found there for reference by peace 
officers before resorting to such force as might cause death or 
serious bodily harm in detaining those who flee for the purpose 
of escaping arrest.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	When the provision applicable to dangerous criminals fleeing 
for the purpose of escaping arrest, which is being amended by 
the present bill, was first introduced, it applied only to the most 
serious crimes, most of which where punishable by death. At 
that time, when dangerous suspects where found guilty, they 
were almost always executed. One can understand why 
dangerous criminals did not hesitate to use any means, even the 
most violent, to escape arrest.
<P>
	At the same time, if the suspect was not arrested then, there 
was little likelihood that he would be arrested later, since the 
tools at the disposal of the police forces where quite 
rudimentary, communication networks were primitive and 
investigation methods rather crude.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Over the years there have been complaints about the present 
section and calls for its reform from, among others, the Uniform 
Law Conference and the Law Reform Commission of Canada.
<P>
	In April of last year the section was declared unconstitutional 
by a judge of the general division of the Ontario court on the 
basis of the very same flaws that I have identified here today.
<P>
	Surely it is time for Parliament to catch up with the 
jurisprudence, with the police practices in place in this country, 
and to amend this section of the code so that it reflects current 
values and current approaches to policing matters.
<P>
	Let me deal briefly with the degree and nature of consultation 
that took place as the government worked toward the 
amendment that is now before the House. I hope members 
throughout the House will agree that consultation has been 
thorough, thoughtful and constructive.
<P>
	The most recent round began for present purposes in 
mid-June 1990 at the federal-provincial-territorial conference 
in Niagara-on-the-Lake at which there was general agreement 
that an initiative should finally be taken to change the code.
<P>
	The following June, June 1991, the Department of Justice 
released a consultation document identifying four alternatives. 
In September 1991 at their conference in Yellowknife, the 
federal-provincial-territorial representatives agreed in 
principle on the approach that should be taken. Following that, 
there were a number of federal-provincial-territorial 
discussions at various levels on the precise shape of the 
amendment.
<P>
<B>(1300) </B>
<P>
	On August 17, 1992 a further discussion paper with detailed 
proposals was released at the time of the meeting of the 
Canadian Association of Chiefs of Police. Throughout this 
process and in the months and years since it started, the 
Department of Justice has had the benefit of views expressed by 
members of Parliament, by senators, by provincial and 
territorial attorneys general and solicitors general, by chief 
justices, by ethnocultural groups, by representatives of the 
ethnic press, by provincial police associations, the police press, 
the Canadian Association of Chiefs of Police and the Canadian 
Police Association, bar associations, law deans, law societies, 
aboriginal police forces, non-governmental organizations and 
other interested individuals.
<P>
	Thanks are due to all of those who took part in this important 
discussion. The suggestions and the observations they have 
made from time to time are reflected in various aspects of the 
legislation.
<P>
	What will this bill achieve? May I observe, as I introduce 
debate at second reading, that this bill will maintain and 
reaffirm the ability of peace officers to protect themselves and 
the public from serious harm or death; will clarify when peace 
officers can use deadly force to stop suspects who are fleeing 
arrest, or inmates attempting to escape from penitentiaries; will 
justify a police response to the threat posed by a fleeing suspect 
that is in proportion to the seriousness of that threat; and, will 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1293"> 1293 </A></B>
<P>
modernize the law by updating an archaic  provision of the code 
that is inadequate and no longer fits the reality of present day 
Canada.
<P>
	The bill provides that force that is intended or is likely to 
cause death or grievous bodily harm to arrest a fleeing suspect 
may only be used when reasonably necessary for the protection 
of any person from imminent or future death or grievous bodily 
harm, and only if the flight cannot be prevented by reasonable 
means in a less violent manner.
<P>
	This bill calls for a proportionate response and respects the 
principle of restraint.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	I want to make sure that police officers can continue to protect 
themselves and the public from serious injury or even death.
<P>
	Bill C-8 specifically authorizes the use of whatever force is 
necessary to protect the public or police officers.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The proposal for a new subsection 25(4) focuses the decision 
on whether to use deadly force against a fleeing suspect against 
the risk of physical harm posed by the fleeing suspect if not 
immediately apprehended. The subsection provides that the 
physical threat posed by the fleeing suspect may be imminent or 
future. As a result, the subsection would allow for the use of 
deadly force against a fleeing suspect in situations where the 
danger to the public would be increased and not reduced by 
allowing the fleeing suspect to avoid arrest.
<P>
	By adopting that standard, Parliament would be saying that 
only in those circumstances is the use of deadly force justified. 
At the present time there is in the current provision no 
requirement that the fleeing suspect be dangerous before deadly 
force can be used.
<P>
	Admittedly, the assessment of future danger is a difficult one 
to make. But retaining the word as it appears in the amendment 
would make it clear that the provision would apply, for example, 
with respect to a dangerous mass murderer, or a person with a 
record of violent offences fleeing from arrest who constitutes a 
danger to society, even though the anticipated harm may not be 
immediate.
<P>
	The assessment that the fleeing suspect poses a threat of death 
or grievous bodily harm is to be based, according to the 
amendment, on the circumstances as the user of the force on 
reasonable grounds believes them to be. In this way the test 
merges the police officer's subjective belief about the 
seriousness of the danger posed by the fleeing suspect with the 
objective test of reasonableness of such belief. This approach is 
consistent with the test currently used in subsection 25(3) of the 
Criminal Code.
<P>
<B>(1305) </B>
<P>
	The bill also proposes, in new subsection 25(5) of the 
Criminal Code, that deadly force be allowed in order to prevent 
the escape of an inmate from an institution in which it is known 
that there are inmates who would be dangerous if they escaped. 
This proposed amendment once again reflects the current policy 
and practice relating to the use of force in penitentiaries. 
Whereas the use of force against escaping inmates is justified by 
the present subsection 25(4), peace officers in penitentiaries 
would not be able to perform their job properly and public safety 
could be jeopardized by the proposed use of subsection 25(4), 
because paragraph 25(4)(d), if applied to the prison officers 
would be found inappropriate to the special situation that they 
face in penitentiaries.
<P>
	In penitentiaries it is practically impossible for peace officers 
observing an escape to assess whether the particular inmate 
attempting to escape is likely to be dangerous if the escape is 
successful. What is more, the peace officer in such 
circumstances would be unlikely to know the factors that 
determine the risk the inmate presents at that particular moment. 
Deadly force would only be permitted as a last resort after other 
reasonable, less violent means, if possible in the circumstances, 
have been tried.
<P>
	In comparing escape from a penitentiary to the flight of a 
suspect, the inmate is already in the custody of the law, has been 
convicted and sentenced for having committed an offence. The 
social and psychological significance of an escape is very 
different from a fleeing suspect trying to escape arrest, in that 
the person who flees on the spur of the moment while escaping 
from a penitentiary is very rare. Ordinarily such escapes involve 
planning and premeditation. It is necessary also to bear in mind 
that it is necessary to maintain discipline and respect for lawful 
authority in penitentiaries. This amendment would assist in 
achieving that objective.
<P>
	Last, the bill includes an amendment to the Coastal Fisheries 
Protection Act to provide the authority in accordance with 
regulations to be made under the act for a protection officer to 
use disabling force against a fleeing foreign fishing vessel in 
order to arrest the master or other person in command of the 
vessel.
<P>
	The amendment to the Coastal Fisheries Protection Act is 
being proposed to ensure that the Department of Fisheries and 
Oceans retains the same powers it has at present to use disabling 
force when necessary. No new powers are being added.
<P>
	Fishery officers employed by the Department of Fisheries and 
Oceans to enforce regulations concerning the fisheries are peace 
officers under the Criminal Code. They have duties and training 
that are similar to those of other peace officers. These people 
may, on occasion, have to use force to disable a foreign fishing 
vessel that has violated our laws and tries to escape.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1294"> 1294 </A></B>
<P>
	If disabling force could not be used it would not be possible to 
arrest such vessels if they tried to escape and they could violate 
our laws with impunity. The use of this disabling force is being 
authorized only against foreign fishing vessels, not against 
Canadian ones. Domestic fishing vessels and their masters 
routinely remain in Canadian waters or return to Canadian ports 
where they can be apprehended so the disabling force in those 
cases is not required.
<P>
	The amendment includes a regulation making power to 
further control the use of disabling force. The regulations will 
establish the procedures in accordance with which and the 
extent to which disabling force is to be used. The government 
intends to develop these regulations so they will be consistent 
with the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. The 
regulations will also be consistent with a recognized and 
reasonable international practice in the use of disabling force at 
sea. There will be a number of steps that would have to be 
followed and satisfied before the use of disabling force would be 
permitted.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	I think this bill achieves a good balance between, on the one 
hand, the capacity of peace officers to ensure public safety and, 
on the other hand, the protection of Canadians' rights.
<P>
<B>(1310 ) </B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	I believe that the bill marks a significant step forward from 
the archaic fleeing felon rule. It allows us to put in place new 
legal protection balancing the rights of peace officers, who must 
do their jobs in increasingly difficult circumstances, and the 
rights of citizens for protection against deadly force when it is 
not reasonably necessary.
<P>
	It is my hope that the hon. members of the House will provide 
this bill with their support.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Since the standing orders do not allow 
questions or comments under such circumstances, I give the 
floor to the hon. member for Gaspé.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Yvan Bernier (Gaspé):</B> First, Mr. Speaker, I have a short 
question. I see that time is running out. I believe we are allowed 
a 40-minute period for the first speech and I was told that one of 
my colleagues would then make a 20-minute speech and two 
other colleagues would speak for 10 minutes each during the 
day. I believe you were informed of that. As for my 40 minutes, I 
think that I will have finished before the oral question period.
<P>
	The Bloc quebecois will approve Bill C-8, in general. But we 
have serious reservations about it and we will ask for some 
amendments. After expressing these reservations, I will tell you 
about our intention to move these amendments, which we hope 
will clarify the bill and limit potential abuse.
<P>
	I will stick with the fisheries issue. My colleague will explain 
to you later the more detailed position of the Bloc concerning 
the first part of the bill dealing with wardens in penitentiaries, I 
think, in any case the one that amends the Criminal Code. He 
will do it, I believe, more eloquently than I, at least I hope.
<P>
	As I said, as the fisheries critic and also as the representative 
from the Gaspé riding, a traditionally maritime riding, I will 
dwell on the fisheries aspect of Bill C-8, because in fact the 
second part of the bill amends the Coastal Fisheries Protection 
Act.
<P>
	After briefly explaining to you the substance of the 
amendment, I will also explain the risks involved.
<P>
	In short, before its amendment, this provision, in our opinion, 
seemed as brief as imprecise. We understand what the 
government has done about this. So far, this legislation reads as 
follows: ``A protection officer may arrest without warrant any 
person who the officer suspects on reasonable grounds has 
committed an offence under this act''.
<P>
	With its amendment, the government gives a structure to the 
power given to a protection officer. Once this government 
amendment is adopted, the new provision will read as follows: 
``A protection officer is justified in using, in accordance and to 
the extent permitted by the regulations, force that is intended or 
is likely to disable a foreign fishing vessel in these 
circumstances-'' I wil not read all the conditions, but that is the 
basic point of the new legislation.
<P>
	So what does this amendment intend?
<P>
	It gives to a protection officer the right to inspect a foreign 
vessel. Therefore, the right of a protection officer to act is now 
included and protected by the law. We have to keep in mind that 
any protection officer already had this right and this bill simply 
confirms a current practice which brings us to ask a technical 
question first: Do the protection officers have the training 
required of people who hold such an important power? It is up to 
the minister to answer this first question.
<P>
	In the end, what are our reservations about this bill?
<P>
<B>(1315) </B>
<P>
	First, let me point out that illegal fishing is only one aspect of 
the Canadian fisheries issue. Stock depletion is a complex issue 
which cannot be confined to illegal fishing.
<P>
	Thus, the fisheries problem is much more than just a question 
of stock depletion as mentioned by the Minister of Fisheries and 
Oceans. We believe that the entire structure of the industry must 
be revisited. Instead of addressing these structural changes 
necessary to respond to the cyclical changes in stocks, the 
government-as it did in the speech from the throne-is still 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1295"> 1295 </A></B>
<P>
looking for those responsible for stock depletion when it is the 
government that is responsible for stock management.
<P>
	Surely, the government cannot allow illegal fishing. But it 
must also take other action. It must concentrate first on 
restructuring the fishing industry, on developing new trading 
practices. It must emphasize all sorts of alternatives in order to 
put more than 50,000 people back to work in this country. Illegal 
fishing must be stopped, but the problem goes beyond that. In 
our view, this bill looks like another element of a broader 
smokescreen. We hope that our fears are unfounded.
<P>
	Now, here are some tangible reservations we have about Bill 
C-8. The Criminal Code allows a peace officer to use force in 
order to arrest a person who wants to flee. We agree with this 
principle in the context of the Criminal Code. However, we 
consider this is a poor approach when it comes to fisheries. The 
situation in the fisheries industry is so precarious right now that 
the amendment could result in violent incidents. Let me explain.
<P>
	In the past, using deterrent firing has not permitted to inspect 
foreign ships at fault. Therefore, once the bill is adopted, the 
protection officers may think they can use a degree of force 
greater than the one they are using now to achieve what they set 
out to do. As I said, the situation is precarious and using a 
greater degree of force to disable a foreign fishing vessel may 
encourage illegal fishermen to respond to the measures taken by 
Canada by arming to defend themselves. So, without being 
alarmist, we believe that the risk is real and should be 
considered by the minister.
<P>
	Second, one of the objectives of Canada is to show the 
international community its determination to stop illegal 
practices.
<P>
	This is a commendable objective. However, it entails the 
inherent risk to view force as the ultimate solution to the 
problem. We refuse to view force as an end in itself. Using force 
does not allow us to get to the root of the problem of illegal 
fishing. It is only a short-term solution. The real solution will 
come from concerted international action.
<P>
	In fact, and here I come to our third concern, Canada will not 
be able to stop illegal fishing practices without the help of other 
countries. Negotiation efforts with the international community 
must be pursued. Even though we keep a close watch over the 
200 mile area, if, for instance, fishing activities outside that area 
are allowed to go on and harm our fish stocks, the amendment to 
the Coastal Fisheries Protection Act will not solve the problem 
in any way. Canada cannot legislate in an international area. 
Therefore, negotiation is the only possible solution. We must 
not forget that when examining this amendment.
<P>
	Other countries' input is all the more important since it is our 
firm belief that using force is only a temporary solution, one that 
we want to eliminate as soon as possible. Force is a short-term 
measure. We reject it on the whole but for purely dissuasive 
purposes, we tolerate  reasonable use of force, that is force 
aimed at disabling a fishing vessel without putting any human 
life at risk.
<P>
<B>(1320) </B>
<P>
	Contrary to what the Criminal Code says, we do not tolerate 
using force likely to cause death in the case of fishing vessels. In 
our view, illegal fishermen are not criminals; often crewmen are 
not even aware of what is going on. We must understand that but 
since we must act rapidly, we are ready to accept it.
<P>
	We take it that the bill applies exclusively to foreign ships 
because, in the case of Canadian vessels, there are alternatives 
to force which we cannot use in the case of foreign ones. In the 
case of Canadians, we could, for example, arrest identified 
offenders dockside or at home.
<P>
	Therefore, through international treaties, the government 
should strive to have the countries involved implement arrest 
procedures similar to those we have on our territory. It would be 
the only efficient way to avoid using force and at the same time 
succeed in punishing those guilty of violating the law. We could 
avoid using force even in the case of offenses; through bilateral 
or multilateral agreements, we could have a ship captain 
arrested by the police of his own country. In such cases, if the 
fines were high enough, we could discourage smugglers without 
using any force.
<P>
	While I am on the subject of international treaties, let me take 
this opportunity to talk about those that already exist, for 
example those with the United States and Quebec. I would like 
to give the House the following example, should Quebec ever 
become a foreign nation. Eighty per cent of resources found in 
the Gulf of St. Lawrence are already shared among the bordering 
provinces under an individual quota system.
<P>
	This system is backed by a dockside monitoring program. The 
Department of Fisheries and Oceans is able to know, on a daily 
basis, what is being unloaded, where it is being unloaded, 
precisely at which dock, and by whom. Therefore, should 
Quebec choose sovereignty, contrary to what some of my 
colleagues claimed last time I rose in this House, we would not 
be locked into endless constitutional arguments; on the contrary, 
the work has already been done.
<P>
	Resource sharing agreements are already in place. In the 
worst case scenario, the colour of the paper might change but the 
basis is already there. So, whether Quebec is a neighbour or a 
foreign state, using force, under international agreements, 
might not be necessary, or so I hope.
<P>
	There are alternatives to using force. I would like to give other 
examples. Apparently, as we approach the year 2000, a satellite 
orbiting around the earth can read a newspaper over my 
shoulder. How can it be then that we are unable to keep up with 
new technology and track any vessel in our waters? We could 
increase security at sea and better protect our sovereignty on the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1296"> 1296 </A></B>
<P>
ocean. I do not claim to know everything there is to know in the 
field of electronics, but I do know that things can be done.
<P>
	These alternatives to violence may prove important if we 
consider that the proposed amendment to the Criminal Code 
could be applied to worse crimes than poaching. It may be 
justified to use lethal force against a dangerous criminal but it 
would be unacceptable to do so with poachers, who pose a 
totally different problem.
<P>
	We can arrest a captain because he caught too many fish, 
because he was fishing in the wrong place, because he caught the 
wrong species or because he did not have a licence. These are all 
serious fishing regulation offenses but none is so serious as to 
justify endangering the lives of the captain and crew while 
trying to stop their ship. This aspect of the problem is covered by 
an amendment we will bring forth later.
<P>
<B>(1325) </B>
<P>
	I want to get back to another point that I touched on briefly a 
while ago. I will phrase my comment in the form of a question. 
Is it really lawful to pass legislation that applies only to 
foreigners?
<P>
	Clause 8.1 applies only to foreign fishing vessels. The bill 
does not authorize the use of necessary force to disable a 
Canadian vessel. We realize that other measures are in place to 
track down offenders in Canadian territorial waters. 
Consequently, there is no need to resort to the use of force in 
their case. We ask the Canadian government to apply the same 
policy to foreigners so that altercations can be avoided.
<P>
	We understand that until such measures are put in place, the 
Canadian government must resort to the use of force. However, 
we will not stand for a policy based on a double standard. 
Therefore, it is imperative that we implement, along with the 
international community, effective measures to stop vessels 
from fishing illegally and to change a system where two kinds of 
law apply, one for Canadians, and one for foreigners.
<P>
	In addition, it seems clear that the government is again, 
through this legislative provision, focussing attention on 
foreign fishing. At least that is how I see it. It seems to still be 
looking for a scapegoat when instead, it should re-examining 
the whole issue of the Canadian fishery.
<P>
	The fourth point about which the Bloc Quebecois has 
concerns is the matter of the possible additional overlap 
between government departments. National defence vessels are 
already equipped to disable foreign fishing vessels. The 
inclusion of clause 8.1 could prompt the Department of 
Fisheries and Oceans to further equip its vessels so that they 
have enough strike power to intimidate foreign vessels. Should 
these investments be considered a priority given the crisis in the 
fisheries?
<P>
	Furthermore, one can question the relevance of giving 
fisheries protection officers the mandate to disable a foreign 
fishing vessel. There is indeed overlap between the different 
department when it comes to maintaining maritime sovereignty. 
The report of the Malone Committee on maritime sovereignty 
states in no uncertain terms that savings could be realized if 
there were more co-operation and co-ordination between the 
departments of Transport, Fisheries and Oceans, National 
Defence and the RCMP. Today's amendment does nothing to 
restrict overlap and could quite likely increase its incidence.
<P>
	To respond to some of its concerns, the Bloc Quebecois will 
move an amendment to the government's bill. We will add a line 
to the end of section 8.1 as follows: the use of force cannot be 
tolerated if the lives of the crew of the escaping boat are 
endangered. I do not claim to be a lawyer, but I submit that this is 
a very sensible resolution and I say it most sincerely.
<P>
	The purpose of this amendment is clear: to set limits for the 
use of force. Since subsection 25(3) of the Criminal Code does 
not apply to the Coastal Fisheries Protection Act, use of force as 
mentioned in section 8.1 of that Act is not limited by law. The 
Bloc's amendment is intended to limit the use of force in order 
to avoid possibly nasty incidents. Foreign fishermen are human. 
They do not deserve to die just because they wanted to make 
ends meet. In many cases, the people on the ships will not even 
understand the language used to arrest them and thus 
unreasonable use of force could lead to serious incidents.
<P>
<B>(1330) </B>
<P>
	I have another question about this bill: the government does 
not define what ``disable'' means when it says ``force that is 
intended or is likely to disable a foreign fishing vessel''. Since I 
am not a lawyer, I looked in the dictionary and saw that a 
``disabled'' ship is unable to move because it has been damaged. 
Damaging a ship on the high seas-I do not know if some of you 
have ever fished, but any kind of weather may be going on out 
there at that time. Various kinds of vessels, made of various 
materials, exist: iron, wood and fibreglass. A .303 bullet hole 
could perhaps sink a ship, but if it did, it would be because it was 
fired through the hull as a warning, apparently. But if a shot were 
fired through a fibreglass fishing boat, I would not want to be a 
fisherman asleep between decks.
<P>
	So I think that the use of force requires prudence and good 
judgment. And we know that life at sea can be tough. So 
remember that this right to use force must be exercised 
carefully.
<P>
	This amendment is even more important in that the 
application of the law is subject to regulations issued by the 
Governor in 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1297"> 1297 </A></B>
<P>
Council. It is really the regulations which will determine the 
scope of the law. If the regulations are too lax, the law as worded 
is dangerously open to abuse.
<P>
	The bill in itself is not bad, but what seem less attractive are 
the motivations for it.
<P>
	The government is giving fishermen a target, namely 
foreigners. When the cod stocks started to decline, some said 
that the increase in the seal population was mainly responsible. 
After all the twists and turns we have been through, scientists 
now tell us that seals are only one predator among many. Since 
the scapegoat is no longer there, another one must be found! 
What better than foreigners? Let us gladly hide the real 
problems behind the wicked foreigners. In the meantime, we do 
not talk about what will happen to the fishing industry after May 
16. In the meantime, fishermen forget that the federal 
government was responsible for managing the stocks and that it 
is mostly to blame.
<P>
	According to NAFO, barely 5 per cent of the cod stocks are in 
the nose and tail of the Grand Banks where the illegal fishing is 
now going on and about which this government is making so 
much fuss. We wonder why the minister is making such an issue 
of it. Does the government realize that it is politicking instead of 
solving the real underlying problem?
<P>
	The Department of Fisheries and Oceans itself recognizes that 
it is practically impossible to estimate the cost of illegal fishing. 
What I am saying is that we should be discussing the fisheries of 
the future instead. The seals have always been there and the 
stocks did not collapse. Foreigners have always fished some of 
our stocks and our stocks did not collapse as they have now. Our 
whole industry must be rethought and quickly, because many 
people are idle and frustrated. These are capable people. 
Seafaring people are resourceful, but the government does not 
listen to them.
<P>
	However, the traditional management imposed by the federal 
government disdains local initiatives for solving the problems 
of the fishing industry. Indeed, this is not the first big crisis of 
the fishing industry. I repeat what I already said, and I think it is 
important to repeat it. In the early 1970s, cod stocks were in 
almost the same state as they are today, but the resourceful 
fishermen then turned to crab fishing. A little later, in the late 
1970s, with the collapse of haddock fishing in the Gulf, some 
fishermen turned to shrimp.
<P>
<B>(1335) </B>
<P>
	I gather from this that these maritime communities can adjust 
when allowed to interact. They can signal the presence of other, 
less popular species that can then be marketed. But this requires 
rapid channels of communication between decision-makers and 
the people on the front line, namely the fishermen. Quebec lost 
the opportunity for feedback in 1982, when the then Liberal 
government repatriated the fisheries jurisdiction. It is about 
time, in my opinion, that the federal government opened its 
eyes.
<P>
	I have another, more recent example. In 1986, this feedback 
mechanism would have allowed inshore fishermen, who were 
the first to notice the decline of cod stocks, to adjust. While cod 
stocks were in decline, other species wrongly seen as unfit 
should have been made more attractive.
<P>
	I want to reiterate that my motto on fisheries throughout this 
session will be this: A valid industrial policy on fisheries can 
only be consistent if the provinces share in the management of 
resources. The vulnerability of Quebec and the other provinces 
with respect to fisheries is due to the fact that the most decisive 
powers in this area are held by the federal government.
<P>
	The Minister of Fisheries and Oceans should talk about a new 
partnership between the various stakeholders in this sector. He 
should talk about the steps he intends to take to put fishermen in 
Canada and Quebec back to work. What tools will he give 
maritime communities to help them pull through?
<P>
	Where I come from, we have a saying: ``If you give a man a 
fish, you will feed him for one day, but if you teach him how to 
fish, you will feed him for life''. I think it is also a Chinese 
proverb. We are very cultured in the Gaspe, are we not?
<P>
	What tool should we use to enable former fishermen to find a 
new path? Similarly, what tool will we use to diversify this 
industry so that it can live through the next stock variation 
cycles? As I was saying during the election campaign, ``A local 
problem calls for a local solution''. The real solutions will not 
come, I am sorry to say, from Ottawa.
<P>
	Today, because of the federal government's management 
mistakes, these communities are seeing their world turned 
upside down. Their lives will never be the same. They must find 
a new way of life. This revolution requires the various 
governments to provide maritime communities with new 
development tools.
<P>
	The fishing world is undergoing massive changes and it would 
be an insult to all fishermen to unduly target illegal fishing or 
smugglers. We hope that this bill is not part of a plan to obscure 
reality and cloud the real debate on the fisheries' future. We 
support this bill, as I said earlier, but we hope it will be 
amended. Most of all, we are in favour of the government 
assuming its responsibilities and facing the crisis in a sector that 
is vital to many Quebecers and Canadians. That, Mr. Speaker, is 
something I have yet to see.
<P>
	In closing, I would like to reiterate-because I have been 
talking a lot-the few questions I want to ask the government. I 
would like the government to answer these questions; I do not 
know how, but it should be able to respond before tabling the 
final draft of its bill.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1298"> 1298 </A></B>
<P>
	My first question is this: are protection officers adequately 
trained to exercise such important powers? I know a few of them 
from my hometown but I know that Canadian regulations have 
different applications, regarding the bearing of weapons, for 
example. I know that two of the five Maritime provinces have 
asked for permission to refuse the bearing of weapons.
<P>
<B>(1340) </B>
<P>
	What will be the attitude of protection officers with regard to 
a use permitted by the regulations, although I do not know what 
regulations will be made under this legislation? That is a 
question I would really like answered.
<P>
	Did the minister also think of the possibility that government 
initiatives could make things worse? The point I am making is 
that the fisheries are already in crisis. I would not want fuel to be 
added to the flame. Will the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans 
also step up his efforts in negotiating with the international 
community? And will the government reduce the current 
overlap between various federal departments, as I said earlier? 
The Malone report referred to a four-way approach.
<P>
	Finally, will the regulations made under this legislation be 
tabled in the House of Commons to allow us to assess whether 
they are too lax and are leaving the door open to abuse or not?
<P>
	In closing, I would urge the government to consider carefully 
the amendments the opposition will be proposing. This bill has 
numerous implications and deserves careful consideration.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Since there are no questions or 
comments on the speech made by the member from the Bloc 
Quebecois I would go directly then to the Reform Party member 
for New Westminster-Burnaby who has the same time as the 
first speaker for the two other parties as of today when the rules 
come into force.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul E. Forseth (New Westminster-Burnaby):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I rise today in response to Bill C-8 which is laid before 
this House.
<P>
	The bill strikes at the heart of what it is all about for 
communities to delegate authority on their behalf, to have police 
officers, to give them lethal weapons and to give them the power 
not available to ordinary citizens. This bill clearly strikes at the 
heart of the authority of a policeman. The bill clearly 
circumscribes and brackets to a greater degree the existing law 
which is the discretionary authority where force, such as 
bringing possible harm or death, may result to a perpetrator of a 
crime.
<P>
	First, I note that this bill appears to be a top down fix or a 
response to a charter argument made in the Lines case. It is said 
that the current provisions of the Criminal Code are too broad. 
Second, there appears to be some desire for this measure from 
certain community groups that in particular circumstances too 
much force was used  and the Criminal Code guide and 
parameters were far too broad.
<P>
	However, I do not detect a community outcry that the police 
are shooting people and that forces are really abusing their 
community trust. If anything the community feels that the police 
are hamstrung and that their hands are tied and do not generally 
have enough authority to carry out their duties. Where is the 
current community bottom up drive for this change?
<P>
	It is said, however, that subsection 25(4) of the Criminal Code 
is a problem. That subsection empowers a peace officer who is 
proceeding with lawful arrest of a suspect who may be arrested 
without a warrant to use as much force as is necessary to prevent 
escape unless there are other reasonable and less violent means. 
This is what is known as the fleeing felon rule. It is evident from 
plain reading of the section that the only judgment requirement 
of the peace officer concerned the availability of other means.
<P>
	It is said that subsection 25(4) of the code breaches the 
suspect's rights and the rights of innocent bystanders under 
section 7 of the charter which is life, liberty and security of the 
person or section 9 which is protection from arbitrary detention 
or section 12 which is protection against cruel and unusual 
treatment.
<P>
	The fleeing felon rule was developed at a time when most 
felonies were punishable by death. If a felon could be executed 
on conviction then it was apparently felt that the death of a 
fleeing felon was not terribly disproportionate. To those who 
protested that this amounted to a so called execution before trial, 
the answer could be well made that the fleeing suspect could not 
have been terribly interested in his trial or he would not have 
fled in the first place.
<P>
	In any event this rationale for the rule no longer exists in 
civilized societies where no crimes are punishable by death in 
Canada.
<P>
	It is said that the bulk of academic and law enforcement 
opinion is that the deadly force justification found in subsection 
25(4) is quite simply too broad.
<P>
<B>(1345 ) </B>
<P>
	Police officers of the RCMP, Ontario Provincial Police and 
metropolitan police forces all receive instructions and 
guidelines that limit their use of deadly force more narrowly 
now than is allowed in the Criminal Code.
<P>
	The common thread of these limitations is the requirement of 
some element of actual or reasonably perceived danger to the 
officer or to others of death or bodily harm. The public interest 
in the use of force, even deadly force, is equally obvious. It is to 
facilitate law enforcement and prevent the escape of criminals.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1299"> 1299 </A></B>
<P>
	It is thought by some that if criminals come to know that they 
may flee from arrest with impunity then they will do so and 
chaos will result.
<P>
	There is some easy agreement in the extreme cases. I will take 
the extreme case to illustrate the point. That is not always so 
when the lines of delineation are not all that clear.
<P>
	The case is raised for example about the hypothetical 
doughnut thief. If the peace officers found a thief in the act he 
would perhaps would be entitled to arrest without a warrant. If 
no other means were available he would be entitled to use lethal 
force to prevent the escape. No sane person would ever suggest 
that it should or could be used in that circumstance. I do not 
think we have a history in Canada of that kind of abuse.
<P>
	Other provisions also limit this peace officer who might 
coming upon an armed bank robber spraying bullets in every 
direction. Few would suggest that he should not use lethal force 
to prevent escape and the possibility of further harm to the 
public.
<P>
	What about the policeman who finds someone in the act of 
smuggling large quantities of cocaine or heroine into the 
country? The suspect is unarmed and takes flight. The crime is 
extremely serious. It involves bodily harm and often death 
among users. It fosters often violent crime by addicts to gain the 
wherewithal to feed their habit. It frequently fosters violent 
crime among its distributors but at the moment of flight the 
suspect offers no immediate danger to the officer or anyone else. 
Should the officer fire?
<P>
	What about the future harm of a hypothetical Clifford Olsen? 
It is said that provisions such as those that exist in the Criminal 
Code now authorize the use of lethal force whenever no less 
violent means of capture are available and that that violates the 
charter concerning the right to life and security of the person. 
The prospect of deprivation thereof for some offences is not in 
accordance with the principles of fundamental justice.
<P>
	Can section 25 be justified under section 1 of the charter as a 
reasonable limit on the right of liberty and security of the 
person? Clearly the detention of fleeing suspects is a pressing 
and substantial concern. The use of force to prevent flight is 
clearly designed to achieve that objective and is rationally 
connected to it.
<P>
	The use of deadly force does not impair the right as little as 
possible. The potential use of deadly force in a broad range of 
situations as may be envisioned is said to be over broad and 
entirely lacks proportionality.
<P>
	The example is given of the spectre of the doughnut thief. It is 
simply that. It is only a spectre. There is no evidence that 
doughnut thieves are being gunned down in unprecedented 
numbers in Canada.
<P>
	The evidence is that police officers are instructed to fire their 
revolvers only in circumstances much more stringent than those 
in section 25(4). In short the  argument is made that peace 
officers can be relied upon not to abuse the force authorized by 
the code.
<P>
	It is the potential for harm and not the reality that matters. 
Does the seriousness of the crime matter or is the sole question 
about the danger present? What is the danger? Is it grievous 
bodily harm or some serious physical injury? What is the risk 
level? Is it that it might, may or likely possesses substantial risk 
of injury? Who is protected aside of course from the arresting 
officer? Is it those who are immediately present both spatially 
and temporally or those more remotely at risk? The fleeing 
rapist might have slaked his lust but for how long?
<P>
	These issues today are being dealt with by those who are 
responsible to the electorate. This is a political debate.
<P>
	For example, in the Lines case the Criminal Code was 
declared indeed to be an unconstitutional violation of the 
suspect's charter right to life and security of the person.
<P>
	Let us review. More clearly, subsection (4) currently permits 
a peace officer and anyone lawfully assisting such a person to 
use as much force as is necessary to prevent flight from lawful 
arrest if the additional circumstances set out within the 
subsection are met. It must be shown that there is a lawful basis 
for the arrest either with or without a warrant.
<P>
	Second, the person to be arrested must flee to avoid that 
arrest.
<P>
	Third, it must be shown that there was a no less violent means 
of stopping such flight than was reasonable.
<P>
	If an officer crosses into another jurisdiction in the course of 
such a chase, the officer retains the status of the peace officer for 
the purposes of that section.
<P>
	In deciding in a particular case whether a police officer had 
used more force than is authorized by subsection 4, general 
statements as to the duty to take care to avoid injury to others 
made in civil negligence cases cannot be accepted as applicable 
without reservation. The performance of the duty imposed upon 
police officers to arrest may at times and of necessity involve 
risk or injury to other members of the community. Such risk in 
the absence of a negligent or unreasonable exercise of a duty is 
imposed by the statute.
<P>
<B>(1350) </B>
<P>
	The right of a peace officer to use force to prevent escape is a 
limited one and the right may be exercised only if the escape 
could not be prevented by reasonable means in a less violent 
manner. A peace officer cannot in any circumstances justify the 
use of excess force and where the right to use force exists, it 
must be exercised in a reasonable manner. If it is to be exercised 
in a negligent manner, a peace officer is liable for all loss or 
damage caused by his negligence. That is the current situation.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1300"> 1300 </A></B>
<P>
	In summary, it could be viewed that the proposed changes are 
administrative only and only bring into line what is now 
accepted practice which is housekeeping. That remains to be 
seen.
<P>
	We need only to get this bill into committee, call witnesses 
and have a more thorough reflective examination. It may be that 
the court and the justice community elite have already decided 
what has to be done. What remains is the community 
conversation that we can have about this bill. This is the most 
fundamental power the community has. It delegates to its police 
force for peace, order and good government.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Derek Lee (Scarborough-Rouge River):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
I am very pleased to address this piece of legislation presented 
by the justice minister.
<P>
	So often in this House when we debate legislation we are 
dealing with it usually on an intellectual level somewhat 
divorced from the real life circumstances in which we intend the 
legislation to apply.
<P>
	In this particular case however, on a very personal note I could 
not help but notice that the drive for this legislation commenced 
with a decision of an Ontario court judge who found that the 
existing Criminal Code provisions strayed from the 
requirements of our charter. I believe this is rightly so. He did 
find that correctly. That particular judge was a lawyer for whom 
I had first worked as an articling student some 20 years ago.
<P>
	The case involved a police officer who had apprehended a 
suspect and in connection with that had fired his gun. That 
police officer lived right across the street from me in Toronto. 
This particular amendment is a little bit more than just an 
intellectual exercise for me.
<P>
	I would like to speak in particular to that aspect of the 
legislation that deals with the work of employees in federal 
penitentiaries who have certain powers and protections to help 
them do their work. The bill recognizes that peace officers who 
are correctional officers in penitentiaries have a unique 
situation relative to that of peace officers who are police officers 
on the street.
<P>
	Correctional officers are dealing with convicted offenders, 
many of whom would present a serious danger to public safety if 
they were to escape. Subsection 25(5) of the bill would permit 
correctional officers to use deadly force in order to prevent an 
escape from a penitentiary that houses such high risk offenders. 
This would be only as a last resort when less violent means had 
been tried and found not to work. Those other means include 
warning shots and oral commands.
<P>
	This reflects current policy and practice in the correctional 
service which is responsible for the operation of the federal 
penitentiary system. It is in accordance with the mandate of the 
service to protect society. The Correctional Service of Canada's 
current internal policies are currently consistent with proposed 
subsection 25(5). This requires a correctional officer 
intervening in an escape to attempt to first issue an oral  warning 
to stop and then to fire a warning shot unless circumstances do 
not permit that to happen. In practice it has happened extremely 
rarely that a warning shot has not deterred an escapee and that 
lethal force has had to be applied.
<P>
<B>(1355) </B>
<P>
	Only specifically trained and authorized correctional officers 
in maximum and medium security institutions carry firearms. 
They do so only in designated areas. These include the 
observation towers and patrols around the institution perimeter.
<P>
	Both maximum and medium security institutions contain 
inmates considered to pose a significant risk of escape and 
threat to the safety of the public. Consequently both maximum 
and medium security institutions are equipped with strong 
perimeter security such as high fences, walls, movement 
detection systems, cameras, armed posts and patrols.
<P>
	The Correctional Service of Canada currently has 13 
maximum security facilities and 17 medium security facilities 
in Canada. There are no armed posts in federal minimum 
security institutions since these institutions house offenders 
who are classified as being of low risk to the public.
<P>
	As the Minister of Justice has already explained, the general 
rule in subsection 25(4) requires the peace officer to have 
reasonable grounds to believe that the particular individual 
fleeing arrest represents a threat of death or grievous bodily 
harm.
<P>
	Subsection 25(5) qualifies that rule in the case of escapes 
from a penitentiary. That is important. This is a special rule to be 
used only for federal penitentiaries. The reason for this is that 
when a correctional officer sees an inmate escaping it is 
practically impossible for him or her to assess the degree of risk 
that particular individual represents at that precise moment in 
time. Physical circumstances such as darkness, distance, or a 
disguise worn by the inmate may make it impossible for the 
officer to identify the inmate.
<P>
	Even if the identity were known the officer would not likely 
be aware of the factors that have precipitated the escape attempt, 
factors which could result in the inmate posing an increased risk 
to public safety. Inmates attempting to escape are often 
desperate to make good their escape attempt and are capable of 
resorting to violent measures including the taking of civilian 
hostages.
<P>
	Therefore the test that is used in subsection 25(5) is that the 
officer must believe on reasonable grounds that any of the 
inmates in the penitentiary pose a threat of death or grievous 
bodily harm to the officer or any other person, that is, any 
inmate in that institution.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="1301"> 1301 </A></B>
<P>
	Correctional officers are able to found their belief on a well 
established system which assigns every federal institution a 
security classification according to the inmate population it is 
designed to accommodate. The new provision applies only to 
federal penitentiaries. Provincial corrections authorities were 
consulted in the drafting of this provision and they agreed there 
was no need for this provision provincially.
<P>
	I believe that this proposed new subsection maintains powers 
of protection needed by front line staff in our penitentiaries and I 
believe it strikes the appropriate balance with the interests of 
public safety.
<P>
	Lastly, in connection with the provision of the amendment 
dealing with foreign fishing vessels, I want to note that the 
vessels involved are foreign and not Canadian, an important 
distinction, and that the amendment is aimed at disabling a 
fishing vessel and not a person. Strictly speaking, the Canadian 
Charter of Rights and Freedoms certainly does not have the 
same application as it does in the fleeing felon rule amendment 
we are discussing. However, there are implications for the safety 
of persons on the fleeing vessel and for the fisheries officers on 
the Canadian vessel who may be bound to use force.
<P>
<B>(1400) </B>
<P>
	The section we hope the House will adopt contains a reference 
to the making of regulations that would circumscribe or outline 
the situations in which force might be used, how it would be 
used and when it would be used.
<P>
	This House frequently delegates this regulatory making 
power. We do it in almost every statute we pass. In this 
particular case we are delegating a scheme of regulatory making 
power which will come very close to making laws which are 
approximate to the issues of life and safety on a fleeing fishing 
vessel.
<P>
	It is my view that we are in waters, if I may use that term, that 
require us to use very careful guidelines. In doing this I know 
there is a committee of the House-
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> Order. The hon. member will of course take the 
floor after Question Period.
<P>
	It being two o'clock, pursuant to Standing Order 30(5), the 
House will now proceed to statements by members pursuant to 
Standing Order 31.

the interest free provision of the Advance Payments for Crops 
Act or APCA.
<P>
	It is the belief of the Liberal Party of Canada that the removal

<P>
	In 1974 the Liberal government of the day issued a lower 
corporate income tax for businesses which fall under the small 
business category. This rate was raised in subsequent years 
under the Liberals to an upper level of $200,000 in 1982. It has 
not been raised since that year despite a 55 per cent increase in 
the consumer price index.
<P>
	On behalf of the many small businesses in my riding which 
have tremendous confidence in the Liberal plan for small 
business, I would like to recommend to the minister that we

that it was the federal government that changed on October 25

	The minister should be clear to Canadians that he and his

	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, my question is directed to the Prime Minister. In 
today's editions of <I>Le Droit</I>, <I>Le Soleil</I> and <I>Le Quotidien</I>, 
journalist Michel Vastel reported on allegations of cocaine 
trafficking in Kahnawake. These allegations, originating from 
sources associated with the RCMP, are very serious because 
according to them, warriors have been asked by organized crime 
groups in Montreal to protect large convoys of cocaine which 
are thus able to transit safely through the Kahnawake reserve.
<P>
	My question to the Prime Minister is this: Could he inform the 
House whether the RCMP has told him about any involvement 
of the warriors in cocaine trafficking?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Herb Gray (Leader of the Government in the House 
of Commons and Solicitor General of Canada):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
have asked the RCMP commissioner for a full report on the 
article in question, and I expect to receive a report very shortly. 
The Leader of the Opposition has asked me a question on a very 
serious matter, and that is why I asked the commissioner for a 
report as soon as possible.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it is hard to imagine and almost inconceivable that the 
Solicitor General and the Prime Minister are not aware of 
information now circulating in the newspapers under the 
by-line of a well-known journalist.
<P>
	I would like to ask the Prime Minister or the Solicitor 
General, if the former is not willing to reply, whether the 
government can confirm that the following, as stated and 
confirmed by Mr. Vastel, is true, namely that Montreal's 
organized crime families have a number of warehouses on the 
Kahnawake reserve which are being used for drug deliveries, 
each cargo having a market value of up to $200 million.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Herb Gray (Leader of the Government in the House 
of Commons and Solicitor General of Canada):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
cannot confirm Mr. Vastel's article, and that is why I asked the 
RCMP commissioner to give me a full report as soon as 
possible, because these are very serious allegations.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, for the past few weeks the government has told us on 
various occasions: we are not taking any action because if we 
have the facts and if you have anything to say, then say it. What 
we read in the newspapers today is very serious indeed. I would 
like to ask the Prime Minister why the RCMP is not acting. Is it 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1305"> 1305 </A></B>
<P>
by any chance because the government has given orders not to 
take any action?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
we have told the RCMP to do its job everywhere in Canada, and 
that is what it does. As for allegations in a newspaper article, 
obviously any sensible person would consider it was 
elementary, before stating what was written in an article-As 
you know, there is always a slight possibility that what a 
journalist writes may not be true.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval):</B> Mr. Speaker, my question 
is also for the Prime Minister. In the same article, we are told 
that conversations taped by the RCMP reveal that organized 
crime knows very well that supplies go through an Indian 
reserve since, and I quote, one would have said: ``We have a 
place there, where we know that nothing will happen''.
<P>
	My question to the Prime Minister is this: Will he not agree 
that, contrary to what he told us in this House, there are places in 
Canada where neither the RCMP, nor the army, nor even MPs 
can go freely?
<P>
<B>(1420) </B>
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
there is no place in Canada which is outside the mandate given to 
the RCMP, which is to act according to the law and to uphold the 
law.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval):</B> Mr. Speaker, could the 
Prime Minister tell us whether or not it is true that the RCMP has 
been compiling evidence for months on people involved in 
cocaine trafficking, and especially on an Indian chief?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Herb Gray (Leader of the Government in the House 
of Commons and Solicitor General of Canada): </B>Mr. Speaker, 
it is never wise to comment on investigations in progress or on 
matters related to police operations. If the hon. member wants 
an action leading to convictions in criminal court, he should be 
careful in the way he formulates his questions. I do not suppose 
he wants to create a situation which would prevent the police 
from presenting enough incriminating evidence in court.

	<B>Mr. Bob Ringma (Nanaimo-Cowichan):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the Minister for International Trade.
<P>
	The government recently signed a credit agreement worth $60 
million U.S. to help finance the construction of a new 
aluminium smelter in South Africa. However, Canada has also 
entered into an informal agreement to cut world-wide 
aluminium production by about 10 per cent.
<P>
	Will the minister explain to the House why his government is 
trying to reduce the international aluminium glut on the one 
hand and is helping to build a new smelter on the other?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Roy MacLaren (Minister for International Trade):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, the contract in South Africa with SNC Lavalin is 
for the design of an aluminium smelter. It will not come on 
stream for a number of years, by which time the present excess 
amounts of stockpile in Russia should have been absorbed by the 
market.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bob Ringma (Nanaimo-Cowichan):</B> I have a 
supplementary question, Mr. Speaker. Perhaps the government 
thinks that some jobs are more important than others, but the 
aluminum glut has already forced western producers and Alcan 
Aluminum in Montreal to cut production by one half million 
tonnes.
<P>
	Can the minister explain to Canadian aluminum workers who 
are in danger of losing their jobs because of falling aluminum 
prices why their taxes are helping to finance a foreign 
competitor?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Roy MacLaren (Minister for International Trade):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I thought I had just answered that question.
<P>
	The situation with regard to Russia today is one of a present 
glut of a stockpile. The agreement among the countries involved 
is intended to look toward orderly marketing of that stockpile.
<P>
	In the year 1996 and beyond when the South African 
aluminium smelter comes on stream, there should be in place a 
more standard, orthodox market for aluminium. We do not 
anticipate at that time the sort of glut that is being encountered 
today.

	<B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
this morning we learned that the Minister of Finance had 
informed the president as well as the vice-president of the 
Canadian Federation of Independent Business, Mr. Pierre 
Cléroux, that he would be slashing expenditures by roughly $5 
billion while increasing taxes on the middle class by $2 billion. 
This announcement came on the heels of a series of meetings 
between the minister and this organization which is 
well-viewed by the Canadian public.
<P>
	After having shown a lack of judgment last week with his 
statements on interests rates, can the Minister of Finance tell us, 
yes or no, whether he disclosed these details about the budget to 
Mr. Pierre Cléroux?

<P>
<B>(1425) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot):</B> That answer 
is brief and to the point. Mr. Speaker, does this means that the 
Canadian Federation of Independent Business and its 
representatives are not credible?
<P>
	In response to all our questions, the Minister of Finance keeps 
repeating: Wait for the budget. Given that the minister made 
these statements to the Canadian Federation, will he not 
acknowledge that it is totally unacceptable for him to reveal this 
kind of information to lobbyists outside this House, not to 
mention that it shows contempt for members of Parliament and 
for the people of Quebec and Canada?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional Development 
(Quebec)):</B> Mr. Speaker, I think that this goes to show why one 
should not prepare his supplementary question before knowing 
what the answer to the main question will be.
<P>

answer the second question which is nonsensical.

question is for the Prime Minister.
<P>
	An audit of the International Centre for Human Rights and 
Democratic Development in Montreal reports a waste of 
millions of taxpayer dollars. Will the government commit to 
acting on the recommendations of the audit?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Roy MacLaren (Minister for International Trade):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I believe the centre has already set up a committee 
to look further into the questions the hon. member has raised. I 
believe in the first instance they will be dealt with in that way.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary North):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
audit reports that the staff at the centre is overpaid an average of 
$10,000 and that the senior staff is rarely in the office.
<P>
	Given that similar work is already being done by other public 
agencies this entire project appears to be an expensive 
retirement plan for the former leader of the NDP, complete with 
a $150,000 yearly salary. Will the government terminate this 
centre and save taxpayers more than $4 million a year?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Roy MacLaren (Minister for International Trade):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I understand that the centre itself, in devising its 
salary policies, attempted to follow guidelines similar to those 
of the public service in job identification and remuneration.
<P>
	That process may be under evaluation by the board of the 
centre. I hope my colleague, the Minister of Foreign Affairs, 
will have the opportunity to respond more fully to the question 
at a later date.

lowering the ceiling on RRSPs, which primarily benefit the 
middle class.
<P>
	Is the Minister of Finance prepared to promise that the 
measures contained in his upcoming budget will not increase the 
tax burden of the middle class?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional Development 
(Quebec)): </B>Mr. Speaker, as I have said repeatedly to members 
opposite, they will know what is in the budget when I table it.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Nic Leblanc (Longueuil):</B> Of course, Mr. Speaker, I was 
expecting this answer. Nevertheless, does the Minister of 
Finance not realize that in all fairness, lowering the ceiling on 
RRSPs will deal a direct blow to self-employed workers who, 
unlike other workers, do not have an employer-sponsored 
pension plan?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional Development 
(Quebec)): </B>Mr. Speaker, if the answer is known, why ask the 
question? Clearly, we will examine the ramifications of all the

Institute which recommended that 150,000 immigrants per year 
be accepted into Canada.
<P>

conclusions of this report?
<P>
<B>(1430 ) </B>
<P>

said that the report, often quoted by that gentleman and his

<B><A NAME="1307"> 1307 </A></B>
<P>
party, did not tell Canadians that it was found in the very worst 
case scenario that immigration was neutral on the economy. 
That is what I said and that is what I stand by.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Art Hanger (Calgary Northeast):</B> Mr. Speaker, a 
supplemental. In the same address the minister spoke positively 
about an Economic Council of Canada report. It recommends an 
immigration level of about 180,000, fully 70,000 fewer than the 
minister's plan.
<P>
	Why has the minister chosen to ignore not only the C.D. Howe 
Institute but also the Economic Council of Canada which he 
previously cited in support of his immigration policy?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sergio Marchi (Minister of Citizenship and 
Immigration):</B> Mr. Speaker, I think the hon. member is wrong 
with respect to drawing that conclusion from the Economic 
Council of Canada.
<P>
	The Economic Council of Canada agreed with the 
approximate 1 per cent figure. It also made the additional 
recommendation that governments should pursue that 1 per cent 
gradually and that is exactly what we did. We honoured the 
commitment of approximately 1 per cent which was a red book 
commitment and we are doing it gradually which is in keeping 
with the Economic Council report recommendations.

that its author, Ed Stewart, states that I said the government's 
policy was to reduce health care expenditures. This was not his

this minister and this government do not look favourably on 
those who wish to subvert our immigration and refugee laws. 
The member also knows that privacy laws prevent us from 
getting into the specifics of the case.
<P>

we are standing up to the very letter of the law for those who

laws.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Sharon Hayes (Port Moody-Coquitlam):</B> Mr.

system problem. Canada's refugee system should act as a haven 
for genuine refugees, for people whose lives have been torn 
apart by war, famine and persecution.

	Will the minister commit to proceed to overhaul the 
immigration and refugee system that seems to protect and 
harbour criminals at the expense of legitimate claimants?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sergio Marchi (Minister of Citizenship and 
Immigration):</B> Mr. Speaker, the member raises a certain 
frustration many Canadians feel.
<P>
	Speaking generally, Canadians face and favour a system 
which is tolerant to those who legitimately wish to put their 
claims before the Immigration and Refugee Board. On the other 
hand they want a sense of balance for those who are convicted of 
heinous crimes or those who wish to clearly subvert the law. 
They do not want that tolerance abused.
<P>
	As the minister I certainly share that frustration. I will be 
working at trying to come to grips with that balance by trying to 
keep out those who clearly do not require assistance, without 
closing the door under the Geneva international convention to 
those who legitimately seek it.
<P>
	I would also like to point out to the member that those 
criminal cases are very few, in the minority in comparison to the 
general number. I am saying one is too many, but I am also 
cautioning the member in her leaving the impression that the 
IRB process is riddled, if I can use that word, with all sorts of

Speaker, there is no question that, under the Constitution, 
education is an area of provincial jurisdiction.
<P>
	Under the Constitution, manpower issues come under a 
shared jurisdiction because the responsibility for workers who 
cross the various borders is a federal one, while the 
responsibility for courses provided as part of the training 
process is a provincial one. That is why, for years now, this has 
been an area of shared federal and provincial responsibility.

concerned, this is another example of the skilful sidestepping

and Minister responsible for Public Service Renewal):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, who initiated manpower training courses paid with UI 
funds, unemployment insurance being an exclusive federal 
jurisdiction, if not the federal government? It has over one 
hundred employment offices in Quebec, approximately 120 I 
believe, compared to only 30 or so provincial employment 
offices. 	
<P>
	Obviously, when we want to develop manpower skills in a 
modern country, the plumber or electrician, as the case may be, 
must have abilities and skills that are equally usable in all 
provinces, not just in one. So, the standards applied to these 
skills are national ones. That is why this has been an area of 
shared jurisdiction for years.

	<B>Mr. Myron Thompson (Wild Rose):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the Minister of Justice.
<P>
	As was suggested to me after my speech on justice I did 
review the hon. justice minister's address to the House on 
January 27. In that address, as reported on page 514 of <I>Hansard</I>, 
the hon. minister stated that the justice agenda included 
modernizing our laws so they reflect current values.
<P>
	According to all polls, current values include stopping 
automatic parole, deporting non-citizens committing serious 
crimes and the return of the death penalty for first degree 
murder.
<P>
	Will the minister assure the House that the current values of 
Canadians will be included in the government's agenda for 
justice?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney 
General of Canada):</B> Mr. Speaker, sometimes the perception of 
current values is in the eyes of the beholder. There are those of 
us who would contend that the position of Canadians generally 
on the subjects to which the hon. member has referred are not 
exactly as perceived by the hon. member for Wild Rose.
<P>
	I can tell the hon. member that so far as the Ministry of Justice 
is concerned and as evidenced by the speech I gave in the House 
to which the hon. member has referred, we are very much 
concerned with ensuring that all of our laws, criminal and 
otherwise, conform with current values. With the agenda we 
have put before the House I believe we have done exactly that.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Myron Thompson (Wild Rose):</B> Mr. Speaker, I refer to 
several polls. If one were to talk to Canadians on any street 
anywhere in Canada I am sure one would find these are the 
things they want. One does not have to have the brains of a 
professor to understand what Canadians want.
<P>
	The biggest fear that Canadians and I have is that the voice of 
special interests which does not represent the majority of 
Canadians will be heard while the majority's wishes will go 
unheard as they have in the past.
<P>
	Can the minister state to this House that this will not be the 
case, yes or no?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney 
General of Canada):</B> Mr. Speaker, the platform upon which this 
party gained office in October last contained at length 
recommendations, proposals and initiatives we intend to take 
with respect to Canada's justice system. Among others are 
important reforms to the young offenders legislation and as the 
Solicitor General can tell the House, changes in respect of 
parole in order to conform with needed changes we see in the 
system.
<P>
	I can assure the hon. member this is not a reaction to special 
interests. This is prescribing a Liberal view of what is good for 
Canada and in the public interest. That is exactly what we are 
going to do.

service renewal, as have most members. It is normal that a 
report be given to the House once a year, yet I am shocked to 
discover that it is a year and a half since a report has been

a report to the House of Commons?
<P>

Council for Canada, Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs

Speaker, I thank the hon. member for her question.
<P>
	First let me underline how important it is to have such a 
competent and devoted public service as we have. Good 
government would not be possible without a public service of 
that quality. The annual report to the Prime Minister on the 
public service is still in the process of being drafted.
<P>
	It has been somewhat delayed by the events of the summer. It 
is intended it will be sent to the Prime Minister after the tabling

	<B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, my question is for the Minister responsible for the 
Federal Office of Regional Development. A while ago, the 
Minister of the Environment announced that a consulting firm 
had been hired to advise her on the choice of the Canadian city 
that will host NAFTA's commission on environmental 
co-operation. During the last election campaign, the current 
Minister of Finance promised to make every effort to bring the 
headquarters of international organizations to Montreal and to 
turn Quebec's largest city into a world environment centre.
<P>
	My question to the finance minister is this: Will the minister 
keep the promise he made to Montrealers during the election 
campaign?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister 
of the Environment):</B> Mr. Speaker, of course, the Liberal 
government's promise is the same one we made in the red book. 
Our government is transparent and open to the public. And I am 
very happy to inform all members that the applications to host 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1310"> 1310 </A></B>
<P>
NAFTA's environmental centre were filed on February 4. Three 
of the 22 applications came from Quebec cities. The  process, 
that will be conducted in a very open manner, will close on 
February 30. We will pick the Canadian city which is the most 
open with respect to the environment and all other 
infrastructures.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I understand that there may be some problems with the 
report if it is expected by February 30.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh!
<P>
	<B>Mr. Duceppe:</B> I also understand that this promise was made 
not only in Montreal during the last election campaign but that it 
may have been made by chance in Hamilton as well. I am 
therefore asking the minister responsible for the federal office 
of regional development whether he fears that the manoeuvres 
of his colleague, the Minister of the Environment, will deprive 
Montreal of this environmental centre.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister 
of the Environment):</B> Mr. Speaker, obviously, even the Liberal 
government cannot change the calendar; it is true that the results 
are expected not by February 30 but by the end of February.
<P>
	That being said, I do not know if the hon. member knows that 
three Quebec cities have applied, namely Montreal, Kirkland 
and Hull. I am sure that members of the Bloc Quebecois do not 
want to deny a process open to all Canadian cities interested in 
applying, including the three Quebec cities wanting to be 
considered in an open and transparent manner to become, in 
effect, a centre for Canada.

<P>

<P>
	In light of the fact that constituents and the Liberal, Reform, 
Conservative and NDP constituency associations in this riding 
are organizing in an attempt to force a byelection, when will the 
Prime Minister recognize and support the merits of recall?
<P>
<B>(1450 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
this process has not worked in Canada in the past and will not 
work. It was tried once by the Socreds in Alberta. A member of 
the cabinet at that time is the father of the leader of the Reform 
Party. A year and a half later there was a recall of the leader of 
the party and the party decided to recall the recall so it would not 
lose its leader.
<P>
	It is not something that is a high priority for this government.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Leon E. Benoit (Vegreville):</B> A supplementary question, 
Mr. Speaker. As the Prime Minister is well aware, the hon. 
member for Vancouver Quadra, a recognized parliamentary 
expert, declared in a recent interview with CBC Prime Time 
News that he does not oppose the notion of recall.
<P>
	Does the Prime Minister agree with the hon. member's expert 
opinion?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the people decided that every one of us was to be elected, for one 
party or another.
<P>
	The leader of the opposition was elected as a Conservative 
and eventually with nine other members of the Tories he decided 
to move. There was no recall. If we were to have recall, I would

<P>
	Given the answer I just received, is the Prime Minister aware 
that his Minister of Fisheries and Oceans promised a new 
program to replace the one ending on May 15? If he is aware of 
that fact, can he tell us if fishermen will have the opportunity to 
give their opinion on the implementation of that new system 
and, if so, how will the consultation be done, given the very 
short time left?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister 
of the Environment):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is a fact that the program 
ends in May. We are already working on a few possibilities. 
Today, the Minister for Human Resources is meeting with his 
provincial counterparts in order to determine what direction the 
renewal of social programs will take. It is also a fact that the 
minister is working in co-operation with his colleague the 
Minister of Fisheries and Oceans so that fishermen of the 
Magdalen Islands and Newfoundland are consulted before the 
program's expiration on May 15.
<P>
	The member should know that the implementation plan is not 
for Newfoundland alone; it concerns fishermen of the Magdalen 
Islands, Newfoundland and other parts of the Maritimes. We are

<P>
	The death of Sue Rodriguez has once again raised the ethical 
issue of euthanasia. I believe the time has come for a full public 
discussion of this issue. As members of Parliament, we should 
facilitate this discussion. Once all sides are heard, the final say 
on this deeply personal issue should go to the people of Canada.
<P>
	Will the Minister of Justice agree that on the date of the next 
federal election a binding national referendum on euthanasia be 
put to the Canadian people?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney 
General of Canada):</B> Mr. Speaker, Sue Rodriguez was a 
courageous person whose death we mourn, and whose life in its 
last stages served to put in sharp focus the difficult and 
contentious issues arising from the subject of euthanasia.
<P>
	I remain with the belief which I have expressed in the past that 
this is a subject that Parliament should consider and determine. 
Judges in the course of the Rodriguez litigation observed that it 
is the job of Parliament, and not the courts, to grapple with 
societal questions such as these. The House of Lords in England 
has embarked on  an examination of the principles so it can be 
determined legislatively in that jurisdiction.
<P>
	I remain of the view that we should provide through 
Parliament a forum for informed discussion, drawing 
distinctions among the various concepts that are involved, from 
cessation of treatment to actively assisting suicide, and let 
parliamentarians make up their minds.
<P>
	It has not yet been determined the forum in which that will 
come forward from this government. But I assure the hon. 
member it is a matter of continuing concern for me that it occur. 
I do not agree that a referendum is the answer but I do think it 
should be discussed in Parliament. I will keep the hon. member 
advised as we make progress in the process of bringing the 
question forward for consideration in this Chamber.

<P>
	The image of milk as a clean, pure food has great credibility 
among Canadian consumers. However, the recent approval by 
the American government to allow the injection of BST, bovine 
somatltropin, to stimulate milk production in dairy cows has 
caused great concern among consumers in Canada.
<P>
	Consumers are concerned they will be denied the right to 
clean, pure milk. As well, they will not be able to tell if BST has 
been used in blended products such as cheese, butter, yogurt and 
ice cream.
<P>
	Will the minister assure all Canadians that the government 
will not approve the use of BST until the experiment in the 
United States proves conclusively that milk and milk blended 
products are safe?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Diane Marleau (Minister of Health):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
BST is a technically produced product, equivalent to a naturally 
occurring hormone in cows. Officials in my department have not 
concluded their review of BST. I am aware that BST is approved 
in the United States, after having undergone extensive review.

	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister

between Ontario and Quebec and among various provinces in 
this country, which should be reflected in our environmental 
standards. It is very important. That is why I am hoping that we 
will soon reach a second agreement with Quebec regarding the 
St. Lawrence River. It is also why anyone interested in the 
environment should understand that what is dumped into Lake 
Ontario may affect fishermen downstream, even as far as the St. 
Lawrence.

immigration can plug in, and to ensure that the country reaches 
those dreams and those aspirations.

<P>
	<B>Mr. Derek Lee (Scarborough-Rouge River):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
I certainly will not need that amount of time. When we recessed 
for question period I was near the end of an intervention dealing 
with amendments to the Criminal Code and the amount of force 
police officers may be permitted to use in apprehending 
individuals fleeing arrest.
<P>
	The amendment also deals with changes to the Criminal Code, 
specifically the circumstances of penitentiary guards. Their 
circumstances are a little different. Now the code will recognize 
the ability of penitentiary guards and corrections officers to 
have access more quickly to the use of force than would 
otherwise be the case for police officers and peace officers.
<P>
	At the end of that amendment there is a section dealing with 
the Coastal Fisheries Protection Act. I had made note of the 
reference in the amendment to an authority to be given by the 
House to the Governor in Council, that is cabinet, in prescribing 
regulations establishing the procedures in accordance with 
which and the extent to which a fisheries protection officer is 
permitted to use the force referred to in the subsection.
<P>
	For the record I wanted to impress upon the House what we 
are doing here without saying it is right or wrong. At the end of 
the day it is probably the most expedient procedure. We are 
giving over to the Governor in Council, to cabinet, the ability to 
prescribe and define the precise definition between times when 
the force may be used and when the force may not be used. In 
essence, we are giving them the right to define what is an 
offence and what is not an offence. Over time this is not 
something a parliament would ordinarily do. It is our job in the 
House to define clearly and consistent with the charter what is 
and what is not an offence.
<P>

<P>
	As we delegate this regulatory power in the statute I want the 
House to know I am confident the joint Standing Committee on 
Scrutiny of Regulations will take a little closer look at the 
regulations passed, if any, under this section. I want the House to 
be aware that as a rule we should not get into the habit of 
delegating to cabinet regulatory making powers whenever we 
find it difficult on our part to do it with precision.

the other side of the coin and it is also very enlightening.
<P>
	Bill C-8 proposes to amend two acts, one of which is the 
Coastal Fisheries Protection Act. My colleague from the Bloc 
discussed this aspect. I will comment on the amendments which 
concern the Criminal Code. Since I am the Official Opposition 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1314"> 1314 </A></B>
<P>
critic on matters regarding the Solicitor General of Canada, I 
will only discuss clause 1 of Bill C-8.
<P>
	At first glance, this clause seems to meet most of the 
stakeholders' expectations regarding the use of force by peace 
officers against fleeing suspects and prisoners trying to escape.
<P>
	However, to appreciate the proposed amendments and assess 
the implications of delegating such power to officers, i.e. 
persons in authority, and also to be able to make constructive 
criticisms, it is useful to remember that section 25 is part of the 
general provisions of the Criminal Code, more specifically in 
the chapter dealing with the protection of people responsible for 
implementing and enforcing the law.
<P>
	The general provisions of the Code are certainly the best 
known, and perhaps the most used, provisions of this act, and 
that is true even for policemen who do not necessarily often go 
to court.
<P>
	Consequently, it is essential that these general provisions be 
very clear, understandable and defined.
<P>
	Based on past experience, we can assume that police officers 
will use that new section. Fortunately, in the vast majority of 
cases, they will do so to protect themselves. However, 
experience also tells us that we must be very careful when it 
comes to granting increased power to persons in authority. 
These powers and their use must be defined in a very clear and 
specific way to avoid any gap between the objective of such 
delegation of power and its routine use by the persons in 
authority.
<P>
	For at least ten years, the federal legislator has been 
pondering the issue, and that illustrates the importance of 
amendments such as the ones contained in Bill C-8.
<P>
	In recent years, the review of this issue intensified and, in 
September 1991, the federal government proposed, at a meeting 
of ministers of justice, to amend subsection 25(4) of the 
Criminal Code, in order to better circumscribe the use of force 
by peace officers and prison guards.
<P>
<B>(1515) </B>
<P>
	The objective was therefore to better circumscribe the use of 
force by the police, while protecting the public and the police 
itself.
<P>
	The Minister of Justice of the time, the very transient Kim 
Campbell, presented in August 1992 a discussion paper on the 
question of fleeing suspects.
<P>
	The study was progressing when, in April 1993, the Douglas 
Lines case, already mentioned, brought to the fore this question 
of necessary force. I will give a short synopsis of the case, 
because I think it will help us understand what is involved in 
amending section 25.
<P>
	In the Douglas Lines case, a young white police officer in 
Toronto was chasing a black 19-year-old suspected of having 
tried to snatch the purse of a woman some time before.
<P>
	The police officer ordered the suspect to stop, which of course 
he did not do, so the police officer shot six bullets in the 
direction of the suspect who was hit twice. The police officer 
said that he believed that the suspect was armed.
<P>
	In fact, upon searching the suspect, they only found a knife 
which was probably the weapon used in the attempted theft.
<P>
	The police officer was charged with dangerous use of a 
firearm.
<P>
	However, as was said before, he was acquitted by a Toronto 
judge, and the ratio decidendi tended to suggest that subsection 
25(4) of the Criminal Code was unconstitutional.
<P>
	I have already mentioned that amending subsection 25(4) has 
been under consideration for about 10 years.
<P>
	The judge also said-and maybe that was to force the 
government into action-that he suspended for six months the 
application of the judgment to give the federal government time 
to review the clause in question. The ball was in the government 
court, so to speak, and something had to be done.
<P>
	Let us study clause 1 of Bill C-8 to see how it amends the 
various subsections of section 25 of the Criminal Code.
<P>
	Bill C-8 proposes changes which deserve an in-depth 
analysis, because of their implications for the various police 
forces and the area of law enforcement in general.
<P>
	Let us take the section we are looking at. We can see that 
subsection 25(3) confirms the possibility for anyone to use force 
intended or likely to cause death or grievous bodily harm if that 
person believes on reasonable grounds that it is necessary for the 
purpose of preserving himself or herself or any one under his or 
her protection from death or grievous bodily harm.
<P>
	Therefore, according to this subsection, the use of force is not 
unwarranted; it is clearly justifiable and well-defined legally.
<P>
	Subsection 25(4) as rewritten in Bill C-8, and that is the point 
I want to comment, leaves me puzzled. I do not question the 
necessity of such a subsection-I think the Toronto judge did not 
leave the legislator any choice-but the wording of it. It allows a 
peace officer to use force that is intended or is likely to cause 
death or grievous bodily harm in order to arrest a person taking 
flight provided he-the peace officer-respects certain 
conditions.
<P>
	However, we must admit, and give credit where credit is due, 
that these conditions are spelled out clearly and in full detail in 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1315"> 1315 </A></B>
<P>
paragraphs (a), (b), (c), (d) and (e) of the subsection; that 
certainly does credit to the legislator who wrote it.
<P>
	Paragraph (a) reads: ``the peace officer is proceeding lawfully 
to arrest with or without warrant''. It creates no problem. 
Neither does paragraph (b) which reads: ``the offence for which 
the person is to be arrested is one for which that person may be 
arrested without warrant''. Paragraph (c) reads: ``the person to 
be arrested takes flight to avoid arrest''. That is the very purpose 
of the law. Paragraph (d) reads: ``the peace officer or other 
person using the force believes on reasonable grounds that the 
force is necessary for the purpose of protecting the peace officer, 
the person lawfully assisting the peace officer or any other 
person from imminent or future death or grievous bodily harm''. 
This is the one paragraph I would like to comment; I will come 
back to it later on. Finally, paragraph (e) reads: ``the flight 
cannot be prevented by reasonable means in a less violent 
manner''. That is self-evident.
<P>
<B>(1520) </B>
<P>
	We see that the legislator added the words ``imminent or 
future'' in paragraph (d) of this new section, contrary to the 
previous section which did not provide for any timeframe. It 
said that the provisions applied under given circumstances, but 
with no mention of the words ``imminent or future'', as in the 
proposed section.
<P>
	By adding these, the legislator introduces a time difference 
between subsections (3) and (4) of the same section. Given the 
two interpretation tenets known by any lawyer, to the effect that 
first, any piece of legislation is to be interpreted as a whole, and 
second, everything in the law has a meaning, the words 
``imminent or future'' could lead to a very loose interpretation 
on the part of peace officers. We should not create a new 
problem while attempting to solve one.
<P>
	If the noble objective was to restrict the use of force on the 
part of peace officers and prison guards, such force should not 
be allowed to be used on a continuous basis, without any time 
limit.
<P>
	I humbly submit that the words ``imminent or future'' can 
lead to abuses. Sometimes, in a piece of legislation, a single 
term, a word, an expression have a definite purpose, but in the 
present case the expression ``imminent or future'' makes an 
already complete text cumbersome.
<P>
	The legislator did not see fit to add the words ``imminent or 
future'' to subsection 25(3) while it is doing so in paragraph 
25(4)(d), under similar circumstances. Why? Is it that he wants 
to provide greater protection to peace officers than to citizens? 
Does he believe that one would be more prone than the other to 
abuse such a wider use of force? The answer is anybody's guess.
<P>
	Unfortunately in both cases there are and always will be 
excessive people who will abuse a given provision.
<P>
	Why then open the door to such a broad use of force over 
time? Good judgment and the appraisal of the situation at a 
given time, on the part of the peace officer, his or her assistant, 
or a citizen, must prevail, as stated in subsection 25(3).
<P>
	Therefore, I will suggest to the Standing Committee on 
Justice and Legal Affairs, on which I sit, to remove the words 
``imminent or future'' from the last part of paragraph 25 (4)(d) 
and thus prevent any possible ambiguity.
<P>
	Moving on to section 25(5) of the Criminal Code, I think that 
in this case, the legislator was well advised to take into 
consideration the special situation faced by peace officers in a 
penitentiaries. I believe that circumstances warranted such a 
provision and I approve of it.
<P>
	The fact of the matter is that in penitentiaries, it is practically 
impossible for the correctional personnel reacting to an 
attempted escape to tell whether the inmate in question will pose 
a threat to society if his attempt is successful. Not only is it 
unlikely in such a situation that the peace officer would know 
the inmate attempting to escape but chances are he would not 
know what enabled the inmate to make such an attempt at a 
given time on a given day. It was therefore important-and the 
legislator understood it well-to give this power to the peace 
officer in case of escape, and section 25(5) does just that.
<P>
	However, we will have to make sure that the use of force that 
is intended or is likely to cause death or grievous bodily harm 
would be authorized only as a last resort, when every other 
means that could be used under the circumstances to tell the 
inmate to stop his escape attempt, such as a warning shot, had 
failed.
<P>
	Of course, these section of the Criminal Code will be 
supervised, that is to say that control will be exercised by 
superior court judges in Canada to determine whether or not the 
person, peace officer or citizen, used excessive force under 
section 25(4)-25(5) in the case of peace officers-and over 
time, through jurisprudence, through the decisions made by the 
judges, we will be able to determine if these provisions go far 
enough or not, or whatever.
<P>
<B>(1525) </B>
<P>
	First of all, I think we can say here in the House that, 
concerning Bill C-8, and clause 1 in particular, the government 
is on the right track. After ten years and many consultations, as 
the minister said this morning, subsections 25(4) and 25(5) meet 
the expectations of Canadians as well as those of peace officers.
<P>
	Two words in the bill are important. They are ``imminent or 
future''. Why add these words if they are meaningless, if they 
are not intended to give more time, if they are not meant to give
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1316"> 1316 </A></B>
<P>
officers permission to use force much later on? We could 
consider making some changes to these provisions later on in 
committee. We will make these observations then.
<P>
	You have understood, Mr. Speaker, that as my colleague said a 
moment ago, we will support this bill, but we will move 
amendments before the appropriate committee.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Harbance Singh Dhaliwal (Parliamentary Secretary 
to Minister of Fisheries and Oceans):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
Minister of Justice has outlined to the House what this bill is all 
about. He has done so with the clarity, directness and 
forcefulness that comes naturally to the minister. Before his 
appointment he was one of Canada's leading trial lawyers. In his 
speech the minister dealt principally with the amendments to the 
Criminal Code. He dealt briefly with the amendments to the 
Coastal Fisheries Protection Act.
<P>
	I will seek to provide the House with more detail on this latter 
topic.
<P>
	The amendments to the Coastal Fisheries Protection Act 
provide authority to use disabling force against a foreign fishing 
vessel that is fleeing so as to arrest the person commanding the 
vessel. This legislation relates to foreign fishing vessels, it does 
not relate to Canadian vessels.
<P>
	The reason is simple. Canadian vessels operate from 
Canadian ports, thus the person in command of a Canadian 
fishing vessel can be arrested when he returns to port. This is not 
true, of course, for foreign vessels.
<P>
	No new powers would be granted by this legislation. The 
amendment to the Coastal Fisheries Protection Act is necessary 
to avoid any uncertainty that may be created by the proposed 
amendment to subsection 25(4) of the Criminal Code.
<P>
	Let me outline when disabling force could be used. The 
legislation sets out three conditions. A duly authorized 
Canadian official referred to as a protection officer is 
proceeding lawfully to arrest the person in command of a 
foreign fishing vessel. The vessel takes flight to avoid the arrest 
and the protection officer believes on reasonable grounds that 
force is necessary to make the arrest. Thus, Parliament would 
define in the legislation when disabling force could be used.
<P>
	The government would decide how disabling force would be 
used. This would be done in regulations, the authority for which 
is granted in the legislation. As the Minister of Justice indicated, 
these regulations would be consistent with the Charter of Rights 
and Freedoms.
<P>
	Disabling force would only be used following ample warning. 
This would give a fleeing vessel the opportunity to stop. It 
would also allow the crew of the fleeing vessel to leave the part 
of the vessel to be fired upon. Disabling force should be a last 
resort. Every opportunity should be provided to avoid its use.
<P>
	When it is used, every effort should be made to avoid 
casualties. Yet, a credible threat of disabling force is necessary 
to act as a deterrent.
<P>
<B>(1530 ) </B>
<P>
	In general terms the regulations would provide for the use of 
disabling force at sea in compliance with international practice. 
A foreign vessel has fished contrary to Canadian laws. Various 
methods of warning the vessel are used. Internationally 
accepted flags are hoisted to request communication with the 
vessels and to order the vessel to heave to. Flashing lights and 
whistles are used to order the master to stop his vessel. 
Internationally accepted codes are used to signal the vessel to 
heave to. Repeated orders to stop are also made via radio 
communication. Only if these are unsuccessful-I repeat, 
unsuccessful-are warning shots fired.
<P>
	If all of those attempts to get the vessel to stop are failed, 
those aboard the vessels are told that disabling force will be 
used. They are told the part of the vessel that will be fired upon 
and they are told to leave that part of the vessel. Additional 
opportunity is given for the vessel to stop or for the crew to leave 
that part of the vessel. Only then would disabling force be used 
and only as much force as would be necessary to stop the vessel 
and make the arrest. This follows international practice in the 
use of disabling force at sea.
<P>
	It has always been important for Canada to protect its fish 
resources. This is critical today off our Atlantic coast where cod 
and flounder stocks face possible commercial extinction. We 
must take all measures necessary, domestic and international, to 
protect them.
<P>
	The greatest threat to stocks of cod and flounder that straddle 
the 200-mile limit is from the vessels fishing in international 
waters and flying flags of convenience. These are flags of 
countries like Panama, Honduras, Belize and Sierra Leone. 
These vessels continue to harvest fish stocks that are at 
dangerously low levels. They fish without quotas. They harvest 
whatever they can catch. They use small mesh gear. They target 
undersized fish. In short, they break every conservation rule in 
the book. For the owners of these vessels, profit comes first and 
conservation is never considered. They simply do not care.
<P>
	The Government of Canada will no longer stand by and watch 
this happen. These vessels will not be allowed to take the last of 
the breeding stock of cod or flounder before moving on to 
overfish somewhere else in the world. For too long these vessels 
have hidden behind obscure technicalities in international law. 
For too long they have claimed the protection of countries that 
neither the vessels nor their crews have ever seen. We will not 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1317"> 1317 </A></B>
<P>
let the technical niceties shield them any more. Their time is 
almost up. Canada is going to stop their overfishing.
<P>
	Canada has never used disabling force against a foreign 
fishing vessel. We hope we will never have to, but we must be 
prepared to do so where circumstances warrant.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Yvan Bernier (Gaspé):</B> Mr. Speaker, I listened carefully 
to what the member opposite had to say, but I am not sure I 
understand his point of view. So, I would like to give him the 
opportunity to go over it again, just to make sure I understand 
what he is saying. From what I gathered, the strengthening 
measures proposed in this bill would be, as far as the hon. 
member is concerned, one way to put an end to what he called 
foreign overfishing outside the 200-mile limit, on the nose and 
tail of the Grand Banks east of Newfoundland. However, I must 
remind him that the nose and tail of the Grand Banks in 
Newfoundland are outside the 200-mile limit and consequently 
not under Canadian jurisdiction. The strengthening or 
controlling measures put forward in this bill will not help to 
solve the issue.
<P>
<B>(1535) </B>
<P>
	I would now like to address another issue. According to the 
hon. member, foreign fishermen use smaller mesh gear than the 
Canadian industry and harvest smaller fish. I would like to point 
out that the Canadian groundfish industry, the cod industry, is 
very different from the European industry. The two industries 
are very different because fish consumption in Europe differs 
from our own. Whereas here, in Canada, when we eat cod, we 
usually want at least an eight-ounce filet as a main course, the 
smaller cod harvested by foreigners-what they call cabillaud 
for fresh cod in France-is usually served as a first course.
<P>
	I just want to call your attention to the various customs and 
ways of eating fish throughout the world. Some people may 
think they are right while their opponents are wrong, but what 
they believe should not contribute to an escalation of violence. 
To make sure that what we believe is true does not clash with 
what our opponents think is true, I came up with a draft 
amendment this morning. I urge the hon. member to reflect on 
this and to reconsider his position.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dhaliwal:</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank the hon. 
member for bringing those questions forward. I would like to 
inform him that the minister of fisheries will be in Brussels from 
the 15th to the 17th to discuss overfishing beyond the 200-mile 
limit with the NAFO organization. This law does not deal with 
beyond the 200-mile limit.
<P>
	As the minister has repeatedly stated in the House we are very 
concerned but we want to work within the international laws, 
both through the UN and NAFO to ensure conservation beyond 
the 200-mile radius on the high seas. We have to comply with 
the international laws on the high seas but we will work very 
hard to change that. The minister has indicated in the House 
many times that he has serious concerns about overfishing 
beyond  the 200-mile radius but we must work within the 
international laws.
<P>
	We are very confident that through NAFO and the United 
Nations we can get greater conservation. Right now the minister 
is informing NAFO to take the same action that Canada has. We 
have a moratorium on the cod in 3NO. The same type of 
conservation we have inshore can be had offshore as well as on 
the high seas.
<P>
	In terms smaller mesh nets it is not a question of values or 
truths, it is a question of conservation. We want to ensure we 
have good conservation practices and that is the reason it is 
mentioned.
<P>
	The hon. member understands the serious problem of fishing 
beyond the 200-mile radius and that we have to work within the 
international law. If we are not able to do that, then we have to 
take tougher decisions. This government is willing to do that the 
same as was done on the Pacific treaty commission on the west 
coast. We have told the Americans that equity must be on the 
table and that we are not willing to discuss management of the 
salmon until we discuss equity which has not been discussed and 
put forward each time it is brought forward.
<P>
	I thank the hon. member very much for the question.
<P>
<B>(1540 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Cummins (Delta):</B> I do not have much difficulty 
with the disabling force. It is necessary and we have to take 
strong action to protect our fisheries. However I am concerned 
about the provision dealing with the use of force against fleeing 
suspects.
<P>
	Fisheries officers are peace officers and they do carry 
weapons and have occasion to use them. On the west coast, and I 
am sure on the east coast of this country we do at times have 
problems with poaching. Poaching is an exercise which takes 
place at night and as a rule in secluded areas. Fisheries officers 
quite often can get into predicaments where weapons may have 
to be produced.
<P>
	The difficulty with this legislation as I see it is that in such a 
circumstance if a weapon is produced and shots are fired and 
someone engaging in illegal activity is shot, the fisheries officer 
not only will have to deal with the trauma and horror of having 
shot someone, but he will also have to deal with the horror of 
interrogation by the system he represents.
<P>
	I would like my friend the parliamentary secretary to the 
Minister of Fisheries and Oceans to comment on that please.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1318"> 1318 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dhaliwal:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for that 
question. I would like to bring to his attention that this deals 
with foreign vessels and the use of force against foreign vessels. 
This does not in any way talk about Canadian vessels. We can 
arrest Canadian vessels when they come into port. We do not 
need to use force against them. This deals with foreign vessels.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Cummins:</B> Mr. Speaker, I should have prefaced my 
remarks and probably forewarned the parliamentary secretary 
that my question was to be directed to him, but as I stated I do 
agree with the disabling force portions of the legislation. I do 
not have any difficulty with that and I understand that this 
disabling force will be used only against foreign vessels.
<P>
	My concern is with the provisions for use of firearms with 
suspects fleeing from arrest. As I indicated fisheries officers are 
police officers. They do carry weapons. In instances in which 
poaching is going on it occurs at night as a rule and in secluded 
areas. Weapons have been produced and people have been shot. 
Sooner or later by the law of averages someone could end up 
dead.
<P>
	The problem as I see it is that these are very trying times when 
these sorts of things happen. These police officers or fisheries 
officers are working alone or with a very small group of people 
in very isolated areas. Things happen quickly in the dark of 
night. Yet if someone is killed these people not only will have to 
live with their actions but they will also have to deal with an 
interrogation and possible court appearance. They will be taken 
to task by the very people who are supposed to be their bosses 
for enforcing the law of the land. I find that rather curious.
<P>
	Could the parliamentary secretary please comment on that 
particular aspect of the law.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dhaliwal:</B> Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the hon. member 
for his question.
<P>
	This legislation creates a number of restrictions which outline 
in detail when force can be used. If anything this legislation will 
deter the use of weapons. With respect to the situation the hon. 
member talks about in which someone might be shot, this 
legislation reduces the times where firearms can be used by the 
police and enforcement officers. This is very good legislation 
and will reduce incidents such as the hon. member has brought 
forward.
<P>
<B>(1545 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Art Hanger (Calgary Northeast):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
government has tabled a very important and in my opinion a 
somewhat problematic piece of legislation. I am thankful for the 
opportunity to speak to this legislation from the point of view of 
a police officer with 22 years experience on the force. As a 
policeman I have experienced what it means to have to make that 
judgment, the judgment that all police officers fear, whether or 
not to use deadly force. I also believe that attention must be paid 
to public opinion as it relates to criminal justice matters.
<P>
	Before I speak to this bill I would like to interject a few 
appropriate words for what is in effect my maiden speech in the 
House. I would like to congratulate the Deputy Speaker on his 
appointment and the election of the Speaker of the House. I have 
not taken the time to offer my thanks to those people who made 
my presence in this House possible nor introduced the 
community of Calgary Northeast. I hope the House will permit 
me a few moments for this purpose.
<P>
	I am indebted to all those people who played a vital role in my 
election. The first are my campaign volunteers who sacrificed so 
much time, gave so much effort and demonstrated such a civic 
commitment. They deserve the highest praise and I thank them 
all.
<P>
	I would also like to express my sincerest appreciation to my 
wife Margaret and my three children, Laura, Mitch and Jason. 
Their love and support have provided a source of strength that is 
unfailing and which I depend on from day to day. I would like to 
extend my thanks and appreciation to all the good people in my 
riding of Calgary Northeast.
<P>
	Calgary Northeast is a riding as diverse as any in Canada. It is 
made up of people from all ethnic groups, religions, educational 
and work backgrounds. During my campaign I was fortunate 
enough to have spoken to and received valuable input from a 
great many constituents. I am proud to claim the support of 
many new Canadians, first and second generation immigrants 
who have contributed so much to my riding.
<P>
	Calgary Northeast is an economically diverse riding. Jobs 
come from service industries as well as oil and gas. Because the 
riding is so diverse both demographically and economically it is 
especially noteworthy that the people of Calgary Northeast are 
united in their desire for real, fundamental and lasting reform. 
They expressed to me their disillusionment with politics, 
politicians and business as usual in Ottawa and they urged me to 
communicate in Ottawa the need for political, economic and 
judicial reform.
<P>
	Crime is a constant and growing concern in my riding as it is 
in many other communities across Canada. I am pleased to see 
the government is addressing the issue of judicial reform.
<P>
	However, in Bill C-8, the bill to amend the Criminal Code 
provision dealing with the use of deadly force, I am concerned 
that the government has its priorities backwards. I have some 
real misgivings regarding this bill and I shall now turn to those 
reservations.
<P>
	As I previously mentioned the criminal justice system is an 
area in which my constituents have expressed passionate 
opinions. Communities all over Canada have become concerned 
and 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1319"> 1319 </A></B>
<P>
alarmed at growing crime and the apparent inability of the 
judicial system to adequately respond to and prevent crime.
<P>
	Canadians are concerned about the safety of their families and 
they have reason to be concerned. Rates of violence across the 
country increase yearly and are reported daily. Confrontations 
between police officers and law breakers, many of whom are 
increasingly well armed and aggressive, are becoming more and 
more frequent.
<P>
	Historically, the public has felt secure and satisfied with 
Canada's police forces and their handling of crime and 
criminals. However, in response to a charter case heard before 
an Ontario court, a case prompted by an incident that was more 
of a political problem than a procedural one, the government is 
tabling a bill that seeks not so much to address a problem with 
police as an artificial problem created by charter arguments.
<P>
	In an Ontario court case in which a suspect was shot, a charter 
argument called into question the breadth of the current law 
regarding the use of deadly force. The court found that the law 
was too broad, since in theory-and this is a part of the Ontario 
decision-doughnut thieves could be shot by police if they fled 
from the scene of a crime. A brief to the Canadian Association of 
Chiefs of Police stated that the current law was out of date and 
noted that a literal reading of the rule could justify a use of force 
which could cause death or grievous injury against a shoplifter.
<P>
<B>(1550) </B>
<P>
	In a news release earlier this month the government 
announced it intended to introduce more restrictions on the use 
of deadly force by police officers attempting to capture fleeing 
suspects. The release said that deadly force should only be the 
last resort.
<P>
	While I agree, along with everyone in this House, I am sure, 
that police officers must be held accountable for their actions, 
especially when those actions include the use of deadly force, 
we must bear in mind that there is ample case law already on the 
books dealing with this issue. Stare decisis has long functioned 
as a mechanism by which the use of deadly force is judged.
<P>
	Common law has held that in order to use deadly force a 
police officer must have reasonable and probable grounds. Of 
course, in some instances there have been errors in judgment 
made on the part of individual police officers but the law has 
provided a basis for consideration of whether or not those 
judgments were proper ones. The current law lets police officers 
who are forced to make instant life and death decisions rely on 
their thorough training, their knowledge of the situation and 
their assessment of danger.
<P>
	Upon examining the proposed new sections of the Criminal 
Code contained in Bill C-8 I have to ask the following question. 
Will an officer who has felt the necessity to use deadly force still 
be given the same consideration, and will the same precedent 
apply during an examination of an incident? Or will this revised 
law open up the door for consideration of external issues  
surrounding each incident, issues that do not bear directly on the 
decision to use deadly force?
<P>
	The court case that caused the present law to come into 
question was precisely that sort of occurrence. As a police 
officer I dread any law that might have the effect of forcing 
officers to weigh political implications of the use of force in 
situations in which officers feel that either they or the innocent 
public are in imminent danger. Will this new law force such 
detailed examination by police officers? Will it place the onus of 
defence, not unlike criminal defence, directly on our police 
officers?
<P>
	I believe the Canadian people want the police to have greater 
authority in dealing with crime and criminals, and less legal 
charter based restrictions upon their ability to defend the public. 
Will this law force a police officer who would already be 
suffering enormous trauma after having been forced to use 
deadly force to undergo an equally traumatic political defence 
of his actions?
<P>
	Instead of giving police the authority and freedom that they 
need to properly defend our communities, are we ironically 
constraining them with the very charter which is supposed to 
protect law-abiding Canadians and their families?
<P>
	If the law does not give a degree of latitude to officers, if the 
law constrains the freedom of police officers to make instant 
decisions backed up by training, dedication and common sense, 
then that law actually puts the lives of police and innocent 
bystanders at risk for the sake of protecting fleeing dangerous 
criminals.
<P>
	Do Canadians want their police officers to have the freedom 
and authority to perform their duties even if that means having, 
in some tragic situations, to use deadly force?
<P>
	I believe the answer to that question is a resounding yes. Does 
the public feel the need for a law that would restrict police 
officers, put more onus on the police and less on criminals? The 
answer to that would be a resounding no.
<P>
	I understand that a court has issued a challenge to the current 
law, and I realize that some laws deserve to be challenged. But I 
am not sure this is one of those situations. Canadians have had 
enough of special interests groups that come up with 
government funded challenges to good, tested, working law 
simply because our charter gives them an opportunity for 15 
minutes of fame. Laws should come from people, not from the 
courts, whose only role should be interpretation. Our police are 
finding themselves increasingly unable to perform their duty to 
serve and protect the public. Is the House aware that in some 
jurisdictions police officers are issued firearms but must keep 
them locked in the trunks of their cars?
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1320"> 1320 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1555) </B>
<P>
	Similarly, federal fisheries protection officers, although 
armed, are prohibited from making arrests. They are instructed 
to observe, record and report a crime but may not take action to 
stop it.
<P>
	The public is enraged every time a police officer is killed in 
the line of duty. The public is enraged every time an innocent 
child is killed or molested. The public is enraged when the 
courts grant asylum to the likes of Charles Ng.
<P>
	These are clear messages and the government is not heeding 
them. Instead it introduces a bill which casts doubt on legitimate 
use of force by police. This reflects very misplaced priorities 
indeed.
<P>
	In closing, this bill is court inspired rather than people 
inspired. The court decision it stems from has no basis in 
common sense. When was the last time anyone heard of a 
doughnut thief or shoplifter being summarily executed by 
police? What nonsense. The cliche holds true: hard cases make 
bad law.
<P>
	Further, as my hon. colleagues will point out, there has not 
been adequate bottom up consultation with those whose lives 
will be directly affected by this bill.
<P>
	Last, why has the government chosen to make its first priority 
in criminal reform a restriction on police and not on criminals?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Morris Bodnar (Saskatoon-Dundurn):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
congratulate the hon. member on his speech. It was clear and 
certainly put his point across.
<P>
	I would like to ask him two question with respect to points he 
raised. He is concerned that police may not be protected 
sufficiently by the proposed legislation and made a reference to 
consultation not being adequate or at all. My first question of 
two is whether the member is aware that there has been 
considerable consultation with the provinces and with different 
police groups within the last year with respect to this 
legislation?
<P>
	Second, the hon. member criticized the proposed legislation 
and commented that there should be a requirement for an 
increased degree of latitude for police officers, et cetera, but he 
made no concrete suggestion as to what changes should be made 
in the proposed legislation. What changes would the hon. 
member make to the legislation that is being proposed?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hanger:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the member for his 
question.
<P>
	It is important to point out that historically there has been case 
law, founded in common law, supporting police officers in these 
situations. I believe there have been several cases in Canada 
where police officers have shot individuals and have been 
exonerated through the courts for their actions.
<P>
	The concern is that now every time a situation occurs in which 
a police officer has to use deadly force he will be evaluated 
totally on a charter basis. What other issues could be brought 
into such situations? Are there going to be political 
ramifications if a community says: ``We feel that he erred in his 
judgment prior to the incident'' or ``Police in general have not 
been handling themselves properly in the community and as a 
result certain individuals feel they are being picked on?'' Are 
these points going to be brought up in the hearings of police 
officers? That is my question.
<P>
	I would like to have these matters specifically addressed by 
the minister. That has not happened thus far.
<P>
<B>(1600 ) </B>
<P>
	I am aware that the Canadian Police Association has been 
addressed and two submissions have been forwarded over the 
last two years. I realize that this legislation is part of what the 
Conservatives started. Again, let us be realistic. The Canadian 
Police Association and its representatives are rather on the 
political side themselves. Many of their arguments have been 
presented on that basis.
<P>
	I think if we go into the practical evaluation of this piece of 
legislation that we will find that many police forces have not 
discussed this matter and have never heard of it. This is news to 
them even to the point of reading about it in the news. An honest 
evaluation and practical discussion about how this will affect 
policing has not been done.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Judy Bethel (Edmonton East):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is my 
understanding that the police services in general, and certainly 
the Edmonton police services, are in favour of this particular 
amendment because it clarifies the situation for police officers 
and thereby makes it easier.
<P>
	I am wondering if the hon. member has any comment. I would 
be interested to know how his Calgary police services feel about 
this particular bill.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hanger:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for her 
question.
<P>
	I would like to inform the hon. member that certainly the 
chiefs of police of all the police departments in the country 
undoubtedly have been consulted. At least there has been a brief 
presented to them. I have not seen the replies that came back 
from all those departments or from the chiefs for that matter. 
Often these matters are just discussed at an association level.
<P>
	I did consult members of the Calgary police department. Let 
me state that I am not a police officer. I would like to correct the 
statement that I made earlier. I am a former police officer. Yes, 
the matter has been discussed but only after seeing it in the 
news.
<P>
	The use of deadly force again is an issue that should be 
thoroughly discussed not only at police association levels-I 
think we should move away from that-but on the level of public 
debate. The whole matter should be  presented for the people to 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1321"> 1321 </A></B>
<P>
really analyse and then tell Parliament what they would like to 
see as a piece of legislation that would make police officers most 
effective in defending their rights in society.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Shaughnessy Cohen (Windsor-St. Clair):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I congratulate the hon. member for Calgary Northeast 
on his maiden speech.
<P>
	I point out to him that this legislation was not undertaken 
without consultation with police forces. I would seek to correct 
what I think is simply an error in his address when he indicated 
that front line police officers were not consulted. It is indeed the 
purpose of the Canadian Police Association to represent 
front-line officers and not to represent chiefs of police. In fact 
those officers have been consulted through that association and 
support has been given.
<P>
	I would also like to comment that the Canadian Charter of 
Rights and Freedoms is in place for the benefit and for the 
protection of all citizens of this country. The fact that the charter 
does not produce results with which members opposite may 
from time to time agree or disagree does not make it any less a 
valuable tool.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hanger:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the member for her 
question and for her congratulatory remarks.
<P>
	It is interesting when we talk about the charter and its effects 
on law. Certainly there has been an analysis done by many 
people. I believe there is one that is presently in circulation that 
was completed by an RCMP officer and chief superintendent. 
He clearly points out the shortfalls that have occurred over the 
last 10 years to allow police to effectively police.
<P>
<B>(1605 ) </B>
<P>
	In fact in his opening statement his analysis was that the 
charter has literally forgotten about truth and in effect has 
directed the investigations police do on the basis of how well the 
investigation is done. The courts have analysed it in this way. 
They are more concerned about how well the investigation was 
done as to whether or not it violated the rights of an accused 
rather than seeking the truth. I think this is where the breakdown 
has occurred.
<P>
	As we get more into the discussion of this particular piece of 
legislation we are going to see exactly what the charter has done 
to policing across the country because we are talking about that 
very thing. It is how police handle themselves and the law in 
protecting the people. The reflection I am getting from the 
community is that they realize the hands of police are tied, they 
cannot do anything about it and want something changed in that 
area.
<P>
	As for the consultation process with front line officers 
through the Canadian Police Association, I will rise to that 
particular challenge and say that we should talk to individual 
officers on the street. If it comes out of the association per se, 
then that is a politicized statement of the police associations and 
not rank and file officers in this country. I think police should be 
consulted on a rank and file level and not through some 
association.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The member for 
Markham-Whitchurch-Stouffville indicated earlier that he 
wished to rise on a question of privilege. Is that correct?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bhaduria:</B> Mr. Speaker, I will make my statement 
tomorrow morning.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Morris Bodnar (Saskatoon-Dundurn):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
am sure I will get the questions, which I have just asked, in 
reverse.
<P>
	Bill C-8 poses a very interesting question to all of us. 
Generally in drafting such legislation and granting powers to 
whatever body, whether it is a police force or any other force, we 
must be very vigilant in making sure that the intent we wish to be 
carried out does not go to far. The Minister of Justice must be 
complimented for bringing forward legislation with restrictions 
so that it does not go too far and the intent of the legislation is 
carried out.
<P>
	As we know, the intent of this legislation is to provide for the 
legal protection of police officers. It is not there for any other 
purpose. It is to provide for the protection of police officers, 
persons lawfully assisting police officers and those who use 
force that is intended or likely to cause death or grievous bodily 
harm to fleeing suspects who pose a threat of imminent or future 
death or grievous bodily harm. That is the purpose.
<P>
	In drafting such legislation we have to look at the values in 
our society and what we need in our society. What we do need in 
this society is a prevention of crime and the control of criminals 
but it has to be within certain prescribed rules. Unless those 
rules are in place we will end up with a situation in which 
different members of society can run a little footloose and fancy 
free if the rules are not in place. For this reason we do require 
rules.
<P>
	What should these rules do? They are laws that have to be fair. 
Fair is a very loose word to use. Then we go on to say that it must 
strike a balance. What is a balance? It has to be a balance 
between the rights of the fleeing suspect and the ability of police 
officers to protect themselves and the public.
<P>
<B>(1610 ) </B>
<P>
	This is what has to be dealt with in the legislation that is 
proposed. It is very important that this be drafted carefully 
because we are not dealing with just a minor matter. We are not 
dealing with some minor legislation. We are dealing with giving 
the right to kill. That is what we are doing. We are dealing with 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1322"> 1322 </A></B>
<P>
the most serious of  force. We are dealing with the granting in 
certain circumstances a right to cause the death of an individual.
<P>
	We cannot allow such a right to be put in place without 
restriction which describe the conditions under which that right 
can be utilized. In drafting such rules we cannot avoid common 
sense because common sense obviously is required. We must 
rely on it in the drafting of the legislation.
<P>
	It is quite important in drafting such legislation that we look 
at what we want to do. Of course, we do not want to cause agony 
for police officers and we do not want to cause them to have 
undue concerns. We do not want police officers to feel that they 
are restricted in their enforcement of laws. We understand that 
police officers have to make split second decisions. Sometimes 
they do not even have that much time to make a decision.
<P>
	However the rules still have to be there so that police officers 
can, after having thought through this legislation, be able to 
make that automatic decision as to what to do in the 
circumstances. They have to know in that split second or less 
what they are doing because in training they know what their 
parameters are.
<P>
	That is what is so important about this legislation as well. It 
has clarified to a large extent what police officers or peace 
officers can do. If it clarifies it for them then they know what 
they can do and where they can go.
<P>
	It is so important in such legislation to have certain 
restrictions so that a police officer can understand what can be 
done and what cannot be done. Perhaps the legislation is not 
perfect, perhaps it needs some modifying and perhaps we can 
foresee certain problems that arise with this legislation but that 
can perhaps be cleared up in committee with a few alterations.
<P>
	However, the general intent of the legislation is good. The 
intent is one of protecting the law enforcement people. We must 
go through it. It has been gone through by a number of members 
in the House already. However, there are certain aspects that 
have to be looked at.
<P>
	Of course there are restrictions because the law as it is 
proposed in subsection 4 says that the police officer or peace 
officer is justified in using force that is intended or is likely to 
cause death or grievous bodily harm. As I have already 
indicated, the most serious of matters is taking a person's life or 
causing grievous bodily harm. That is not just bodily harm. It is 
grievous bodily harm in many cases causing permanent 
disability, et cetera.
<P>
	Under what circumstances can a peace officer do this? It has 
already been enunciated that such a peace officer must be 
proceeding lawfully to arrest. That is not an undue hindrance on 
a peace officer because peace officers know when they can arrest 
and they know when they cannot. They know under which 
offences they can arrest. They know under which offences they 
can arrest without a warrant. They know where they require a 
warrant, et cetera. That should not be a problem to a peace 
officer.
<P>
	Second, the offence for which the person is to be arrested is 
one for which that person may be arrested without warrant. 
Again that should not be a problem for a trained police officer to 
determine.
<P>
	Third, consider when the person to be arrested takes flight to 
avoid arrest. That is a fairly obvious one where the police officer 
is trying to arrest the individual and he turns and starts running 
or the police officer announces that the person is under arrest 
and the person all of a sudden turns 180 degrees and is literally 
in full flight.
<P>
	One has to question this situation. What if the person does not 
know the police officer is trying to arrest him? We get into these 
special exceptions depending on the facts of each individual 
situation as it arises. Again, that is a matter that can be dealt with 
in our court system. The courts have generally and very 
reasonably set out additional rules if they are necessary. The 
legislation is not sufficient.
<P>
<B>(1615) </B>
<P>
	The fourth aspect is with regard to the peace officer or other 
person using the force who believes on reasonable grounds that 
the force is necessary for the purpose of protecting the peace 
officer, the person lawfully assisting the peace officer, or any 
other person from imminent or future death or grievous bodily 
harm.
<P>
	I must admit I have some sympathy with the hon. member 
from the Bloc who spoke previously indicating concerns with 
the wording of future. There has to be a concern. What does 
future mean? What does future death mean or future grievous 
bodily harm? Does it mean tomorrow? Does it mean 10 minutes 
from now? Does it mean six months from now? Does it mean a 
year from now? How imminent does that have to be? It does 
distinguish between imminent and future death.
<P>
	That is a matter that perhaps can be looked at in committee. Of 
course the flight cannot be prevented by reasonable means in a 
less violent manner.
<P>
	That is reasonable too because through experience I am sure 
that all know that police officers do not want to cause deaths of 
individuals. They will use precautions. They will take whatever 
steps are necessary. They will fire in the air. They will yell at the 
person. They will radio ahead for someone to get the person who 
is headed in a particular direction.
<P>
	Generally the flight cannot be prevented if such drastic action 
is taken but a provision like this is important in case there is one 
police officer who decides otherwise.
<P>
	I suggest there are concerns once we get into the other 
subsection dealing with the penitentiary provision for the peace 
officers in the jails. I will raise these simply as food for thought 
for some members.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1323"> 1323 </A></B>
<P>
	The subsection deals with peace officers being justified in 
using force that is intended or likely to cause death or grievous 
bodily harm against an inmate who is escaping from a 
penitentiary. Then it says if the peace officer believes on 
reasonable grounds that any of the inmates of the penitentiaries 
pose a threat of death or grievous bodily harm to the peace 
officer or any other person.
<P>
	That is a strange section. When a guard comes to work in the 
morning in a penitentiary he has to think who is being held in 
custody. Is there any person in custody who poses a threat of 
death or grievous bodily harm to anybody? If that person is even 
sitting in the special handling unit or in secure custody, if that 
person is within the penitentiary, that allows that guard to shoot 
a person who is escaping from the prison even though that 
person may not be an immediate threat.
<P>
	That is a matter that has to be looked at. That section appears 
to give a right of stopping an escaping inmate simply on the 
basis of who is in the prison population, even though the person 
in the prison population may not be doing anything.
<P>
	That is something that has to be looked at and that is why we 
look at this legislation. It would be quite unfair if the guard 
decides there is a person who would pose a problem, who may 
cause bodily harm, and he decides he can fire at that person who 
is escaping and then finds out that that person was released 
during the day and is no longer in the jail. All of a sudden the 
provision does not apply to him. It could be just as unfair the 
other way.
<P>
	If the intent of that subsection is to allow a peace officer to 
cause death or grievous bodily harm through an escaping inmate 
when no other reasonable means that are less violent are 
possible then it should be said in that clause rather than having 
the cumbersome procedure that is available.
<P>
<B>(1620 ) </B>
<P>
	I support the legislation because it is so important to peace 
officers. The clearer the legislation, the better the legislation.
<P>
	The amendments to the section before the House clarify to a 
large extent what peace officers may wish. It certainly places 
restrictions on them, but at least they know where they stand 
with the legislation. If there is something that is not clear and 
can be clarified, that can be dealt with further in committee.
<P>
	I would suggest that for once we have legislation that police 
officers can look to. They can read it and say here are the 
circumstances in which we can do something and here are the 
circumstances where we cannot. Once they have that, it will help 
them react much quicker and much better in emergency 
situations. When that is the case we will have much better police 
officers.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Art Hanger (Calgary Northeast):</B> Mr. Speaker I have a 
question for the hon. member, recognizing that the hon. member 
is steeped in the traditions of law and is  familiar with many 
charter cases that he undoubtedly has handled.
<P>
	Several times in his presentation he mentioned ``if the 
intent''. That is my point in questioning this law, the fact that the 
charter will come into play. If the intent is unknown then we will 
be subject to all kinds of wrangling. The police officer will not 
have the traditional support of the common law principles in 
case law. He will be subject to the introduction of other 
questionable material and the case may go in another direction.
<P>
	Will the hon. member please comment on exactly what he 
means when he tells this House that now police officers can be 
satisfied that they have some definite rules to follow. That is not 
the case if we do not have any case law to fall back on.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bodnar:</B> That is true. Until we have some case law to 
clarify particular matters, at times we will have to rely simply 
on the legislation so that we can interpret the legislation.
<P>
	Let us not forget that the Charter of Rights and Freedoms did 
not change the common law. To commit an offence one still has 
to commit a particular act and a person must have a particular 
intent. That has never been changed by the Charter of Rights and 
Freedoms. If a police officer runs into problems under this 
section and at any time is charged with a criminal offence, the 
police officer has the same protection of the Charter of Rights 
and Freedoms as any other individual.
<P>
	I can advise the hon. member that police officers are just as 
insistent on having the protection of the Charter of Rights and 
Freedoms as any other member of society.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hanger:</B> Taking it one step further, if we are going to be 
looking at a piece of legislation such as this, it must answer the 
concerns of Canadians. Are Canadians happy to see more 
restrictions placed on police officers?
<P>
	I do not believe they are. They have made that clear right 
across this country. We are going to be answering as 
parliamentarians many, many questions relating to crime and 
the way things are going with regard to criminal offences in this 
country. I do not see this legislation fitting the bill.
<P>
	How will this member address those particular concerns of 
the Canadian people when in fact it is not going to serve them in 
a more efficient manner?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bodnar:</B> That is an interesting comment made by the hon. 
member, that this may not fulfil the wishes of the public. One 
has to question what the public wants.
<P>
	The public wants efficient police enforcement. It wants 
people brought to justice when they should be and it wants 
individual rights protected. The public does not want police 
officers brandishing firearms and firing in every direction for 
any reason under the guise of protection. That would not happen. 
I am not saying police officers would do it, but individuals may. 
That would not happen. We want good enforcement. That is why 
we need a balancing. That balancing is between the  protection 
of individuals and police enforcement and bringing people to 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1324"> 1324 </A></B>
<P>
justice. That is what the Canadian public wants. The Canadian 
public will get it with this legislation.
<P>
<B>(1625) </B>
<P>
	It will get it within this legislation which I suggest to the hon. 
member police officers will support once it goes through the 
House.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Cummins (Delta):</B> Mr. Speaker, the member for 
Saskatoon-Dundurn mentioned that police have the same 
protection as any other member of society under this law. I 
would suggest to him that the police may have the same 
protection, but they have more responsibility when it comes to 
enforcing the law.
<P>
	I can recall as a youngster that if a policeman said stop, we 
stopped. That was the rule of the day. Nowadays it seems that if 
the policeman says stop, the criminal element says catch me if 
you can. The law will defend them if they say that.
<P>
	I would suggest to the member for Saskatoon-Dundurn that 
if the government was interested in justice on this matter that it 
would increase the penalty for fleeing. In other words, it would 
try to make it very unattractive for people to flee from the law 
when they are caught red-handed in crime rather than penalizing 
police officers and making the police officers jump through a 
series of hoops to defend themselves if they happen to be 
attempting to enforce the law.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bodnar:</B> Mr. Speaker, the laws are there dealing with 
escaping from lawful custody. The penalties are in place. The 
penalties are certainly not light. It is a matter of those laws being 
enforced and enforced in the sense of having the appropriate 
sentences. If the sentences do not appear appropriate, they are 
taken through the proper legal channels so that the courts can 
deal with it at an upper level to deal with the penalty fitting the 
offence. If that is not appropriate then Parliament can deal with 
it.
<P>
	The laws are in place now to deal with that particular aspect 
and to deal with it very adequately with respect to sentence so 
long as the judiciary deals with it appropriately in the 
circumstances.
<P>
	We cannot overlook that each situation is different. When 
judges look at situations they look at them differently. They will 
look at one situation, look at the extenuating circumstances if 
there are any, and impose what they believe is the appropriate 
penalty. It may be quite different from another situation in 
which near the maximum penalty is the appropriate sentence. 
That is where the judges vary in sentences and that is where 
prosecutors decide or decide not to proceed through the 
appellate routes in appealing sentences.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Cummins:</B> I would like some clarification from the 
member for Saskatoon-Dundurn. He suggests that there is a 
penalty for fleeing. I would suggest that there is also a penalty 
for using firearms in the commission of crimes.
<P>
	I may be wrong and I ask him for clarification, but it seems to 
me that rather than these laws being enforced rigorously or 
definitely, quite often these matters are dealt away with in the 
judicial process: ``If you'll do this, I'll do that'' so the law in 
fact has no force in its effect.
<P>
	I wonder if the member could perhaps clarify that.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bodnar:</B> Mr. Speaker, with respect to dealing these 
matters away, I am not familiar with that. I can tell him that I 
have worked as an assistant for 21 years. The way it is dealt 
away with is usually with a consecutive jail sentence. It is a 
question of how long.
<P>
<B>(1630 ) </B>
<P>
	On the question of using firearms in the commission of an 
offence, for the information of the hon. member there is a 
minimum jail sentence prescribed in the Criminal Code. It is a 
one-year minimum and it must be consecutive to any other 
sentence, not concurrent.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Benoît Sauvageau (Terrebonne):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
welcome this opportunity to speak to Bill C-8, an Act to amend 
the Criminal Code and the Coastal Fisheries Protection Act 
(force), tabled for first reading on February 4, 1994.
<P>
	I would like to start by emphasizing the need for providing a 
framework for the use of force, as indicated in the Criminal 
Code. There are two concepts in clause 1 of this bill that seem 
rather ambiguous.
<P>
	The first concept with which we have a problem is that of 
reasonable grounds. What are reasonable grounds? Do they 
depend on an individual's personal judgment? Good question.
<P>
	Two recent incidences are a good illustration of what I mean, 
and I am thinking of the Richard Barnabé case, where the police 
may have acted on what it felt were reasonable grounds, in a 
situation that did not necessarily warrant such action, and the 
case of three residents of Saint-Pierre-et-Miquelon who were 
accused of illegal fishing in Canadian waters, a case which 
fortunately had no serious consequences. The interpretation of 
reasonable grounds is therefore rather puzzling.
<P>
	The second concept we would like to see clarified, as it 
applies to the fisheries situation, is the interpretation of 
necessary force. Again, the individual's personal judgment is 
supposed to guide him in the use of force to the extent that he 
judges necessary. However, a stressful situation may affect 
one's judgment.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1325"> 1325 </A></B>
<P>
	As Hegel wrote when considering the principles of the 
philosophy of law, what is reasonable is real and what is real is 
reasonable. Hence this request for clarification of the concepts 
of reasonable grounds and necessary force.
<P>
	We in the Bloc Quebecois would also appreciate some 
explanation of the use of the term ``désemparé'' in the bill itself. 
The Petit Larousse illustré 1994 gives the following definition 
of the term, as it applies to the fisheries: ``Qui ne peut plus 
manoeuvrer, par suite d'avaries''. [``The state of being disabled, 
of being unable to manoeuvre, as a result of damage.''] This 
definition of the term as used in Bill C-8 would seem 
incomplete in the case of human lives.
<P>
	The importance of the precision takes a whole new meaning 
when you consider that the same clause says: ``-intended or... 
likely to cause death or grievous bodily harm-'' In the Bloc 
Quebecois we believe that human lives should never be 
endangered by the decision of a single individual responsible for 
enforcing the Coastal Fisheries Protection Act. We accept the 
principle of the use of force, but we must adapt it to the field of 
fisheries.
<P>
	Our amendment is intended to limit the use of force, in order 
to avoid any dangerous situation that could lead to an escalation 
of violence.
<P>
	The wording of our amendment bears some resemblance with 
a recommendation of a report from the Standing Committee on 
National Defence and Veteran Affairs, chaired by the Hon. 
Arnold Malone, and tabled in November 1990.
<P>
	The recommendation said, and I quote, ``-that research be 
conducted as a high priority into methods of stopping 
unco-operative boats on the high seas without endangering 
human life''. What happened to that recommendation already 
four years old?
<P>
	Second, I would like to stress the importance of attacking at 
the source the problem of poaching. But we must face the fact 
that we will not be able to do it alone, without the help of other 
countries. Negotiation efforts must be pursued with the 
international community.
<P>
<B>(1635) </B>
<P>
	If fishing outside the 200-mile limit hinders reproduction of 
fish stocks, the amendment to the Coastal Fisheries Protection 
Act will not solve the problem. Canada cannot legislate over 
international areas. Accordingly, negotiation remains the only 
possible avenue, hence the necessity of involving the 
Department of External Affairs.
<P>
	Therefore, the Bloc considers that the solution is to be found 
primarily in negotiated multilateral agreements providing for 
compliance measures by various interested parties. The 
<I>Concordia</I> incident proves that that kind of situation cannot be 
solved by the use of force but by precise and clear agreements 
between various interested parties.
<P>
	It should be recalled that in that precise case, there was no 
agreement in force between two sovereign countries, namely 
Canada and the United States. The ridiculously timid penalty 
given the master and owner of the <I>Concordia</I> shows the 
regulations' flaws. The fact is that Canada has to show clearly 
that it is determined to defend vigorously its sovereignty over 
Canadian waters. Now, as far as the concept of sovereignty is 
concerned, members from the Bloc Quebecois could most likely 
advise the Canadian government on the definition of that 
concept, even if it deals with Canadian waters, because we have 
some experience in that area.
<P>
	Still, if only multilateral agreements had to be negotiated, we 
could possibly find a solution to the problem in a very short 
period of time. But no, once more we are confronted with a 
problem of overlapping-we are sorry if we always seem to 
come back to that issue but that is part of the problem-not 
federal-provincial overlapping but, as I mentioned in my first 
speech on environment, overlapping within the federal 
government itself. As a matter of fact, three departments could 
not agree on a single solution regarding the environment.
<P>
	As for fisheries, and in particular in the present bill, four 
departments are trying to find a solution to a single problem 
which is, I admit, a big one.
<P>
	The Department of Fisheries and Oceans, the Department of 
National Defence, the Department of Foreign Affairs and, in this 
instance, the Department of Justice are all working to find a 
solution to the problem.
<P>
	This conflict between the various federal bodies goes back a 
long way. In fact, the same aforementioned report about 
maritime sovereignty, drafted under the chairmanship of the 
Hon. Arnold Malone and tabled in 1990, made this 
recommendation: ``The Committee recommends that the 
government institute a program of regularly exercising 
interdepartmental coordination procedures, particularly for 
emergency situations, with a view to identifying problems and 
reducing necessary consultation time. Such exercises should 
include all responsible individuals and their alternates''. This 
way, there would be no seven and a half hour delay before an 
emergency decision could be taken, as was the case in the 
<I>Concordia </I>incident.
<P>
	Any amendment would be useless if the various federal 
departments are not even able to co-ordinate their action, so this 
is a critical factor.
<P>
	In conclusion, we concur with the bill provided the 
amendment suggested by the Bloc is agreed to. I say again that I 
believe in a strict control regarding the use of force, as 
prescribed in the Criminal Code.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Brent St. Denis (Algoma):</B> Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the 
comments of the member for Terrebonne. Although he spoke 
mostly about the coastal aspects of the bill, I will direct a 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1326"> 1326 </A></B>
<P>
question to him on the broader  question of the situation faced by 
our enforcement officers in moments of crisis.
<P>
<B>(1640) </B>
<P>
	Unfortunately I was a victim of a gun crime many years ago. I 
would like the member to consider my question from the point 
of view of a victim or a potential victim and the relationship of 
the police officer at that point in time to the potential victim. If 
we put faith in our officers we have to accept that they face a 
very difficult decision in a crisis.
<P>
	Even though the questions of the hon. member for Terrebonne 
are very good, does he not feel it is better to start with something 
like this? As has been raised before, we have to build some 
history, some common law, as a result of this legislation. Are we 
not better to start from this point and build from here rather than 
leave our enforcement officers in what is now a very difficult 
situation?
<P>
	We have to stand behind them. We have to recognize that 
crime and violence are out of hand in some areas of our country 
in particular. Does the hon. member still feel this is a step 
forward even though he may not agree with every provision in 
the bill?
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Sauvageau:</B> Mr. Speaker, as stated by my colleague, my 
remarks were not directly linked to that part of the Bill that 
amends the Criminal Code and the Coastal Fisheries Protection 
Act and deals with necessary force.
<P>
	My comments were aimed at coastal fisheries protection, as 
he pointed out, and I took that opportunity to highlight our 
amendment stating that at no time should human lives be 
jeopardized when disabling or boarding a vessel. If indeed there 
is illegal fishing, we must find a way to disable the vessel, make 
the necessary arrest and bring it to port, without ever putting any 
lives in danger.
<P>
	My colleague, the Solicitor General critic, spoke earlier on 
the part of the bill dealing with the Criminal Code, and I will add 
that I am in total agreement with what he said. I will therefore 
refrain from making any comments on the Criminal Code, 
having chosen to address instead the issue of coastal fisheries 
protection.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Témiscouata):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the bill we are discussing does indeed have two parts 
but I will comment only on the second part, that is the Coastal 
Fisheries Protection Act.
<P>
	The bill seeks to give fisheries protection officers the right to 
disable a foreign fishing vessel or to attempt to do so, within the 
limits of the regulations. As my colleague said before, the 
expression ``to disable'' a vessel is what is creating a problem 
here because definitions vary from one dictionary to another.
<P>
	I checked the <I>Robert</I> dictionary and it says that to disable is to 
``make unable, unfit, ineffective''; hence, to disable a ship 
means to cause damage that will prevent it from manoeuvering, 
for example cause damage to the helm, the motor or other 
essential instruments. The purpose therefore is not to sink the 
ship but to keep it from causing harm or sailing away. So that we 
may be sure of the meaning of the term, the bill should include a 
definition of the word ``disable''; that way, there could be no 
confusion in the interpretation of the act.
<P>
	A foreign vessel under arrest could then be disabled if it were 
in flight. If, while inspecting the vessel or interrogating its crew, 
the protection officer discovered illegal actions, the owners and 
the captain of the ship could then be forced to face Canadian 
justice.
<P>
	We must admit straight off that foreign fishing vessels have 
been sailing for a long time in what are recognized today as 
Canadian territorial waters; they did so even before the 
discovery of Canada.
<P>
<B>(1645) </B>
<P>
	Therefore, they acquired historic rights which enabled them 
to obtain a permit to fish within Canada's 200-mile zone, 
provided they complied with the attendant regulations. Among 
other things, the regulations spell out the species that can be 
caught, the allowable size of the catch, where parties can fish, 
the need to keep a log, and so forth.
<P>
	Some foreign vessels are occasionally suspected of fishing 
illegally. The <I>Concordia</I> affair which occurred on December 11, 
1989, comes to mind. A US vessel, the <I>Concordia</I>, was fishing 
illegally in Canada's exclusive economic zone, on George Bank 
off the shores of Nova Scotia. Detected and photographed by a 
Canadian Forces Tracker aircraft, the <I>Concordia</I> did not respond 
to the Tracker's radio transmissions. It also ignored the 
Canadian Forces destroyer <I>Saguenay</I>, which it even rammed 
before retreating toward US waters.
<P>
	Back in Ottawa, as my colleague mentioned, External Affairs, 
Fisheries and Oceans, DND and the Privy Council needed seven 
and one half hours to consult with one another before giving the 
<I>Saguenay</I> permission to use force to stop the <I>Concordia</I>. In the 
meantime, the <I>Concordia</I> had plenty of time to take refuge 
outside Canadian waters. The owner and captain of the vessel 
were fined $9,000, considerably less than what they took in as a 
result of the illegal fishing activities.
<P>
	It is important for a country to protect its territorial waters. 
The Coastal Fisheries Protection Act now before Parliament 
gives fisheries protection officers the right to disable a foreign 
fishing vessel suspected of carrying out illegal fishing 
activities.
<P>
	In speaking to this debate, I want to draw the government's 
attention to the importance of having regulations that spell out 
clearly when and how force is to be used to disable a vessel. I 
realize that regulations to this effect are being drafted, but 
regulations are not voted on. In my view, it is important that 
these regulations be  tabled in the House prior to the adoption of 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1327"> 1327 </A></B>
<P>
this bill on third reading. If this is not possible, then the 
restrictions that go along with this power should be spelled out 
clearly in the act.
<P>
	Fisheries protection officers are being given this new power 
in an effort to halt illegal fishing by foreign vessels in Canadian 
waters. In the absence of any extradition provision with regard 
to fisheries, it is all too easy for a foreign vessel that has 
committed an offence in Canadian waters to escape scot-free by 
sailing out of the economic zone, keep its cargo and cash in the 
profits.
<P>
	As we have just seen, it is difficult to disable a vessel. So, 
notwithstanding the necessity to amend the Coastal Fisheries 
Protection Act, the government must continue to explore new 
ways of resolving the problem.
<P>
	For instance, it could negotiate bilateral arrangements with 
other countries to arrest on arrival at their home port the 
captains of vessels suspected of illicit fishing in Canadian 
waters. It could insist that deterrent penalties be imposed on the 
owners and captains of vessels contravening the regulations 
governing their fishing licences. In that regard, it should be 
pointed out that since 1991, the fine imposed on nationals guilty 
of illicit fishing is $100,000 in the United States, while in 
Canada it can be as high as $750,000.
<P>
	Finally, illegal fishing is not the prerogative of foreign fishing 
vessels. While pursuing ongoing efforts in the UN to ensure 
better protection for our resources through arrangements, it 
would be important that the Canadian government initiate a 
project to develop a national, if not international, code of ethics, 
the primary purpose of which would be to make everyone 
accountable and responsible for the conservation of our fishery 
resource.
<P>
	Fisheries management must be decentralized. The industry 
must assume responsibility for itself and regulate itself in terms 
of the enforcement measures or penalties to be applied to those 
who contravene the code of ethics. For example, the fisherman 
who exceeds his fishing quota one year could see his quota 
reduced the next year. For illegal fishing, his fishing licence 
could be withdrawn or suspended for some time.
<P>
<B>(1650) </B>
<P>
	The Bloc Quebecois supports this bill from the Minister of 
Justice. Nevertheless, this bill should include an amendment 
forbidding the use of force if the lives of the crew of the fleeing 
vessel are in danger. The door to the use of force which we are 
opening today must in no case be used to excuse blunders which 
could be committed by protection officers using the right given 
to them today.
<P>
	Canada must show its political will to enforce its 200-mile 
jurisdiction over its territorial waters. This alone justifies the 
bill today, although it is regrettable in some respects for moral 
and social reasons. Unfortunately, it seems that force is still the 
only language which some people understand, although it is not 
the most effective way to end illegal fishing practices. The aim 
of showing the international community that our country is 
determined to end these practices is quite laudable. However, 
the use of force is always risky. That is why the Bloc 
Quebecois's amendment is meant to limit the use of force so as 
to avoid unfortunate incidents.
<P>
	I hope that the government will consider this amendment, 
especially since there is no causal relationship between illegal 
fishing and the Atlantic fisheries crisis. The government must 
restructure the fishing industry and develop new commercial 
practices to promote underused species.
<P>
	Finally, we cannot stop illegal fishing practices without the 
other countries' co-operation. Negotiations with the 
international community should continue because today's 
amendment to the Fisheries Protection Act in no way solves the 
real problems of fishermen in Eastern Canada.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Hart (Okanagan-Similkameen-Merritt):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am happy to participate this afternoon because I have 
spent some time on the ocean off the west coast of Canada and 
have participated in the fisheries in the early 1970s. I would like 
to share some of these things, especially with members of the 
Bloc, this afternoon.
<P>
	Serving in the Canadian navy we had a very important role in 
protecting the 200-mile limit. It is important we understand that 
fish are a natural resource of Canada. We must protect our 
natural resources. As a matter of fact it is our sovereign right to 
do so.
<P>
	I get a bit upset when I hear people say: ``You have to be 
careful; you don't want to disarm or disable a boat because you 
might hurt the crew''. I have some problems with that. First, the 
person responsible for the crew is the captain of the ship. It is not 
the responsibility of the people trying to enforce the law of the 
country; it is the responsibility of the captain of the vessel to 
ensure the protection of the crew.
<P>
	I will use the analogy of a drunk driver for a minute. A man 
may sit in a bar and drink too much alcohol so that he is over the 
.08 level. Then he gets in his car and obviously is in 
contravention of the laws of Canada. Because he does not know 
the law does not make him not guilty; he is guilty under the laws 
of Canada.
<P>
	I would agree with the section of the amendment as far as 
disabling force is concerned. I have looked at all the things here. 
There is adequate warning. There are flags and flashing lights. 
All these things are very typical to communication on the high 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1328"> 1328 </A></B>
<P>
seas. It is very much the responsibility of the captain of the 
vessel to ensure the  crew remains safe. If they are breaking the 
laws of Canada then they must pay the consequences.
<P>
<B>(1655) </B>
<P>
	The last point I would like to state is that in our national 
anthem we sing: ``we stand on guard for thee''. It is our 
sovereign right to protect our resources and this must be done. 
This is a good example of things we should be undertaking.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Témiscouata):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I appreciate the comment made by the hon. member 
who used to be in the Canadian navy and had the responsibility 
of protecting Canadian territorial waters. It is imperative that 
the government protect its territorial waters. There is no doubt 
in my mind; however, we must not think that if we give the right 
to cripple a vessel, this responsibility will exclusively be 
assumed by the captain.
<P>
	Competition is very stiff; fishermen must earn a living; they 
must catch as many fish as possible in the shortest possible time, 
and then they must move on. But these people have permits after 
all. In my opinion-correct me if I am wrong-illegal fishing in 
itself is not an act of piracy. However, I think it is important that 
these measures be taken with a maximum of guarantee as 
regards the protection of human lives. In my opinion, it will 
never be worth risking a person's life to arrest someone who is 
fishing illegally.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The time allotted for the debate is now 
expired.
<P>
	Pursuant to Standing Order 38, I must now inform the House 
that the questions to be raised tonight at the time of adjournment 
are as follows: The hon. member for 
Notre-Dame-de-Grâce-Court Challenges Program; the hon. 
member for Provencher-Small business; the hon. member for 
Wild Rose-The Environment; the hon. member for 
Kamloops-Small Business.
<P>
	I understand there are no speakers left from the Bloc 
Quebecois, the Official Opposition, on this bill, nor from the 
government, except the hon. parliamentary secretary, who will 
conclude the debate. Consequently, two members from the 
Reform Party may speak on this bill. I have no objection. The 
hon. member for Wild Rose.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Myron Thompson (Wild Rose):</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today with mixed feelings in respect of Bill C-8. Although at the 
present moment I am leaning toward supporting the bill, I do so 
with some reservation.
<P>
	I am concerned that no police official in my riding has been 
consulted with regard to this change to the Criminal Code. 
Further, having contacted the superintendent of K Division in 
Red Deer, Alberta, to his knowledge neither he nor any other 
official representing the RCMP in Alberta has been contacted 
for input into this bill. This strikes me as rather strange when the 
news release with  this document states that it was derived from 
consultation with police officials all across Canada.
<P>
	I am also having difficulty deciding in my own mind that this 
change will strengthen the ability of the police officer in making 
the necessary apprehension of criminals. In fact I am looking for 
assurances that the legislation will do exactly that. However, my 
gut feeling tells me that this could possibly reduce the ability of 
the officer to do his job, primarily due to the loss of precedents 
over the past few years.
<P>
	In a nutshell, is the legislation for the good of the police or for 
the good of the criminal? I really cannot make up my mind what 
is the answer to that question. What was the motivation to bring 
in this legislation? Was it to make Canada a safer place for its 
citizens or was it brought about by pressure from special interest 
groups? They seem to have had a major impact on governments 
of the past and apparently are having an impact on the 
government of today.
<P>
<B>(1700) </B>
<P>
	If we were to talk to Canadians across the country, I am quite 
certain their feelings would be to strengthen the power of law 
enforcement. I am almost certain in their minds this legislation 
would not do that.
<P>
	My colleague from B.C. and fellow Reformers brought the 
attention of this House to three deaths which have occurred at 
the hands of killers who had their charges reduced to 
manslaughter because they were drunk and did not know what 
they were doing. Research proves these types of offences are 
quite high. Does this legislation address these types of 
problems? I am quite sure the answer is no.
<P>
	I am certain Canadians want to know when legislation is 
going to be put into place to stop or at the very minimum attempt 
to stop the killing of Canadians at the hands of first degree 
murderers out on day pass or early parole from this country's 
prisons. I have stated in this House I know of 23 killers who fit 
this category and have murdered 32 additional people and these 
are only the ones I know of. Over the last five years I wonder 
how many criminals have been killed during the process of 
arrest. I would guess the number would be significantly lower 
than 32. If that is the case, then where are our priorities? Are 
they truly for the victims and their families, or are they for the 
criminals?
<P>
	If this legislation is brought about to protect criminals, then 
let us wake up and do what the red book says. Let us concentrate 
on the victims for a change and truly make this country safer for 
its citizens. Taking away authority from the police is not the way 
to achieve this goal. If this legislation is going to do that then I 
would have to oppose the bill.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1329"> 1329 </A></B>
<P>
	In conclusion I want answers to the following questions. How 
many police officers have died in this country in the line of duty 
as compared to the lives of criminals lost? If more police have 
died then I would suggest this legislation must be geared toward 
protecting them. Is that the case? If not, then why are we doing 
something that may jeopardize our law enforcers even further 
while at the same time fattening the wallets of lawyers? I 
certainly hope that is not one of the motives for this kind of 
legislation.
<P>
	I am pleased to have had this opportunity to voice my 
concerns regarding Bill C-8. I will listen carefully to the debate 
to hear the answers from my colleagues to my many questions 
and concerns.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Cummins (Delta):</B> Mr. Speaker, I will be quite 
brief. I raised the points I wanted to mention while questioning 
other members.
<P>
	In preparing for this afternoon's debate I did talk to fisheries 
officers on the west coast who I thought probably should have 
been aware of any consultation which had taken place with the 
government before this bill was brought forward. My questions 
to them were the first ones they had heard on any change of this 
nature. Not only did I talk to fisheries officers in the field, I also 
talked to people with some authority in the department who 
should have been aware of the changes being talked about.
<P>
	The question raised by the member for Wild Rose is one which 
we must keep asking-what is the motivation for this bill? Is the 
bill there to make law enforcement more effective? Is it there to 
make the streets safer? Is it there to protect our police officers? 
Will it make them feel more confident when they go about their 
duties knowing that the force of law is on their side and that the 
authorities and their supervisors will back them up when they 
make the tough decisions they have to? That is where this bill 
falls down. The bill does not offer police officers, whether they 
are fisheries officers, city police or the RCMP, the confidence 
they need.
<P>
<B>(1705) </B>
<P>
	Police officers in this country are not like members of the 
Gestapo. They are our neighbours. They are our sons. They are 
our friends. They are not authoritarian figures by far. They are 
people committed to public service. Yet they are people who put 
their lives on the line more often than not. They are people who 
put themselves into very dangerous situations making sure that 
Canada is a better country in which to live. That is where this 
whole bill falls apart. It does not offer these people the 
protection they should get. It does not offer them the kind of 
encouragement they need to continue their duties. I find it very 
disappointing.
<P>
	It is difficult for us to imagine what it would be like pursuing 
someone down the dark alleys of one of our major cities or 
pursuing poachers in the dark of night along the banks of the 
Fraser River or in some isolated inlet on either the coast of 
British Columbia or Nova  Scotia. It takes a particular kind of 
courage to do that work day after day. These people need our 
support and encouragement.
<P>
	As I suggested earlier, if the government were truly interested 
in making the streets safer in this country, if it were truly 
interested in enabling law enforcement people to do the job 
Canadians expect and want them to do, we would be putting the 
onus on the criminal to stop. We would make it very difficult for 
a criminal to say: ``I am going to try to get away from this 
thing''. The penalties should be severe for those who do not 
obey the orders of police officers, whether they are guilty or 
innocent.
<P>
	The onus is on us to expect that other members of our society 
will stop when a police officer asks them to and leave the 
determination of their guilt or innocence to the courts. That is 
what it is all about. We as Canadian citizens must recognize the 
very basic fact of life that the onus is on us to obey authority 
figures and leave the determination of guilt or innocence to the 
judicial system which I have a great deal of confidence in.
<P>
	In conclusion I would like to say again that this law needs 
some work. We should be offering our police officers the 
encouragement they need. We should be coming down heavy on 
the criminal element that wants to escape the lawful requests 
and demands of the police authorities in this country.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Pierre de Savoye (Portneuf):</B> Mr. Speaker, the two 
previous speakers talked about law and order, and I am in favour 
of law and order. However, in the last few years, we have seen a 
number of police mistakes, like the incidents that happened in 
Montreal and Toronto. I am aware that, under most 
circumstances, the majority of police officers do their job in a 
manner that is beyond reproach and deserves respect. 
Nonetheless, in the events I am referring to, as an ordinary 
citizen-even if I am a member of Parliament today, I remain at 
heart an ordinary citizen-I still have this feeling, this 
aftertaste, that things were not done right.
<P>
<B>(1710) </B>
<P>
	Of course, to better understand a given situation, I must have a 
number of criteria, of limits. What should a police officer do 
under the circumstances that led to these mistakes? Did the 
police act correctly? Without limits or criteria, it would be 
difficult for me to appreciate the consequences of their actions 
and that worries me.
<P>
	On the contrary, if the limits are clear, if there is a definite rule 
to follow and if I am comfortable with this rule, like I am with 
the rule proposed in this bill, I will be in a better position to 
appreciate the behaviour of the police under these extreme 
circumstances. The police themselves may be in a better 
position to know clearly what society expects from them.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1330"> 1330 </A></B>
<P>
	As a result, I do not agree with the comments made by the last 
two speakers, but they could perhaps help me to better 
understand their position now that I have explained mine.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Cummins:</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank the hon. 
member. I hold him in high regard and appreciate the sincerity 
of his comments.
<P>
	To answer specifically from my point of view, the limits are 
quite clear. Referring to the events in Montreal and Toronto as I 
recall them the people involved were ordered by the police to 
stop and chose not to. That is where the problem lies.
<P>
	Somewhere society has the idea that when the police order 
someone to do something, it is all right to try to play cops and 
robbers and try to get away. That is where the problem lies. I do 
not know whether it is too much TV or too much publicity for 
those people trying to get away.
<P>
	I do not know what the answer is but that is the root of the 
problem. It is the people who flee. It is not the police officers 
ordering them to stop. We have to direct our efforts at 
encouraging people to have more confidence in this country's 
legal system. Maybe they are fleeing because they have too 
much confidence in it and know where they are going to end up. 
That may very well be, but that has to be where our efforts are 
directed.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Harold Culbert (Carleton-Charlotte):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
listening to my hon. colleague speak relative to Bill C-8, I am 
wondering whether he has read it and studied it carefully.
<P>
	My impression is that it very clearly gives those parameters 
he has mentioned. It sets the parameters for our policing 
agencies to go about their duties in a very responsible fashion. It 
leaves no question. It refers to reasonable.
<P>
	We have to interpret the word ``reasonable''. If one looks at 
the bill it follows through in trying to give the best explanation 
possible of what reasonable is which is, in using force that is 
intended or is likely to cause death or grievous bodily harm 
unless that person believes on reasonable grounds that it is 
necessary for the self-preservation of the person or the 
preservation of anyone under that person's protection from 
death or grievous bodily harm. It is pretty straight forward.
<P>
	I would ask my hon. colleague across the way if he feels that 
improves the situation we are in right now in which that police 
officer has that question in his mind. Now he has some 
jurisdiction to look at it to see if in his opinion at that given time, 
and it has to be opinionated because he is the only person who is 
going to be in that particular situation, it provides reasonable 
grounds.
<P>
<B>(1715) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Cummins:</B> Mr. Speaker, as I said before I am not a 
lawyer. My understanding from listening to people here this 
afternoon who are is that this law will be put in place and 
somehow or other the courts will interpret the law as it is read 
here today.
<P>
	The difficulty I have with this law is that it does not address 
the problem it purports to address, the problem of people fleeing 
from police officers when ordered to stop. I do not think it 
addresses that problem. I think it simply makes it much more 
difficult for the policeman who has to take action. If that action 
involves bodily harm or involves the death of an individual, it 
makes it much more difficult for the police to justify their 
action.
<P>
	It is very easy for us to sit here in this very safe environment, 
read the bill and say that it covers this and that problem and 
addresses this and that shortcoming. However, that is not where 
the action is played out. The action is going to be played out in 
some back alley in the city of Toronto or Montreal or, as I said 
earlier, in some dark corner of the Fraser River canyon or some 
place like that. This is where the whole bill falls apart.
<P>
	We should be offering our police officers more 
encouragement than this bill currently does.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Russell MacLellan (Parliamentary Secretary to 
Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I would like to thank all hon. members who agreed to 
partake in the debate today on Bill C-8. I would like to deal with 
some of the concerns as I understand the bill and to express my 
opinions as they relate to the legislation.
<P>
	First of all I would like to discuss some of the questions that 
were brought forward regarding the fleeing felon legislation, in 
particular police officers and criminals.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	After that, I would like to talk about fishing off the coasts of 
our country.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The member for Delta said that we really have to be concerned 
more with the safety of the police officers. This legislation is not 
meant to do everything in the criminal field to deal with all of 
our concerns.
<P>
	The member for Wild Rose said it is unfortunate that the first 
piece of legislation the justice department brings forward deals 
with reducing the power of the police.
<P>
	First, it does not reduce the power of the police. Second, the 
reason this legislation is coming forward now is because of the 
negotiation and consultation that has taken place over the past 
two years by this government and the preceding government. 
There was a lot of dialogue, going back to 1992. The 
consideration of this subject matter has gone on. The 
Department of 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1331"> 1331 </A></B>
<P>
Justice now feels that the time has come to put this legislation 
before the House of Commons. I think to delay it further would 
be totally unnecessary.
<P>
	It does not take away from the powers of the police. What we 
have is legislation that is overly broad in the Criminal Code. The 
current provision does not direct police officers to consider the 
danger posed by the escape of the suspect before using deadly 
force to attempt to prevent the escape.
<P>
<B>(1720) </B>
<P>
	It appears from the literal reading of subsection 25(4) that 
deadly force can be used to stop a suspect from avoiding arrest 
even though the suspect poses no risk of physical harm to 
anyone, including the police officer, provided of course that the 
escape cannot be prevented by reasonable means in a less 
violent matter.
<P>
	What we are saying here is that we are not risking the life of 
the police officer. We are not going to risk the life of anybody for 
whom the police officer has the role of protection. If it is felt that 
anyone's life or safety is threatened or grievous harm could 
come to that person, deadly force would be used. There are 
certain crimes which by their very nature would not pose a threat 
to the police officer or to the public if that suspect escaped. 
There would be other means of arresting that suspect.
<P>
	We are not letting anyone go. We are not endangering 
anyone's life. We are saying that the law as it is now is so broad 
that the police can use deadly force for any offence that they 
wish. That is not in the interest of society and, from the 
discussions I have had with the police, it is not in the interest of 
the police. Every time somebody who is suspected of a crime is 
shot, people automatically say: ``Ah ha, the police are gun 
happy. They just shot somebody for no reason at all''. That is 
often not the case at all. Maybe now and then, in a very isolated 
incident, a policeman or policewoman uses his or her firearm 
unnecessarily. Very seldom will a police officer even draw his or 
her firearm unnecessarily.
<P>
	I would be the last one to say that we are changing this 
legislation because police officers are using this section in the 
Criminal Code unnecessarily. They are not. They are being very 
responsible about the use of their firearms. There is no question 
about that.
<P>
	This law has been in the Criminal Code in this fashion for a 
long time and we feel the time has come to change it. We are not 
in any way trying to reduce the effect and the force of the police.
<P>
	The situation is that we have consulted with police officers in 
this regard. They feel that this provision in the Criminal Code 
should be changed. We also say that any doubt whatsoever is 
going to be given to the police officer. This is very clear in the 
provision as it relates to penitentiaries.
<P>
	It was stated by the member for Scarborough earlier today that 
only certain guards in penitentiaries are armed. The fact is they 
are armed for a reason. If there is an escape from a federal 
institution-not a provincial or municipal institution because it 
is not felt that escapees from there are going to pose the same 
threat as from a federal institution-the guard cannot by the 
very nature of the institution take the time to find out if this is 
one of the more hardened criminals or one of the less dangerous 
criminals. Because there are hardened criminals in that 
institution, the guard has the right to use his or her firearm.
<P>
	We have to look at this legislation. We have to look at it not 
from the point of view of changing it because the law has already 
been changed by the court decision. On April 26, 1993, the 
current subsection 25(4) of the code was ruled to be an 
unconstitutional violation of a suspect's section 7 charter right 
to life and security of the person. This was decided by the 
Ontario court in the case of R. versus Lines.
<P>
<B>(1725) </B>
<P>
	We have a charter decision in which the court said that if 
somebody has committed a crime and is fleeing, they can be 
shot. This very provision puts the life and the rights of the 
criminal in danger. I do not think anyone in this House would say 
that even suspects do not have rights under the charter. Every 
Canadian has rights under the charter.
<P>
	We do not want to see criminals escape. I agree with the 
member for Delta that it seems to be more involved now to test 
the determination of the police to make the arrest, and more and 
more people are thumbing their noses at the authority of the 
police. That in itself does not warrant the person being shot. We 
have to keep that in mind. We have to look first of all to the fact 
that public safety is our most important consideration. We have 
to look too at the role of the police officer. As I see by this 
legislation, the police officer is not having his or her role 
interfered with or handicapped in any way.
<P>
	I agree with members opposite that if that were the case then I 
too would have to look at this legislation in another light 
altogether. Because this is not the case, we have to make this 
change.
<P>
	What happens if, although it has not gone to the Supreme 
Court of Canada, this provision of the Criminal Code is 
designated as being unconstitutional in accordance with section 
7 of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms? Once that happens, 
effectively the provision is null and void.
<P>
	What we will have here is a provision which is ineffective if 
we do not make a change. By not making the change we are 
hindering the operation of the police because they do not have 
any guideline now. The existing guidelines have been 
determined to be contrary to the Charter of Rights and 
Freedoms. We have an obligation now to make this change, to 
take away the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1332"> 1332 </A></B>
<P>
grey area, and  to explicitly say in constitutionally acceptable 
terms what it is the police can do. That is all we are doing here.
<P>
	I think we owe it to the police and to society to do this.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Something else is really important here too. The member for 
Gaspé, for example, says that he wants to move an amendment 
to the bill. It is a good idea because the standing committee will 
sit soon, maybe next week. It will be appropriate to present 
amendments in committee, and I would like to assure the hon. 
member here that his amendment will be considered and I thank 
him for his interest.
<P>
	I do not promise that his amendment will be adopted, but it 
will receive our consideration.
<P>
	It is a really serious situation, as the last speaker for the Bloc 
Quebecois said. We have a serious situation with the fisheries 
off Canada's Atlantic coast.
<P>
<B>(1730) </B>
<P>
	In Atlantic Canada now, we have more than 45,000 
unemployed people. It is really serious and it is bad for the 
people of Atlantic Canada as well as for Quebecers, because 
there is really no more fishing now. We have a feeling that 
fishermen off the coast of other countries have the same 
problem. It is really necessary to have something, so that we can 
tell fishermen in Quebec and Atlantic Canada that there will be 
laws and regulations which will be applied in their interest.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	We have to do something to tell the people we know there is a 
problem with foreign overfishing. We are not changing the laws 
here. We are not bringing forward something that does not exist 
right now. We are putting this into what we are considering in 
Bill C-8.
<P>
	We are saying that we are not going to bring forward 
confrontation with foreign vessels. That is not the intention. The 
Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans 
outlined in detail the process we go through in confronting a 
foreign vessel. It is very detailed. Every chance is given for the 
master of the vessel to bring the vessel to a stop or to turn it 
around. Sufficient time is given for the crew to vacate a certain 
part of the vessel so that what has to be done will be done 
without endangering the lives of the crew of the vessel.
<P>
	If something is not done then we are telling the foreign fishing 
vessels to come in and overfish and make a clean getaway. That 
is not the message we want to send. It is getting far too serious 
for that right now.
<P>
	We do not want confrontation and it has not been done to date 
but we have to do something to enforce the fishing rules in our 
jurisdiction.
<P>
	The last speaker, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister 
of National Defence, has a great deal of experience and he was 
an admiral in the Canadian navy. He will give us some indication 
of how this can be done and how the Canadian government and 
the authorities would confront a foreign vessel.
<P>
	I want to thank the members of the House for their 
participation. We welcome all their considerations in 
committee. We welcome any suggestions they may have. We 
want to have a good hearing on this. We want to call some 
witnesses. We are not going to call an unlimited number of 
witnesses but we want to get good witnesses who can make a 
contribution. The minister will appear to answer some questions 
that members of the committee may have. We want to take this 
to committee so we can begin this study.
<P>
	I feel that there is a good reason for this legislation and we are 
going to aid the enforcement of our fisheries laws and 
regulations. We are going to give to the police officers a good 
provision that is constitutionally correct under which they can 
act. We are going to do this without hurting or inhibiting the 
security of the Canadian people.
<P>
	I think what we are doing with this legislation is in the interest 
of all Canadians.
<P>
<B>(1735) </B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Témiscouata):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I would like to thank the Parliamentary Secretary to the 
Minister of Justice for a very interesting speech, to which I 
listened very carefully. However, there was no mention of 
regulations. Could the parliamentary secretary tell us how we 
will deal with the regulations? Could he describe how we are 
going to proceed, just for my information? How does it work? 
The hon. member told us we would be able to table amendments, 
which would be considered in committee, but what about the 
regulations?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. MacLellan:</B> Mr. Speaker, there are under consideration 
right now by the minister of fisheries quite comprehensive 
provisions relating to the fishery on the Atlantic coast and in the 
Gulf of St. Lawrence which is going to have quite a sufficient 
effect on the fishery, its future and how we are going to deal with 
its problems.
<P>
	We are trying to deal with the foreign vessels fleeing the 
jurisdiction without getting into actual protection in other areas 
of the fishery.
<P>
	Because of the nature and the complicated aspect of the 
fishery considerations that the minister is now pondering and 
the time it is going to take to put the final package together, that 
will come a little later.
<P>
	I hope the hon. member can understand that we do not want to 
take a part of this away from the minister of fisheries because it 
is going to be a part of the whole package we expect.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1333"> 1333 </A></B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Pierre de Savoye (Portneuf):</B> Mr. Speaker, we 
appreciate the openmindedness shown by the hon. member, who 
said he would carefully consider the amendments put forward by 
the Bloc Quebecois, when the bill is referred to the Standing 
Committee.
<P>
	However, I would like to cast some new light on an issue 
which is important, considering the amendments we will be 
moving. Even though we want to protect our territorial waters 
from overfishing, we cannot prevent our stocks from leaving our 
territorial waters. If we were to legislate on that, we would soon 
run out of aquariums to detain the fish which would have 
ignored our legislation and our territorial limits.
<P>
	Moreover, outside of our territorial waters, we have no 
authority whatsoever to stop foreign vessels from fishing. And 
God knows those vessels come from all over the world! Since we 
cannot legislate on fish migration, all countries should agree to 
legislate globally on fishery resource management, because the 
fish stocks do not belong to one particular country. They do not 
belong to Canada nor to Quebec. They belong to the sea. And the 
sea, outside our territorial waters, belongs to everyone. This is 
why it is so important to pay special attention to the amendments 
we will put forward in the hope of seeing Canada and Quebec 
show some leadership in bringing the countries together to 
develop a better management strategy for this resource which 
belongs to everyone.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. MacLellan:</B> Mr. Speaker, that is a very good point. We 
cannot at this point deal with problems outside the Canadian 
jurisdiction.
<P>
	I would like to make one point that I think is very important. 
When Canada extended its boundaries to the 200 mile limit we 
were able to take in all of the Grand Banks off the east coast of 
Canada, particularly the east coast of Newfoundland, except for 
two little parts which we call the nose and tail of the Grand 
Banks.
<P>
	However, because of the nature of the terrain of the Grand 
Banks the fish conjugate on the Grand Banks. Once one goes 
past the Grand Banks into deeper water it is a different situation 
altogether.
<P>
<B>(1740) </B>
<P>
	We would like to assure that when fish leave the major part of 
the Grand Banks, which is in Canadian waters, and go to the nose 
and tail of the Grand Banks, some of them will gradually come 
back.
<P>
	What is happening is that foreign vessels are on the nose and 
tail outside Canadian waters in great numbers. Very few of the 
fish that go out there are coming back. The fish that go out there 
do not come back into Canadian waters. We feel we are losing a 
great deal of our fisheries resource.
<P>
	The member for Gaspé said that we should not tell other 
countries what kind of fish they should catch. If France wants to 
catch a small cod then it should be able to do that. However, it is 
not that simple. The fact is that if one catches a small cod then 
that cod does not grow up to be a big cod.
<P>
	Where does one stop on small cod? If one can catch small cod 
then why can one not catch all the small cod that go outside the 
Canadian jurisdiction? It really is a very serious question. There 
have to be rules and regulations on the catching of small and 
juvenile fish.
<P>
	We have to try to negotiate.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The Minister of Fisheries and Oceans is in Brussels right now, 
negotiating with other countries to try to reach an agreement on 
the section concerning the fisheries.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	If the minister is not successful then he will be developing 
other means of discussing this. He has stated to the House and to 
the country that this is a very serious question and he wants to 
find a resolution to it one way or the other. Negotiation is the 
preference.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Fred Mifflin (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
National Defence and Minister of Veterans Affairs):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I want to thank my hon. colleague, the Parliamentary 
Secretary to the Minister of Justice and the other members who 
have engaged in this discussion.
<P>
	The discussion has been certainly not totally one sided but I 
sense a predisposition to move in favour of Bill C-8. I want to 
speak on the bill generally and really amplify an aspect of this 
which is of great interest to me personally and to the area of 
Canada that I represent.
<P>
	To begin with, I appreciate and understand the excellent point 
that was made by my colleague, the Parliamentary Secretary to 
the Minister of Justice, that this bill in no way precludes or tries 
to restrict the use of force by a peace officer.
<P>
	As I understand it, it is merely attempting to clarify the 
position of peace officers following the judgment in the Ontario 
Supreme Court decision which basically declared that the 
current subsection of the relevant Criminal Code violated the 
right to life in the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.
<P>
	It is one thing for us to stand in this House and talk about this 
subject. It is another thing to imagine oneself being on the scene 
either as a peace officer or as the master of a vessel in a situation 
that requires the person to do something for which very few rule 
books are written.
<P>
	I am not coming down on one side or the other but I want to 
bring to members' attention and to remind the House that it is 
very necessary and important to these people who are pursuing 
their difficult duties in a time of crisis to have a framework in 
which they can operate that not only provides protection in the 
situation for  them but as well for the other party involved. In the 
case of the proposed legislation for a police officer, I have read it 
very carefully and I understand this is a modernized version of 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1334"> 1334 </A></B>
<P>
the Criminal Code which dictates the clear national standard on 
the use of force which is proportionate. I can assure members 
that as a philosophy my byword is co-operation instead of 
confrontation. However, when confrontation does occur then 
use that force which is proportional to the force required to 
achieve what it is one wants to achieve.
<P>
<B>(1745) </B>
<P>
	I suppose it is the antithesis of trying to kill a flea with a 
sledge hammer. One does not want to use too much force, 
otherwise one really prostitutes that force. One makes use of 
force that is not appropriate. In our society today with the crime 
rates the way they are and with the sometimes apparent 
disregard for our justice system, it is very important that these 
measures be discussed in the highest court in the land, the House 
of Commons.
<P>
	This bill does allow the use of deadly force by a peace officer 
or anybody lawfully assisting the officer. The situations are 
clear. The first is when the suspect poses a threat of serious harm 
or death and the suspect flees in order to escape arrest and when 
no other less violent means exist to prevent escape. If a peace 
office could chase a fleeing criminal and could wrestle him to 
the ground with a football tackle or would be able to use some 
other kind of appropriately lesser force than deadly force, then 
the police officer or the person assisting the police officer would 
be expected to do precisely that. This is the intent of the 
legislation as it is amended and clarified.
<P>
	The bill also does something else of personal and political 
interest to me. It includes an amendment to the Coastal Fisheries 
Protection Act to provide the authority for masters of vessels 
acting in their capacity to use disabling force against a fleeing 
foreign fishing vessel in order to arrest the master or other 
person in command of that vessel. My clarification right off the 
bat is that this is for a foreign fishing vessel and it will not be 
used against Canadian vessels.
<P>
	I have heard three speakers talk about the necessity for 
Canada, which is a great trading nation with the largest coastline 
in the world to have some pretty clear legislation on how we go 
about protecting the coast literal, or those resources that are 
available to those Canadians who depend on the sea and the 
coastline for their living.
<P>
	The act has not been as clear perhaps as those of us who have 
used it in the past and for those who would want to use it in the 
future would like it to be. At the outset I want to say that this rule 
applies in the case of a foreign fishing vessel that is to be 
arrested. I will say peripherally that the requirement on the high 
seas is not as clear as I have heard it discussed in the House. 
International maritime law is not determined in the way that 
civil or criminal law is. It is determined by precedent.  Certainly 
there are precedents for arresting foreign vessels on the high 
seas.
<P>
	I do not have the exact wording with me right now but I do 
know that recently at a United Nations conference the right of a 
literal country, or the country that has the coastline adjacent to 
the high seas, was discussed. It has a right, a duty and a 
responsibility on the high seas with respect to a straddling stock. 
The recognition of a straddling stock would certainly apply to 
the nose and tail of the Grand Banks as described by my hon. 
colleague, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of 
Justice, and does apply in this case. It is not as cut and dried as 
other members would have us believe. I do not want to get into a 
debate concerning the nose and tail of the bank at this time but 
clearly this could be a follow-up discussion at a later date.
<P>
<B>(1750) </B>
<P>
	I want to discuss that aspect of the legislation which permits 
the master of a vessel under the Coastal Fisheries Protection Act 
the action that hopefully will be legislated. The legislation says 
what can be done and when and under which circumstances it 
can be done. The government will, at a later date, following the 
passage of the bill, determine and put together regulations that 
will decide how it can be done.
<P>
	In the case of the Coastal Fisheries Protection Act and the 
amendment that is being proposed at second reading of this bill, 
the protection officer is justified in using disabling force under 
three circumstances. The first one is if the protection officer is 
proceeding lawfully to arrest a vessel, including the person in 
command of that vessel, if that circumstance also involves the 
master or the other persons involved taking flight to avoid 
arrest. Taking flight on the sea does not mean sprouting wings 
and flying, it means cranking up the engine room to maximum 
revolutions and trying to escape the chasing vessel. The third 
condition is that the protection officer has reasonable grounds to 
believe that force is necessary for the purpose of arresting the 
master or other persons.
<P>
	When I talk about the use of force among certain groups, they 
immediately think that we are going to bring out all the 
warships, mount a broadside and sink everything in sight. That 
is anything but the intention. Force is not used that way. I talked 
earlier about protecting force and to use only the minimum that 
is necessary.
<P>
	I recall in July 1985 when the Canadian navy arrested two 
Spanish fishing vessels. We did not go around shooting them up 
and Ramboing them, basically we used a loud speaker system 
and said: ``You are under arrest and if you don't stop we are 
going to have to consider escalatory measures''. Without going 
into the details, the finale of the exercise was that the two 
Spanish vessels had armed boarding parties put aboard them 
from the warship involved, HMCS <I>Athabaskan</I> I believe it was. 
These ships relented, succumbed to the arrest and were towed 
back to a Canadian port. The masters were  subsequently 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1335"> 1335 </A></B>
<P>
charged. This is an example where the use of force involved a 
loud hailer, a few threatening manoeuvres I suppose is a good 
way to put it, the stopping of the vessel and the sending across by 
boat of two armed boarding parties.
<P>
	All kinds of things are done to show force, but force that is 
proportionate to get the vessel to stop and arrested and taken 
back to port so it can be properly charged. I agree on the high 
seas it is going to be much more difficult and I would not expect 
people to go and do that tomorrow.
<P>
	I want to tell the House that when this government was elected 
on October 25, 103 vessels were on the nose and tail of the Grand 
Banks, and 72 of them were fishing. Today there are 39 that are 
engaged in any sort of credible fishing endeavour. There may be 
70-odd, I did not get the count for the day. But the point I am 
making-and please do not hold me to numbers-is that the 
numbers have decreased significantly. That has, in my opinion 
and in the opinion of others, been the direct result of the 
Minister of Fisheries and Oceans and the Prime Minister making 
it very clear that we do not intend to stand for foreign 
overfishing, where foreign fishing vessels from other nations 
plunder our stocks, either by using small mesh size, by 
disregarding quotas, giving themselves great quotas, literally 
vacuuming up the ocean of a stock that Newfoundlanders and 
Atlantic Canadians and Quebecers cannot catch because of the 
rules that we have imposed on ourselves, to say nothing of the 
fact that there are no fish to catch anyway. If we have to stand on 
guard quietly and watch our fish disappear under some rubric 
that we are not really allowed to go outside the 200-mile limit, 
this government is not going to stand for it.
<P>
<B>(1755) </B>
<P>
	The rules we are discussing are intended to apply within our 
jurisdiction. The parliamentary secretary has made that clear. 
However, these are rules that can be developed. After all, in my 
lifetime we have gone from a 3-mile territorial sea because that 
was the range of a cannon-ball. We went out to 12 miles because 
that was the range of high definition radar for an average size 
vessel in an average sea state. We are now out to 200 miles 
because that is where the resources are and we have technical 
detection devices and aircraft that can tell us what is in the 200 
miles. I do not expect to live the rest of my life with a 200-mile 
limit. I have gone from 3 miles to 200 miles so I can assume, in 
the interest of avant-garde international law, we may well go 
beyond the 200-mile limit.
<P>
	I want tell members how we can use this kind of force. We 
have our ship at sea and we are involved with a foreign fishing 
vessel that is fishing in an area where it is not supposed to be. We 
are told that this vessel is to be arrested. The first thing we do is 
make it clear to the vessel that it is under arrest. We go through 
all kinds of pain. We hoist international codes. We use our radio,  
flashing lights and, if we have speed advantage over that 
particular vessel, we do circles around it. We basically stand on 
our nautical head to do everything we can to make sure that 
vessel understands it is under arrest.
<P>
	If the vessel proceeds and ignores the order, we have to make 
it clear to the vessel that we must now ratchet up our force. 
Without going through all the measures, I suppose at some point 
a shot would be fired in the general direction of the vessel and 
eventually across the bow of the vessel. In an ultra necessary 
step, where force is absolutely necessary and where hours and 
hours have elapsed, at some point the captain of the arresting 
vessel has to make it clear to the vessel on which force now has 
to be used, a disabling force after hours of negotiation: ``We are 
now going to disable your rudder so get your people out of the 
stern of the vessel and we will give you an hour. Let me know 
when they are out''. The captain may not hear from the vessel.
<P>
	At some point we may have to fire a shot into the stern of the 
vessel to disable it. It is terrible stuff but necessary, that force 
which is necessary to disable the vessel to allow the arrest to be 
carried out. Hopefully that should be enough under regular 
circumstances to allow an armed party to be put aboard that 
vessel, a tow to be put together and the vessel to be towed back 
to a Canadian port where the master would be charged and duly 
put through the process.
<P>
	The importance of this legislation in allowing regulations to 
be developed by the government, to make it more clear and to 
buttress the determination of the government to take charge of 
foreign overfishing I cannot reinforce enough. I believe it is safe 
to say that this kind of legislation not only clarifies section 7 of 
the charter and responds to the Ontario court ruling which made 
some form of legislation necessary-and I am delighted to see it 
is already in our mandate-but it makes the change to the 
Coastal Fisheries Protection Act in such a manner that the rules 
and the intent of the government to masters of vessels involved 
in arresting foreign vessels that are overfishing are very clear, 
unequivocal and concise.
<P>
<B>(1800 ) </B>
<P>
	I commend the Minister of Justice and his parliamentary 
secretary for putting forward this legislation at such an early 
date. I commend all members of the House because the 
presentations I heard seem to indicate an understanding of the 
intent of the regulation. I was delighted there were indications 
on both sides of a good understanding of what was involved in 
the necessity to improve the Coastal Fisheries Protection Act. 
Certainly I saw a general predisposition on the part of all 
members to move forward with second reading to get the bill 
into committee so that we could have a good look at it there.

	The House resumed consideration of the motion.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ted White (North Vancouver):</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the 
hon. member for his speech which I found to be quite 
entertaining. At one point he was talking about following the 
offending vessel for hours and hours. I had the vision of being a 
third of the way across the Atlantic before the negotiations were 
finally over and we were going to get tough on this vessel that 
had broken the rules. Then I had the vision in which we said to 
the people: ``Everybody out of the stern because we are going to 
shoot you in the rudder''.
<P>
	I wondered what happens if the ship turns the other way? Do 
we then tell them: ``We are going to shoot you in the bow so 
everybody run to the stern?'' What if the people on board do not 
obey the rules that we ask them to obey? Does the member really 
think he is making practical suggestions?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mifflin:</B> Mr. Speaker, I could be flippant and say yes, I 
do; otherwise I would not have said that. I give the hon. member 
the dignity of a reply. I think he is trying to be funny as well. I 
want to tell him that deadly force is defined as a force that is 
intended or is likely to cause death or grievous bodily harm.
<P>
	I do not know the background of the hon. member. I would 
suspect it is as colourful as he would indicate. However, I am 
sure he would understand that basically at any time or at any 
place, humanity being what it is, most reasonable people would 
try to avoid the use of deadly force of one organization or one 
person against the other, particularly in the unwritten law of the 
sea, the unwritten law of mariners. It is the same law that 
basically requires a ship to go to the distress of another ship lost 
at sea or has lost a man overboard or something of that nature. 
We have seen many examples in recent days where this has 
happened.
<P>
<B>(1805) </B>
<P>
	Certainly as a mariner in my previous incarnation the use of 
force would be avoided as much as possible. One would not want 
to use deadly force. One may want to and have to harm a ship. 
One may want to destroy a rudder or the main engine of a vessel 
at sea, but the last thing in the world one would want to do is to 
be put in a position as a fisheries protection officer or the master 
of a vessel so engaged that would be to cause bodily harm.
<P>
	I am not sure what the hon. member meant when he said 
moving people from the stern to the forecastle or the forecastle 
back to the stern. The name of the game would be basically to 
vacate that area to which we would cause damage so that there 
would not be bodily harm to any people involved. Clearly that 
was the intent of that.
<P>
	With respect to carrying on for hours and hours I merely use 
that as an indication to try to convey to the House the situation 
that one would do almost anything to avoid this. One would 
make sure that the language was understood. One would make 
sure that the captain of the vessel understood it. Whether the 
time was as he said across the ocean, certainly that was not 
intended. It could take anywhere from one hour to ten hours and 
the vessel could be dead in the water while all this is going on.
<P>
	The technical aspects of that were purely intended as an 
illusory manner to indicate the difficulty one has in actually 
using deadly force at sea.
<P>

[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Yvan Bernier (Gaspé):</B> I would like to add a brief 
comment to what was said by the two previous speakers. Since I 
am not a lawyer, I have to admit that the parliamentary 
secretary's remarks helped me understand a little better the 
amendments proposed by the government.
<P>
	I also appreciate the fact that the government has taken note of 
the amendment I tried to propose today. I hope it will consider 
our position that the use of excessive force does not seem 
appropriate for the type of offense that could be committed by 
illegal fishermen.
<P>
	I am a bit concerned about the remarks of the last speaker who 
talked about the impact of overfishing outside the 200 mile 
limit, on the nose and tail of the Grand Banks. It scares me a 
little because I had said in my speech this morning that I wanted 
to be sure that the government would not use this legislation to 
lay the blame for the collapse of the Canadian fishing industry 
on foreign countries.
<P>
	I said it in my speech and I will repeat it, Canadians must 
examine their own fishing habits, they have to recognize the fact 
that they are part of the problem. As I mentioned this morning, I 
would like to remind hon. members that according to NAFO, the 
Northwest Atlantic Fisheries Organization, and its member 
states, including Canada as well as France, Denmark and the 
USSR, only 3 to 5 per cent of the Canadian biomass, of the 
Northern cod, flows through the nose and tail of the Grand 
Banks, that is through international waters.
<P>
	In this regard, I would like to be sure that we will not provoke 
foreigners because we have a difference of opinion with them, 
and that is what I fear. The last time someone believed he was 
right, he triggered off a series of actions he might have regretted 
afterwards. This example might be far-fetched, but this is to tell 
you how much I fear that we will attack foreigners because we 
believe we are right. I am, of course, referring to Saddam 
Hussein. When he indicated that he wanted to enter into Kuwait 
to do what he did, I did not agree, but he had a belief.
<P>
	I would not like us to take reprisals against foreigners because 
we thought we were right. We can get our message across 
without resorting to that kind of force. I understand from the 
remarks made by the parliamentary secretary that we are going 
in the right direction.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mifflin:</B> Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the point the hon. 
member has made. I am a little worried about the comparison 
that he made. I presume it was for the purpose of illustration. I 
appreciate the point he is making. I am not going to try to make 
any political hay out of it.
<P>
<B>(1810) </B>
<P>
	I would say in all seriousness that if there is a point we reach 
as a nation at which the livelihood of a large section of the nation 
is decimated by action over which we have control, I would 
certainly not have respect for a nation that would allow its 
people to be plundered and to take no action other than to give 
speeches at diplomatic tables. I for one do not intend to stand for 
that and neither does my government.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bernier (Gaspé):</B> Mr. Speaker, I will give a short answer. 
If ever there is an escalation in the use of force in this 
matter-and that is not how I understood the parliamentary 
secretary's remarks-I hope that at that time we can investigate 
or hold an emergency debate if required. But I would really like 
to hear Canadian biologists come and tell us what the actual 
impact of the so-called overfishing is. Certain candidates have 
based their electoral campaign on this, but I have never heard a 
biologist prove it beyond a shadow of a doubt.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mifflin:</B> Mr. Speaker, I tell the hon. member that we have 
had three emergency debates in the House on the subject. He 
would be aware that before any such action was contemplated 
there would be yet a further review of what all the biologists 
have told us already.
<P>
	As a member from an area that is interested in and very 
concerned about the same issue I am sure he too is following the 
activities of such organizations as the Fisheries Resource 
Conservation Council. It has been fairly clear in the advice it has 
given to the department, the government and other organizations 
so constructed and so intentioned.
<P>
	The point the hon. member is making is a valid one that I am 
sure would be taken into consideration. This is not an 
irresponsible government but a government concerned about its 
people.

<P>
	A motion to adjourn the House under Standing Order 38 
deemed to have been moved.
<P>
<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="COURTCHALLENGESPROGRAM">COURT CHALLENGES PROGRAM</A></H4>
	<B>Hon. Warren Allmand (Notre-Dame-de-Grâce):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, in the recent speech from the throne the new Liberal 
government promised to restore the court challenges program 
which had been cancelled by the previous Conservative 
government in 1992.
<P>
	The court challenges program was originally established by 
the Liberal government of Pierre Trudeau in 1978 and it was 
expanded in 1982. Its purpose was to assure that Canadians 
could enforce their constitutional rights before the courts.
<P>
	In 1981 we established a Canadian Charter of Rights and 
Freedoms which guaranteed certain basic rights to all 
Canadians, rights such as fundamental freedoms, equality 
rights, democratic rights, mobility rights, legal rights and 
language rights.
<P>
	It is one thing to have these rights guaranteed in the 
Constitution, but it is another thing to enforce these rights in 
court, especially against big government or big business. One 
needs the funds to hire lawyers over a long period of time, very 
often in appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada. Without the 
funds to enforce your rights in court, these rights become 
meaningless. That is why a Liberal government established the 
court challenges program: to provide funds to individuals and 
groups who had important constitutional rights to enforce, 
especially where a precedent was involved.
<P>
	During the life of the program the most important cases dealt 
with language rights and equality rights. In my constituency in 
particular there is great concern over the erosion of language 
rights. On several occasions there were important court actions 
taken against Quebec Bills 101 and 178 which were successful 
in knocking out repressive sections of those laws. There were 
similar actions in other provinces by francophones. The battle 
has not ended. There are still sections of those and other laws 
which must be challenged and citizens need help from the 
government to do that.
<P>
	I would like to know today when the government will bring 
back the court challenges program as promised in the speech 
from the throne. I want a clear commitment that it will cover 
court challenges to legislation which restricts or rescinds 
language rights.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Albina Guarnieri (Parliamentary Secretary to 
Minister of Canadian Heritage):</B> On behalf of the Minister of 
Canadian Heritage I am pleased to have the opportunity to 
clarify the scope of the court challenges program for my 
colleague from Notre-Dame-de-Grâce.
<P>
	As the hon. member mentioned, this government initially 
indicated its intention to reinstate the court challenges program 
in the red book and recently reinforced the commitment in the 
speech from the throne.
<P>
<B>(1835 ) </B>
<P>
	In fact the government is committed to not only the 
reinstatement but also the expansion of the court challenges 
program. In addition to language and equality rights the new 
program will fund test cases of national significance involving 
challenges to fundamental freedoms as outlined under section 2 
of the charter.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	I am pleased to reassure my colleague that the reinstated 
program will continue to support national test cases concerning 
federal and provincial statutes that come under sections 93 and 
133 of the Constitutional Act of 1867, section 23 of the 
Manitoba Act, 1870, and sections 16 to 23 of the Canadian 
Charter of Rights and Freedoms.
<P>
	The program will also financially support challenges to 
federal statutes, practices and policies under sections 15 and 38 
of the Charter or when an argument based on section 27 of the 
Charter confirms arguments based on section 15.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The minister hopes to have the new program operational early 
in the new fiscal year as he indicated to my colleague 
previously. As a result of the broad range of interests, 
experience and expertise that will be taken into account by the 
government, the Minister of Canadian Heritage is confident the 
program will be implemented as quickly as possible in a manner 
accountable to the government and the people of Canada.
<P>
<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="SMALLBUSINESS">SMALL BUSINESS</A></H4>
	<B>Mr. David Iftody (Provencher):</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise today to 
continue with some comments and questions I raised in the 
House a couple of weeks ago having to do with small business in 
Canada.
<P>
	We know that in 1993 small business bankruptcies reaped a 
heavy toll on the Canadian economy. Nonetheless, of one 
million businesses registered in Canada 97 per cent have 50 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1339"> 1339 </A></B>
<P>
employees or less, employing 40 per cent of the Canadian 
workforce. Of those, 35 per cent are located in western Canada. 
Certainly for my  constituents in Provencher small business is 
an important aspect of the local economy.
<P>
	In 1990 despite the difficult operating environment of small 
business, small firms with less than 20 employees filled the 
employment gap left by large businesses as they restructured or 
closed. In fact, smaller expanding and newly established firms 
accounted for virtually all of the net job creation during the 
recession of 1990.
<P>
	One of the principal obstacles to the growth of small business 
in Canada has been what is described as the credit crunch. 
Expansion into new global markets by utilizing new technology 
and advanced equipment occurs all too infrequently in Canada 
particularly in western Canada. Yet outside of its leading role in 
job creation and economic growth the significant contribution 
of small business to the economy is its ability to be 
self-financing.
<P>
	Long term debt of small business accounts for 25 per cent of 
business financing with government grants and loans less than 
one-third of 1 per cent. The credit applications of micro 
businesses or those with even a smaller number of employees, 
20 or less, I regret to report are rejected very frequently. 
However we know that in 1993 in particular most of the job 
growth occurred in this area.
<P>
	Outside of that obstacle one of the other things we face is the 
difficulty in providing the human resource capabilities and 
capacities to staff those young and emerging new firms which 
create jobs in Canada. We know that in Japan 96 per cent of the 
students graduate from grade 12 with at least one year of 
calculus while comparatively in Canada 30 per cent of our 
young people do not even finish high school. We are told by 
Statistics Canada that 36 per cent of our people have difficulty 
even with basic numerical and reading material.
<P>
	As employers in Canada not only is there a credit crunch and a 
deficit in terms of financing for small business but the young 
people and the human resources we need to staff those firms are 
lacking as well. I think we can compete successfully in Canada. 
We have the capabilities, the human resources and the 
infrastructure resources. I point particularly to my riding of 
Provencher and Atomic Energy of Canada that has been 
successful in applying its scientific research applications into 
world markets and really is second to none in the world.
<P>
<B>(1840) </B>
<P>
	My question, and I want to continue on this theme, is what is 
the government prepared to do to work with the Canadian banks 
in Canada to ensure that small business and people who are 
putting their lives, their resources, their homes and what they 
have on the line to run these small business, have access to 
capital and to increase the training in Canada for young people 
and in western Canada in particular?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Harbance Singh Dhaliwal (Parliamentary Secretary 
to Minister of Fisheries and Oceans):</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the 
hon. member for an excellent question.
<P>
	Let me just say, as the hon. member said, that small 
businesses create 85 per cent of the new employment in Canada. 
If the government can create the right environment, small 
business will take the lead in promoting more stable economic 
growth in western Canada.
<P>
	In the past too much reliance has been placed on using public 
funds to attract large corporations. This has encouraged a 
culture of granterpreneurship when we want to encourage 
entrepreneurship. We need to encourage co-operation among 
jurisdictions rather than competition.
<P>
	In a period of fiscal restraint, the government must work more 
effectively with the limited dollars available. This can be done 
by relying on the entrepreneurial talent of westerners and by 
working on the entrepreneurial talent and strategic partnerships 
with provincial governments and the private sector.
<P>
	To encourage small business that generate new jobs, the 
Minister of Western Economic Diversification directed on 
November 26 that the western diversification program focus its 
repayable assistance on independent small businesses, usually 
with less than 50 employees.
<P>
	Projects are now being assessed on the basis of their 
contribution to the strategic diversification of the western 
Canadian economy.
<P>
	To create the right climate for business, governments must 
work co-operatively and pool their efforts in implementing 
strategic economic initiatives. By working together and not 
duplicating efforts, we can save tax dollars and create new jobs.
<P>
	A recent report by the Calgary based Canada West Foundation 
estimated that the removal of interprovincial barriers could 
result in the creation of 28,000 new jobs across the four western 
provinces.
<P>
	As well, economic and administrative co-operation-I know 
my time is up, Mr. Speaker, but let me just conclude that there 
are a number of areas-
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Thank you very much. It was an 
excellent conclusion.

	<B>Mr. Myron Thompson (Wild Rose):</B> Mr. Speaker, it gives me 
pleasure to talk about this issue again under Standing Order 
37(3) regarding Sunshine Development in Banff National Park.
<P>
	Calling a FEARO panel to assess development of the Goat's 
Eye ski run in the government approved leaseholding area of 
<P>

<B><A NAME="1340"> 1340 </A></B>
<P>
Sunshine Village Corporation costing a loss of hope for jobless 
Albertans is a waste of taxpayers' dollars. Every step necessary 
for discovering the environmental impact of Goat's Eye ski run 
has already been studied and restudied since 1978. This  project 
received environmental assessment review panel approval.
<P>
	The formal notice of the Goat's Eye screening decision sent to 
Sunshine stated:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Environmental impacts predicted to result from the proposed development of 
Goat's Eye for skiing at Sunshine are either insignificant or mitigable with known 
technology as defined in section 12(c) for environmental assessment and review 
process guideline order 1984.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The minister should be aware that section 12(c) means the proposal may 
proceed or proceed with mitigation with no referral for panel review and under 
section 12(c) there is no need for a FEARO panel.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	The hon. minister stated that Goat's Eye was virgin territory. 
How can that be when this is one of the five areas in our national 
parks the government has allowed access for public skiing 
recreation?
<P>
	The hon. minister stated that Goat's Eye deserves an 
environmental assessment. May I suggest that she review the 
history of the project. She will find that an environmental 
impact assessment was completed by Gail Harrison, Canadian 
Parks Service, western region. Ms. Harrison found no evidence 
why this development should not be allowed to proceed. A 
regional screening committee concluded this development has 
minimal impact or mitigable impact consistent with EARP 
requirements in section 12(c).
<P>
	A three day conference including environmental 
non-government organizations studied the long range plan and 
initial agreement on the plan including the parking lot and the 
study was presented to the Minister of the Environment.
<P>
	In terms of the parking lot Bruce F. Leeson, chief, 
Environmental Assessment Sciences Division, Canadian Park 
Services, western region stated the parking lot could be 
developed without extraordinary environmental and 
engineering difficulties. We have successful experience with 
this kind of project.
<P>
	In July 1992 Canadian Park Services stated the project was 
mitigable under EARP guidelines order. A preliminary 
screening indicated the long range plan was doable within 
environmental constraints. In August 1992 the Minister of the 
Environment approved the project.
<P>
	Sunshine held an open house for the public to scrutinize the 
development. A majority of those present agreed with the 
proposal. The Federal Court in Vancouver upheld Sunshine's 
legal right to proceed with this development against special 
interest groups' intervention.
<P>
	Did special interest groups pressure government to change the 
legal procedure and rules Sunshine followed with success? Will 
special interests again overrule the legal process and have the 
government order a FEARO panel for every project special 
interests do not agree with?
<P>
	When will this government follow the wishes of the majority 
of Canadians?
<P>
	May I remind the minister that two out of three notices 
received when the government called for the redundant public 
notice favoured completion of Goat's Eye. May I again remind 
the minister that a redundant FEARO review wastes taxpayers' 
dollars and prevents unemployed Albertans from having jobs on 
construction which could get going immediately. Then there 
would be ongoing operations that would create long term jobs 
which fits right down the alley of the red book.
<P>
	Why would this minister continue to put a stop to this 
particular item? Calling a FEARO panel on this issue is a 
contradiction of 12(c) of the guidelines the minister states the 
government wants to uphold.

<P>
	<B>Ms. Albina Guarnieri (Parliamentary Secretary to 
Minister of Canadian Heritage):</B> Mr. Speaker, on behalf of the 
Minister of Canadian Heritage, I am pleased to give additional 
information concerning the question of the hon. member for 
Wild Rose on the development of Sunshine Village.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	As the guardian of our national parks and historic sites system 
Canadian Heritage is committed to the continued protection of 
our national heritage. Protection of heritage resources is 
fundamental to their continued use and enjoyment by present 
and future generations. As Canadians we must do all we can to 
ensure that any development within a national park is respectful 
of our natural heritage.
<P>
	The Sunshine lease covers 918 hectares of federal crown land 
in Banff National Park. Parts of the ski area are located in a 
highly environmentally sensitive alpine meadow.
<P>
	Following public review of the application for the Goat's Eye 
permit phase II we have found that there is significant concern 
about the impact of the Goat's Eye project on the environment 
and that the Goat's Eye development and the 1992 plan are 
indeed closely related. As a consequence the Minister of 
Canadian Heritage referred both development proposals to the 
Minister of the Environment to establish an environmental 
review panel.
<P>
	The review of Sunshine's proposal is following the legislated 
environmental assessment and review process. There are legal 
requirements to respond to scientific deficiencies and public 
concern with the present proposal.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="1341"> 1341 </A></B>
<P>
	Environmental assessment has been key to the development 
that has already occurred at the ski hill. In fact much of the data 
collected earlier can be used in the current evaluation. We will 
continue to be mindful of our responsibilities as managers of 
Canada's precious natural treasures.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> No one is here to speak on the final 
item so we will adjourn.
<P>
	Pursuant to Standing Order 38(5) the motion to adjourn the 
House is now deemed to be adopted. The House stands 
adjourned until tomorrow at ten o'clock pursuant to Standing 
Order 24(1).
<P>
	(The House adjourned at 6.48 p.m.)
