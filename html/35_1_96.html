	<B>Mr. Nelson Riis (Kamloops):</B> Mr. Speaker, Captain Barry 
Woods, the Canadian captain of Korean Air flight 2033 which 
crashed August 10, and who as a result of his efforts saved all 
152 passengers and eight crew, was being held by the South 
Koreans. This morning it was announced that he has been 
released and allowed to return to Canada to his wife and family.
<P>
	On behalf of the family, I express our appreciation to the 
Minister of Foreign Affairs, not only for his personal efforts but 
for the efforts of his department both here and in South Korea for 
the extraordinary work that has made this reunion possible. 
Again, on behalf of the family I say thank you very much to the 
minister.

Development)</B> moved that the bill be concurred in.
<P>
	(Motion agreed to.)
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> When shall the bill be read the third 
time? By leave, now?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Irwin</B> moved that the bill be read the third time and 
passed.
<P>
	He said: Mr. Speaker, I do not believe this is a very 
contentious bill. It has all-party support, therefore I will be 
brief. It is more in the line of housekeeping than substantive 
change to anything being done in that area. This is the member's 
area. I remember that from the last round of speeches.
<P>
	I would like to begin by thanking hon. members for 
supporting this bill at second reading and at committee. The 
support of members for the bill guarantees longer term benefits 
and stability to dozens of individuals, families and businesses 
associated with the Norman Wells project.
<P>
	Bill C-25 will accomplish two basic objectives. First, it will 
extend existing jobs, create new employment and business 
opportunities. Second, it will ensure responsible management of 
one of Canada's most important producing fields.
<P>
	As hon. members are aware, Bill C-25 will allow production 
from the massive Norman Wells oil fields to continue beyond 
the year 2008 and possibly to the year 2020. Without this 
extension the community of Norman Wells would suffer 
economically since it is dependent on the oil industry to a 
significant degree.
<P>
	There is an important human element to this legislation. We 
are talking about maintaining existing jobs, creating new jobs in 
a region of Canada with few economic alternatives. We are 
talking about continuing a way of life and a source of income for 
families that have depended on the Norman Wells project for 
many years.
<P>
	Information gathered from prolonged production and 
advanced technology demonstrates the extent of the field should 
be redefined and the expiration date should be extended to 
capture the full productive capability of the field.
<P>
	The National Energy Board conducted an independent review 
of Imperial Oil's assessment. It has corroborated the conclusion 
that the fringe areas of the oil field extend beyond the 1944 
boundaries as well as the corporation's projections on the 
remaining production life beyond 2008.
<P>
<B>(1005 ) </B>
<P>
	It is incumbent upon the government as the steward of 
northern resources on behalf of all Canadians to ensure that 
Norman Wells field is fully developed. The extension and 
expansion of the proven area agreement will accomplish this 
strategic goal.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6072"> 6072 </A></B>
<P>
	All Canadians stand to win from the full development of the 
Norman Wells field. The benefits will be most obvious in the 
north and in Alberta where most of the money that supports the 
production and operation is spent. Members will be happy to 
know, Mr. Speaker, that the money is spent in your home 
province.
<P>
	Taxpayers across Canada will gain something from the return 
on the government's one-third investment in Norman Wells. 
This is expected to bring the government millions in additional 
revenues after 2008. As well, the government will receive 
millions of dollars in royalty payments as a result of the 
extension. These two revenue sources will improve the 
government's overall financial situation and ease some of the 
burden on taxpayers.
<P>
	I am pleased to note that a share of the royalties from Norman 
Wells will also go to the aboriginal people of the area under the 
terms of the land claim settlement agreements. This money will 
be used by the aboriginal beneficiaries to improve conditions in 
their communities, increase economic development initiatives 
and generally to build a better future.
<P>
	Finally, extending the production day for Norman Wells will 
also revitalize industry interest in the north, particularly as land 
claim settlements create certainty to open new areas for 
exploration and development.
<P>
	By approving Bill C-25 we will be sending a clear message 
that the Canadian north is an attractive area for investment. 
There are many arguments in favour of Bill C-25 and the 
continued production of the Norman Wells oil field. As far as I 
am aware there are no meaningful arguments against the project 
and I think members of the House agree.
<P>
	With this in mind I urge my hon. colleagues to once again 
demonstrate their support for the bill so that it can be referred to 
the other place and be quickly promulgated into law. I know that 
the oil company involved has been waiting patiently for several 
months for this bill to go through the House and the other place. 
They are ready to keep on working. I do not think there is any 
disagreement in the House on this bill.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. René Canuel (Matapédia-Matane):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is 
my pleasure today to speak on Bill C-25. Although this bill 
represents only a minor change to the Norman Wells oilfield, it 
is a change of no small consequence.
<P>
	The purpose of this bill is to exclude the Norman Wells 
Amending Agreement about to be signed from the application of 
the Canada Petroleum Resources Act. In order to understand the 
reason for this amendment, it is necessary to go back and 
examine the history of this oil well. It was discovered in 1919 
and drilling operations began in 1920.
<P>
	The site's distance from markets and the economic crisis of 
the 1930's were unfavourable to the development of the early 
wells. Extraction and refining were limited to meeting local 
needs. World War II led to renewed exploration and the 
construction of a pipeline to Whitehorse. The end of the war in 
1945 brought a halt to operations, which had grown from 100 
barrels a day in 1940 to a production ranging from 1,500 to 
25,800 barrels daily.
<P>
	In 1944, the government of Canada signed an agreement with 
Imperial Oil to ensure the development of the Norman Wells 
field. In 1966, over 2,000 barrels of oil were being produced 
daily, primarily for shipment to locations in the Mackenzie 
Valley, the Arctic coast and DEW line radar stations.
<P>
<B>(1010) </B>
<P>
	In 1974, with 54 producing wells, production was 2,738 
barrels of oil daily and 4.9 million cubic feet of gas. In 1981, 
Cabinet allowed Esso Canada to increase its production to 
25,000 barrels of crude, which were sent by pipeline to Zama in 
Alberta.
<P>
	Since then, more than 200 injection and producing wells have 
made Norman Wells the fourth largest producing oil field in 
Canada. The first delivery to the south took place in April 1985 
through a 868 kilometer pipeline, 65 years after the discovery of 
the field.
<P>
	The 1944 agreement gave exclusive drilling and mineral 
prospecting rights and privileges for three 21-year periods. The 
agreement also established the boundaries of the oil field. As I 
said earlier, the agreement expires in the year 2008.
<P>
	The Canadian government holds an interest in the project 
equivalent to a third of the value of production, less a third of all 
production and development costs, as well as management 
costs. Esso also undertook to pay five per cent in annual 
royalties on the other two thirds of its production.
<P>
	In 1992, production rose to 12.1 million barrels of oil, 
representing profits of 50 million for the government. The 
drilling program undertaken in 1984 and new technologies have 
made it possible to drill horizontal wells, and at the same time to 
produce the oil located at the boundaries of the field 
economically.
<P>
	The new technologies have also revealed that it would be 
possible to work this field until the year 2020 if its boundaries 
were extended.
<P>
	The National Energy Board has approved the expansion of the 
field to include the outlying area for the purpose of oil recovery 
in that area. This is when the Canada Petroleum Resources Act 
comes into play. This act provides for submissions to be made 
regarding issuance of production interests.
<P>
	In view of the fact that the outlying area is of no use to other 
producers, especially considering the associated costs, it be-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6073"> 6073 </A></B>
<P>
comes necessary to amend the act to allow the  extraction of 
petroleum in that area not covered by the 1944 agreement.
<P>
	It is important to consider at this point how other stakeholders 
might view this expansion of the Norman Wells oil field.
<P>
	The Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers declared 
itself in agreement with the proposed change to Norman Wells 
boundaries because of the very special circumstances of the 
case. However, the Association indicated this change was not to 
be construed as a precedent with regard to future issuance of 
interests.
<P>
	As for the native people, they have given their consent to the 
project in March 1994 on one condition: that the bill respecting 
the Dene and Métis land claims settlement come into force 
before the petroleum resources legislation be amended.
<P>
<B>(1015) </B>
<P>
	This condition was met and the Bloc Quebecois is quite 
pleased that the government respected the wishes of the natives 
peoples on this issue. Such a departure from its old ways reflects 
a new course that should be maintained in the future.
<P>
	Exploring the new area covered in the Norman Wells 
Amending Agreement to be signed in 1994 seems, on the face of 
it, like it could benefit all the communities involved. For one 
thing, it will allow Imperial to invest over $30 million in a 
development program, $10 million of which will be spent 
directly in that northern area. In addition, 65 direct jobs will be 
created, 40 of these for northeners, as well as many indirect jobs 
in the service industry and other areas.
<P>
	The development project includes a $6 million contract for 
drilling equipment. The drilling contract was awarded to a 
profit-sharing company owned by the Dene and Métis and 
Imperial. As new technologies will be developed regarding 
horizontal wells, this company will acquire the necessary 
expertise to participate in other drilling jobs. You are also 
looking at some long term investments, particularly in the use of 
enhanced oil recovery technologies.
<P>
	We are talking about investments of up to $100 million, 
depending on the exploratory period in that particular oil field. 
This bill appears to accommodate both the oil industry and the 
native communities that depend on it for their livelihood. It is 
also important that the federal petroleum resources legislation 
remain strong with regard to the future issuance of operating 
interests. As the Official Opposition critic for natural resources, 
and after discussion with my colleagues, I will not vote against 
this bill and I do hope it will pay the dividends it seems to be 
promising.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. David Chatters (Athabasca):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased 
to speak to this bill today, the first bill that I will be able to speak 
to in my new capacity as Reform Party  critic for oil and gas 
within the Department of Natural Resources.
<P>
	Bill C-25 addresses an issue in an area of Canada I am quite 
familiar with, having been involved in the drilling of several 
wildcat wells in the Norman Wells field fringe area. Bill C-25 
contains a minor amendment to the Canadian Petroleum 
Resources Act in order to exempt the Norman Wells amending 
agreement which will now be expanded to include the additional 
lands which are under the jurisdiction of that act.
<P>
	Although this bill deals with a minor wording change it is 
important that this bill pass in order to exclude the Norman 
Wells agreement from the Canadian Petroleum Resources Act so 
the governor in council can proceed with its action to extend the 
boundaries.
<P>
	At the risk of being repetitive I would like to talk briefly about 
the history of this oil field, discuss the necessity for this bill and 
talk about the positive actions the governor in council will be 
taking to extend the life of this field.
<P>
	There is a long history leading up to this current amendment. 
The first oil well was drilled in Norman Wells in 1920. Since 
then it has grown to be the fourth largest producing field in the 
country. In 1944 Imperial Oil and Canada signed the Norman 
Wells proven area agreement which included just under 3,300 
hectares within its boundaries.
<P>
	When the Canadian Petroleum Resources Act came into force 
the Norman Wells proven area already covered by legislation 
was exempted from the new act. Because of this bill before us 
today subsequent renewals and expansions will be similarly 
exempted.
<P>
	Since the boundaries of the Norman Wells field will be 
changing to include areas of new production some exemption 
from the Canadian Petroleum Resources Act is necessary.
<P>
<B>(1020 ) </B>
<P>
	It is important to note that the original Norman Wells 
agreement was signed before the Canadian Petroleum Resources 
Act came into effect. The new land that will be included in the 
boundary change to the Norman Wells field is the land that 
would normally come under the Canadian Petroleum Resources 
Act. This means that without an amendment exploration and 
production licences on these new lands would have to go to an 
open bidding process. This amendment is necessary to provide 
security of tenure for Imperial Oil and allow for the renewed 
investment and enhanced recovery techniques in this production 
field.
<P>
	This amendment will also provide for one-third ownership in 
the production of these new areas for Canada.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6074"> 6074 </A></B>
<P>
	In addition to the expansion of the field this amendment 
allows for another initiative to take place to extend the life of 
this field. This is the decision by the governor in council to 
extend the licence of Imperial Oil on the Norman Wells field 
to the year 2020.
<P>
	There have been advances in industry extraction techniques. 
Imperial Oil in the Norman Wells field has pioneered and 
perfected much of this new technology. It was here at Norman 
Wells, because much of these reserves lay below the Mackenzie 
River, that directional and later horizontal drilling have been 
developed and are now used all over the world. The technology 
of building islands in a water body that freezes and thaws in the 
spring when the ice goes out was also developed here and later 
used in the Mackenzie Delta and the Beaufort Sea.
<P>
	Other techniques of well workover for production 
enhancement such as water and gas flooding, formation 
fracturing and acidization have also been developed in good 
measure in this field. They have made Canada a world exporter 
of petroleum production technology. They have allowed us over 
the last 20 or 25 years to increase the recoverable reserves in 
Canada's conventional oil fields by up to 15 per cent, preventing 
the long predicted decline in conventional crude oil production.
<P>
	Because of these advancements in technology they now 
believe that the Norman Wells field will be productive well 
beyond the original date. Therefore it is important that the 
governor in council proceed with extending this licence so that 
as much oil as possible can be extracted in a realistic timeframe.
<P>
	With this bill allowing for the Norman Wells boundaries to be 
extended and the order in council decision to extend Imperial 
Oil's licence, Imperial Oil will be given the security of tenure it 
needs for long term planning and control of overhead costs. This 
will make this field economically viable for a much longer 
period.
<P>
	It has been assured that there is time to realize a return on 
major investments in new technology. These investments are 
essential to maximizing the production from this field.
<P>
	With the extension of the boundaries and licences, Imperial 
Oil will commence a $30 million drilling program. This drilling 
program will be undertaken mostly in the expanded proven area; 
more specifically, 12 new wells, four for water injection and 
eight for production, drilled along the field limits of the new 
boundaries. About one-third of the money, $10 million, will be 
spent directly in the north. Most of the remaining $20 million 
will be spent in my home province of Alberta.
<P>
	I would hope this is an indication that this government 
realizes the importance of providing our resource based 
industries with predictability and stability in policy 
environment. If this government starts sending signals to the 
private sector that it is safe to make long term investment plans, 
it will lead to economic growth and the  creation of far more 
permanent jobs than government can hope to achieve through 
any temporary government initiated make work projects.
<P>
	This amendment is good for Imperial Oil because it provides a 
stable planning environment. It is good the Sahtu Dene and other 
local residents because they can rely on employment 
opportunities and a cash infusion into the local economy for 
many more years. It is good for the Canadian people because it 
will generate additional oil revenues and royalties.
<P>
	From my perspective the only thing objectionable about this 
bill is that in spite of the fact that no party could or did object to 
this initiative, it has taken over two years to get this simple 
initiative through this cumbersome, unresponsive process.
<P>
	Let me and my party affirm our support for this bill and 
encourage all other members of this House to do so as well.
<P>
<B>(1025 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Nelson Riis (Kamloops):</B> Mr. Speaker, I want to join 
with others in support of this bill, recognizing as the previous 
speaker has indicated that this amendment will give recognition 
for technological development by Imperial Oil. It will be good 
for Imperial Oil. It will be good for the Sahtu Dene and Metis 
land claims settlement act process.
<P>
	The Dene in the area will benefit directly in terms of wealth, 
particularly with the largest contract involved, $6 million, and a 
conditional tender given to Shethah Drilling Ltd., a Dene, Metis 
and Imperial Oil joint venture. This bodes well in terms of future 
developments in the north and throughout Canada generally.
<P>
	Also, as the previous speaker has indicated, the people of 
Canada will benefit from this resource in two ways, through the 
normal royalty process and also through profit sharing. It seems 
to me this marries the federal government, the people of Canada, 
Imperial Oil of Canada and the First Nations people of the north. 
This is an excellent model on which further northern 
development ought to be based.
<P>
	I had a number of questions in terms of what this bill would 
do. I want to indicate my appreciation to the minister who, with 
his associates, clarified some of these. For example, I was not 
certain whether the Sahtu Dene and Metis land claims 
settlement act had been proclaimed. This was a condition that 
they had for their support. I was told that has now taken place.
<P>
	There was concern also because of the new technology 
involved. The previous speaker indicated that new technology 
has been developed in this part of Canada, particularly with 
horizontal drilling to avoid sensitive and fragile ecological 
areas. Quite frankly this is good technology that will help 
development throughout other parts of northern Canada and 
throughout similar environmentally and ecologically sensitive 
parts of the world.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6075"> 6075 </A></B>
<P>
	The question was whether as a result of the increased oil flow 
and the horizontal drilling technique this would influence the 
royalty system. I have been assured by the minister it will not. 
The second question was whether there will be ongoing 
environmental studies watching this new process as a result of 
the horizontal drilling that is going on. Again the minister 
indicated that the National Energy Board and other agencies 
will actually be monitoring this project in terms of 
environmental concerns.
<P>
	Also, I wanted to confirm again in terms of precedent setting 
that this agreement will continue to give one-third of the profits 
to the people of Canada. After all, we would appreciate that this 
resource belongs to the people of Canada and they ought to share 
directly in its development. Again, that has been confirmed.
<P>
	This $30 million drilling program producing eight productive 
wells will not only bring job opportunities to the residents of the 
area which is certainly needed, but will benefit Canada in the 
ways I have already mentioned.
<P>
	I want to say on behalf of my colleagues that we will be 
supporting this bill enthusiastically. I do want to share the 
concern raised by the previous speaker that such a 
straightforward piece of legislation would take so long. We have 
been watching this inch its way through the parliamentary 
process. It says something about the way we deal with business 
here. Perhaps it will add to the changes that will expedite 
business, particularly something which is so straightforward.
<P>
	However, I suppose the quid pro quo would be the concern 
with the Sahtu Dene and Metis land claims settlement act to get 
their support on this. That took perhaps more time than we had 
anticipated.
<P>
	Overall I think the point was well taken. The process here is 
cumbersome at best and something we must all strive to achieve 
is expediting the passing of legislation in the future. The world 
is changing quickly around us and we have yet to get this place 
up to speed.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Loney (Edmonton North):</B> Mr. Speaker, it gives 
me great pleasure to speak in favour of this important bill. While 
it represents a small amendment, Bill C-25 will have important 
ramifications for Norman Wells and other northern 
communities. As my colleague, the Minister of Indian Affairs 
and Northern Development, has outlined, two important 
objectives underlie this bill.
<P>
	First, Bill C-25 will ensure the responsible management of an 
important natural resource. We have heard in earlier debate how 
this legislation offers sound resource management. I am sure 
most members of this House will agree that such measures are 
important to our resource base.
<P>
<B>(1030) </B>
<P>
	Let us turn to the second objective of Bill C-25, the creation 
of a stronger northern economy. Passage of this legislation 
offers the sustainment and development of employment and 
business opportunities. I believe that the realization of this 
objective alone is impetus for this legislation.
<P>
	A bit of history is necessary in order to fully appreciate the 
economic benefits the Norman Wells oil field has brought to the 
north and those it could yet bring with the passage of this 
legislation.
<P>
	In 1944 the Canadian government entered into an agreement 
with Imperial Oil to develop the oil field at Norman Wells in the 
Mackenzie Valley. The proven area agreement that was adopted 
set boundaries and a production limit for the field.
<P>
	At the time it was predicted that the field would be productive 
until the year 2008 at the latest, but with today's more 
sophisticated technology we know that the Norman Wells oil 
field has a much longer productive life. In fact, it is expected to 
remain productive until at least 2020.
<P>
	Technological advances over the 50 years have also led to a 
more advanced knowledge of the extent of the oil pool at the 
Norman Wells area. However, it has been shown that a small part 
of the pool lies outside the original proven area boundaries. As 
hon. members know, Bill C-25 extends the proven area 
boundaries to include all the proven reserves.
<P>
	What does all this mean for the people of Norman Wells and 
other northern communities? The bottom line is that it means 
greater economic stability and growth. The Norman Wells 
project injects millions of dollars into the northern economy 
each year.
<P>
	Over 50 companies in Norman Wells and other northern 
communities receive a substantial amount of business directly 
from the oil project. This says nothing of the spinoff business 
generated for those and other companies.
<P>
	For a better appreciation, consider for a moment how 
businesses would be affected by reduced spending by Norman 
Wells employees alone. Considering the project provides annual 
wages to the northern residents in the range of $3.7 million, this 
loss would most certainly have devastating economic effects on 
small business.
<P>
	Now consider the positive implications of increasing the size 
and production life of Norman Wells. The passage of this 
legislation paves the way for a $30 million drilling program 
which will be undertaken by Imperial Oil, the operating 
company of Norman Wells.
<P>
	This project and the extension of the field's productive life in 
general will increase short term employment and stabilize long 
term employment in the Norman Wells area. It is estimated that 
an additional 25 person-years of indirect employment will also 
be created in the north.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6076"> 6076 </A></B>
<P>
	Northern businesses will also benefit from the opportunity 
to learn up to date horizontal drilling technology. Future 
business and employment opportunities will be enhanced for 
these firms not only in the north, but also in Alberta and B.C. 
where there is a shortage of such expertise.
<P>
	The economic benefits of this small amendment to the Canada 
Petroleum Resources Act do not end at the 60th parallel. Indeed, 
all Canadians stand to benefit from the passage of this bill.
<P>
	Not only will the Government of Canada's financial position 
improve from the additional corporate and personal tax 
revenues, the government's one-third investment in Norman 
Wells is expected to bring in millions of extra dollars.
<P>
	This project will also be an economic benefit to Albertans. At 
a time when Canadians are looking for economic stimuli, this is 
clearly a wonderful opportunity. I urge hon. members to lend 
their support to this bill so economic renewal can continue.
<P>

<P>
<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="DEPARTMENTOFAGRICULTUREACT">DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE ACT</A></H3>
	<B>Hon. Ralph E. Goodale (Minister of Agriculture and 
Agri-Food)</B> moved that Bill C-49, an act to amend the 
Department of Agriculture Act and to amend or repeal certain 
other acts, be read the second time and referred to a committee.
<P>
	He said: Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to rise today to begin the 
debate on Bill C-49, an act to amend the Department of 
Agriculture Act and to make related amendments to other acts.
<P>
	In some ways this bill is a reflection of the kinds of changes 
the Canadian agriculture and agri-food industry has undergone 
in recent years and can anticipate in future years.
<P>
	The amendments add the word ``agri-food'' to the 
department's name, reflecting a recognition that the 
department's mandate extends far beyond the farm gate. This 
change also reflects a recognition that what happens on the farm 
and beyond the farm gate are intimately linked together. The 
strength of primary agriculture depends to a great extent on the 
strength of all those downstream in the food chain who process 
and use agricultural products.
<P>
	The bill also defines more precisely the department's 
responsibilities for research. The existing act only mentions 
research indirectly through a reference to experimental farm 
stations. This bill broadens the definition to cover research 
related to agriculture and products derived from agriculture, 
including the operation of experimental farm stations.
<P>
	This clarification of the mandate of the department in no way 
takes away from this government's commitment to Canadian 
farmers as primary producers. In fact it strengthens it by 
ensuring that the importance of maintaining and nurturing the 
health and prosperity of the entire agriculture and agri-food 
industry is upheld.
<P>
	Farmers are and will always be at the centre of the agriculture 
industry. As such the department will continue to devote a very 
large amount of its resources to farmers. In addition, there is a 
growing need to be aware of the products of Canadian agri-food 
processors. More and more we must be aware that market 
development is important not just for raw commodities but 
increasingly for value added products.
<P>
	There are opportunities for the agriculture industry to provide 
ingredients for pharmaceuticals, cosmetics, paints and energy 
products, in addition to food products. More and more we must 
be assured that the systems are in place to produce those 
products and to ensure they reach their market destinations.
<P>
	Before that process even begins we must ensure that the kinds 
of crops and livestock demanded by these markets are being 
produced and we must ensure that the research and technology 
are there to transform those crops and livestock into the 
processed products in demand worldwide. That is where the 
department's research function comes into play, both in 
developing the commodities that form the basis of the industry 
and in pioneering new uses for them.
<P>
	The research branch of the department has been conducting 
research to the benefit of both the primary and secondary 
agriculture industries for many, many years and with great 
distinction. The changes in this bill merely reflect that ongoing 
work in the definition of the department's responsibilities for 
research.
<P>
	It is fitting to be talking about the mandate of the Department 
of Agriculture and Agri-food at this time. As we approach the 
beginning of a new century it is time to take a look at where we 
would like Canada's agriculture and agri-food industry to be in 
the years 2000, 2005 and 2010.
<P>
	This industry is a very important one to this nation. It 
represents 8 per cent of Canada's gross domestic product and 
accounts for 1.8 million Canadian jobs. That is 15 per cent of all 
of the employment in this country. Agricultural and agri-food 
exports equal more than $13 billion annually. In 1992 farm 
inputs valued at $10.5 billion translated into farm products 
worth $20 billion. That translated into a further $44 billion 
worth of processed food and beverage products.

<P>
	The agriculture and agri-food sector enhances the quality of 
life in both rural and urban Canada. It ensures a safe, high 
quality food supply. Because of Canada's agriculture and 
agri-food sector, in comparison to the rest of the world 
Canadians spend the second lowest proportion of their 
disposable incomes on food.
<P>
	It is important to ensure that the success of this industry so 
vital to all Canadians continues. Canada's agriculture and 
agri-food industry must be able to compete in a rapidly 
changing world. A common vision is needed, shared by 
government and industry, to take the agriculture and agri-food 
sector into the 21st century. In that way we will together be able 
to make the kinds of decisions necessary to secure our future.
<P>
	The world in which Canada's agriculture and agri-food 
industry does business is not the same today as it was 25 years 
ago or 10 years ago or even 5 years ago. For example, in the 
grains and oilseeds sector alone markets for Canadian products 
have changed dramatically. It was not all that long ago that we 
depended upon traditional billion dollar bulk grain markets in 
places like the former Soviet Union and China.
<P>
	Many of those markets have been replaced by more varied and 
somewhat smaller and more individual markets. Customers now 
more and more are buying to exacting specifications. Our U.S. 
market has grown to almost 60 per cent of agri-food exports so 
far this year.
<P>
	By the year 2010 rural population is expected to increase by 
another two billion people. Over the next five years incomes in 
regions like Asia and the Pacific are expected to rise by 6 per 
cent to 12 per cent per year. Incomes are also expected to rise in 
areas such as Africa, Latin America and the Middle East.
<P>
	With these increases in income and the changes in the quality 
of life that it brings, there will be a shift in global consumption 
patterns to more animal protein products and more highly 
processed food products than ever before. At the same time, key 
export markets such as the United States remain crucial to the 
continued growth and development of our industry here in 
Canada.
<P>
	On the domestic side we are also confronted with changing 
marketplaces and fiscal constraints on federal and provincial 
budgets. Is the Canadian agriculture and agri-food sector ready 
to respond to changing demands internationally? Is it ready to 
respond to changing imperatives on the domestic front?
<P>
	The industry is strong in a great many ways. The value of 
agricultural output continues to increase by about 2 per cent 
annually. Productivity growth rates are high by international 
standards. Many processing firms are shifting to focus more and 
more on world markets.
<P>
	Canada's agriculture and agri-food industry has a solid basis 
in abundant natural resources and sound environmental 
practices, is productive in skilled human resources, has a well 
developed infrastructure and institutions and a reasonably 
stable operating environment. However, there are areas where 
we must do better.
<P>
	Right now Canada has higher processing and marketing costs 
and less private sector research than many of our major 
competitors. Although Canada is exporting more of our higher 
valued agri-food products to the United States, our imports are 
growing faster than our exports and we are missing 
opportunities for marketing higher valued agri-food products. 
There is little growth in our exports of higher valued products to 
countries other than the United States, in particular to Asian 
markets where standards of living and demand are growing 
rapidly.
<P>
<B>(1045) </B>
<P>
	In 1993 our agricultural private sector, supported by federal 
and provincial ministers of agriculture, set a target for 
agriculture and agri-food exports of $20 billion by the year 
2000. To achieve that goal, industry and federal and provincial 
governments will need to work harder to meet the challenges of 
the global marketplace.
<P>
	Right now our growth rate in agri-food exports is not 
sufficient to meet that target of $20 billion by the year 2000. 
Change is needed if the Canadian agriculture and agri-food 
industry is to grow and prosper into the next century.
<P>
	If we look at the grains and oilseeds sector as an example, it is 
clear that change is beginning to take place. Farmers are 
beginning to diversify out of traditional crops such as wheat and 
into more new crops such as mustard seed, canary seed, lentils 
and especially canola.
<P>
	Acreage of specialty crops grew almost 130 per cent in the 
period from 1988 to 1994. At the same time acreage of wheat fell 
by about 15 per cent. With farmers beginning to diversify out of 
traditional crops, new demands and challenges are being placed 
on our grain handling and transportation system as these 
different crops are moved into export position.
<P>
	In the last crop year, as we all know, we experienced some 
very serious problems with moving grains and oilseeds partly 
due to a rail car shortage and a number of other factors that 
conspired together at the same time. Those issues, as I have 
discussed in the House on other occasions, are being dealt with 
so that the kinds of problems experienced in the last crop year 
can be avoided to the largest extent humanly possible in the 
current crop year and into the future.
<P>
	The whole experience with our grain handling and 
transportation system brings into focus the question of whether 
the system in Canada is sufficiently equipped to meet the 
demands of a rapidly changing international marketplace.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6078"> 6078 </A></B>
<P>
	On another front we have to look at technology and we have 
to ensure that Canada is not being left behind. For example, 
non-food uses for grains, oilseeds and other agricultural 
products are expected to rise dramatically in the years 
immediately ahead. Forecasts in the United States and Europe 
predict that up to 50 per cent of raw agricultural materials will 
be used in the future for non-food industrial purposes.
<P>
	Is Canada investing sufficiently in the kinds of research 
required to develop new products from our grains, our oilseeds 
and our other agricultural output?
<P>
	There are many other issues on the agenda with respect to the 
renewal of our supply management systems, with respect to our 
red meat sector, with respect to horticulture issues and with 
respect to challenges affecting the broad spectrum of Canadian 
agriculture.
<P>
	Clearly, as we face all the issues and challenges that provide 
us at the same time with enormous opportunity, we must develop 
a common vision to ensure the decisions taken today and the 
initiatives undertaken in the future are part of a comprehensive 
long term plan for a progressive, competitive and successful 
agriculture and agri-food sector.
<P>
	I believe such a vision for the future must include at least five 
key elements. First it must be founded on economic reality. If 
the base is artificial then the plan will soon collapse.
<P>
	The fundamental reality is the marketplace. We must produce 
what the world wants to buy. We must do it cost effectively. We 
must diversify. We must be good managers and world class 
marketers. We must build strategic alliances internally and 
internationally. We must ensure that the benefits flow fairly 
among all our regions and all the players in that complicated 
food chain.
<P>
<B>(1050 ) </B>
<P>
	Second, our vision must recognize that rural Canada is not a 
backwater. It can in fact be the location of wealth generation, 
economic growth and new jobs.
<P>
	Diversification on and off the farm, value added processing, 
and niche marketing including exports, are all part of the 
equation for rural Canada, as are research and development and 
information technology to link the kitchen table in Sedley, 
Saskatchewan, to Toronto and Vancouver and indeed Osaka and 
Hong Kong.
<P>
	A third requirement for our vision is financial security. I have 
not met a farmer yet who tells me that he or she wants 
subsidization. What they want is a decent marketplace with a 
decent return.
<P>
	Well managed farms should expect a reasonable rate of return 
even though in some cases it may be supplemented by some 
amount of off farm income. The weather and other production 
and marketing risks will always necessitate a farm safety net 
program, but federal and provincial tax dollars are scarce and 
support in the form of safety nets must not distort production or 
marketing signals.
<P>
	Fourth, we must achieve resource and environmental 
sustainability. We need a sensitive and sensible balance among 
social, economic and environmental considerations founded on 
enhancing our resource base, maintaining surrounding 
ecosystems, and developing, adapting and marketing new 
technologies to protect our environment. Our environmental 
stewardship could become a unique new Canadian export 
opportunity.
<P>
	The fifth and final element in this vision that I would mention 
at the moment is the maintenance of a safe and secure food 
supply. That is really the foundation upon which everything else 
rests. Food safety has been and must continue to be a priority in 
and for Canada. Our reputation for safety and quality is vital to 
our domestic consumers and is a critical advantage in the 
international marketplace.
<P>
	We must reduce our inspection costs while not impairing but 
rather enhancing our inspection system overall. That can be 
achieved by a national, non-duplicative system tuned to market 
requirements and international standards with alternative 
delivery options.
<P>
	What I have mentioned in the last few moments is a 
framework in which I believe we can structure a sound and solid 
game plan for the Canadian agriculture and agri-food sector. It 
is not yet all inclusive and it is certainly not cast in stone, but I 
think it is a basis upon which to begin.
<P>
	We cannot foretell the future. Neither can we forestall it. 
What we must do is define our best case scenario, where we 
really want to get to, and set out the steps needed to make that 
outcome most likely. I hope we can do it with the largest degree 
of consensus and teamwork.
<P>
	I close by saying I am extremely confident about Canada's 
agri-food sector and I am very ambitious about its future. There 
are no guarantees but as Wayne Gretzky once said, you will miss 
100 per cent of the shots you never take. We need to start 
shooting the puck at the net and we need to score. That is what 
this vision for the future of Canadian agriculture is intended to 
achieve.
<P>
	With a strong market orientation and the careful use of scarce 
tax dollars, with diversification, innovation and value added, 
with thoughtful stewardship of our natural resources, with the 
enhancement of our human resources, with a sharp focus on 
rural Canada and local communities, with high international 
standards and a cohesive team Canada attitude we can meet the 
objectives outlined in our red book last year about growth, jobs 
and security. Agriculture and agri-food can play a very large 
role.

<P>
	<B>Mr. André Caron (Jonquière):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to 
speak on behalf of the Bloc Quebecois on Bill C-49, introduced 
by the Minister of Agriculture to amend the act governing his 
department.
<P>
	Essentially, the bill changes the department's name to 
Department of Agriculture and Agri-Food. As the minister 
explained during his speech, the new name confirms that today 
the government's agricultural responsibilities are not restricted 
to helping farmers; their economic well-being and survival are 
largely dependent on the need to process, market and distribute 
their products.
<P>
	I think a country has a responsibility to ensure the smooth 
development of its agricultural sector, whose impact on the lives 
of nations and peoples is well known.
<P>
	In his speech, the minister identified his responsibilities with 
respect to marketing. I think it is an important sector. In Quebec, 
I heard about demands made by fine cheese producers, for 
example, who saw their industry's problem as one of marketing. 
I hope that this bill will enable the department, in cases like 
these, to help our producers market their products.
<P>
	Of course, in a modern state, the agriculture department's 
responsibilities go beyond dealing with agricultural production 
as such. I think a modern state's responsibilities extend to 
marketing and to helping and supporting agricultural producers 
and processors. With the globalization of markets, we must 
export abroad.
<P>
	I think, as the minister pointed out in his speech, that the time 
for exporting raw commodities is over. We, for instance, used to 
export enormous quantities of wheat to Russia. I think that we 
must refine our policies in this area and take steps to process our 
products right here, because agriculture-as the minister also 
mentioned-is a major source of jobs in Canada. The 
downstream sector in agriculture, the whole processing 
industry, is very important in that respect.
<P>
	It is therefore important that the Department of Agriculture 
work to improve our competitiveness, our independence from 
foreign countries, and to ensure the future of our agricultural 
system, and that the department do its part to promote research. 
The bill points out that the department has responsibilities in 
this area.
<P>
	I would like to point out how ironic it is that Bill C-50 on the 
Canadian Wheat Board, proposing that checkoffs be made from 
sales proceeds to support research, was tabled last Monday. I do 
not know if, in the future, other agricultural sectors will be 
asked to make the same effort. If not, one has to wonder whether 
we are not asking wheat producers to subsidize agricultural 
research twice through their taxes and the checkoffs? It remains 
to be seen.
<P>
	You can see from my remarks that the Bloc Quebecois 
supports this bill, even though it does not address at all the 
matter of overlap. Mr. Speaker, I will be happy to clarify what I 
mean after Question Period.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> It being eleven o'clock, pursuant to

<P>
	This prime minister has done everything to make Quebecers 
like him. He was involved in the proclamation of the war 
measures in 1970. He was responsible for the night of the long

Newfoundland, Clyde Wells, for killing the Meech Lake 
Accord.
<P>
	Now he is acting like a bad debtor by refusing to pay Quebec 
back for its contribution to the 1992 referendum, which was held 
under Quebec law with the agreement of the federal government 
then in power.
<P>
	Mr. Prime Minister, you are being consistent only with 
yourself when you show such contempt for the Quebec people, 
who are able to judge you when they see who is defending 
Quebec's interests in this House. You accuse us of being elected 
under false representations; we reply to you that you are robbing

open B.C. land claims negotiations to the general public.
<P>
	On September 20 Premier Mike Harcourt bowed to public 
pressure and issued a statement claiming to bring a new 
openness to the process. Steps have been taken to include local 
municipal governments in treaty negotiations but more must be 
done.
<P>
	As the premier recently noted, closed doors negotiations and 
mandatory confidentiality statements have undermined public 
trust.
<P>
	There is a mood of uncertainty and fear in affected 
communities. Negotiations have been secretly carried out and 
the average citizen is scared. Public policy is best decided in 
open meetings, not behind closed doors. Let the people who 
have to live with the decisions have a say in the decisions.
<P>
	I call on the federal government to follow the premier's lead 
and allow the average citizen to be a part of negotiations. This is 
necessary to restore a mood of trust and public confidence to a 
process long marred by unwarranted secrecy.

	<B>Mrs. Georgette Sheridan (Saskatoon-Humboldt):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I have three topics, Saskatchewan, immigration and

<P>
	My province of Saskatchewan joined Confederation in 1905. 
It was another Liberal Prime Minister, Laurier, whose visionary 
immigration policies opened the west to settlement by 
immigrants from around the world.
<P>
	Settlers came to a land that Saskatchewan's Connie Kaldor 
describes as harsh and unforgiving. This land offered 
independence and opportunity, treasures precious enough to be 
worth a little dust and frostbite.
<P>
	Next year marks Saskatchewan's 90th birthday, the 90th 
anniversary of Laurier's western visit. In only 90 years, less 
than one lifetime, Saskatchewan pioneers have taken us from 
oxcarts to fax machines.
<P>
	I think of Herbert S. Wright, born on this date in 1907. An 
English immigrant, Stan and his wife Peggy raised three 
children. Starting a family at the beginning of the great 
depression was not easy, yet the Wrights faced the challenge, 
prospered and were stronger for it.

	<B>Mr. John O'Reilly (Victoria-Haliburton):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
during the summer months our country hosted the 
Commonwealth Games. I am proud to say that Team Canada 
turned in its best performance ever. Our team won a record 128 
medals: 40 gold, 42 silver and 46 bronze.
<P>
	I would like to congratulate all Canadians who participated in 
the games. In particular, I would like to congratulate two of 
Canada's athletes who hail from my riding of 
Victoria-Haliburton in the province of Ontario. Nancy 
Sweetnam of Lindsay won a silver medal in the 400 metre 
individual medley and a bronze medal in the 200 metre 
individual medley. Linda Szulga, who  hails from Burnt River, 
Ontario, won a bronze medal in the pairs smallbore rifle 
competition.
<P>
	These women represented Canada with a great deal of class 
and sportsmanship during the games and sacrificed many hours 
to train for their event.
<P>
	Once again I salute their achievements and urge all members 
to applaud the fine showing by Team Canada at Victoria in 
August.

government places a high priority on sustainable development, 
the joint goals of achieving a clean environment and a strong, 
internationally competitive economy.
<P>
	That is why yesterday the Deputy Prime Minister and 
Minister of the Environment and the Minister of Industry 
announced a new $57.5 million national strategy for the 
Canadian environmental industry.
<P>
	The environmental industry strategy was developed after 
extensive consultations with the industry, with all levels of 
government and with industry associations.
<P>
<B>(1115 ) </B>
<P>
	This strategy will improve the access of the environmental 
industry to government programs and services, support cost 
effective technology development and commercialization, 
secure dominance in the growing Canadian market and increase 
exports of environmental technology.
<P>
	Canada's industry has an important role to play in helping 
Canada achieve sustainable development, and the government is 
firmly committed to strengthening this sector of our economy.

	<B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, in a powerful report, the Council on Social 
Development expresses its concerns regarding the increasing 
poverty in Canada. The council concludes that although we may 
have to review our social programs they are still working. What 
is not working however is the labour market.
<P>
	My question is for the person speaking on behalf of the Prime 
Minister and the Deputy Prime Minister.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> Put your question.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6083"> 6083 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Duceppe: </B>I am just about to do so. I was looking about 
to see who could give me an answer, as there are not too many 
people in here this morning.
<P>
	Does the minister not agree than instead of reforming our 
social programs, the government must put forward concrete job 
creation measures since, as the council pointed out, it is not 
social programs which are not working, but rather jobs which 
are lacking?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Ralph E. Goodale (Minister of Agriculture and 
Agri-Food):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have a couple of points to make in 
response to the hon. member's question on behalf of my 
colleague, the Minister of Human Resources Development.
<P>
	It needs to be pointed out, as the minister did yesterday in 
some remarks, that the report of the Canadian Council on Social 
Development covered a period of time that ended in 1991. 
Therefore some of its statistical information is more than three 
years old.
<P>
	To be fully accurate any report on poverty must take into 
account the rapidly changing labour market, which I think is 
implied in the hon. member's question, and the need to direct 
young people into developing job sectors that have long term 
potential.
<P>
	I am sure the hon. member will have noted, not only in our red 
book proposals from the election campaign of last year but also 
in the throne speech, in the budget and in all the activities of the 
Minister of Human Resources Development, that the entire 
focus was upon the growth of the Canadian economy and the 
creation of jobs for Canadians.
<P>
	The statistics would show that in the first nine or ten months 
of our administration a very substantial beginning has been 
made. It is not nearly enough yet, but there has been very good 
progress at the beginning of the term of the government.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, could the agriculture minister explain how he is able to 
claim that a reform aimed at reducing costs by cutting social 
programs can create jobs?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Ralph E. Goodale (Minister of Agriculture and 
Agri-Food):</B> Mr. Speaker, as the Minister of Human Resources 
Development pointed out on many occasions in the House, the 
objective of the reform process upon which he has embarked is 
to transform the Canadian system into one that prepares 
Canadians for the changing requirements of the job market.
<P>
	Rather than acting just as a net to catch people when they need 
special assistance, it is transformed into a system to help them 
reintegrate into the workforce and be fully prepared for the job 
opportunities that must exist in the future.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, for a change in the social system , this is a real change 
indeed! In Quebec alone, there are 22,000 unemployed workers 
who are no longer eligible for UI benefits and the government 
reform is going to add thousands more to that number, forcing 
them onto welfare. In the past year, in Quebec alone, 20,000 
more people have been added to the welfare roll. It is a real 
change indeed, Mr. Speaker.
<P>
<B>(1120) </B>
<P>
	Will the Prime Minister, or the Minister of Agriculture, 
recognize that the government itself is adding to poverty by 
making these unjustified and inhuman unemployment insurance 
cuts?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Ralph E. Goodale (Minister of Agriculture and 
Agri-Food):</B> Mr. Speaker, the government's entire objective is 
to create economic growth and with that new jobs for Canadians.
<P>
	It bears noting that since last November we have been 
successful in assisting in the creation of 275,000 Canadian jobs, 
including 79,000 in the province of Quebec.

	<B>Mr. Roger Pomerleau (Anjou-Rivière-des-Prairies):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, my question is for the Prime Minister.
<P>
	The report of the Canadian Council on Social Development 
identifies Montreal as the Canadian city with the highest 
number of people living under the poverty line; 30 per cent of 
the population, or 386,000 households, live under the poverty 
line in Montreal. This is more than twice that of all the Atlantic 
provinces combined.
<P>
	Considering how serious the situation is in Montreal, will the 
Prime Minister undertake to implement an economic recovery 
strategy for that city, because the temporary infrastructure 
program will clearly not be enough?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Ralph E. Goodale (Minister of Agriculture and 
Agri-Food):</B> Mr. Speaker, the infrastructure program 
commenced by the government in literally the first few hours 
after we took office last November has been a remarkable 
success story with the mayors, municipalities and provincial 
governments virtually everywhere across the country.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6084"> 6084 </A></B>
<P>
	The minister responsible for infrastructure could add more 
detail. However, as far as I know without exception it has been 
heralded as a good and successful program. It is serving a very 
good purpose in establishing jobs for Canadians in the short 
term period while that program is in place over a span of about 
two years.
<P>
	More important, that program will renew and refurbish the 
physical underpinning of infrastructure in every province and in 
most communities from coast to coast in the country, giving us a 
modern infrastructure base upon which to build economic 
development for the future.
<P>
	The benefit of the program is being felt in the city of 
Montreal, just as it is in my home city of Regina and in all 
communities in between. That was the first major initiative of 
the government with respect to economic growth and job 
creation for the future.
<P>
	As the hon. member will know, we have many other plans in 
the development process at the present time. I think he will find 
as those plans come to fruition that communities such as the city 
of Montreal and all others in Canada will be able to feel the 
positive impact.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Roger Pomerleau (Anjou-Rivière-des-Prairies):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, does the Prime Minister intend to announce in the near 
future assistance measures for defence industry conversion, 
given that 10,000 jobs are in jeopardy in the Montreal area?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dennis J. Mills (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister 
of Industry):</B> Mr. Speaker, the Department of Industry is doing 
a whole range of activities that are relevant to the member's 
question.
<P>
	In terms of the defence industry productivity program, we 
have undertaken a very aggressive review and restructuring of 
the program so that we will be able to leverage the limited 
resources we have in that fund and to assist defence industries in 
converting so they will be much more in touch with knowledge 
based industries that are emerging as a new job creation force.
<P>
	We are also giving them added marketing in their conversion 
to new industries. We must never forget the fact that as a 
government we are leaning very hard on all financial institutions 
of the country to become much more progressive in their lending 
activities and their service activities for small and medium sized 
entrepreneurs. As a government we believe that is where our 
greatest hope for putting people back to work rests.

	<B>Mr. Ray Speaker (Lethbridge):</B> Mr. Speaker, I raise a 
question today of major concern in the minds of millions of 
Canadians. It is about their savings; it is about their retirement.
<P>
	My question is for the Minister of Finance. Why is the 
government considering taxing RRSPs?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Peters (Secretary of State (International 
Financial Institutions)):</B> Mr. Speaker, I keep hearing about new 
taxes from the Reform Party. I do not hear the Minister of 
Finance discussing new taxes.
<P>
	First I heard of a carbon tax. Now I hear of a tax on RRSPs. All 
these suggestions of new taxes come from members of the 
Reform Party and not a single idea on a cut in spending comes 
from them.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ray Speaker (Lethbridge):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have a 
supplementary question for the Secretary of State for 
International Financial Institutions.
<P>
	The Prime Minister, the Minister of Finance and now the 
minister responsible for financial institutions have been 
unclear, indefinite, and have not made a statement to the 
Canadian people indicating that the government is not prepared 
to tax RRSPs.
<P>
	If the minister is so sure of himself, would he stand in his 
place and say to the Canadian people that there will be no 
taxation on RRSPs during the term of this Parliament?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Peters (Secretary of State (International 
Financial Institutions)):</B> Mr. Speaker, as I am sure you know 
and as I am sure members of the Reform Party will find out with 
their experience in Parliament, new taxes are announced in 
budgets. The budget is coming down next February.
<P>
	In the meantime we will put out a paper in the fall. It will be 
referred to the finance committee and we will be able to listen to 
all the ideas of the Reform Party in the finance committee about 
taxation proposals.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ray Speaker (Lethbridge):</B> Mr. Speaker, I could only 
conclude from the answer of the minister that the possibility of 
new taxes for Canadians is there and that we have to be 
concerned about it.
<P>
	The minister recognizes that RRSPs are no different from 
other pension plans. RRSPs were created so that self-employed 
people in Canada could save for their retirement.
<P>
	My question is for the minister. Is the government not only 
considering taxing RRSPs but also considering taxing 
government pension plans and private pension plans as well?
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6085"> 6085 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Peters (Secretary of State (International 
Financial Institutions)):</B> Mr. Speaker, let me repeat that I keep 
hearing about new taxes only from the Reform Party. I hear 
about taxes on RRSPs. Now I hear about taxes on pension plans, 
on government pension plans, and I hear it from the Reform 
Party.
<P>
	All these ideas about new taxes are coming from members of 
the Reform Party. Do they have a suggestion for cutting 
spending? Please let us have some ideas on that.

	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval):</B> Mr. Speaker, yesterday, as 
he was leaving the House of Commons, the Minister of 
Intergovernmental Affairs started his media scrum by stating: 
``The federal government owes nothing to Quebec''. How 
arrogant! As for the Prime Minister, he keeps saying that he 
needs to get a bill before he can pay the Quebec taxpayers the 
$26 million he owes them.
<P>
	The minister knows full well that the people of Quebec paid 
twice for the referendum, once for the referendum in Quebec 
and again for the one held in the rest of Canada. Why then persist 
obstinately in refusing to pay what they owe to Quebec?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Marcel Massé (President of the Queen's Privy 
Council for Canada, Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs 
and Minister responsible for Public Service Renewal): </B>Mr. 
Speaker, on October 26, 1992, two referendums were held in 
Canada: one under the federal referendum act and another, under 
Bill 150 and the Quebec referendum act. These are two different 
acts. For example, the residency requirements are not the same 
in the Quebec legislation as in the federal legislation. Therefore, 
there is no legal basis for paying the government of Quebec for 
holding a referendum under its own provincial legislation.
<P>
<B>(1130) </B>
<P>
	The issue being raised could only be settled if we had in our 
files a clear agreement to waive the application of the act. But 
there is no evidence of such a document.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval):</B> Mr. Speaker, is the 
minister's response not proof in itself of this government's 
failure to recognize that Quebec is different from the rest of 
Canada? Is it not a tacit admission of the fact they are unable to 
accept this fundamental difference for one thing? Now, I would 
like to ask him: is the Premier of Quebec stating before the 
Quebec National Assembly that there was an agreement not 
sufficient proof of the existence of such an agreement? does the 
minister doubt the word of the former Premier of Quebec?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Marcel Massé (President of the Queen's Privy 
Council for Canada, Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs 
and Minister responsible for Public Service Renewal): </B>Mr. 
Speaker, in response to the first part of the hon. member's 
question, if Premier Bourassa decided to hold a referendum 
under his own legislation, he obviously believed it was for the 
best political advantage of both himself and the province to have 
a separate referendum.
<P>
	As for the second part of the question, I cannot help but 
wonder: if an agreement did exist between Premier Bourassa 
and Mr. Mulroney, and then Mrs. Kim Campbell, why then did 
neither Mr. Mulroney nor Mrs. Campbell express their 
agreement or pay a debt they presumably undertook to pay?

	<B>Mr. Grant Hill (Macleod):</B> The health minister has stated 
that Canada's blood supply system does not need to have as 
strict standards as those in the U.S. Frankly, that is hogwash. 
Will the minister raise her standards so that all Canadians will 
once again feel safe?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Diane Marleau (Minister of Health):</B> Mr. Speaker, our 
system of blood collection is among the best in the world. What 
is happening with the FDA, and I will repeat it again, is a 
question of different regulations to meet different systems, one 
system not being superior to the other.
<P>
	That being said, we are working with the FDA to harmonize 
those regulations, which would help us ship plasma to the 
States. We are going to continue to look at any possible way that 
we can improve the safety of our blood supply.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Grant Hill (Macleod):</B> Mr. Speaker, that is actually the 
first time I have heard the minister say that she is concerned 
about an improvement to the system which she has continually 
said is excellent and needs no changes. Frankly the patients, the 
people of Canada, expect no more hidebound, old fashioned 
statements. Rather, they would prefer to see changes that will 
improve our system.
<P>
	Will this minister stop making those old fashioned statements 
that simply try to cover her tracks?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Diane Marleau (Minister of Health):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
have been very clear during this whole debate. We have taken 
every step since I have been minister of health to ensure that we 
are using everything we know to guarantee the safety of the 
blood supply and we will continue to do that.
<P>
	It bothers me a great deal to have responsible people 
continuing to spread uncertainty when every day in every 
hospital across this land our blood supply system saves lives. 
Let us continue to encourage donors to move forward and donate 
their blood to continue to give the gift of life.

	<B>Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Témiscouata):</B> Mr.

At the press conference announcing the appointment of Mr. 
Manera as president of the CBC, the heritage minister said that 
the government was committed to making no further cuts in the 
CBC's government funding.
<P>
	How can the minister, who claims to be a great friend of this 
institution, justify his about-face and go back on his February 3 
commitment by announcing that it would be hard for him not to 
cut the CBC's budget?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Michel Dupuy (Minister of Canadian Heritage): </B>Mr. 
Speaker, I am delighted to note our colleague's interest in the 
CBC, this great federal institution which promotes our culture 
from coast to coast.
<P>
	If she is referring to decisions that have been made, I would 
like to know what these decisions are. What was said earlier this 
year has not changed, so I think she is indulging in speculations 
she may have heard elsewhere. However, no changes or 
decisions have been made that contradict what we said earlier.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Témiscouata):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it is quite obvious that it has not been announced, as the 
Minister of Canadian Heritage's colleague was saying. The 
budget has not been announced yet, but there is no smoke 
without fire. When we read in the newspaper that it will be 
difficult to avoid cutting the CBC's budget by 5 per cent to 8 per 
cent, it is a warning of things to come.
<P>
	Only yesterday, the vice president, Mr. Pineau, clearly said to 
the heritage committee that cuts were coming. So they should 
stop treating us like fools. Does the minister confirm that these 
cuts, if they are implemented, would mostly affect the services 
offered to Canada's francophone and Acadian communities?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Michel Dupuy (Minister of Canadian Heritage): </B>Mr. 
Speaker, I think that our colleague is worrying about smoke. I 
did not know she planned a career change from member of 
Parliament to firefighter.
<P>
	I think that if she wants to help this great institution, the 
CBC-which she herself is working on as a member of the 
parliamentary committee currently reviewing the CBC-she 
should say frankly that she is happy that this institution is 
working to promote Canadian unity and ask it to do even more.

	<B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley East):</B> Mr. Speaker, we 
have heard reports of infighting within the Liberal cabinet over a 
plan to uproot public servants and ship them to the east coast. On 
the one hand the Minister of Public Works and Government 
Services wants to move them to his hometown in Atlantic 
Canada while opposing ministers of public renewal and industry 
and others say, and I think the quote is: ``You do not move 
departments around just for the fun of it''.
<P>
	Will the minister of government renewal bring this dispute to 
an end by stating categorically that there are no longer any plans 
to ship parts of the civil service to the east coast?
<P>
	<B>Hon. David Michael Collenette (Minister of National 
Defence and Minister of Veterans Affairs):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
want to categorically assure you and members of this House that 
there is no division on this issue within cabinet.
<P>
	The administration of the federal government is complex. We 
have hundreds of thousands of employees. Perhaps on a 
supplementary my colleague the President of the Treasury 
Board might address some of the more specific issues relating to 
public servants.
<P>
	As the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs has noted, we 
are planning to reshape government and reorder our financial 
priorities. This will be done in an orderly fashion. Certainly the 
statements made by my colleague the Minister of Public Works 
and Government Services are in no way at odds with government 
policy.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley East):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
not sure if they are listening to their own reports. The Minister 
of Public Works and Government Services has established a 
committee with very specific instructions. The instructions are: 
To develop an action plan to enhance the government presence 
in Atlantic Canada. That is pretty much at odds with the plan that 
says: ``We will reorganize the civil service on the basis of cost 
effectiveness and efficiency''.
<P>
<B>(1140 ) </B>
<P>
	Will the Minister of Public Works and Government Services 
fall into line with the latter, which is cost effectiveness, and state 
today that he will disband this committee that is merely looking 
to enhance his own political future?

Defence and Minister of Veterans Affairs):</B> Mr. Speaker, all of 
the ministers in the government have been charged with looking 
at their own departments, the administration and the saving of 
money. The Minister of Public Works and Government Services 
is doing what everyone else is doing. They are looking line by

<P>
	After deciding not to implement a real comprehensive policy 
for the development of the French-speaking community, despite 
the request of the Federation of Francophone and Acadian 
Communities, the Minister of Heritage finally brought forth a

nothing more than an action plan to meet his own obligations 
under part VII of the Official Languages Act.
<P>
	Can the minister tell us how and in what way his action plan 
will develop the francophone community?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Michel Dupuy (Minister of Canadian Heritage):</B> Mr.

to Francophones and Acadians across Canada. He would have 
the answer, because they are the ones who called for the

deemed to be a threat to national security attempt to infiltrate 
them?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Patrick Gagnon (Parliamentary Secretary to </B><B>Solicitor

kinds that the government is investigating various political 
parties. There is none of that.

	<B>Mr. Réal Ménard (Hochelaga-Maisonneuve):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, my question is directed to the Minister of Health.
<P>
	In March 1993, the Canadian government released its funding 
plan for the second phase of the National AIDS Strategy. Ottawa 
was to spend $211 million on the strategy over the next five 
years or $42 million annually. Of those $42 million, $1.5 million 
were not set aside for specific programs but were to be allocated, 
at the discretion of the minister, to needs not covered by the 
strategy.
<P>
	Could the Minister of Health indicate whether according to 
plan, in 1994-95, in addition to the $40.7 million for standard 
programs, $1.5 million will be allocated by the minister to the 
National AIDS Strategy, as discretionary funding?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Diane Marleau (Minister of Health):</B> Yes, Mr. 
Speaker, that is the case. We have established a criteria for the 
$1.5 million, and we will try to follow those criteria. I may add 
that we have already planned to spend $400,000 of the $1.5 
million on a conference to be held in Vancouver at some time in 
1996.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Réal Ménard (Hochelaga-Maisonneuve):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, as far as the remainder is concerned, could the minister 
indicate the criteria for allocating these funds and which 
agencies will benefit?
<P>

<P>
	The CBC already receives more than $1 billion a year from 
Canadian taxpayers and the government appears to be on the 
move to tax even further.
<P>
	The minister has in his possession a study by the Nordicity 
Group which recommends new funding sources for the CBC but 
he does not want the public to see it. The organization, 
development and funding of the CBC has been behind closed 
doors for too long now and has now become a matter of 
accountability.
<P>

parliamentarians with this study which recommends new 
funding sources for the CBC?

<P>
	As for transparency, we have provided all the members who 
want to participate in the hearings of the standing committee on 
heritage an opportunity to look at the CBC. The hearings started 
yesterday and will go on for some months. There will be no 
secrets there. I understand a number of questions have already 
been put to the CBC through the standing committee.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Jan Brown (Calgary Southeast):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
really quite surprised that the minister has not yet seen the 
Nordicity study. I find that quite an unacceptable response.
<P>
	In any event, the Liberals continue to be unaccountable to 
Canadians. They are considering a tax on entertainment to 
generate more money for the CBC. Canadians cannot afford this 
any longer and they will not put up with any new taxes, 
especially for the CBC.
<P>
	Will the minister tell us categorically and right now that there 
will be no new entertainment tax introduced in order to fund this 
billion dollar boondoggle?

<P>
	Many economic observers claim that Canada is coming out of 
the recession and the job numbers are there to prove it. However 
as far as my constituents are concerned, there are still too many 
people out of work.
<P>
	Can the minister please tell me how many jobs have been 
created in Alberta so that I can reassure my constituents?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (President of the Treasury Board 
and Minister responsible for Infrastructure):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
there is a lot of interest in Alberta.
<P>
	This program is moving very rapidly right across the country. 
With the co-operation of the Government of Alberta it is 
moving quite rapidly in that province as well with some 719 
infrastructure projects investing over $422 million and creating 
some 700,000 jobs in that province. This is only the beginning.
<P>
	I am pleased to say that we have to this point in time allocated 
more than two-thirds of the money under the $6 billion 
infrastructure program. There are over 6,500 projects across the 
country and so far we have put some 70,000 Canadians to work. 
That is only the beginning.

to come across the country. It is attracting additional investment

directed to the Prime Minister or the Acting Prime Minister. 
After the Government of Quebec passed the Partition of the 
Family Patrimony Act, the government tabled Bill C-55, which 
received royal assent on September 29, 1992. Bill C-55 would 
provide for seizing or dividing federal pension benefits. Nearly 
two years after the bill was passed, the regulations have yet to be 
approved by the federal government.
<P>
	Would the Prime Minister or his substitute agree that after 
waiting for two years, the federal cabinet should move quickly 
to adopt the regulations so that Quebecers who have been 
disadvantaged as a result of this situation can obtain the pension 
share to which they are entitled?

Pension Benefits Division Act which helps to bring into effect 
the very regulations that are of concern to the hon. member with 
respect to implementing Bill C-55.
<P>
	Bill C-55 was put into effect by the previous government. It 
required a lot of detailed examination as to the regulations. We 
moved as quickly as we could. We have already made changes 
which I announced previously with respect to incorporating 
part-time employees and marriage after retirement into the

	<B>Mr. Art Hanger (Calgary Northeast):</B> Mr. Speaker, again 
from the minister's department we get the same mumbo jumbo, 
political double talk and no real, clear answers in reference to 
removal, deportation or whatever.
<P>
	The minister is making a great to-do about his new 
immigration reform package which is currently before the 
House. Since nothing in this legislation would have prevented 
someone like Forbes from returning to Canada, is the minister 
willing to immediately undertake legislative changes to bar any 
applicant for immigration who has previously been deported for 
any reason?
<P>
	<B>Ms. Mary Clancy (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of

understand. I am sorry that the hon. member did not feel my 
previous answer was clear. I attempted to be clear.

<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="DEPARTMENTOFAGRICULTUREACT">DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE ACT</A></H3>
	The House resumed consideration of the motion. That Bill 
C-49, an act to amend the Department of Agriculture Act and to 
amend or repeal certain other acts, be read the second time and 
referred to a committee.
<P>
	<B>Mr. André Caron (Jonquière):</B> Mr. Speaker, I will now 
continue the speech I started before Question Period. I may 
recall that I was commenting on the bill introduced by the 
Minister of Agriculture, which proposes to change the name of 
the department and define certain powers, duties and functions 
with respect to research on and processing of agri-food 
products.
<P>
	I indicated that the Bloc Quebecois supports this bill, but I 
note, after reading the bill and listening to the minister, who 
explained the role played by his department in the agricultural 
industry in this country, that there is considerable potential for 
overlap.
<P>
	If we look at what the Government of Quebec and the 
Government of Canada are doing in the agricultural and agri--
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6093"> 6093 </A></B>
<P>
food sectors, there are many activities that are practically 
identical. The Government of Quebec also supports farmers, 
promotes market development,  supports research and also 
supports activities connected with the inspection of agricultural 
products.
<P>
	It is, more or less, what the federal government is going to do 
as well. This is a typical example of overlap. And if we consider 
that historically, federal spending on Quebec's agricultural 
industry has always been less than Quebecers would consider 
their fair share as part of the Canadian federation, this may be 
yet another instance of Quebecers paying twice for the same 
service. They pay for agricultural research and development 
activities in their province and, since they pay federal taxes, 
they also pay for what is being done elsewhere.
<P>
	If federal spending in Quebec could be said to be more or less 
on a per capita basis, we could say that we are not paying more to 
get the same services or services that are almost identical to 
what the federal government can offer. However, that is not the 
case.
<P>
	If I am not mistaken, federal spending on agriculture in 
Quebec has never exceeded 20 per cent, and has often been 
considerably less.
<P>
<B>(1215) </B>
<P>
	I am not surprised, because this has been going on for quite 
some time in Quebec, but I am surprised that the minister failed 
to include in his bill a number of provisions to keep to a 
minimum any overlap with activities in this sector that are 
covered by the Government of Quebec.
<P>
	I feel very much involved in this particular debate. As we 
heard during Question Period and statements by members, in the 
past three years, and especially during the 1992 referendum in 
Quebec, Quebecers have paid for the referendum they held 
under Quebec's legislation and also paid for the referendum held 
in the rest of Canada. Since Quebecers pay taxes like everybody 
else, part of the money spent by the federal government on the 
referendum in Canada-Regina and Toronto and St. John's, 
Newfoundland-came from taxes paid by Quebecers. They paid 
for this referendum and they also paid for their own referendum. 
This is an obvious case of overlap.
<P>
	Quebecers understood their Premier had received assurances 
from the Canadian Prime Minister that they would get the 
money back. Quebecers believed Premier Bourassa. They did 
not necessarily think Mr. Bourassa was lying. Mr. Bourassa 
spoke from his seat in the National Assembly. Today, we are told 
that the word of the Premier of Quebec is not enough to prove 
that the federal government owes money to Quebec.
<P>
	That is why I would have liked to see in the agriculture 
minister's bill provisions stating that the Department of 
Agriculture will consult with the Quebec Ministry of 
Agriculture in order to avoid overlap, to ensure that there are no 
cases where Quebecers will have to pay twice.
<P>
	I would have liked to see that in the bill because I realize that 
if it is not written in black and white before a witness and 
recorded by a notary, when provisions are not perfectly clear, 
nothing ever gets done. So we say that even if promises were 
made by a prime minister, there is no guarantee if it is not in 
writing.
<P>
	That is why I would have liked to see in the minister's bill 
clear indications that real efforts will be made to avoid overlap 
so that Quebecers will not again-as in many other cases-have 
to pay twice for the same service.
<P>
	I will not keep the House any longer. Of course, the Bloc 
Quebecois endorses the spirit of the bill. We will review it in 
committee. In particular, we will ask that the matter of 
inspectors be clarified. The definition of ``inspector'' in French 
seems slightly different from that in English.
<P>
	Bloc members will ask for clarifications in committee, 
because it is very important to convince and assure Quebec 
francophones that the French version of a bill says the same 
thing as the English version.
<P>
	I thank you for your attention and let me assure you that our 
Bloc colleagues who sit on the agriculture committee will see to 
it that this bill is improved in the interest of the people of 
Quebec and Canada.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Allan Kerpan (Moose Jaw-Lake Centre):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, at first glance one would look at this bill and pass it off 
merely as simple housekeeping. Certainly as a Reform member I 
am in favour of any bill that would streamline and make this 
department more efficient.
<P>
<B>(1220) </B>
<P>
	However a couple of aspects of this legislation give me some 
concern. First, there is a new section on inspection services. It 
states: ``The minister may designate any person as an inspector 
for the purpose of providing the inspection services that the 
minister considers necessary for the enforcement of any act of 
which the minister has any powers, duties or functions''.
<P>
	I certainly have some questions about this. Does this create 
another level of inspection police in Canada? For example, will 
this give the minister, through an appointed inspector, the 
latitude to enforce any laws in his jurisdiction of agriculture?
<P>
	The second aspect is the repeal of section 6 which currently 
states: ``The minister shall cause to be laid before each House of 
Parliament not later than the fifth sitting day of that House after 
January 31 next, following the end of the fiscal year a report 
showing the operations of the department for that fiscal year''.
<P>
	The questions I have in that area are, first, how much will it 
save? If it could save significant dollars I would be the first to 
admit that I am in favour of that. Second, will the standing 
committee be able to examine fully the report given by the 
minister without it being laid on the table in the House?
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6094"> 6094 </A></B>
<P>
	Forces in the world today may radically change the way 
agri-business is carried on. New trade deals, safety nets, farm 
debt, to name but a few, will drastically alter agri-business over 
the next few years. We have a great opportunity here. Rather 
than just do a facelift on the department by giving it a new 
name, why does the government and the minister not sit down 
and do a major overhaul from the ground up?
<P>
	We are prepared to help in this process but not in the fashion 
that has been suggested. Let all of us in the House, especially 
including the minister, go back to square one and develop policy 
that has been built from the grassroots.
<P>
	I believe we must do more than just tinker with an agriculture 
bill and change the department's name. We are facing a crucial 
time of rapid change: on our farms, in our support business and 
in both levels of government and their responsibilities regarding 
agriculture. We are at a time of change, perhaps greater than the 
dominion land settlement and the emergency action taken 
during the great depression. We know what the current changes 
are. They are global trade arrangements. They are new markets. 
They are new biotechnology. They are less government money. 
They are greater worldwide food demand. They are the need to 
look after our environment.
<P>
	In order to meet all these challenges we must do more than 
just tinker. We must look at what I refer to as a reconfederation 
of agriculture. This is our vision. I believe this vision should 
have three components to it.
<P>
	First, as Canadians we must encourage each other to 
appreciate our safe and affordable food supply more. What is 
more important to our daily lives than food? Yet we take our 
abundance of supply so much for granted. Many people in other 
parts of the world have had massive natural disasters or 
destructive military conflicts that have created food shortages 
and famines. Thankfully we have never suffered that in Canada.
<P>
	We must appreciate our food supply more. Surely we should 
not only see the agri-food department in terms of statistics and 
figures. While the industry is only 8 per cent of GDP, what is 
more important in our daily lives than our daily bread?
<P>
	We as leaders should be talking to people about this. This is 
what the minister of agriculture should be doing. I would like to 
see him use this upcoming Thanksgiving season to give a speech 
to Canadians on the blessings and the importance of a safe and 
abundant food supply and then to encourage his fellow 
legislators at all levels to make sure that we protect the resource 
of farming and food production. This is the first element of a 
vision statement.
<P>
	Second, we must realize how important it is to have good 
legislative policy for our farmers, those who produce and 
process our food. The basic thing we must strive toward is to 
make farming profitable again. Our policies must be geared 
toward this.
<P>
<B>(1225 ) </B>
<P>
	It is discouraging to know that farmers' real net market 
income in 1991 was only half of what it was in 1971. On top of 
that farmers as well as other Canadians have faced tremendous 
inflation in land prices, equipment prices, building prices, et 
cetera. Personal income and property taxes have gone up 
dramatically. How can farmers survive in this economic 
climate? Support programs have had to compensate.
<P>
	Farmers want an economic and fiscal environment in which 
they can make an honest buck on their own. We do not want 
handouts. We do not want government as a senior business 
partner. Get out of our pockets and get off our backs, is what 
farmers are saying.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stinson:</B> Right on.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Kerpan:</B> This is the direction in which the government 
should be going.
<P>
	The third component of our vision is that we must redefine the 
role of the federal government, the provinces and industry in 
agriculture. There must be a more clear, more precise division of 
responsibilities.
<P>
	Our party went on record in May during debate in the House 
on what we feel the new arrangements should be. We are doing 
more work on this. Experts have told us that a brand new 
arrangement could be made without any opening up of the 
Constitution. We would need to talk to each other as players and 
negotiate a new and better relationship but we must streamline 
and stop the overlap and duplication.
<P>
	We propose that the provinces have the regulatory 
responsibility for the management of the physical resources; 
land, water, crops, livestock and the training and education of 
human resources, youth, farmers, processors, et cetera, all the 
players in the system. The federal government would have 
responsibility for trading relationships, fiscal and monetary 
policy and support programs that will agree with our trading 
agreements. The industry would be left alone to make the vast 
majority of decisions related to production, processing, 
marketing and transportation.
<P>
	This arrangement needs to be fleshed out in a lot of detail. 
However, I sense a real momentum and a desire building in the 
country to get into this. I would suggest that we take the 
agriculture sector and work in this direction.
<P>
	I want to point out to the minister of agriculture that I 
appreciated his opening comments and his remarks with regard 
to this bill. He mentioned a five point vision. I talked about a 
three point vision. In many ways both of those visions have a lot 
of similarities.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6095"> 6095 </A></B>
<P>
	He talked about the cross-country consultation that is being 
planned. I ask the question: How do you do this? How do you 
go to the farmers in this country and get a reading of their 
feelings and ask their direction? It is very difficult.
<P>
	I want to encourage the minister today to become involved. 
There is no other way that consultation like this can work 
without the full co-operation and the full involvement of the 
minister and his complete department.
<P>
	The last thing that farmers need is another consultation 
process with a report that gets put on someone's desk, never to 
be looked at. In the last few months I have had the opportunity to 
look at such reports. Many of them were very well done. Many 
of them laid out plans and policies that should and could have 
been implemented by all governments but they were never 
looked at. We cannot afford that type of consultation process any 
more.
<P>
	The minister stated in his opening remarks that the industry 
has changed in the last 25 years. I certainly agree with that. We 
need, as the minister pointed out, a common vision for farmers 
and consumers right across the country.
<P>
	As a farmer I can remember many times my father telling me 
that you must be prepared. You must be ready for any 
eventuality and that you must leave your options open. It 
reminds me of going out to do a day's field work with the tractor 
and not having any fuel in the tractor. You may leave the yard 
with the best intentions in the world of doing a full day's work, 
but an hour later you run out of fuel and your mission cannot be 
accomplished. It is simply impossible.
<P>
<B>(1230) </B>
<P>
	We must drive into the next century and not be pulled into it 
by other market forces. We must take the initiative as 
government and as industry and drive ourselves into the next 
century with good policies created and established at the 
grassroots level.
<P>
	In closing I go on record again as saying that the Reform Party 
is most happy, most ready and most willing to co-operate with 
the government to build that policy. Hopefully together we can 
develop a policy that is good, that is right, and that is something 
farmers want for the next century.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I enjoyed the hon. member's presentation and I would 
like him to elaborate on this: would rural development, in which 
agriculture is surely a very important factor, not require a much 
broader approach, which, as he mentioned when he talked about 
co-operation between consumers and producers, would also 
require a comprehensive approach?
<P>
	As it is, much of what the federal government does hurts rural 
communities now, for example with Canada Post and with 
railways. In many cases, the left hand does not know what the 
right hand is doing and I would like the hon. member to say 
whether the federal government should take a different 
approach. What should be done to ensure that what the 
government does through these national corporations carries out 
the desire for action expressed by the Minister of Agriculture, 
instead of having a negative effect which destroys this good will 
with an excessively centralizing approach that often wipes out 
the efforts of local communities?
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> I apologize to the hon. member, I was 
mistaken. There is no period for questions and comments after a 
speaker for a party has spoken. It is all my fault. Can we take it 
as a representation or is there unanimous consent to let the hon. 
member ask this question?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Kerpan:</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like to respond to that 
question and I thank you for the time.
<P>
	Very briefly, certainly we are in what I perceive to be a global 
market. There is no question about it. The role of people at the 
committee level is that we have to develop within our own 
boundaries part of that policy. Certainly part of that planning 
has to be a developmental policy that will lead us into an even 
larger global economy than what we are now involved in.
<P>
	It appears to me from where I sit as a member from 
Saskatchewan and knowing most about my home province, that 
farmers are telling me that without starting at square one, the 
grassroots, we cannot develop the global policy.
<P>
	The minister probably said it best. In his opening comments 
he said that without a solid foundation everything else falls 
down. In my experience that is in fact the case. One cannot build 
a building with a poor foundation; it just will not stand.
<P>
	It is my opinion that we have to look at an agricultural policy 
as if there were none at this point in time. We have to start from 
step one, build it within our borders, and then expand globally 
and internationally.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Lyle Vanclief (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Agriculture and Agri-food):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is certainly a 
pleasure to stand today to make some comments on Bill C-49.
<P>
	I want to refresh everybody's memory on the purpose of the 
bill. It is giving effect to a change in the title of the department. 
At one time it was known as the department of agriculture or the 
ministry of agriculture and now it will be known as the ministry 
of agriculture and agri-food. That is one of the changes. Other 
changes and amendments will have to be made in corresponding 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6096"> 6096 </A></B>
<P>
acts just to expand the act because of the role the department  has 
been playing for many years. We are just bringing it up to date.
<P>
<B>(1235) </B>
<P>
	In response to some comments made by speakers in the 
opposition, the Reform Party and the Bloc Quebecois, 
concerning the allocation of spending, et cetera, they are not 
covered in the bill. They are not for discussion in the bill. It is at 
an administrative level in co-operation with the provinces and 
the federal government. It is ongoing at all times and certainly 
can and will continue.
<P>
	In response to the member from the Reform Party suggesting 
that the minister give a speech on Thanksgiving Day, if he 
desires to do so he can certainly get a copy of a speech the 
minister made on September 19 in Regina to the Chamber of 
Commerce wherein he stressed the importance of agriculture 
and the agri-food industry in Canada. He also made some 
comments about what he saw as some of the issues that needed 
to be addressed. As the member already knows, next Thursday 
the minister will be attending a very detailed session on our 
vision and projected concerns about the total industry with 
members of the standing committee.
<P>
	The bill makes other changes. At the present time it states that 
the mandate is clarified in the bill to include not only primary 
agriculture but products derived from agriculture. It is 
necessary to do that. The bill enlarges the responsibility of the 
minister by changing reference to experimental farm stations to 
research related to agriculture and products derived from 
agriculture, including the operation of experimental farm 
stations across Canada.
<P>
	We need these important amendments to bring the matter up 
to date. They reflect the longstanding relationship between the 
ministry and the agriculture and agri-food industry of Canada. 
That relationship started changing a number of years ago when 
the ministry was given the mandate to ensure the safety of the 
Canadian food supply.
<P>
	Our inspection services are still one of the most important 
points of contact between the industry and the department. The 
highest percentage of the employees in the Department of 
Agriculture and Agri-Food are in the food inspection and 
production branch.
<P>
	As years have gone by the department has played an 
increasingly important, necessary and continuing role in 
research and market development assistance. Enforcing safety 
rules is still important but the department sees itself as more of a 
supervisor in inspection roles.
<P>
	A key activity in the department now is partnership. We must 
continue to rethink our working relationships with the industry 
clients out there. It is important to re-emphasize that food safety 
will always be our top priority but our priorities are in other 
areas as well. A partnership, however, can only survive if there 
is good communication among the department and the other 
parties. I am certainly looking forward to the type of  
communication and co-operation at the standing committee we 
have always had since I came to Parliament in 1988.
<P>
	I want to emphasize another partnership recognized in 
Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada. It was recognized for the 
first time at the meeting of federal and provincial agriculture 
ministers in Winnipeg back in early July. I am referring to the 
important role farm women play in the agriculture and agri-food 
industry. Not only do we look to them as the nourishers of the 
nation, but they are playing ever increasing and ever more 
important roles as business people, as individuals and as 
partners with their spouses or in businesses. They can play and 
will play even more roles. They bring to our attention in the 
department that we have to be constantly aware of safety in 
agriculture.
<P>
<B>(1240) </B>
<P>
	In Ontario a number of years ago, I had the privilege to be on a 
health and safety in agriculture task force for two years. At that 
time the necessity of our role was certainly made clear by farm 
women and other people involved in the industry.
<P>
	We know, especially at the primary producer level, that days 
and nights can be long, wet, muddy or whatever, that conditions 
are not considered ideal. There are also bankers that would like 
to get the crop in the bin or to the elevator because there are bills 
to pay. We have to be very conscious of those concerns and the 
safety of everybody involved in the industry.
<P>
	The role of government is changing. Canada's food inspection 
system is a good example. We cannot afford to have a full time 
permanent inspector at every factory and every processing plant 
for every minute. Therefore to a large extent we must rely on the 
industry to police itself. It too is a net beneficiary of the very 
high standards of food and produce quality in Canada. It has a 
responsibility to ensure the products and the processes it takes 
part in meeting the standards we set. There is also a facilitator 
role for the department to play.
<P>
	The industry understands the high quality of our Canadian 
products is one of the biggest and best selling points for our 
domestic consumers and those abroad, and we have many of 
those. Our reputation for quality in Canada is money in the bank. 
We must make sure we can continue that.
<P>
	It is a shared responsibility that is expensive to maintain. We 
spend a tremendous amount of money. I am not saying it is 
money wasted in any way, shape or form, but cost sharing 
arrangements are being discussed with the industry. They have 
worked very well in other countries. They are working very well 
in Australia, New Zealand and the United States. Certainly those 
countries have very good standards as well.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6097"> 6097 </A></B>
<P>
	We have to keep improving the inspection system and that 
is not cheap. For its part the department is trying to harmonize 
standards across the country. To our colleague from the Bloc 
Quebecois who spoke earlier I want to point out that one area 
in which we are making good progress and have co-operation 
is in getting rid of duplication or overlap among provinces in 
the Canadian food inspection system. We have a way to go yet. 
We can and will get rid of the duplication.
<P>
	That area is of net benefit to everyone and it is necessary to 
continue that co-operation. We need to work more with the 
industry as far as research is concerned as often the result of 
scientific and technical breakthroughs are benefits to all 
Canadians.
<P>
	We have goals we must reach in trade. In his comments earlier 
today the minister spoke about the goals we want to reach, 
including $20 billion in agriculture and agri-food export trade 
from Canada by the year 2000. We know if we are to reach that 
goal, I say to my colleagues and to the industry, we will have to 
get better at it than we are at the present time.
<P>
	We need to capitalize on opportunities, new technologies, 
changing markets and trading agreements such as GATT, 
NAFTA and all the others we are involved in. That goal is there. 
The market is there.
<P>
	The Asia-Pacific market, for example, is one that really 
beckons us. We know that 50 per cent of the increase in the 
world's wealth between now and the year 2000 will take place in 
the Asia-Pacific area. We also know that 50 per cent of the 
increase in world trade between now and the year 2000 is going 
to take place in that area. We know there is a booming increase 
in trade opportunities in Latin America and South America and 
we must be there. We as a department, collectively and 
collaboratively, need to work with all of the stakeholders and all 
the partners in the industry in order to take the best advantage of 
that. The opportunities are there so we need to work very 
closely.
<P>
<B>(1245) </B>
<P>
	In our platform during the campaign last fall we promised the 
creation of an agri-food council that would focus on 
international competitiveness. Some of my colleagues across 
the way will say yes, we put things in place but what are we 
going to do? I can assure you that these groups of people will not 
be put in place unless they are going to be given a mandate and 
that mandate is listened to and we can draw on the resources of 
those people.
<P>
	We also said that we would be creating an agri-food trade 
service. We are doing that in the markets and industry services 
branch in order to provide a single window to get rid of 
duplication and get rid of red tape. Therefore, when an industry 
or someone in the industry wants to discuss access to federal 
government programs or federal government support, whether 
that be in research which we are encouraging as partnerships in 
research, or whether that be in support as far as  marketing 
opportunities, they can do it at a single window.
<P>
	Getting Ready to go Global is a $4 million program. Earlier 
this week I had the opportunity to join with some constituents at 
the Experimental Farm in Ottawa where the Indian agricultural 
program is working with some support from the Getting Ready 
to go Global program in the development of, and I hope I call it 
by the proper name, white Indian corn to be made into corn 
chips, et cetera.
<P>
	The Getting Ready to go Global program is helping them to do 
the things that are there. It is to improve management capability, 
help people promote strategic alliances, apply technological 
solutions and develop market intelligence. We are pleased to be 
able to help there.
<P>
	The agri-food industry marketing strategies is another one. 
There is the export expansion fund. I will give an example of the 
type of work of the agri-food industry marketing strategy. The 
department is providing up to $475,000 to the Quebec 
Agri-food Export Club in support of its international market 
developments. This is a club with international sales, excluding 
sales to the United States, of $25 million. It provides 
information, advice and training to its members. It supports and 
promotes co-operation among members in promotional 
activities abroad.
<P>
	The department also helps agri-food exporters by collecting 
and disseminating trade intelligence. We have at the present 
time, and we will continue to emphasize this, about 85 
commissioners working either full time or part time in over 100 
foreign markets around the world.
<P>
	For too long the Canadian agri-food industry has been content 
to just sell to the United States customer. Yes, it is our biggest, 
our closest and our easiest. However, we cannot put all our eggs 
in one basket, if I can use that well-worn phrase. We have to 
continue to look at the other areas, and we are doing that. We 
have to learn how to satisfy the appetites of the rest of the world. 
As the minister said this morning, we in North America are 
probably not too far away from the time when 50 per cent of the 
production at the farm gate will be used in some way in our 
society other than as a food product. There are increasing 
requirements for that.
<P>
	The minister said as well that we have to look at the 
opportunities out there, whether they be domestic or abroad, and 
we have to produce what we can sell. We can no longer be 
successful trying to sell what we like to produce. We are all 
guilty of that. When you are in farming you kind of get into 
feeling that ``I have always done this and I have always done 
that''. That is what you become familiar with, but you have to 
roll with the punches.

<P>
	I want to confirm the goals that the changes in this bill 
emphasize and offer as an opportunity. It is more than just a 
recognition that we have been doing these things in the 
department. We have been doing these things in the Government 
of Canada. I want to stress that better research in agriculture and 
agri-food will help us develop new products. Better 
partnerships will help us keep our standards high. In better 
partnerships, be that with farm women, industry, or the 
stakeholders, there are a lot of links in this chain and they all 
have to be strong and tight in order to pull.
<P>
	Better partnerships will help us keep in touch with the needs 
within the sector. Better intelligence will keep us on top of 
market trends. Better promotion will increase the demand for 
Canadian agri-food products not only domestically but abroad. 
Better relations between the industry and the department will 
ensure that the agri-food industry continues to be the engine of 
prosperity for all Canadians.
<P>
	In closing, I want to remind the House and everyone in 
Canada that the agri-food industry from the primary producer to 
the consumer, including the retail and the restaurant and hotel 
industry, employs 15 per cent of Canadian workers. It employs 
1.8 million Canadians and accounts for 8 per cent of our gross 
domestic product. It is an important industry.
<P>
	The government pledges to work even harder in order to make 
it even more successful and we look forward to the support of all 
the members in the House in doing so.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Elwin Hermanson (Kindersley-Lloydminster):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am pleased to rise today and speak to Bill C-49.
<P>
	This bill deals with the management of the federal 
Department of Agriculture. As you know, Mr. Speaker, anything 
that impacts on agriculture is important to me as a farmer and is 
also important to a great number of my constituents in 
Kindersley-Lloydminster as agriculture is the leading industry 
of the riding.
<P>
	In my opinion and the opinion of my caucus this House does 
not discuss agricultural issues nearly enough and government 
action is even more rare. We did see a little bit of action when 
cabinet was expanded the other day. We now have I believe a 
minister of state with responsibilities for agriculture. I guess 
that is well and good but the call I am hearing from the industry 
is not that the cabinet be expanded but that some of the issues 
that are near and dear to the industry be dealt with in a real, 
sincere and effective manner.
<P>
	I heard a rather humorous description of a man who was 
adjusting his tie while his pants were on fire. I think that 
application might apply to the current minister of agriculture 
who gave a very eloquent speech. There was very little in it that 
any of us could find fault with. We all want the best for our 
industry. The fact is that there are a lot of problems in the 
industry. Until we act, our eloquence is rather hollow and rather 
empty.
<P>
	Most reforms to the agriculture sector have one of two results. 
Either money is taken out of the farmers' pockets through 
program cuts or a department reshuffling is initiated, leading to 
more bureaucracy and red tape. If anything, this bill seems to 
fall into the second category.
<P>
	Farmers have made it clear that they are ready for action on a 
number of very important issues. Instead, the first bill that the 
minister has brought to us in this session is one that opts to 
perform some cosmetic changes to the department, shuffles 
some chairs around and hires a few more inspectors. It would 
seem that the minister is deliberately ignoring the issues of most 
concern to the agri-food industry.
<P>
	For instance there is widespread consensus across the prairie 
provinces for a producer plebiscite on barley marketing. 
Opinion polls, farm groups and surveys, including one that I did 
in my constituency, show that a vast majority of farmers support 
holding a producer plebiscite. In my constituency a survey 
indicated that 93 per cent of Canadian Wheat Board permit 
holders would support a plebiscite to determine how they 
market their barley. The strength of these numbers indicate that 
those on both sides of the issue are eager to resolve the question 
in a democratic manner.
<P>
	In fact the Prime Minister before the election called for a 
plebiscite on this issue. Why is this minister not taking action 
regarding this democratic initiative? He seems more interested 
in rejigging his department than acting on issues of importance 
to farmers.
<P>
<B>(1255) </B>
<P>
	Another issue concerns the Canadian Wheat Board. All 
farmers know that the current board is out of date and 
unresponsive to the needs of producers. There are some 
elements of the western Canadian press that are sounding the 
demise of the wheat board. The Reformers believe that a vibrant 
and responsive wheat board that gives farmers choices would be 
preferable to eliminating the board.
<P>
	Most farmers are calling for a democratized wheat board that 
will listen to farmers, meet their needs and change with the 
times. Again, this question was included in a survey in my 
riding. In fact 96 per cent of Canadian Wheat Board permit 
holders in the riding of Kindersley-Lloydminster in the survey 
we conducted supported democratization of the Canadian Wheat 
Board. In other words, take control of the wheat board out of the 
hands of the politicians and give it to the producers as is the case 
with most marketing institutions in Canada.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6099"> 6099 </A></B>
<P>
	It seems that the minister would rather introduce 
housekeeping measures that have more to do with relabelling 
bureaucrats than accomplishing anything for farmers.
<P>
	There are some very constructive things that can be done to 
reform the department of agriculture and will have positive 
results for producers.
<P>
	It is my contention and that of my Reform colleagues that the 
purpose of funds earmarked for agriculture support should 
primarily be to assist agriculture producers who, through no 
fault of their own, find themselves financially disadvantaged.
<P>
	I remind the minister of agriculture that at present there are a 
total of 41 different agriculture programs at the federal level, 
286 more provincial programs, and 22 joint federal-provincial 
programs. That brings the total number to 349 separate support 
programs for agriculture, each one administered and accounted 
for separately.
<P>
	The administrative cost of running so many different and 
often overlapping and outdated programs is rather staggering. 
Over $2 billion per year is spent by the minister of agriculture, 
of which over $700 million is spent on operating and capital 
costs alone. These figures do not include the $728 million spent 
under the Western Grain Transportation Act. I believe those 
figures are for the year 1992. They have been reduced somewhat 
since.
<P>
	This appallingly high level of overhead signals 
mismanagement because of overmanagement. By consolidating 
all those federal programs and initiatives into three or four the 
government could save many millions of dollars and provide 
better support to the industry as a result.
<P>
	We must expose the myth that more money spent always 
results in more effective programs. In the case of agriculture it is 
not only possible to provide better support with fewer dollars 
but it is essential to the long term sustainability of the industry 
given the bad financial shape of the government.
<P>
	The government has a moral obligation to the next generation 
of farmers to ensure that whatever programs it has in place today 
will remain economically viable for tomorrow. At present with a 
$40 billion annual deficit this government is not living up to its 
moral obligation.
<P>
	Reform of agriculture programs is essential because we must 
be able to defend the cost of agriculture support to taxpayers, 
consumers and future generations. Support programs that 
protect farmers and producers from situations beyond their 
control are defensible and desirable for the maintenance of the 
agricultural industry.
<P>
	My colleagues in this House have proposed three major 
programs that we support. I will not review those in their 
entirety today but I will list them because we believe they are 
defensible programs. They include an actuarially sound 
federal-provincial producer funded  crop insurance program. 
They also include an income stabilization program that is a 
whole farm program available to all sectors of the industry. The 
third program that we suggest would be a trade distortion 
adjustment program designed to compensate exporting 
producers as a direct countermeasure to foreign subsidies.
<P>
	My colleagues and I believe that if these improved programs 
are targeted to those producers who need them there will be 
many benefits.
<P>
	A couple of them I might list are support dollars that are 
strategically targeted to increase their effectiveness manifold. 
Why are we just spending money in all directions where there is 
not a quantifiable need? Also, by delivering support more 
directly to the farmer rather than through a large bureaucracy the 
money gets to where it is needed and it gets there faster.
<P>
<B>(1300 ) </B>
<P>
	These are just a few examples of how the minister can 
increase his effectiveness and the effectiveness of his 
department for those farmers in need of support and at the same 
time reduce the burden to taxpayers. These are the kinds of 
things the government should be doing. Simply making a few 
internal housekeeping changes to the department is not going to 
affect producers in any meaningful way.
<P>
	Rather than making some of these reforms that move the 
agricultural industry forward the minister is content to shuffle 
his department around. The minister is adjusting his tie while 
his pants are on fire. In other words, there are serious problems 
in agriculture that need urgent attention and here we are in the 
House today debating a recycled Tory reorganization bill.
<P>
	If we look at the minister's record of action we can see why 
farmers and producers from all across Canada are unhappy with 
his performance. I will list a few of the minister's non 
accomplishments. The minister signed the GATT agreement the 
way that we forecast he would during the last election campaign. 
He did not change a thing, contrary to the promises in the red ink 
book.
<P>
	We recognized the decision that had to be made while the 
Liberals and other parties in this House were reticent to accept 
the fact that Reform indicated the deal would be signed more or 
less the way it was signed. The agriculture minister had to sign 
the GATT deal more or less the way it had been negotiated in 
spite of promises to the contrary.
<P>
	Our agriculture minister bungled the grain transportation 
system effectiveness last year which led to a disastrous year for 
many producers. Producers are worried about the same thing 
occurring this year because very little has been done to put 
safeguards in the transportation system that would not allow a 
reoccurrence of last year's paralyzed system.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6100"> 6100 </A></B>
<P>
	The agriculture minister is stalling on the issue of 
backtracking of grain from Thunder Bay. The date has been set 
back and we have not seen anything of substance that would 
indicate he is even going to meet the targets he set.
<P>
	Of even more concern is that the minister of agriculture has 
caved in on his commitment to defend durum producers in 
Canada by agreeing to export quotas to the United States when 
all of the cards were in our deck and we were in the right and the 
Americans were in the wrong. Yet we caved in and handicapped 
our producers who were discovering a great export market for 
their product where the customer had cash on the barrel head to 
pay for the product.
<P>
	Our agriculture minister has labelled Canadian farmers as 
criminals for wanting to export their own grain to the United 
States. Rather than rectifying the problem he has lashed out at 
the producers he is supposed to represent. Our agriculture 
minister has failed to reform the Canadian Wheat Board even 
though most farmers are calling for it. Our minister of 
agriculture has failed to consolidate support programs for the 
agricultural industry, as I mentioned earlier in my speech. He 
has failed to reduce the proportion of agriculture bureaucrats to 
farmers. I believe at this time there is one bureaucrat for every 
three to five farmers. It depends on where the figures come 
from.
<P>
	This minister talks about consulting with producers. 
Certainly there is no one and no party more warm to the idea of 
consulting with people than the Reform Party. As my colleague 
from Moose Jaw-Lake Centre said, we have seen 
consultations, we have seen studies, we have seen a lot of 
producers and producer groups do an immeasurable amount of 
work in putting forward proposals that once they have come to 
the cabinet table get put on a shelf and nothing comes of it or the 
final product is far removed from what was indicated through 
the consultation process.
<P>
	We would urge this minister to move beyond the consultation 
process and move into the action mode where he either acts on 
the judgment and wisdom of producers who have spoken in the 
past or in a democratic fashion allows producers to make 
decisions such as on the wheat board and the marketing of 
barley.
<P>
	The minister must get around to doing something. We cannot 
consult forever until the industry wanes and becomes weakened 
over time through inaction.
<P>
	In his speech the minister talked briefly about Wayne 
Gretzky. Of course being a hockey fan I perked up immediately 
when he said Wayne Gretzky said he scored because he shot the 
puck. My concern is that our agriculture minister is not even on 
the ice. If he is on the ice he has not even gone over his blue line 
yet. It is a concern that many producers share.
<P>
	I hope the minister has listened to the suggestions that I have 
put forward sharply. I admit I put them forward sharply because 
I believe that action is required. However, they are in a spirit of 
constructive criticism. My desire is that the government will 
very soon stop putting forward administrative bills and finally 
act to improve the agriculture industry.
<P>
<B>(1305 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Morris Bodnar (Saskatoon-Dundurn):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
perhaps I could remind the hon. member for 
Kindersley-Lloydminster that the minister, wherever he is on 
the ice, has such a slapshot that he can score from any position.
<P>
	On his criticism of the minister with respect to the durum 
quotas I wish to remind the hon. member that the cap that has 
been agreed to is higher than the average of shipments to the 
United States over the last number of years.
<P>
	My question for this member is one with respect to the 
Canadian Wheat Board and the criticism of the minister again as 
to the shipping of grain into the United States. My question is 
very simple. Does the member and his party support the 
Canadian Wheat Board and the maintenance of the Canadian 
Wheat Board?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hermanson:</B> Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the hon. 
member's questions.
<P>
	I want to speak briefly with regard to the durum cap that he 
mentioned. It was either the minister of agriculture or his 
parliamentary secretary who talked about the fast and rapid 
changes in agriculture.
<P>
	I agree. As I said, the minister of agriculture was very 
eloquent in his presentation. Who could help but applaud 
motherhood and apple pie? What we have seen with regard to 
durum exports to the United States is a rather rapid increase in 
those exports to the point in the last three or four years at which 
we have seen a great market develop which our producers were 
filling and being paid a good dollar for their product.
<P>
	What the minister of agriculture has in effect done is cut those 
exports in half in a growing market that could have expanded. 
While the minister recognizes that there are rapid changes in 
agriculture, he is stifling those very positive changes. One of the 
few positive changes in agriculture he in effect axed and said we 
will go back to the average, which is half of what producers 
could have expected to export had the minister stood his ground, 
stood up to the free trade agreement that was signed with the 
Americans, which protected our producers and gave us access to 
that American market.
<P>
	That is an indefensible position. As the leader of the Reform 
Party said, it was a cream puff move and we are appalled that the 
minister would put our own producers at such a disadvantage 
and allow or disallow them such a good market.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6101"> 6101 </A></B>
<P>
	With regard to the Canadian Wheat Board, yes the Reform 
Party is on record. We campaigned in support of the Canadian 
Wheat Board. I have mentioned this in the House before. Times 
are changing. When my father was a young man and delivered 
his own grain he had to deliver it with horses and a wagon 
20-some miles and when he got to the point of delivery, there 
was only one person who would buy it. That person would offer 
him a price in grade and dockage over which he had no 
bargaining position whatsoever. If he did not like the deal he 
had to harness his horses and drive them another day's drive 
back to the farm, not a good use of time in those days when 
one was really busy.
<P>
	Today it is a different situation. It is 1994, with numerous 
marketing options. Our concern is that the wheat board has been 
hindered by politicians getting too involved. Producers are in 
charge of their own marketing boards in most cases, the wheat 
board is the odd man out.
<P>
	Even the Ontario Wheat Board, which markets the wheat for 
Ontario producers, is controlled by producers. It is only the 
Canadian Wheat Board which is confined to the prairie region 
that is controlled by government.
<P>
	If producers control that board, they will make the right 
decisions for producers and if they make a mistake, they will 
correct it very quickly. If governments make a mistake-believe 
me, it has made several-it will never own up to those mistakes 
and will harm the producers it is supposed to be protecting.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley East):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
appreciated the comments of the hon. member on how to better 
enhance our agri-food industry.
<P>
	Given the fact that Canada is rapidly becoming more 
urbanized, perhaps he would comment on some of his proposals 
on how a triple-E Senate would enhance farmers' representation 
in Parliament.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The Chair is having a little difficulty 
seeing how a triple-E Senate relates to the contents of the 
member's speech but I am sure the hon. member can make it 
relevant.
<P>
<B>(1310 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hermanson:</B> Actually I have no problem, Mr. Speaker, 
responding to that question.
<P>
	In the United States and even in Australia where there is a 
triple-E senate the agricultural industry has much more clout in 
decision making at a national or federal level.
<P>
	If we look at states such as Iowa, Montana, South Dakota and 
North Dakota where there are two elected senators representing 
those states, the same number as Texas, New York and 
California, we realize that our Senate which is appointed-and 
we saw the type of appointments, always patronage 
appointments with no responsibility to the people they are 
supposed to represent-certainly is not likely to be very 
interested in agriculture. It handicaps the more sparsely 
populated  regions of the country which tend to be agricultural 
regions.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jerry Pickard (Essex-Kent):</B> Mr. Speaker, thank you 
for allowing me to speak on the debate on Bill C-49.
<P>
	My colleague, the parliamentary secretary to the minister of 
agriculture, has spoken about the department's relationship in 
the agri-industry. I would like to discuss another important 
aspect of this bill, its recognition of agriculture and agri-food's 
role in research and development.
<P>
	When the department of agriculture was first established the 
minister was given responsibility for experimental farm stations 
whose research concentrated on crops and livestock. Since then 
the role of the department has greatly expanded. The proposed 
legislation simply reflects today's realities.
<P>
	AAFC's research efforts are still involved with crops and 
livestock but they have been taken far beyond the farm gate. The 
department is now committed to helping not just farmers but 
also the entire agri-food sector become more competitive here 
and abroad.
<P>
	The department is working on non-food uses in agricultural 
products. For example, it is looking at new pharmaceuticals and 
grain based fuels like ethanol. It is also trying to develop and 
promote environmentally sustainable practices in agriculture 
and the agri-food industry such as biological pest controls.
<P>
	What does this mean for the average Canadian? Let me put it 
in perspective. Many people do not realize that they owe their 
daily bread quite literally to Agriculture Canada research. 
Virtually all the varieties of wheat grown in this country were 
developed by scientists employed by the federal government of 
agriculture. They are constantly working to improve our plant 
and animal varieties and because of their work we enjoy 
plentiful, wholesome and certainly some of the least expensive 
food in the world.
<P>
	Perhaps the most spectacular success story for government 
and universal research is that of rapeseed, known today as 
canola. In World War II rapeseed oil was used as a marine 
lubricant. Nobody thought of putting it on salad at that time. 
Government scientists working with universities saw the 
potential of rapeseed and worked to breed out the toxic elements 
in rapeseed and create a new strain of nutritious properties. 
Canola is now the most valuable single crop, worth one billion 
dollars a year.
<P>
	The department continues to do outstanding work in plant and 
animal breeding. It is now exploiting some of the possibilities of 
new techniques in genetic engineering and biotechnology.
<P>
	We have all heard of the human genome project whose goal is 
to identify and record every element in our DNA. On a some-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6102"> 6102 </A></B>
<P>
what smaller scale, our agricultural scientists are trying to 
decipher the DNA pattern of the common oat. AAFC's Ottawa 
based plant research centre is working with Quaker Oats of 
Canada and three  American universities on this gene mapping 
project. Once we know what the oats are made of we can make 
even better ones.
<P>
	In the agri-food sector innovative research is not a luxury. In 
a world of rapidly evolving markets technology is giving 
farmers and food companies new ways to meet their customers' 
needs. New foods and food processing techniques could 
stimulate economic growth and create many more jobs for 
Canadians.
<P>
<B>(1315 ) </B>
<P>
	The Canadian agri-food industry must remain 
technologically competitive. Continuing high quality research 
is fundamental to keeping Canada a world leader in agriculture 
and agri-food.
<P>
	AAFC is managing to maintain a strong R and D capability 
even in the face of budgetary restraint. Increasing the 
government's budget for agri-food R and D may not be possible, 
but at least we can keep what we have.
<P>
	The Minister of Agriculture and Agri-food has made it clear 
that his strong commitment is to research. However, we need to 
reallocate some of the funding. To do this, AAFC intends to 
reduce costs and spend smarter. It will ensure that research 
priorities are driven by market opportunities, in other words, by 
doing research that pays.
<P>
	A good example of this is sunola, a hardy miniature sunflower 
developed by the Saskatoon Research Centre. Royalties from 
certified seed sales will go back to the station's budget and it 
will form more joint ventures with the private sector. The 
department is working to ensure its research meets market 
needs. Input from industry helps the research branch set its 
priorities. Government scientists are encouraged to attend 
market focus workshops. At one of these events last year 
AAFC's research branch, eastern region, unveiled 13 potential 
new technologies; of these 11 were judged to have great market 
potential.
<P>
	The agri-food industry has become an increasingly active 
partner in research since Treasury Board allowed the department 
to take outside money, including financial support, retention of 
revenues and royalties. Industry investment in federal 
government agri-food research has been moved up from $5 
billion in 1989 to approximately $18 billion today.
<P>
	During the past year the department has run a pilot project 
called the matching investment initiative. The department 
matched every dollar the private sector was willing to put into 
agri-food research. Two million dollars in federal funding was 
put into this pilot project this year and this amount could grow 
substantially in coming years.
<P>
	Obviously the industry would not make this kind of 
investment unless it thought research well worth while. When 
the results come in, the department does not have to waste its 
time looking for a buyer, because the results are pre-sold. That 
is why public-private joint ventures can turn theoretical 
knowledge into practical applications, and much more quickly 
and easily.
<P>
	Agri-food research brings many kinds of benefits. Scientific 
breakthroughs in our laboratories not only add to the store of 
human knowledge but also help to raise our standard of living 
both economically and environmentally.
<P>
	Consider the case of ethanol. It could be a miracle fuel of the 
21st century. It is based on a renewable resource, our surplus 
grain stocks, and it is cleaner burning than conventional 
gasoline thus less harmful to the environment. Ethanol and other 
biomass fuels could be the nucleus of a whole new industry and a 
tremendous economic boost for rural Canada. AAFC scientists 
are helping to make this happen. Some day, thanks to them, we 
may export both ethanol and ethanol technology to an energy 
hungry world.
<P>
	This is not a fantasy. There are promising projects in 
biotechnology under way right now in AAFC's research labs 
that would have been dismissed a few years back as science 
fiction.
<P>
	Would you believe that our molecule biologists are working 
on a natural sweetener called stevioside that is 300 times more 
powerful than sugar? That AAFC's scientists are using 
discarded crab shells to create a truly biodegradable packing 
material? Genetically engineered enzymes from the stomachs of 
cows may be used some day instead of toxic chlorine for 
bleaching fabrics and paper. Not to mention the custom-made 
micro-organisms that AAFC is introducing for the use as natural 
insecticides and fertilizers.
<P>
<B>(1320) </B>
<P>
	Experience has shown that agriculture R and D is one of the 
best investments we can make. A number of studies done in 
Canada have shown that return on investment in agri-food 
research can exceed 50 per cent. Findings in the U.S. show 
similar high rates of return. It is an engine of growth in every 
sense and we must take advantage of that opportunity.
<P>
	With the help of our partners in the private sector we should 
capitalize on many more such opportunities in the future.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Elwin Hermanson (Kindersley-Lloydminster):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I would love to ask a question about the Senate but I 
will refrain.
<P>
	The hon. member talked extensively about research and it is 
an issue that is important to discuss. We also have to talk about 
how to fund research. Quite often the check-off system is used 
as a mechanism to garner funds for research.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6103"> 6103 </A></B>
<P>
	I would like to get the hon. member's opinion on whether 
check-offs should be voluntary or whether they should be 
involuntary. Does he support the concept of how the levels for 
check-offs should be determined, and how they could enhance 
the funding for research in agriculture?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Pickard:</B> Mr. Speaker, it truly is important to realize how 
research has affected the agricultural industry over the years. 
Over the past 40 years every dollar spent on R and D has 
returned many more dollars.
<P>
	At the ag committee hearings just yesterday Professor 
McEwen of the University of Guelph gave some really 
interesting observations on research and development.
<P>
	We have doubled the production per cow in the milk industry. 
We produce about the same amount of milk that we did 40 years 
ago with half the number of cows. In the pork industry we 
produce 80 per cent more lean pork than 40 years ago using far 
less feed. In the 1950s it required three kilograms of feed to 
produce a dozen eggs. Today 1.5 kilograms can do the same job. 
In Prince Edward Island 40 years ago an acre of land produced 
some 200 bushels of potatoes. Today farmers would consider it 
disastrous if they did not get 500 bushels per acre. That shows 
the importance of R and D.
<P>
	Where do we go with R and D expenditures and how do we 
bring those forward? It was a very innovative and a very strong 
move on behalf of the government to open the unique venture 
between business and government in order to fund research and 
development. In that way we can spend smart as was suggested 
by the minister. We have to use joint ventures in order to 
establish what the industry wishes to engage in, how they wish 
to move along the research and development, and where we wish 
to be in the future.
<P>
	If industry sees research projects as very vital and worth while 
it will be willing to fund part of that effort. Therefore the major 
direction of funding in the future will be joint ventures between 
government and industry in order to move our research and 
development forward.
<P>
	I really believe that new innovations, new initiatives in 
research and development are very critical to our country. 
Therefore in answering I would suggest that the way to fund 
research and development and to move it forward is for industry 
and government to move in the same direction with the same 
agendas in trying to accomplish the same goals.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hermanson:</B> Mr. Speaker, I am not sure if I did not 
phrase my question clearly enough or perhaps the member was 
not listening. Maybe I should have asked a question about the 
Senate.
<P>
<B>(1325 ) </B>
<P>
	My question to the member on the other side was specifically 
about raising funding for research through check-offs. Maybe 
the member does not know what a check-off is. It is where you 
take a percentage of the receipts of an agricultural product, such 
as so many cents a tonne on wheat or so many cents a litre on 
milk or whatever and you then designate that funding for 
research.
<P>
	My question was whether or not he supported the use of 
check-offs to raise funding for research. If so, how should that 
be administered? What should the levels be? Should those 
check-offs be voluntary or involuntary? In other words, should 
producers be required to participate in a check-off program or 
should they have the option of participating?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Pickard:</B> Mr. Speaker, I was trying to expand the 
viewpoint of the House leader. He seems to be in a very narrow 
position on research and development.
<P>
	I would support a voluntary check-off system where the 
industry puts in money. It has the opportunity to participate or 
not in the check-off system. I do not have a problem with that. 
However, it is very important to realize that research has a very 
broad base and is certainly not just restricted to commodity 
groups but also many other sources in the country in order to 
develop science, technology, research or whatever in the future.
<P>
	I tried to point out how far Canada has gone in research. We as 
a nation should be very proud of where we have gone and where 
we are today. Our research is certainly above and beyond that of 
most countries of the world. We can sell that technology to other 
countries. We have done very well. If we consider from where 
we have come with wheat and the developments we have made, 
we are a very fortunate nation.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The Chair is in a difficult position 
because the member began speaking at 1.10 p.m, and clearly his 
time would end at 1.30 p.m. I would like all members to be 
aware of the fact that if questions go back and forth for another 
three minutes the question will not be put today.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley East):</B> Mr. Speaker, just a 
short question. If the member cannot answer the question about 
check-offs, I wonder what his opinion is of the triple-E Senate 
and how it would help the agricultural industry?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Pickard:</B> Mr. Speaker, I think members of the Reform 
Party have a major problem today in paying attention to what is 
being debated. They seem intent on keeping the question of a 
triple-E Senate in front of agriculture. It is really a questionable 
approach to take in the House.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="6104"> 6104 </A></B>
<P>
	However, I believe that the problem is not with the 
government. The problem is with the opposition. Many times 
I have seen the press point out how ineffective it is. That 
ineffectiveness is showing right now.
<P>
	(Motion agreed to, bill read the second time and referred to a 
committee.)
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> It being 1.30 p.m., the House will now 
proceed to the consideration of Private Members' Business as 
listed on today's Order Paper.

	<B>Mr. Art Hanger (Calgary Northeast)</B> moved:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That, in the opinion of this House, the government should regulate the testing, 
under Sections 11(1) and (3) of the Immigration Act, of all applicants for 
immigration to Canada for H.I.V., and that a positive result of an H.I.V. screening 
be included, under the terms of Section 19(1) of the Immigration Act, as grounds 
for the inadmissibility to Canada of the applicant for landing.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	He said: Mr. Speaker, it is an honour to rise in the House and 
address my hon. colleagues to argue this issue, although I do not 
think there is much of an argument in this case.
<P>
	This motion to require the regulation of HIV testing for all 
applicants for immigration and the barring of those who test 
positive for HIV and AIDS from immigration to Canada is really 
only common sense. However, often common sense gets lost 
where immigration is concerned.
<P>
	Let me briefly provide some background on this issue so that 
all members of this House can understand the importance of this 
issue and the importance of passing this motion. I do not need to 
tell anyone in this House that HIV and AIDS, and I use those 
terms interchangeably for obvious reasons, is a plague whose 
potential for death while having been intolerable and 
heartbreaking has yet to reach its terrible potential.
<P>
	Thousands of Canadians have been afflicted with this 
condition. Thousands more may be. As tragic and devastating as 
this disease has been in Canada, AIDS in Canada has not reached 
the terrible scope that it has in many other nations, primarily 
developing nations around the world. There are nations in Africa 
where estimates put the rate of HIV infection at 20 per cent or 
more. That is a statistic that should sadden and terrify us all.
<P>
	There is no question that the prevention of AIDS has been a 
priority for Canadians. We have engaged in education 
campaigns, campaigns to clean up our blood supply, efforts to 
prevent those with the disease from spreading it any further. 
However, there is one area of control, an obvious area, that no 
government has made an effort to enforce, in immigration.
<P>
	The Immigration Act is clear on a couple of points. First, the 
protection of Canadian health and safety must be the priority of 
our policy. Second, anyone who suffers from a condition that 
would place an excess demand on our social or health services 
should be considered inadmissible to Canada. The language in 
the Immigration Act is as simple and straightforward as that.
<P>
	In order to fulfil the mandate of the Immigration Act the 
immigration department conducts routine testing of all 
immigrants and refugees who apply for landing in Canada. To 
the credit of our immigration medical regulations it is a rigorous 
test. Here are a few of the things that we currently test for: 
tuberculosis, hepatitis, diabetes, debilitating physical 
conditions and even syphilis. Sexually transmitted diseases are 
currently tested for. Those who have them are screened out with 
the exception of the most dangerous of all sexually transmitted 
diseases, the one transmitted disease that is 100 per cent fatal, 
AIDS.
<P>
	Why? That is a good question. I have asked that question on 
many occasions. Here are some of the answers I have received 
from the department and from the minister. I have been told by 
high ranking members of the immigration department that 
HIV-AIDS is not a contagious disease.
<P>
	I am not kidding. They have told me that AIDS is not 
contagious. Of course they went on to explain that in their terms 
contagious means something that you can catch in the air from 
someone's breath or from a touch. Apparently you cannot 
contract AIDS in those fashions but everyone knows that AIDS 
is a highly communicable disease. To say that we need not test 
immigrants for HIV because it is not contagious is either the 
height of semantic stupidity or is political correctness that could 
cost hundreds if not thousands of lives and untold millions of 
dollars.
<P>
<B>(1335 ) </B>
<P>
	I have asked the minister if his government advocates the 
testing of immigrants for AIDS. He told me that the discretion 
for testing and recommending inadmissibility lies with the 
doctors overseas.
<P>
	He said that if doctors detect traces of AIDS then they can, if 
they want to, recommend that someone not be allowed into 
Canada. I am not sure what traces of AIDS means. I suspect that 
the minister meant symptoms.
<P>
	Needless to say, there are no symptoms of HIV. There is no 
way other than through a quick, cheap and easy to administer 
blood test to determine whether someone is infected. I said 
cheap in my last statement because several people have 
approached me asking how much this will cost. The answer is 
not much, from what I understand.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6105"> 6105 </A></B>
<P>
	The AIDS test is one of the most routinely performed of all 
blood screenings. Blood screenings are already performed on 
all immigrants and the cost of including the HIV screening 
would be negligible. Even if it were a significant cost, so what? 
We are literally talking about life and death.
<P>
	Should someone come to Canada infected with HIV, we the 
taxpayers are looking at a minimum cost of $200,000. That is a 
minimum cost to treat each patient until death. That is a cost we 
cannot bear.
<P>
	The risk of admitting immigrants with HIV who likely do not 
even know that they are infected is one we cannot tolerate. I 
have asked immigration officials who are currently working on a 
new set of immigration medical inadmissability guidelines if 
HIV infection will be reason enough to declare someone 
inadmissible if we somehow find out that they have the disease. 
The answer was no.
<P>
	They told me the same sort of logic which only some 
bureaucrats are capable of that the new guidelines use a five year 
window of medical service consumption. If an immigrant is not 
expected to use more than the average of medical services 
within five years of coming to Canada, then they are admitted.
<P>
	Thus, HIV is not on the list because someone with HIV could 
remain relatively healthy for up to five years despite the fact that 
after five years, whenever AIDS kicks in-it undoubtedly 
will-the costs will be enormous and the risk before that time of 
transmission is great.
<P>
	Also, now that doctors around the world have recognized the 
existence of HIV-2, a new strain of the disease that often takes 
much longer than five years to develop into full blown AIDS, 
there is even more reason to conclude that the five year cost 
guidelines the ministry has come up with do not make sense, not 
for this disease. That is precisely why we need the government 
to take specific action on this specific disease.
<P>
	Canada is currently not testing for HIV because one, it is not 
contagious; two, doctors need to look for symptoms even though 
there are not any; and three, it is not expensive to treat. That is 
the logic coming out of the immigration system currently.
<P>
	Clearly we need to jump start the immigration department 
into exercising a little logic in looking after the best interests of 
Canadians. This motion, when implemented into the 
immigration regulations, will provide that jump start.
<P>
	I simply do not understand why this government has held out 
on the implementation of this measure but on my cynical days I 
think there may be some special interests that have the ears of 
this minister and previous ministers of immigration and that 
have nixed this common sense measure.
<P>
	In case my colleagues on either side of this House think that 
voting for this motion would cost them votes or would raise the 
ire of a significant number of people, let me reassure members 
that it will not.
<P>
	Let me also assure members that voting against this measure 
would cost votes. Allow me to provide some evidence to back 
this up. The immigration association conducted a poll over the 
summer.
<P>
<B>(1340 ) </B>
<P>
	One of the questions that was asked of over 1,000 people 
nationwide was whether they think people with incurable, 
contagious diseases should be permitted to immigrate into 
Canada. The result was 77 per cent of the respondents said they 
should not. Anecdotally, a radio station poll was conducted in 
Calgary just before the summer asking the same question. This 
time it was dramatic, if unscientific. Ninety-four per cent said 
that those with HIV should not be permitted to immigrate into 
Canada.
<P>
	When was the last time any issue received this kind of 
consensus? That is the point. There is consensus on this issue. 
Granted, I have received letters from one or two individuals with 
a radical agenda who opposed my calls for HIV testing. That 
means little when compared with these numbers.
<P>
	I can assure my hon. colleagues this is a consensus issue. 
Canadians were shocked when I brought to light the fact that 
immigrants are not screened for AIDS. Now that they know, they 
do support the necessary changes.
<P>
	However, there is more to this than simply acting on the will 
of the Canadian people. Of course, that is a significant reason in 
itself for us to act. There is also the matter of doing what is best, 
doing what is right and doing what makes sense.
<P>
	Canadians, including the members of this House, want AIDS 
eliminated in Canada. There is no one who does not want to see 
this plague eliminated. Given that, why are we not taking the 
most basic, the most proactive, the most obvious measure 
possible to move ourselves down the road to doing away with 
AIDS in Canada, preventing those who carry this disease from 
coming into Canada?
<P>
	It boggles the imagination. I do not know how many of my 
constituents and citizens all over the country have written to me 
or have personally asked me how we could as a nation be so 
stupid as to not test immigrants for HIV and screen them out. My 
answer has been that I do not know.
<P>
	Why are we not doing it when virtually every other nation on 
earth is doing it, when countries like the United States have gone 
so far as to prevent those who admit to having the disease from 
even entering the country as visitors?
<P>
	Let me note this is not the intent of my motion. There is no 
way to screen visitors for HIV. Nor would it be feasible to 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6106"> 6106 </A></B>
<P>
consider doing so. This motion would only affect those who 
make an application either through the  immigration or refugee 
streams for permanent landing in Canada to become permanent 
residents.
<P>
	Let me speak a moment about the humanity of this motion. I 
have been criticized by one or two of my colleagues on the 
opposite side of the House for not being humanitarian, for not 
being sympathetic to the cause of those who want to immigrate 
into Canada and who carry HIV.
<P>
	Refusing immigration to Canada to anyone for any reason is 
not a pleasant task. Canada is the greatest nation on earth and 
one of the most desired of destinations for those who seek a new 
and better life in another land.
<P>
	For these reasons Canada receives more applications for 
immigration than we can accept, even though we are accepting 
far too many. Canada must say no to some. There is no way 
around that. We cannot take everyone who applies. Given this 
fact, we as Canadians and as a government have some hard 
choices to make.
<P>
	We have to devise rules that will screen out some and allow 
residency to others. In order to write good rules, in order to 
devise a just and appropriate screening process we must 
establish priorities.
<P>
	In my mind the priority that should overshadow all others is 
the protection of those who have already been admitted to 
Canada, or were born in Canada. There is no other way. We 
would be doing a grave injustice to our electorate if we were to 
hold any priority above its protection and the protection of the 
services that government administers for it.
<P>
<B>(1345 ) </B>
<P>
	When some people apply for immigration to Canada who have 
a disease that not only threatens the safety of Canadians but is 
guaranteed to place a burden on our already crumbling health 
care system that is nothing short of massive, we have no choice 
but to conclude that the acceptance in Canada of these people 
poses a serious safety and cost threat to Canadians. Such 
immigrants must be excluded so that a place can be opened up 
for someone else.
<P>
	Canada has no moral burden to accept everyone who applies 
to come to the country. We only have a burden to provide a good 
home for those whom we accept.
<P>
	We as legislators have a duty to ensure that only the best, only 
the most fit and only the most productive come to the country as 
immigrants. We have a duty to protect our constituents. We have 
a duty to enforce the preamble of the Immigration Act which 
charges us to protect the health, safety and good order of 
Canadian society.
<P>
	Immigration policy of late has failed in that duty. People have 
become disillusioned with immigration policy and with the 
people who implement it. They do not think that the right people 
are being allowed in and they see too many examples of good 
people being excluded. That has to change.
<P>
	The motion is a small step in restoring some legitimacy to the 
immigration program in Canada. This is a small step toward 
convincing Canadian people that their protection is really our 
top priority. This is a small step toward making the immigration 
program make sense.
<P>
	Let us take that step. Let us pass the motion in a non-partisan 
manner and improve immigration. In the process let us take 
another step that is just as, if not more, important toward 
preventing the spread of AIDS in Canada.
<P>
	When implemented the motion would be a significant step in 
the war on AIDS. No one loses. Everyone gains. The people of 
Canada gain increased safety and a lowering of the burden on 
our medical system. Legislators gain by voting yes on an 
overwhelmingly popular initiative. The government gains by 
being handed an order of the House to move on something that is 
long overdue. Immigrants gain by having the status of their 
health thoroughly checked.
<P>
	It is a hard decision to bar someone on medical grounds from 
coming to Canada as an immigrant, but so many people infected 
with this disease do not know that they are infected with the 
disease. While we will stop them from coming to Canada as 
immigrants, at the same time we could very well be providing an 
invaluable test and invaluable information to hundreds or 
thousands of people who may not know they are infected.
<P>
	We are not doing a disservice to those who are infected since 
their fate, I am afraid, is certain. However we could 
unintentionally be doing a service to those who are infected but 
do not know it.
<P>
	Finally, regulation is long overdue. It should be passed and it 
must be passed. There is no good reason for it not to be passed. It 
should not matter that the motion originated on this side of the 
House. Just let it pass and we will know we have done our job for 
the day and have taken a significant step forward in the 
protection of our citizens and the rationalization of Canada's 
embattled immigration program.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Mary Clancy (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Citizenship and Immigration):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is clear from 
our discussions that there are still a number of misconceptions 
regarding persons who are HIV positive or have AIDS. Despite 
extensive efforts at public education it is clear that prejudices 
about this terrible disease and the virus associated with it remain 
entrenched. The motion before us reflects somewhat this 
unfortunate attitude.
<P>
	Although I do not-and I want to make it very 
clear-question my hon. colleague's intentions, I do wonder if 
the motion is not based on certain mistaken and preconceived 
ideas. I would like to point out that it is incorrectly assumed by 
many that a positive result on an HIV test means that someone 
has AIDS. It 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6107"> 6107 </A></B>
<P>
is also incorrectly assumed that AIDS can be transmitted by 
simple contact. What is even worse, it is sometimes incorrectly 
assumed that someone who is HIV positive  has no further 
contribution to make to society. We all know that these ideas are 
false. Nevertheless they unfortunately continue to influence 
certain public perceptions.
<P>
<B>(1350) </B>
<P>
	Misperceptions about diseases, disabilities and afflictions are 
not new to Canada. All we have to do to find evidence of this is 
to examine the Immigration Act of 1952. If we examine it we 
will see that the question of obligatory HIV screening of 
immigration applicants has certain historical parallels.
<P>
	Back in 1952 protecting public health and safety was a key 
objective of legislators concerned with immigration to Canada 
as it is today. This was before Canada adopted a system of 
universal health insurance. The issue at hand was not a concern 
over an excessive burden on the health care system. 
Nevertheless the act listed various diseases and deficiencies that 
in themselves constituted sufficient grounds to deny someone 
admission to Canada.
<P>
	The act is far from subtle. It reflected the common prejudices 
of the time. It denied admission to Canada ``to idiots, imbeciles 
and the feeble-minded, epileptics, lunatics and individuals who 
are mute, blind or otherwise deficient from a physical point of 
view''. It denied access to Canada of ``immigrants who are 
dumb, blind or otherwise physically defective''. Attitudes about 
disabilities were different back then.
<P>
	In 1952 they did not consider an individual's capacity to live 
normally with a medical condition. They did not consider the 
possibility of calling on medical science to control a medical 
condition.
<P>
	Epilepsy, for example, was considered a ground for exclusion 
even when it was controlled. When a new Immigration Act was 
proclaimed in 1978 it offered, thank goodness, considerable 
progress over the old act, especially with respect to medical 
grounds for exclusion.
<P>
	Two important changes were made. First, the criterion of 
excessive demand was added. This measure was intended to 
protect the universal health insurance system that had been 
created nine years earlier. It was designed to protect the system 
from becoming overrun by people who had not paid into the 
system.
<P>
	Second, the list of illnesses and deficiencies that 
automatically made a person ineligible was eliminated. 
Inadmissibility was now decided by medical officers. These 
doctors now decided whether a person's condition represented a 
threat to public health or whether their condition would present 
an excessive demand on health or social services. For example, 
people with epilepsy could now be admitted to Canada if their 
condition was controllable.
<P>
	We have made much progress since 1952 and I believe we 
should continue to progress. Unfortunately it is my belief that 
the motion before us today would take us back to the attitudes 
that prevailed in 1952.
<P>
	The motion before us would specifically make a positive HIV 
test grounds for inadmissibility to Canada. This denies the 
progress in attitude toward diseases that has been made over the 
years. It denies the progress in medical attitudes and practice 
that has also changed. Above all, it denies the progress in our 
approach to AIDS that has also evolved.
<P>
	Our laws and our institutions must reflect this progress. As 
legislators we must take care to dispassionately analyse and 
reflect on issues that are too often fraught with prejudice and 
discrimination.
<P>
	As dedicated legislators we must take pains to avoid imposing 
our value judgments on others. We must take care to resist ill 
informed and preconceived ideas. We must be very careful to 
avoid being stampeded into adopting a policy that is more based 
on fear than it is on fact.
<P>
	I want to make our position very clear. The facts are 
unambiguous. People who have tested positive for HIV can live 
for many years without developing AIDS. AIDS is not a disease 
that can be transmitted by simple contact. People who are HIV 
positive can make a significant contribution to our society. 
Many of us have worked relentlessly to destroy the myths 
surrounding AIDS. Any decision that marks a step backward 
threatens to compromise the considerable progress we have 
made over the past few years.
<P>
	Our decision on this important issue has the potential to 
critically damage our international reputation for openness, 
fairness and justice. We must avoid this at all cost.
<P>
<B>(1355 ) </B>
<P>
	At the same time I appreciate the concern expressed about not 
imposing an excessive burden on our country's social and health 
services. This is a priority for the department of immigration 
and for the minister.
<P>
	I am confident we can arrive at a decision that is both fair and 
economical. That is why the government is reviewing the 
extensive information we have on HIV. We will be announcing 
our decision soon.
<P>
	I am sure my hon. colleague agrees this issue deserves our 
careful attention. The last time the medical provisions of the 
Immigration Act were reviewed was in 1978. That is why we are 
not about to rush into a hasty, ill conceived decision on this 
matter. We are devoting considerable care and attention to 
medical inadmissibility issues once again.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6108"> 6108 </A></B>
<P>
	I assure the hon. member that our decisions will 
appropriately reflect the health care system, social justice and 
economic matters that concern us today. I know the hon. 
member, with his very great concern in this area, would not 
want us to act hastily. I assure you, Mr. Speaker, the House and 
the hon. member that we will not.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Osvaldo Nunez (Bourassa):</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise to 
participate in this debate on motion M-285 requesting 
mandatory HIV screening for immigrants and prescribed classes 
of visitors.
<P>
	Section 11 of the Immigration Act states that every immigrant 
and every visitor of a prescribed class shall undergo a medical 
examination. The medical examination required under Section 
11(1) is defined in Section 11 as including a mental 
examination, a physical examination as well as a medical 
assessment of records respecting the immigrant or visitor.
<P>
	Section 19 lists the classes of inadmissible persons, from 
terrorists and war criminals to persons convicted of an offence 
committed in Canada or outside Canada and so on.
<P>
	In its present form, the motion tabled by my colleague the 
Reform Party member for Calgary Northeast therefore intends 
to bar entry to immigrants and visitors who are HIV-positive or 
have AIDS. In his opinion, this medical condition should be 
listed in Section 19 of the Immigration Act.
<P>
	The minister of immigration has already stated that it was 
currently possible for Canada to disqualify applicants who are 
H.I.V. positive or have AIDS. In 1993, 54 applications were 
rejected on those grounds. A medical officer needs only suspect 
such a condition for an AIDS test to be performed. If the 
diagnosis is positive, then two medical officers must agree to 
recommend that the application be rejected by government.
<P>
	The minister told the press that the reason for refusing in such 
cases is not the danger for public health but the financial burden 
it would impose on Canada's health care system. This provision 
would also be used to refuse admission to people with other 
diseases that require very costly medical care, like some 
cancers, kidney or heart diseases.
<P>
	The minister himself also pointed out that it would be 
important to ensure the reliability of tests in different countries 
before making the tests compulsory. As for refugee claimants, 
who must undergo a medical examination within 60 days of 
arriving in Canada, the minister surely considers it a sensitive 
issue, because he said that on one hand there are medical 
considerations and on the other a real fear of persecution.
<P>
<B>(1400) </B>
<P>
	This issue is also tied to human rights. The Department of 
Justice should look at this aspect of the issue before making a 
final decision on this.
<P>
	Immigrant selection based on AIDS screening is a matter for 
public debate. One of the arguments put forward in this debate is 
that excluding HIV-positive immigrants would limit 
transmission of the virus and reduce health-care costs 
associated with the treatment of immigrants with AIDS.
<P>
	To determine whether a specific minority of immigrants 
constitutes a financial burden on the public health-care system, 
we must look beyond the costs related to a particular disease. 
The economic burden for a given disease must be compared with 
that for other existing diseases on the basis of which immigrants 
are selected or rejected. This, of course, for the purpose of 
developing an immigration policy that is sensible, fair and, 
above all, free from any hint of discrimination.
<P>
	A group of researchers at the McGill Centre for Medicine, 
Ethics and Law in Montreal recently published a study 
comparing the cost of treating AIDS patients and the cost of 
treating coronary disease. In their study, the researchers used a 
model to project costs directly attributable to AIDS and 
coronary disease over the ten-year period following the arrival 
of immigrants who entered Canada in 1988.
<P>
	The model has three components: first, estimating the cost of 
screening immigrants for AIDS; second, estimating the cost of 
treating immigrants with AIDS; and third, estimating the cost of 
treating immigrants suffering from coronary disease.
<P>
	The results of the study may come as a surprise to some 
people. It is estimated that after ten years, the total direct cost of 
HIV-related health care would be $18.5 million. Over the same 
ten-year period, the total cost of treating immigrants suffering 
from coronary disease would be $21.6 million.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	There is no effective screening method for detecting an 
increasing risk of developing clinical coronary heart disease. 
However, excluding all immigrants over the age of 50 years old 
would potentially save $14 million of the expected $21.6 
million in cost attributable to coronary heart disease.
<P>
	With regard to the reliability of the testing itself, we know it is 
not 100 per cent sure. In fact, three consecutive tests are needed 
to confirm positive HIV infection in a person. This process, time 
consuming and costly, will fail to detect close to 10 per cent of 
HIV carriers.
<P>
	The study I am talking about assumed the testing to be done in 
Canada so that the false results could be reduced. How could the 
Canadian government possibly control the quality of testing in 
other countries? A similar problem produced itself in 1981 when 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6109"> 6109 </A></B>
<P>
costly  testing for intestinal parasites in prospective immigrants 
were abolished partly because of the inability to control the 
quality of testing in overseas laboratories.
<P>
	All of these facts speak clearly against the introduction of 
AIDS testing of prospective immigrants and refugees. I have not 
even spoken about ethical considerations, which would seem 
just as important in the discussion. After all, applying a criterion 
for one disease and not for another is simply discriminatory. 
Testing for AIDS would also reinforce stereotyping and 
discrimination for prospective immigrants or refugees, whether 
it be in this country or the country they would be forced to return 
to.
<P>
<B>(1405) </B>
<P>
	The spreading of AIDS must not be labelled as originating 
from visitors or new residents to this country, but must rather be 
seen in its global context. In other words, if the Canadian 
government were to impose obligatory AIDS testing, how could 
it justify not spending an equal amount of tax dollars on 
educational programs aimed at preventing the spreading of this 
disease? Prevention is the only way to control AIDS, which is 
surely better than spending millions on a testing which gives 
absolutely no concrete results.

[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	For all these reasons the Bloc Quebecois will vote against this

<P>
	<B>Mr. Rey D. Pagtakhan (Winnipeg North):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
thank you for your kind consideration. I am pleased to debate the 
private member's motion put forward by the member for 
Calgary Northeast which in essence asks the government to 
make it mandatory to test applicants for immigration to Canada 
for the AIDS virus, also known as HIV.
<P>
	Because of its severity, its infectious pandemic nature, the 
lack of a preventive vaccine and an effective treatment, AIDS 
had in the past engendered a great deal of fear among the general 
public, employers, insurance companies, schools and even 
health care workers.
<P>
	Today the very mention of the term AIDS which once struck 
fear into the hearts of almost all still frightens some. Fear can 
elicit two opposite behaviours. It can compel one to take 
preventive measures, which is laudable, or it can drive out the 
compassion one would normally feel for those living with the 
disease, which would be a tragedy.
<P>
	Fear of AIDS was often based on misunderstanding or 
misinformation. But as research adds to our knowledge and 
understanding of HIV and as public education dispels the myths 
which surround it, much of that fear has now subsided. 
Compassion for the patients and the victims of the virus has 
returned. I am therefore concerned that the motion before us and 
the action it proposes play upon the unfounded fears of the past.
<P>
	The motion could resurrect public misunderstanding about 
HIV and cause undue panic and unnecessary suffering without 
serving any public health good. This misunderstanding could be 
directed toward immigrants even though immigrants now in 
Canada are no more likely to test positive for HIV than are 
Canadians born in this country.
<P>
	I am concerned that we might unwittingly or wittingly stir up 
resentment against immigrants without achieving any benefit to 
public health and safety or to our health care system. We need to 
keep things in perspective.
<P>
	Medical experts do not consider HIV to be a threat to public 
health or safety in the same way tuberculosis is or smallpox once 
was. I have more reason to fear being in the same room with 
someone who has a common cold virus than I do being near 
someone who is HIV positive.
<P>
	HIV cannot be transmitted through casual contact as a cold 
can be. Even close contact as happens with health care workers 
and their patients is a very low risk activity. I certainly will not 
be infected by a chance contact with an immigrant or foreign 
visitor who has HIV.
<P>
	Canada's public education campaign has been successful. I 
would like to think that the times when innocent children born 
with HIV were barred from schools are far behind us.
<P>
	The private member's motion now before us which calls for 
mandatory testing of immigrants for HIV and the automatic 
inadmissibility for those who test positive is truly a regressive 
move. This motion would be a throwback to those dark days of 
the early eighties when our understanding of AIDS was still in 
its infancy.
<P>
<B>(1410) </B>
<P>
	Does the action the member proposes make more sense than 
barring those living with HIV from schools, from the workplace, 
from public transportation? Does the action make more sense 
than simply testing the 28 million citizens of Canada today? I 
submit it does not.
<P>
	If the entrance of HIV positive individuals into Canada would 
pose a threat to Canadians, would the member then take the next 
step and propose mandatory testing as part of the criteria for 
obtaining a visitor's visa to the country? What of the open 
border that separates the United States from Canada? Is the 
member also proposing HIV testing at the United States-Canada 
border starting today?
<P>
	Is the member willing to go on record today as suggesting that 
all those who enter Canada, including pilots on every return trip, 
diplomats, tourists, returning Canadians, will need to obtain an 
HIV clearance card first? Has the member considered the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6110"> 6110 </A></B>
<P>
consequences of false positive screening tests in which healthy 
individuals without the virus have been deemed possessing it? 
Has the member imagined the emotional toll this would take on 
those healthy individuals?
<P>
	What about false negative tests in which actually infected 
individuals show negative test results because of the lag period 
it takes to develop the antibodies? Has the member imagined the 
false sense of security that would result from this situation?
<P>
	I wonder if the member has imagined the enormous cost it 
would entail to test everyone. This is a member of the party that 
pontificates daily in this House about cutting government costs. 
Has the hon. member imagined the message we would be 
sending our tourists and the international community if this 
motion were to be adopted?
<P>
	If the member's chief motive is to protect the health and 
safety of Canadians his proposed course of action would fall flat 
because it is not based on knowledge of how HIV is transmitted 
from person to person. If the motive behind this motion is to 
prevent unnecessary strain on our health care system, the hon. 
member should recognize that this should be viewed in the light 
of our overall medical admissibility criteria that already exists.
<P>
	We would have to ask one fundamental question: Are people 
carrying the AIDS virus but without the disease not different 
from those suffering from the disease or any other chronic 
health condition in relation to cost to the health care system? 
There is a mountain of difference.
<P>
	This government is not dismissing the concerns Canadians 
have about AIDS, its virus or HIV testing of applicants for 
immigration. It is addressing them in the most constructive and 
progressive way possible, by conducting a thorough review of 
all medical testing for applicants for immigration with the 
benefit of the best expert advice and consultations. When that 
review is complete the government will take whatever action is 
necessary to protect the health and safety of Canadians and to 
preserve the integrity of our health care system.
<P>
	However, until the review is complete any action of the sort 
proposed by the hon. member would be premature and 
unwarranted. Unfounded debate and an uninformed decision by 
this House would merely foster the kind of misunderstanding 
and fear about HIV that we should be working to overcome. We 
must refuse to assist wittingly or unwittingly in perpetrating the 
myths and fears that too often harden people's hearts and make 
outcasts of those who most need our human compassion and 
understanding. We should formulate public policy based on fact 
not fear, on evidence not speculation, on reason not political 
propaganda.
<P>
	I know the hon. member opposite who introduced this motion 
would like to share the sentiment of this government and that of 
this member for Winnipeg North.
<P>
	In conclusion, I would request that the member in all sincerity 
withdraw his motion until such time as we have all the scientific 
evidence we need to make a reasoned public health policy that 
Canadians want.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Grant Hill (Macleod):</B> Mr. Speaker, I want to tell this 
House about one of my heroes. This hero is Joseph Lister. Joseph 
Lister was the founder of antiseptic surgery and a pioneer in 
preventive medicine. He was a surgeon of some note in 
Edinburgh. Lister noted that in his surgical suite 50 per cent of 
the people on whom he performed amputations died. They 
passed on of an illness called sepsis. Sepsis was something that 
Lister did not understand.
<P>
<B>(1415) </B>
<P>
	Lister noted that carbolic acid seemed to make a difference in 
the cleanliness of the wound after he was done. That carbolic 
acid and Lister's thoughts about microbes, the brand new 
microscope that was just available and Louis Pasteur's work on 
pasteurization went together to form the basis of scientific 
medicine.
<P>
	In a very short period of time in his life, the mortality from 
amputations went from 45 to 50 per cent down to 5 per cent. It is 
very interesting that Lister had his thoughts and ideas 
denigrated by much of the medical community when he first 
presented them.
<P>
	This surgeon who is now looked on as the benchmark of 
surgical treatment was laughed at. During his lifetime he was 
able to see matters change and he became the founder of modern 
antiseptic surgery.
<P>
	I also would like to say that modern medicine can be 
criticized. Modern medicine has had an effect on another type of 
mortality, infant mortality. Statistics show that in 1930 in 
Canada 89 of 1,000 babies died. In 1991 but six of 1,000 babies 
died.
<P>
	The reason I brought this up is that modern medicine 
undergoes evolution and change. Thought processes alter and 
move. I have listened today to rather eloquent arguments for 
how we should ignore medical information. I stand here to say 
that we do so at our peril.
<P>
	My good associate for Calgary Northeast believes that 
immigrants with AIDS should be inadmissible to Canada. I want 
to talk about the other medical reasons we do not admit 
immigrants to Canada.
<P>
	I am going to compare the diseases that we do not allow 
people in for to HIV. One is venereal disease, which is 
discovered by a blood test. It is not contagious. It is infectious 
by sexual contact. It is treatable and is seldom fatal if treated. It 
is 
<P>

<B><A NAME="6111"> 6111 </A></B>
<P>
not visible except in advanced stages. It is cheap to treat with 
two medicines, amoxicyllin and probenecid. But you do not 
come into Canada if you have VD.
<P>
	Another disease is hepatitis. It is found by a blood test. It is 
infectious by blood to blood contact. That is, the nurse who 
happens to be pricked in the finger when she has taken blood 
from a person with hepatitis can get hepatitis. It is not visible 
unless the person is jaundiced or yellow. It can be fatal in some 
cases. It is difficult to treat at moderate cost.
<P>
	Another disease is tuberculosis. It is discovered by a Mantoux 
test or a scratch on the skin. It is infectious. In the true sense of 
word it is contagious by cough or sputum. It is treatable, rarely 
fatal. It is fairly inexpensive to treat as well.
<P>
<B>(1420 ) </B>
<P>
	If an immigrant has any one of these diseases he or she is 
inadmissible. I am sorry, they cannot be admitted to Canada. 
What other diseases would cause denial of entry into Canada? 
Parasites, leprosy, and the list goes on.
<P>
	I would like to quote the parliamentary secretary to the 
minister from <I>Hansard</I> some time ago. This is an interesting 
quotation on the same subject. ``I also want to talk about 
something the hon. member raised with regard to the fact that 
people coming into Canada are not tested for HIV and that the 
minister promised to do something about it four weeks ago. The 
hon. member should know-I thought he knew, maybe he does 
not know that the enabling legislation and regulation on medical 
matters under this department's aegis has remained unchanged 
for 40 years''. She went on to say: ``There should not be 
precipitous moves on an issue like this. Be careful. Go at it 
slowly. Do not move quickly''.
<P>
	In my view if this member had not brought this issue forward 
it probably would have been hidden under another 40 years of 
deadwood and backwoods thinking.
<P>
	Where is HIV if we compare it to the other illnesses that do 
not allow people to enter Canada? How does it stack up in terms 
of the criteria I mentioned before? It is found by a blood test. It 
is contagious by blood to blood contact. Notice that I said blood 
to blood contact. It is not visible except in very advanced cases. 
It is fatal and has no cure. It is very expensive to treat. Various 
comments have been made here today about the cost. The best 
estimates I have are costs that range between $50,000 and 
$250,000 for an individual who has the disease advanced enough 
to require direct medical care.
<P>
	How much does venereal disease cost to treat? About $25 for 
the test, $50 for the medicine, $100 for a doctor's visit, $25 for a 
retest, $50 for the clinic and the pharmacy, in total about $250. 
TB is estimated at $1,105. Not a good comparison there.
<P>
	Why is HIV different from other diseases? I want to be very 
frank about this. HIV is different because the medical issue has 
been pushed aside by the human rights issue. This disease is not 
being treated strictly as a medical issue, it is being treated as a 
human rights issue.
<P>
	When the disease was first discovered medical people called 
it gay men's disease. Why? Because it was discovered to be 
primarily a disease of gay men. There was an outcry that would 
not allow the medical profession to call it what it was. Change 
the name. As the disease became better known and better 
understood it was found to be more common in the Haitian 
community. There was an outcry from the Haitian community. 
``You cannot discriminate against the Haitian community 
because it is more common in our citizens. You cannot mention 
that''. But medical practitioners must mention that. How could 
they hide their heads in the sand and say that it does not exist?
<P>
	We know that intravenous drug users often end up with HIV. 
We know that the sad and sorry hemophiliacs who must have 
blood products given to them often end up with the disease. We 
know that those poor unfortunates who contact it in surgery and 
other blood to blood contact also get the disease.
<P>
	Lister would have looked at this issue and thought that 
Canadians had gone mad. We understand the source. We 
understand the mechanism. We understand the diagnosis. We 
know the cost and we know the risk.
<P>
<B>(1425 ) </B>
<P>
	I have treated people for illness all my adult life. Common 
sense tells me to deny entrance to those who have the other 
diseases. Common sense tells me to deny entrance to Canada for 
those who have AIDS.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ronald J. Duhamel (Parliamentary Secretary to 
Minister of Public Works and Government Services):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the motion before the House today says that the 
Immigration Act should require all prospective immigrants to 
be tested for HIV and include a positive result as grounds for 
inadmissibility.
<P>
	The motion seems quite straightforward, but it raises a 
multitude of questions, and as we analyze these questions, the 
subject becomes very complex indeed. The first question is why 
in some cases, as you know, we already screen prospective 
immigrants for HIV, in accordance with existing guidelines. 
Applicants who test positive may be considered inadmissible on 
medical grounds. We must therefore ask ourselves why our 
current practice is not acceptable, if such is the case.
<P>
	At the very least, we should take a good look at the current 
policy on inadmissibility on medical grounds. By law, all 
immigrants and certain visitors shall produce their medical 
records and undergo a medical examination. The legislation 
does not list diseases that justify inadmissibility on medical 
grounds. The simple fact of having a disease does not in itself 
constitute grounds for refusal under the Act.
<P>
	Grounds for refusal tend to be based on the consequences, that 
admitting an individual would have on Canada, whatever the 
nature of his medical problems.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="6112"> 6112 </A></B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The act requires medical officers to determine inadmissible 
those applicants who would likely pose a threat to public health 
or safety or create excessive demands on Canada's health or 
social services.
<P>
	While there is much that we do not know or understand about 
HIV, expert medical opinion does agree on one thing: A person 
with HIV does not represent a threat to public health or safety 
merely because of the infection. I would hope that most 
Canadians understand by now that one does not get HIV or AIDS 
just by being around someone who tests HIV positive.
<P>
	Refusing admission to applicants with HIV would have to be 
based on any excessive demand they might place on health or 
social services. This requires a judgment to be made in each 
individual case. It seems to me that the question of whether or 
not a person with any specific illness could create an excessive 
demand depends on many factors: the severity of the illness, 
how far it has advanced, prognosis for recovery or deterioration, 
the standard treatment, and so on. Making that kind of 
assessment requires a great deal of expertise applied on a case 
by case basis.
<P>
	Members of this House should recognize that the motion we 
are looking at today calls for a significant departure from 
current policy and practice. It singles out a specific disease. It 
asks that we name that disease in the act and it suggests that the 
act should automatically exclude people with that disease 
without any reference to an expert medical assessment of 
consequences.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	For the time being, I will not ask whether we know enough 
about HIV to adopt such measures. I merely want to point out 
that it would be unprecedented in the recent history of Canadian 
immigration. This measure should not be adopted without 
serious study and it should not be adopted until its potential 
benefits, if any, can be properly evaluated.
<P>
	The physician is not obliged to test for HIV, either by the Act 
or the regulations, but he may do so if he has reason to believe 
that the virus may be present.
<P>
	If an applicant's medical records or a medical examination 
point to the possibility of HIV infection or even a health 
condition that causes the physician some concern, the latter may 
order further testing to make a better assessment of the 
individual's condition.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	As things stand now, testing for HIV does take place when 
there is reason to do so. Under current guidelines immigrant 
applicants found to be HIV positive are usually considered to 
represent an excessive demand on our health and social services. 
They are deemed inadmissible.
<P>
	The point I want to make is not to denigrate the motion. The 
point is we do have an ability now to look at this and we should 
examine whether our current legislation is satisfactory. If it is 
not, we should examine this further.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The time provided for the 
consideration of Private Members' Business has now expired. 
Pursuant to Standing Order 93, the order is dropped to the 
bottom of the order of precedence on the Order Paper.
<P>
	It being 2.30 p.m. the House stands adjourned until Monday 
next at 11 a.m., pursuant to Standing Order 24(1).
<P>
