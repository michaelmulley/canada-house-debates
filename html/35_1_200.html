RETIRING ALLOWANCES ACT</A></H3>
	The House resumed from May 10 consideration of the motion 
that Bill C-85, an act to amend the Members of Parliament 
Retiring Allowances Act and to provide for the continuation of a 
certain provision, be read the second time and referred to a 
committee; and of the motion that the question be now put.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> When we last discussed this matter, the 
member for Wild Rose had two minutes remaining in his 
intervention. I do not see the member for Wild Rose. 
Accordingly we will resume debate.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Jan Brown (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it 
is with pleasure that I rise to speak today to a particularly 
compelling issue, which is the MP pension reform.
<P>
	So many of my colleagues on this side of the House have 
spoken with thoughtfulness and compassion for Canadians who, 
like us, are struggling to make ends meet.
<P>
	During the 1993 campaign this issue came up over and over 
again on the doorsteps of those hard working taxpayers in my 
constituency. They were very frustrated with the fact that MPs 
could come into such a wonderful job as this and were greatly 
compensated for their work here after only having spent a short 
six years in the job. At that time I realized the importance of the 
issue and I made a pledge to my constituents that I would never 
ever participate in any kind of an MP pension plan while I was a 
member of Parliament or afterward.
<P>
	I would like to read to the House for the record the promise I 
made to my constituents. It was signed by me on June 15, 1993 
and witnessed by members of the riding who were at the town 
hall. This is what I said:
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>I, the undersigned, Jan Brown, Reform Party candidate for Calgary Southeast, 
strongly oppose the current extravagant pension plan of members of Parliament. 
It is time our leaders demonstrated some leadership. I therefore totally oppose 
former members of Parliament receiving excessive pensions, when Canadians 
are being asked to tighten their belt. I will, moreover, vote against any bill 
maintaining or increasing members' pensions. I therefore state that I, personally, 
will not participate in the current extravagant pension plan of members of 
Parliament.</BLOCKQUOTE>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	I went on to say:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>I support the policy of the Reform Party to significantly reduce the pension 
plan for MPs to bring them into line with pensions offered in the private sector 
and I will work vigorously toward achieving that objective. However, I hereby 
declare that I will personally choose not to participate in any taxpayer funded MP 
pension plan. As your elected MP, I, like many of you, will plan for my future 
financial needs independently and free of taxpayer support.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	As I said, I signed that on June 15, 1993. Now more than ever, 
my sense of that declaration has gathered importance in my life 
and certainly to those members of Calgary Southeast who I 
represent.
<P>
	There seems to have been a great deception in the Liberal red 
book when it came to pension reform. I say that because the 
public was given a perception that the Liberals were most intent 
about pension reform. However, the red book did not say 
anything concrete about the reform of pensions.
<P>
<B>(1005 ) </B>
<P>
	The Liberals just said that the pension regime of members of 
Parliament had been the focus of considerable controversy and it 
remains so. The red book went on to state: ``It is now the subject 
of an independent review, which Liberals support''. This 
constant focus on reviews, consultations and discussions 
continues over and over as a mantra of the Liberals.
<P>
	The red book further states: ``Whatever the results of an 
independent review, a Liberal government will reform the 
pension plan of members of Parliament to end double dipping. 
MPs should not be able to leave office and receive a pension 
from the federal government if they accept a new full time 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12524"> 12524 </A></B>
<P>
paying job from the federal government''. The Liberals went on 
and on with issues that have not been addressed at all in the bill.
<P>
	In fact, this is what has happened with the new Liberal 
proposals. The lower benefit accrual rate has gone from 5 per 
cent to 4 per cent per year, twice the rate allowed in the private 
sector under the Income Tax Act. Once again, there was the 
perception in the red book that there was change whereas in 
actual fact there has been no real change, just a perception.
<P>
	Benefits will increase with inflation, unlike 80 per cent of 
private plans. MPs are to collect 75 per cent of the annual salary 
after 19 years in office. The average Canadian has to work 35 
years to collect 70 per cent of an annual salary.
<P>
	The Liberals have also allowed a one time opportunity for 
MPs to opt out of the new plan, but MPs elected in the next 
election will be forced to take part in the plan. That sounds like 
some kind of arbitrary punishment for those of us who brought 
forward the whole issue of reform of our pensions.
<P>
	Former MPs or senators appointed after retirement stop 
receiving their pensions while serving, but the benefits continue 
to grow.
<P>
	It sounds like I have struck a chord over there. The babble 
starts once again when we strike a nerve over there that there is 
something which is not quite fair here.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Cannis:</B> You will have your turn.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Brown (Calgary Southeast):</B> Going further, this 
actually goes to the core of leadership in government and 
demonstrates to Canadians that before politicians ask them to 
make any more financial sacrifices that we should lead by 
example. When I hear the empty rhetoric from the other side that 
we are reforming the MP pensions, indeed we are not. The 
Liberals have made only marginal improvements to the MP 
pension plan. They have merely paid lip service to Canadians' 
demands for a pension plan that is in line with those in the 
private sector.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh. oh.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Brown (Calgary Southeast)</B> As you can hear, Mr. 
Speaker, the babble is rising on the other side because they know 
this strikes a very uncomfortable chord with them.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> Settle down.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Brown (Calgary Southeast):</B> I thank the hon. member 
on the other side who is asking his people to settle down. It 
would be very helpful.
<P>
	Reformers are ordinary people who have families to support 
and mortgages to pay. They would like nothing better than to 
participate in a pension plan that is fair, but the Liberal plan is so 
extravagant that Reformers must opt out on principle. That is 
where it comes back to leadership.
<P>
	It is ironic to suggest that reforming the MP pension plan is a 
sacrifice for members of Parliament. As I said, this is a 
wonderful job, a job to publicly serve a country where 
democracy is the cornerstone of our political system. We should 
not take advantage of that by having to be paid through these 
obscene pension plans after leaving here.
<P>
	All we have ever suggested doing is to take our existing, 
outdated, lavish, unfair and expensive pension plan and 
correlate it with the private sector provisions for employees. 
This is no sacrifice. It is doing what every other Canadian out 
there is doing, which is trying to take care of themselves. It is an 
expectation from our electorate that we reform this outrageous 
pension plan.
<P>
<B>(1010 ) </B>
<P>
	More than anything else, Canadians resent that they are being 
asked over and over and over again to tighten their belts, that 
they must pay higher taxes, that their hard earned paycheques 
are taxed back to the government. Let us not forget that about 
eight million Canadians have no pensions at all. Canadians are 
at a point where they no longer believe their politicians are 
worthy of their support.
<P>
	I know I can speak to the constituents of the riding of Calgary 
Southeast on this issue and get that kind of response. In town 
hall after town hall on the issues of the day, this one keeps 
coming up: ``When are you going to get rid of that terrible MP 
pension plan?''
<P>
	I have mentioned in this House before about the reforms that 
were happening in my home province of Alberta. In the spring of 
1993 Premier Klein announced there would be no pension plan 
for members of the legislative assembly after the next election. 
Indeed, Mr. Klein kept that commitment to Albertans. It is no 
wonder that Mr. Klein's leadership retains one of the very 
highest levels of support in the history of Alberta.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Hart (Okanagan-Similkameen-Merritt, Ref.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I will start by saying I was caught a little off guard. 
We hear a lot about the government's need for integrity and 
about trying to increase integrity in the House of Commons. I 
came here today fully prepared to talk about Bill C-67, the 
veterans affairs bill but was told: ``Oh, we will do it later''.
<P>
	The government said Bill C-67 would be the first bill up 
today. I have concerns because I am here for a very specific 
purpose which was to deal with that and now we are thrust into 
this debate on pension plans for members of Parliament. I am 
more than willing to speak on this issue because it was an issue 
during the election campaign. The constituents of 
Okanagan-Similkameen-Merritt spoke very clearly about 
their feelings on it.
<P>
	The MP pension plan this legislation deals with is excessive. 
It is over and above what the private sector has for their pension 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12525"> 12525 </A></B>
<P>
plans. That is what is so discouraging about this government in 
its facade to change and reform the MP pension plan.
<P>
	The Canadian public, including Reformers, have nothing at 
all against pensions. We believe there should be a pension plan. 
Every member in this House should have a pension plan and all 
Canadians should have pension plans. Many Canadians fought 
long and hard to have pensions. Canadians get mad and upset 
when there is an excessive pension plan that is not available to 
all Canadians, such as this pension plan.
<P>
	In the heat of debate, many people say things which may 
sometimes not be quite accurate. The hon. member for Calgary 
Centre stated in one of his speeches that the compensation 
should perhaps be increased to $150,000. I do not necessarily 
agree with what my friend the hon. member for Calgary Centre 
said. However the intent of what he was saying was that the 
whole compensation package for members of Parliament should 
be reviewed independently and brought back to this House so 
that the Canadian public can buy into this whole compensation 
situation. The figure is not important. The fact is that it is out of 
whack. An assessment has to be made by the people of this 
country that it is something they can agree with.
<P>
<B>(1015 ) </B>
<P>
	I do not need 10 minutes, 20 minutes or 40 minutes to say 
what the Canadian public is saying. It is clearly saying it wants 
the MP pension plan brought in line with the private sector. Why 
on earth can the government not see that is all it is asking?
<P>
	What is the government afraid of in the House of Commons 
representing all the people of Canada? It is lining its own 
pockets. It is looking after its own self-interest. It is not 
representing the people of Canada. The government should be 
ashamed.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Is the House ready for the question?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Silye (Calgary Centre, Ref.):</B> On a point of order, I 
seek unanimous consent to speak again to this bill. Standing 
Order 44(1) states:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>No member, unless otherwise provided by standing order or special order, 
may speak twice to a question except in explanation of a material part of his or 
her speech which may have been misquoted or misunderstood, and the member 
is not to introduce any matter, but then no debate shall be allowed upon such 
explanation.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	I stated something in debate. I have spoken to the bill. What I 
stated has been misunderstood. I seek unanimous consent to 
clarify this.
<P>
	It is very important the Canadian public understand that what 
I said has been misunderstood. It is being distorted by the 
government. It is being distorted in the press and the media by 
the government. I want to see the government restore integrity 
to the House and let me speak.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> In the 16 years I have been here I have 
never seen this matter arise. The member is correct in citing 
Standing Order 44(1). It is a provision I was not aware of, and I 
doubt very many people on the government side were aware of it 
either. It says ``except in explanation of a material part of his or 
her speech''.
<P>
	The question is a good one. I do not see any requirement for 
unanimous consent for a member to explain some matter of his 
speech. I will be happy to hear from all members who wish to 
speak to this.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Peter Milliken (Parliamentary Secretary to Leader of 
the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, Standing Order 61(1) reads:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The previous question, until it is decided, shall preclude all amendment to the 
main question and shall be in the following words-</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Standing Order 61(2):
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>If the previous question be resolved in the affirmative, the original question is 
to be put forthwith without debate or amendment.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	It is very clear from all the precedents that on the previous 
question a member may only speak once. There is no possibility 
of further speech once the previous question has been moved. 
That question is before the House. Since there is no person rising 
to speak who is entitled I ask Your Honour to put the question.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stephen Harper (Calgary West, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, to 
assist your ruling, it is clear the hon. member for Calgary Centre 
wants to speak under this rule. He has no intention of moving 
any amendment and so in no way does he violate the standing 
order referred to by the member for Kingston and the Islands.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Don Boudria (Glengarry-Prescott-Russell, Lib.):</B> 
There are two points to be brought to the Speaker's attention. 
The first one was raised by the parliamentary secretary to the 
government House leader. He has indicated to the Speaker that 
because we are dealing with the previous question not only does 
this preclude amendments, it makes it such that we must dispose 
of the previous question before anything else is invoked.
<P>
<B>(1020 ) </B>
<P>
	Quite clearly the rules are designed so that when the previous 
question is moved this matter is to be disposed of at the 
conclusion of members having spoken. Rules elsewhere in the 
standing orders are not applied when we are using the issue of 
the previous question.
<P>
	Second, as it invokes Standing Order 44, no member speaking 
twice with the exception referred to by the hon. whip of the 
Reform Party, I submit to the Chair that the member in question 
has not spoken in the House this day and therefore a clarification 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12526"> 12526 </A></B>
<P>
of comments he made in the House is not in order at this time 
even if this rule were to apply, which I submit it does not.
<P>
	Finally, it is obvious that invoking this rule by the hon. 
member in question is completely out of order because it does 
not satisfy the requirement of his giving an explanation to a 
speech in the House he gave several days ago when there were 
plenty of opportunities in questions, Standing Order 31 and 
questions to other hon. members in order to correct any 
misconception he thinks the House might have about remarks he 
made in the Chamber not today but several days ago.
<P>
	On the comments the hon. member is invoking to clarify 
today, I submit that in the unlikely event the Chair allows these 
clarifications, the Chair will hear clarifications made with 
regard to the response the member gave in answering questions 
to another hon. member not on the motion we are discussing now 
but on the previous question.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> When the hon. whip for the Reform 
Party is speaking to the point of order would he also indicate the 
date of the speech he made in the House and, without giving any 
details, the point of misunderstanding he wishes to clarify.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Silye:</B> Mr. Speaker, I will include those two points and 
further add some points in order to help you make your decision 
in response to what the government whip just said.
<P>
	Nothing under Standing Order 44 says I must avail myself of 
using Standing Order 31. I am speaking to the same question and 
nothing in Standing Order 44 says I have to have spoken earlier 
today.
<P>
	Specifically, the issue is a comment I made during debate in 
my speech when I talked about MP pensions. I pointed out a 
salary figure. That was on Thursday of last week. Since that time 
I have been misquoted and misunderstood by the President of 
the Treasury Board, who is sponsoring the bill, and that is 
extremely important in the Chair's consideration. The President 
of the Treasury Board has been misquoting and misrepresenting 
what I said. Therefore the Canadian public misunderstands my 
point. I said this on Thursday. It is to the same question. I do not 
have to speak on the same day.
<P>
	If there is any integrity in the House, if the government has 
any integrity, I should be allowed to make my point.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Boudria:</B> Mr. Speaker, the whip for the Reform Party 
conceded he did make these remarks last week and has since 
spoken on the same bill. I remind the Chair that if he has spoken 
since that time even if this rule were to apply, which it does not, 
he had that opportunity and failed to exercise it.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Would the whip of the Reform Party 
indicate whether the point he wishes to clarify was his speech on 
the amendment, the subamendment or on the main motion.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Silye:</B> Mr. Speaker, on Thursday when the government, in 
order to get the legislation into committee so that the Canadian 
public would not know everything about it, introduced extended 
hours on Thursday on our amendment to exhaust all our 
speakers. It knew some of our speakers had left to go home for 
the weekend, as many government members did. Therefore we 
had to introduce a subamendment.
<P>
	I am trying to be as factual as I can and recollect whether in 
my speech when I referred to the $150,000 it was on the 
subamendment or on the amendment. I quite clearly state we 
were not debating the main motion on Thursday. I will concede 
that. If that has a bearing on the Chair's decision, so be it.
<P>
	This is a very serious matter and I do appreciate proper 
consideration on this because I have been misunderstood.
<P>

	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Order. This is certainly an enlivened 
Friday morning for all of us.
<P>
<B>(1035 ) </B>
<P>
	The rule is designed to prevent people from starting further 
debate on the issue. I am satisfied, having looked into it, that the 
member was entitled to rise on a point of order, which he did, but 
he is not entitled under our practices at present to rise to make 
another speech on the matter.
<P>
	I would have to rule, based on our present practices, that 
members may not have another go at the debate under this 
branch of the rule.
<P>
	Accordingly, I would say the hon. member has made his point 
of order and the Chair has not accepted that he is entitled to rise 
to make another speech on the matter.
<P>
	The hon. whip to the Reform Party is not entitled to rise to 
reargue the point, as he knows. If he rising on a different matter, 
he is entitled to do so.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Silye:</B> Mr. Speaker, is it possible to request whether or not 
you have factored in that I was misunderstood?

<P>
<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="CONSIDERATIONRESUMEDOFMOTIONFORSECONDREADING">CONSIDERATION RESUMED OF MOTION FOR SECOND READING</A></H4>
	<B>Mr. Charlie Penson (Peace River, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased for the opportunity to speak on this important bill that 
has consumed the House for quite some time. It has actually 
consumed debate in the country for several years prior to the 
lead up to the past election.
<P>
	When I campaigned and even prior to my campaign in the 
election of 1993 this was a very important issue in my riding of 
Peace River. It caught people's attention because they think 
there is a double standard with politicians doing one thing and 
then asking the Canadian public to do another. Politicians were 
writing the rules for their own pension plan which is overly 
generous. It was up to six times more generous than any private 
or public sector plan. I heard it many times.
<P>
	I did not hear any debate about MPs' salaries, but at every 
meeting I went to in the riding I heard about the issue of the MPs 
pension plan and how it was overly generous. It is a matter the 
Canadian people want us to clear up. It is not good enough to 
bring in a revised plan that is twice or three times more generous 
than the Canadian average. They want a plan that is on an 
equivalent basis.
<P>
	Members opposite who are shaking their heads will find, if 
they ram the plan through, that they face the consequences when 
they go to the electorate the next time around.
<P>
	Our alternative has been to say that we need a pension plan 
that is fair, honest and open with Canadians, but if we cannot 
achieve it at this point we will opt out. That is what Reform 
members have done.
<P>
	I have received a lot of feedback in my riding about the 
matter. People have said: ``At least you are honest with us and 
are saying that you will not jump into a plan that is two and 
one-half or three times more generous than any other pension 
plan in the country''.
<P>
	When we discuss the issue and as we talk back and forth 
across this place members on the other side consider the salary 
and the MPs pension plan to be one package. That is a big 
mistake. It has led to the idea that we can have career politicians 
in Canada. People have said they want a pension plan that does 
not encourage career politicians. That is another point people in 
the Peace River riding told me about. They want people to run 
for office who have done something with their lives before 
coming to the Chamber so that they can bring some real life 
experiences to the job. They do not want people elected at 22 
years of age who plan to be here for their entire lives.
<P>
	My understanding is the President of the Treasury Board 
brought forward a pretty good plan to his Liberal caucus in 
December. It was a lot more reflective of the current mood in the 
country and the current average. What happened to it? Who led 
the charge against it? It  was the rat pack of 1984 and 1988. The 
rat pack has become the fat cat pack. They are the ones who 
could not accept the revised pension plan. Some members 
sitting over there will know what I am talking about because 
they led the charge against it. The President of the Treasury 
Board had to withdraw. I understand he was almost 
dismembered in caucus by the Liberal Party. What did he do? He 
could do nothing except bring forward a plan that was somewhat 
lower than the pension plan they had previously but was still not 
good enough.
<P>
<B>(1040) </B>
<P>
	We see members opposite arguing day in and day out that we 
have to accept the plan or our option in the Reform Party is to opt 
out. We will take that challenge and we have taken it. It is not 
that we can afford to do it any more than anyone else, but we 
have to identify with the Canadian people. We have to set an 
example. We have to lead by example in the Chamber and that is 
exactly what we are doing.
<P>
	My understanding is that one Liberal member has also done it. 
I think we will see a few more once they get some feedback. If 
this issue were allowed to go until the summer recess some other 
Liberal members would come back to the House and say: ``I am 
going to opt out of the plan as well''.
<P>
	I take this opportunity to deal with another issue. The gist of 
what is going on across the floor right now is what I want to talk 
about. The member for Calgary Centre rose in the House to talk 
about the issue. At least he was honest. He told the Canadian 
public that we had to put the matter into perspective, that if we 
factored in MPs salary, expense allowance which is tax free and 
housing allowance, in terms of actual dollars before taxes they 
would total about $120,000. If we threw in a reasonable pension 
plan it would be up to $150,000. That is what he was saying. He 
was trying to put the matter into perspective. He was trying to 
tell Canadians exactly what politicians are getting right now. I 
welcomed his addition to the debate.
<P>
	What happened? The people on the other side of the House 
totally misrepresented that. All we expect from over there is 
honesty and openness with the Canadian public. That is exactly 
what the member for Calgary Centre said. He said: ``If you were 
honest you would say this is the value of the pension plan and the 
salary at the moment''. That is the kind of debate we need.
<P>
	He threw out the challenge to put it to the Canadian public to 
decide what the MPs salary should be. I think they would find 
that it should be higher. If they do not, I am prepared to live with 
the results. When we set our own salary and our own pension we 
start to get into trouble. It does not show leadership by example. 
We had better throw it out to a panel that will cross the country, 
hold hearings and talk to ordinary Canadians before we talk 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12528"> 12528 </A></B>
<P>
about raising any MPs salary. The member for Calgary Centre is 
just giving the reality of today, what is actually in place.
<P>
	As I was travelling in my riding I heard over and over again 
that MP's have put themselves in a class above the Canadian 
people. I believe there is a lot of cynicism out there about 
politics right now. I ran into that myself. One person said: 
``Charlie, I wish I would have met you before you went into 
politics because I think I would have liked you''. It is a little 
slam against the profession. What he was saying was that the job 
as an MP is falling into disrepute.
<P>
	Why is that happening? One of the reasons is that we have 
double standards. We have a standard for MPs and we have a 
standard for ordinary Canadians. That is not good enough. It is 
something that has to be changed.
<P>
	Because of the misunderstanding and misrepresentation on 
the other side of the House of the member for Calgary Centre on 
the issue when he was honest and open with discussion in the 
Chamber, I move:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That the member for Calgary Centre be now heard.</BLOCKQUOTE>

	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> In order for such a motion to be made 
by the hon. member who just spoke, two members who are 
entitled to speak have to rise and then a motion such as he just 
made could be moved. Therefore, the motion is out of order.
<P>
	The member for Peace River still has the floor if he wishes.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Penson:</B> Mr. Speaker, it is a matter of whether the public 
will still like us on election day in 1997. That is the challenge I 
am throwing out to members opposite: bring in a realistic 
pension plan and I think the Canadian public will have some 
faith in the whole process, but if we continue to set our standards 
higher than those of ordinary Canadians they will have no faith.
<P>
	We have heard the debate in the House that takes place on old 
age security and Canada pension. We know those two programs 
are under heavy pressure and it may not be possible to sustain 
them. There has even been talk about moving the age limit back 
to 67 for people to receive old age security. That suggestion was 
made because we are in such serious financial difficulty in the 
country that the interest on the debt is consuming more and more 
of these very, very important programs.
<P>
	That is the kind of pressure the public is going to face: a 
Canada pension plan that may not be sustainable, old age 
security that may not be sustainable. At the same time, in what 
direction are MPs going? We are going with a gold plated 
pension plan-not as much as before, but significantly higher 
than the public and private sector.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hoeppner:</B> Something our grandchildren will pay for.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Penson:</B> The member for Lisgar-Marquette just 
reminded me that we will not be paying for it, not our 
generation. It is easy to bring in a plan somebody else has to pay 
for. In fact, that is what will happen with deficit financing.
<P>
	There is a $550 billion federal debt in the country, rising at the 
rate of $115 million a day. Who is going to pay for this in the 
future? It will not be the members who are sitting in the 
Chamber, not our generation. It will be our children and 
grandchildren. What kind of a deed are we perpetrating on our 
future generations in this country?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hoeppner:</B> Let them sign a petition that their 
grandchildren are willing to pay for it.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Penson:</B> Let us examine the pension plan for a moment. It 
is certainly a step in the right direction. We know that. But there 
is still an age limit of 55 for qualification. Who else in the public 
and private sector can do that? Nobody I know. It is still two and 
a half times more generous than any other public or private 
sector pension plan. It is important for us to deal with the issue 
fairly.
<P>
	In conclusion, because of the misunderstanding, I move that 
the member for Calgary Centre be now heard.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The motion is out of order.
<P>
	I believe the member for Edmonton Southwest has already 
spoken to the matter.
<P>
	<B>Mr. McClelland:</B> Mr. Speaker, I believe I spoke on the 
amendment. I have not yet spoken on the main motion.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> This has been quite a morning. The 
member has already spoken, I am told, on the main motion. The 
member for Edmonton Southwest has spoken on the motion now 
before the House, that we move to the question.
<P>
	Is the House ready for the question?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Question.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt 
the motion?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.

	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> All those in favour of the motion will

	<B>Hon. Fernand Robichaud (for Minister of National 
Defence and Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.)</B> moved that 
Bill C-67, an act to establish the Veterans Review and Appeal 
Board, to amend the Pension Act, to make consequential 
amendments to other acts and to repeal the Veterans Appeal 
Board Act, be read the third time and passed.
<P>
	<B>Hon. William Rompkey (Labrador, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
those of us who witnessed the recent celebrations of V-E Day 
cannot help but be reminded once again of the importance of the 
second world war and indeed the other wars in which Canada has 
participated. That war was a defining moment for this country.
<P>
	It was a time when young Canadians from all across the 
country sacrificed themselves. Some went for various reasons. 
Some went because of valour. Some went because of patriotism. 
Some went out of a sense of duty. Some went for adventure. For 
whatever reason, they went. They went for their country and to 
defend and protect an important cause.
<P>
	The second world war was a defining moment for us as a 
country. It helped to partially establish what we are as a country, 
what we stand for, what we believe in, what we are prepared to 
defend. It was also a defining moment for individuals, all of 
those young Canadians who went overseas. In the second world 
war it was not just young Canadians but young 
Newfoundlanders and Labradorians, because the province that I 
represent was not part of this country between 1939 and 1945. 
So there were young Canadians and young Newfoundlanders 
and young Labradorians who went over, serving in different 
forces but all for the same cause. Not only did it define our 
country, but it defined them as individuals. It gave them an 
experience that those of us who did not participate in that war 
can never appreciate.
<P>
	I recall growing up in St. John's, which had an important role 
in the second world war because it was a jumping-off point for 
ships, planes, and personnel. I remember the blackouts and air 
raid sirens. I remember my father being in the home guard. I 
remember the soldiers, sailors, and airmen in the streets, in the 
clubs and in the USO. However, those of us who did not actually 
participate in the war cannot really appreciate what those young 
Canadians and Newfoundlanders went through as an experience. 
Not only was it a defining moment for our country, it was a 
defining moment for them as individuals. Some of them paid the 
supreme sacrifice by laying down their lives. We honoured them 
some time ago, and we honour them again today.
<P>
	As the Legion continually says in its rituals, ``At the going 
down of the sun and in the morning, we will remember them''. 
We must remember them, not only for their sake but for our sake 
and for the sake of our  country as well. If we forget that defining 
moment for the country and that defining moment for them as 
individuals, then history is bound to repeat itself. I want to make 
that point today while those events are fresh in our minds.
<P>
	I do not want to be lengthy today, because the longer I speak 
the more we will hold up improvements to the veterans pension 
plan. What I want to say is that for those individuals who went 
overseas and lost their lives, we can only remember them, 
honour them and pay tribute to them, but for those who came 
back we can do something as a country. We have been doing 
something as a country but we must continue to do something as 
a country. These individuals gave up an important part of their 
lives and some of the best years of their lives. They gave up their 
younger years, when they could have been doing other things. 
We must remember them for that. Some of them also gave up 
abilities they had. Many of them were injured. Many of them 
were totally disabled. Some of them were partially disabled.
<P>
<B>(1055) </B>
<P>
	This country has taken the responsibility that we owe them for 
that, for the sacrifice they made and the contribution they made 
to us as a country and to the world.
<P>
	Canada has been paying a pension. This particular piece of 
legislation will speed up the Canadian pension administration. It 
will merge the Canadian Pension Commission and the veterans 
commission into one. It will make a two-stage process and it 
will free up the lawyers who are available to work on the appeals 
for the veterans as they apply. It gives Veterans Affairs Canada 
the authority to make first-level decisions and it merges the 
Canadian Pension Commission and the Veterans Appeal Board 
into one appeal body.
<P>
	We heard on my committee from a great many witnesses. We 
heard from very few who oppose this legislation. Some had 
some modifications they wanted made, and that is what the 
House of Commons process is all about. But by and large, people 
and veterans support this legislation and believe it will be an 
improvement in the amount of time. We have been far too 
lengthy in granting appeals to veterans in the past. We heard that 
in some cases it takes years for a veteran to get through the 
initial process and the appeal process. This legislation will 
speed up the process and make it more efficient.
<P>
	There is really very little more to say. This is a simple piece of 
legislation but it is important. I encourage the House to pass it 
speedily. I believe there is all-party support for this. I urge the 
House to get on with the job because of what we owe those 
people who went over to represent us.

	<B>Mr. Jesse Flis (Parkdale-High Park, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
am pleased to congratulate the International Development 
Research Centre, better known as IDRC, on 25 years of service 
to Canada and the world since its inception on May 13, 1970.
<P>
	The purpose of IDRC is to bring together research 
professionals from Canada and abroad to help solve the 
problems of developing economies. As a primary example, 
IDRC-sponsored scientific research has led to the development 
of disease-resistant and pest-resistant food crops. 
Consequently, the environmental impact caused by pesticides 
and fungicides is greatly reduced and developing economies are 
one step further toward food self-sufficiency.
<P>
	In short, 25 years' worth of Canadian investment into the 
IDRC will pay dividends into the next millennium. I cannot 
think of a better gift to future generations.
<P>
	Happy birthday, IDRC, and congratulations to past and 
present staffs serving at national headquarters and the seven

	<B>Mr. René Canuel (Matapédia-Matane, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
I would like to draw attention today to National Forest Week.
<P>
	The forest industry in Quebec will be hit hard by the federal 
government's withdrawal from the Canada-Quebec forestry 
development agreement and the eastern Quebec development 
plan. These two programs come to an end in March 1996 and 
will not be renewed.
<P>
	By withdrawing, the federal government will be depriving 
regions of Quebec of more than $30 million and will create 
unemployment equivalent to 1,500 jobs in the Lower St. 
Lawrence region alone.
<P>
	It is because of its spending power, that is, using the taxes paid 
by the people of Quebec, that the federal government came to be 
meddling in this area, which is exclusively the jurisdiction of 
the provinces. Now that it is broke, the federal government is 
backing out and leaving the thousands of workers who depended 
on its involvement high and dry.
<P>
	It is time for the people of Quebec to give a clear mandate to 
their government to recover all of the tax money paid to the 
federal government. This way, Quebec will have the final say on 
its own policies.

was born 175 years ago today. How fitting then that this day has 
been designated as Canada Health Day, thanks to the Canadian 
Public Health Association and the Canadian Hospital 
Association.
<P>
	This year's theme, ``creating a new agenda for health'', 
highlights a broader view of health, one that is consistent with 
this government's approach, the approach of Health Canada. 
The importance of a population health approach, a healthy 
society, is recognized by federal, provincial and territorial 
ministers of health.

	Florence Nightingale's courage and dedication serve as a

	<B>Mr. Philip Mayfield (Cariboo-Chilcotin, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, an Ottawa <I>Citizen</I> columnist recently stated that 
criticizing the use of the words sexual orientation in Bill C-41 is 
homophobia. This is yet another example of the forces of 
political correctness trying to stifle and suppress debate in the 
House.
<P>
	The justice minister insisted on including sexual orientation 
in Bill C-41, but as many MPs have noted it is virtually 
indefinable. As one MP said: ``Don't ask me to tell you what it is 
because [it's] difficult to interpret, to define''. These words 
belong to our very own Prime Minister.
<P>
	Perverse groups such as the North American Man-Boy Love 
Association argue that pedophilia is a legitimate sexual 
orientation and look for legal loopholes to press their case. Bill 
C-41 gives them one more chance to do just that, endangering 
our children in the process.
<P>
	I urge the justice minister to listen to Canadians, listen to 
common sense and drop the words sexual orientation from Bill 
C-41.

<P>
	Chronic fatigue syndrome sufferers have otherwise 
unexplained relapsing fatigue that is not the result of ongoing 
exertion. People with chronic fatigue see a decrease in their 
occupational, social, educational and personal activities. 
Anyone can be inflicted with this disease, men and women, 
seniors and children. I want to recognize their courage in trying 
to cope and carry on under very difficult conditions.

	This honour is well deserved in recognition of Mrs. de 
Villiers' valuable and tireless work on behalf of the victims of 
crime. She has served as director of the Canadian Resource 
Centre for victims of crime and is a member of the National 
Crime Prevention Council.
<P>
	Mrs. de Villiers organized a petition that gathered over two 
million signatures of Canadians requesting changes to the legal 
system that would address the issue of violence in society. The 
success of the petition led to the founding of CAVEAT, 
Canadians Against Violence Everywhere Advocating its 
Termination.
<P>
	Mrs. de Villiers and CAVEAT have done a great deal of 
valuable work that has resulted in many changes to the justice 
system to increase the protection for victims.
<P>
	I am sure all members of the House will join me in extending 
congratulations to Priscilla de Villiers.

	<B>Ms. Bonnie Brown (Oakville-Milton, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
Canadians who are concerned about the welfare of children will 
be interested in the initiative announced by Lyn McLeod in her 
Ontario Liberal election platform.
<P>
	She has promised that if elected she will name a key cabinet 
minister to be responsible for children's services. This minister 
will be responsible for improving the co-ordination and 
delivery of children's services.
<P>
	The number of children living in poverty and the number of 
those at risk or in crisis continues to rise in Ontario. More than 
500,000 children in Ontario are dependent on the welfare 
system. One out of three children in metropolitan Toronto alone 
is on social assistance. This is unacceptable and Mrs. McLeod 
has recognized it. She knows that the current system is 
fragmented and confusing to deal with. She identified that 
involving local communities in the decisions about children's 
services is the key.
<P>
	I applaud her foresight and proactive initiatives in the area of 
children's services. I must ask why the other parties in the 
Ontario election seem to be-

	<B>Ms. Val Meredith (Surrey-White Rock-South Langley, 
Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, in 1982 Theodore Speicher and two 
accomplices kidnapped Sharon Bollivar outside her Vancouver 
house where she lived with her husband and three children. They 
wanted Sharon's husband to provide them with all the money 
from the grocery store where he was the manager.
<P>
	However, the kidnappers panicked and decided not to go 
through with the ransom plot. Instead Sharon Bollivar was 
driven to Burnaby Mountain where Speicher killed her with a 
single shot to the head. He was subsequently arrested after a 
shoot-out with police. Speicher received a life sentence with no 
parole for 25 years.
<P>
	Today Speicher is suffering from terminal leukaemia and is 
asking for the mercy of the crown so he can die a free man, 
surrounded by his family. He wants society to show him a 
compassion that he refused to give Sharon Bollivar.
<P>
	When Speicher was sentenced the judge stated that: ``If there 
was ever a case in which parole should never be granted this is 
it''. I fully concur with the judge's comments and I hope the 
minister sees to it that Theodore Speicher dies behind bars 
where he belongs.

	<B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the inquiry into the conduct of peacekeepers in 
Somalia is scheduled to start on May 24. We have just learned 
that one of the main witnesses in this case, Major Armstrong, 
who, we will recall, stated that incriminating evidence had been 
ordered destroyed, has just been sent on a three month tour of 
duty in the former Yugoslavia.
<P>
	How can the Minister of National Defence explain that Major 
Armstrong was sent on a three month mission in the former 
Yugoslavia just five days before the beginning of the inquiry?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of National Defence 
and Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
assignment of Canadian forces personnel is done within normal 
procedures.
<P>
	In this case, Major Armstrong is a medical officer with certain 
skills that are required in ex-Yugoslavia. Any member of the 
Canadian Armed Forces who is required to give testimony to the 
commission on Somalia will be available to that commission. 
The fact that they are in Bosnia, Croatia, Rwanda, Washington, 
or London does not really matter. If the commission wants to 
interview any Canadian forces personnel, they will be available.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I would have thought that it would be easier to find 
another medical officer to send to Yugoslavia than another 
witness to testify before the commission of inquiry.
<P>
	Since Major Armstrong is one of the main witnesses in this 
case, will the minister undertake to postpone his departure so 
that his testimony can be heard as soon as the inquiry starts?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of National Defence 
and Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, this is an 
independent commission with judicial powers under part II of 
the Inquiries Act. It is for the commission to decide whom to 
speak to and from whom it wants to hear. If the commission 
wishes to hear from Major Armstrong or any other member of 
the forces, all it has to do is make that known and those people 
will be there.
<P>
	We cannot have the normal operations of the Canadian Armed 
Forces and the Department of National Defence affected simply 
by the fact that this commission is under way. We have to carry 
out our duties on a day  to day basis. I want to give my friend the 
assurances that any of the personnel will be available as 
required.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, in light of the fact that the Minister of National 
Defence refused to extend the scope of the inquiry to the events 
in Petawawa, that he decided to restrict access to the documents 
to be used in the inquiry, that he refused to undertake to release 
the commission's report and that, all of a sudden, one of the 
main witnesses in this case is being sent abroad five days before 
the beginning of the inquiry, are we to conclude from the 
government's attitude that this is a further attempt to cover up 
the truth rather than to shed light on the way members of the 
Airborne Regiment from Petawawa behaved both in Canada and 
in Somalia?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of National Defence 
and Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the hon. 
member has made a number of assertions which are totally, 
absolutely and utterly false. I resent those kinds of insinuations 
being made on the floor of the House of Commons. There is 
hardly a grain of truth in any one of those assertions.
<P>
	This is a public inquiry. Its results will be made public. I 
assume it will operate under the glare of the country's television 
lights and cameras. This matter is totally open. It is civilian led 
and is something this government has called. This government 
wants to make sure that all of the troubling accusations 
surrounding the Canadian forces deployment to Somalia are 
brought to light. This government has nothing to hide. This 
government wants the truth.

<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean H. Leroux (Shefford, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the Minister of National Defence.
<P>
	This week, the Minister of Public Works categorically refused 
to break off negotiations with Agusta regarding the settlement to 
be paid for the cancellation of the EH-101 contract. However, 
during the investigation in Europe regarding Belgium's EH-101 
purchase contract, senior executives at Agusta revealed that the 
company is in the habit of giving kick-backs to obtain contracts.
<P>
<B>(1120) </B>
<P>
	In light of these rather troubling developments, how can the 
minister refuse to investigate the circumstances surrounding the 
federal government's EH-101 contract with the company? What 
guarantees can the minister give to the House that the company 
did not use bribery to get its contract with Canada?

[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Brian Tobin (Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, 
Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, answering on behalf of my colleague, I want 
to assure the member that the Government of Canada, certainly 
this government, has no knowledge of the kind of practices that 
have just been described.
<P>
	With respect to the cancellation of the EH-101 contract, the 
Government of Canada is now negotiating a settlement with 
E.H. Industries Limited of London, England and the other 
EH-101 contractors. As the member knows, the company is 
owned equally by Agusta of Italy and Westland Helicopters of 
England. Our intention is to arrive at a fair and judicious 
settlement and to proceed as quickly and as reasonably as 
possible.
<P>
	I would say this to the member with great respect for the 
importance of the question he asked: The onus is not on the 
government to assure the House that something improper has 
not happened; the onus is on the member, if he has some 
evidence, to produce it.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean H. Leroux (Shefford, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, is it not 
the government's duty to shed light on this whole issue?
<P>
	My question is for the Minister of National Defence. Given 
that the president of Agusta was arrested last week in Italy on 
charges of corruption, fraud and unethical practices in relation 
to several government contracts, how can the minister continue 
to refuse to investigate the circumstances surrounding the 
Canadian government's EH-101 contract with Agusta at a time 
when the government is about to pay millions of dollars for 
breaking its contract with the company?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Brian Tobin (Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, 
Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I do not know what the member is getting so 
excited about.
<P>
	One of the very first actions of this government upon 
assuming office was to cancel the EH-101 helicopter contract. 
We are now performing the appropriate duty of concluding this 
whole arrangement in a responsible and appropriate way.
<P>
	If the member is worried about people acting under undue 
influence, and he is raising the notion that someone is being 
cajoled into acting under undue influence, then he ought to be 
worried about a government that threatens people with a tax hike 
if they do not separate.

	<B>Mr. Jim Hart (Okanagan-Similkameen-Merritt, Ref.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, on April 24, Ruth Cardinal, the director general of 
public affairs for the Department of National Defence, 
addressed the Press Club of Canada.
<P>
	She discussed the deployment of Canadian forces in Somalia 
and said: ``In the airborne story Dr. Armstrong made some 
allegations. One of them was that two Somalis were shot in the 
back by Canadian soldiers. It seemed that his story did not have 
credence. This autopsy report done by an independent group 
proved Dr. Armstrong wrong''.
<P>
	My question for the Minister of National Defence is: How can 
the government tolerate such comments which not only 
contradict the minister's gag order of November 24 but also 
prejudice the inquiry?
<P>
	<B>Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of National Defence 
and Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the hon. 
member is quite correct in saying that in the House late last year, 
I publicly asked all members of the armed forces and of our 
department who had any information concerning the matters 
likely to be investigated by a potential commission to bring 
those matters forward to the commission once it was 
established.
<P>
	If the utterances the hon. member quoted from are indeed 
accurate, and I have no direct knowledge today that they are 
although I am not saying they are not, then that individual will 
be reapprised of what I said before in the House. The individual 
will certainly be warned that any kind of comments made by 
anyone along those lines, especially someone in authority 
within our department, could be prejudicial. Those persons 
should go forward to the commission.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Hart (Okanagan-Similkameen-Merritt, Ref.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, national defence is not only going out of its way to 
discredit the testimony of Dr. Armstrong, but it is actively 
removing him from any involvement with the commission's 
inquiry even though his November 1994 allegations compelled 
the minister to call an inquiry. Dr. Armstrong has conveniently 
been posted into the former Yugoslavia theatre, just in time for 
the inquiry to begin.
<P>
<B>(1125) </B>
<P>
	I heard the minister's answer the first time, but my question 
is: Why is DND attempting to remove Dr. Armstrong from the 
inquiry process in seeming contempt of the government's 
declared resolve to get to the bottom of the events in Somalia?
<P>
	<B>Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of National Defence 
and Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
answered that question in the following way.
<P>
	Dr. Armstrong is a member of the Canadian Armed Forces and 
has certain skills. People have to be posted from time to time. 
Dr. Armstrong and anyone else who has relevant information 
will be made available to the inquiry. I will give my hon. friend 
that assurance.
<P>
	I do resent the member and his colleagues continually 
asserting that members of the Canadian Armed Forces and the 
Department of National Defence and the government in general 
do not wish to get to the bottom  of all the sorry events that 
unfolded in Somalia. That is false. That is why we have set up 
and called for the creation of a commission with the most wide 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12536"> 12536 </A></B>
<P>
sweeping investigative powers probably in Canadian history. He 
and all Canadians will get the answers to all their questions in 
due course.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Hart (Okanagan-Similkameen-Merritt, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the hon. minister can object all he likes but this is 
question period and these are the questions which are on the 
minds of Canadians.
<P>
	The director general of public affairs was hand picked by Bob 
Fowler. It is amazing how often that name comes up. This 
inquiry has been tainted from the start. What role is Ruth 
Cardinal playing in the Somalia inquiry?
<P>
	<B>Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of National Defence 
and Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the hon. 
member has just made a very serious charge.
<P>
	The government has appointed a commission of inquiry under 
part II of the Inquiries Act. The terms of reference for that 
inquiry have not been challenged by anyone in the House, by the 
media or anyone else in the country. Two of the three members 
of the inquiry are learned members of Canada's judiciary.
<P>
	I want the hon. member to come forward with absolute proof. 
Bring the proof to the House of Commons as to why those 
honourable people on the inquiry are in some way unable to 
discharge their functions. This inquiry will get to the bottom of 
all the allegations regarding our deployment in Somalia. I would 
ask the hon. member that unless he has proof, please do not 
come to the House and cast aspersions against hon. members 
especially of Canada's judiciary.

	<B>Mr. Philippe Paré (Louis-Hébert, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is directed to the Minister of National Defence.
<P>
	This morning in Belgium, NATO Secretary General Willy 
Claes was again questioned by Belgian authorities about bribes 
totalling US $1,720,000 paid by Agusta, an Italian company, in 
order to obtain a contract for the purchase of 46 EH-101 
helicopters by Belgium.
<P>
	In the light of these new developments, could the Minister of 
National Defence indicate whether Canada intends to ask that 
NATO Secretary General Willy Claes be relieved of his duties, 
at least for the duration of the investigation?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of National Defence 
and Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, this is 
somewhat reminiscent of the earlier questions from the Reform 
Party.
<P>
	As I understand it, certain accusations have been made and 
levelled against members of the party of Mr. Claes when he was 
a politician in Belgium. To my knowledge, none of those 
accusations have been proven. It is rather unfortunate that 
people in public positions have to wear guilt where no guilt has 
actually been proven.
<P>
	In the case of Mr. Claes, he is discharging his duties well. He 
recently visited Canada and met with my colleague the Minister 
of Foreign Affairs and myself. Unless we have any other reason 
to believe that Mr. Claes would not be an appropriate person to 
head NATO, Mr. Claes will continue with the full confidence of 
all the member countries within NATO.
<P>
<B>(1130) </B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Philippe Paré (Louis-Hébert, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
considering that Canada contributes $200 million every year 
towards the financing of NATO, how can the Minister of 
National Defence be so optimistic about Mr. Claes's integrity 
when he is being investigated by the police on a bribery charge?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of National Defence 
and Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, unlike 
hon. members in the opposition, we do not convict people 
simply on wild insinuations and accusations. If the hon. member 
or anyone else has proof of wrongdoing involving anyone, 
including a public servant in an international forum like NATO, 
then those people, including the hon. member, should make that 
proof public.

	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister

Party. It has finally asked a question on the environment. It is 
the first question in a year and a half.
<P>
	In particular I want to thank the auditor general for focusing 
on areas which are of very serious public concern. I believe, Mr. 
Speaker, if you speak to the auditor general he will tell you that 
one of the reasons he undertook this very thorough 
environmental analysis was at my request in anticipation of the 
new role of his department as commissioner for sustainable 
development.
<P>
	I will tell the hon. member that last month I gave the order to 
cancel the federal PCB site program because over the last six 
years under the green plan millions of dollars were spent to look 
for places to burn PCBs and they did not find a single site. I did 
not think it was a good use of taxpayers money. I ordered an end 
to the program.
<P>
	I have further ordered that we work with the Department of 
Public Works to have all federal PCBs burned where there is a 
legally sanctioned facility in the province of Alberta.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ed Harper (Simcoe Centre, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
still waiting for the answer.
<P>
	The Reform Party has always said that cleaning up Canada's 
environment is a top priority and we are on record with that plan. 
It is this level of government that lacks leadership in the area.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Harper (Simcoe Centre):</B> You may learn something if 
you listen. Pay attention.
<P>
	The auditor general stated clearly in his report that the 
government has failed to create a national plan or to set money 
aside to clean up contaminated sites that pose a risk to human 
health and the environment. Why does the government not have 
such a plan? Where does it plan to get the money to meet its 
obligations?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister 
of the Environment, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the member obviously 
did not listen to the answer to his first question.
<P>
	He asked a question about PCBs. I told him that I cancelled 
the program because we had spent $20 million travelling around 
the country and we had not destroyed a single PCB. I did not 
think it was a very good use of taxpayers money, given that there 
is a licensed facility in Alberta. I am working with the 
Department of Public Works. We will meet our agenda. We will 
meet the 1996 deadline. We will probably have all PCBs 
destroyed by the end of this year.
<P>
	I also reiterated the position that we will take responsibility 
and we will clean up all federal contaminated sites. We will not 
endorse the concept of orphan sites because we believe in the 
unanimous resolution of ministers of the environment from 
every  province, which was stated two years ago and restated last 
year, that the concept of orphan sites leaves polluting companies 
off the hook.
<P>
	The commissioner for sustainable development would be the 
first one to underscore that if company <I>x</I> makes a mess of the 
environment company <I>x</I> should pay the liability for the clean up. 
That is not a liability to be borne by the taxpayers and that is why 
the federal and provincial governments have banned the concept 
of orphan sites.

auditor general to review the $380 million contract awarded to 
Hughes Aircraft Canada for automation of the air traffic control 
system. Work on this contract is already two years behind 
schedule, and the total cost may be two and a half times the 
initial cost.
<P>
	What explanation does the Minister of National Defence have 
for the fact that his department approved a similar contract for 
$70 million with Hughes Aircraft Canada, when more than 16 
months ago, he was informed by federal auditors of the delays

	<B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, my question is 
for the Deputy Prime Minister.
<P>
	Yesterday's auditor general report stated that even the best 
codes of conduct or conflict of interest guidelines could not 
protect Canadians from a government that was not 
fundamentally honest. The report made clear that we could not 
expect ethical behaviour from public servants if we do not have 
it from their leadership, the cabinet.
<P>
	After appointing an ethics counsellor that is completely 
beholden to the office so that he will forever be able to hide all 
ethics scandals, how could the Prime Minister expect his public 
servants to behave ethically even when they know they cannot 
get caught?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (President of the Treasury Board 
and Minister responsible for Infrastructure, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, in addition to all of what I enunciated yesterday in 
terms of the high level of ethical standards that the government 
espouses and that the public service carries out, my colleague, 
the House leader, put before the House a proposition for a 
special joint committee of the Senate and the House of 
Commons on a code of conduct.
<P>
	I understand the difficulty is that the members opposite in the 
Reform Party are filibustering the attempt to set it up. If they 
would get behind this effort we could even go an extra step. We 
already have the ethics counsellor, the code of employment and 
conflict of interest. We have already changed the Lobbyists 
Registration Act. We have already changed the certification of 
lobbyists with respect to contracts. We have done a great deal. I 
think the auditor general recognized that in his report.
<P>
	There is always room for more improvement and we will carry 
out more improvement. A lot has been done. Let them come on 
side in terms of getting through the proposition the House leader 
has put before us on a code of conduct.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, there is a great 
difference between filibustering and promoting a logical 
solution to a problem. We want the ethics counsellor to be 
independent. That was my question; that is what I was talking 
about. That is why my question is again directed to the Deputy 
Prime Minister.
<P>
	We noticed that in the last few days no one has questioned the 
authenticity of the report of the auditor general. No one 
questions his findings as being inaccurate. No one questions that 
he is not thorough. We all find him trustworthy and believable. 
Why? It is because he is independent. That is the reason.

to that.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (President of the Treasury Board 
and Minister responsible for Infrastructure, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am glad to hear this praise for the auditor general 
because we accept his report. I think his report has given some 
very useful suggestions.
<P>
	He has pointed out that when it comes to our public service, 
when it comes to our government, we take a back seat to nobody 
when it comes to the ethical standards that are practised by the 
government and its public service. It is comparable very 
favourably, as he pointed out, to other governments and to the 
private sector.
<P>
	The amendments that they apparently want to the motion that 
my colleague, the House leader, has put before us are to exempt 
a whole body from any kind of code of conduct. The other House 
I believe is the proper phrase. I think it is time they showed some 
good faith in trying to get the matter through so that we can 
further deal with the matter of ethics.

	<B>Mr. Michel Daviault (Ahuntsic, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the Minister of the Environment, and I add that 
this is not our first question on the environment.
<P>
	Yesterday, the Auditor General of Canada painted a very sorry 
picture of the federal government's management of dangerous 
waste. The government has reallocated over a third of the budget 
of $150 million intended for pollution management. It has 
dumped 24 highly contaminated sites onto the provinces. The 
minister may well speak of orphan sites, but the provinces will 
be the ones ending up with them. Furthermore, the federal 
government has provided for no additional funds to clean up the 
contaminated federal sites that remain.
<P>
	How does the Minister of the Environment explain that, for 
lack of new agreements, she in fact unilaterally dumped total 
responsibility for 24 highly contaminated sites onto the 
shoulders of the provinces, when human health and the 
environment are at risk, according to the auditor general.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister 
of the Environment, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, first, funding for the 
Green Plan was extended at the request of the provinces, which 
asked for more time to clean up.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12539"> 12539 </A></B>
<P>
	Second, two years ago we unanimously adopted the policy 
to put an end to orphan sites because of a request by the 
Province of Quebec, through its Minister of the Environment, 
Pierre Paradis, who, at the time, felt that creating a fund for 
orphan sites would enable companies to avoid their 
responsibilities-something environmental groups know very 
well.
<P>
	We have paid and will continue to pay for the clean up of 
federal sites. This year, my colleague, the Minister of National 
Defence, has already paid out over $100 million for clean up. 
My colleague, the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, has just 
paid out a significant sum. We have invested more than a quarter 
of a billion dollars in a sewer infrastructure program for the 
Vancouver area. These are joint programs with the provinces.
<P>
	But we adopted our policy on orphan sites at the request of the 
Province of Quebec.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Daviault (Ahuntsic, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
unfortunately, provincial Ministers of the Environment come 
and go and are not all the same. The current minister in Quebec 
is much more demanding. However, let us move on to PCBs.
<P>
	The auditor general also informs us that the federal 
government will fail to honour its commitments in the Green 
Plan regarding its own PCBs. The minister is doubtless the only 
person who believes in the 1996 timetable.
<P>
	How does the minister explain that the matter of federal PCBs 
will still be unresolved next year and that, moreover, she will be 
running the risk of new environmental accidents, again 
according to the auditor general.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister 
of the Environment, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, the auditor general 
mentioned the Green Plan in connection with the sites. As I 
explained to my hon. colleague from the Reform Party, the 
federal government has spent more than $20 million without 
finding a site, as the Government of Quebec did with the BAPE.
<P>
	Last month, I decided to order federal Department of the 
Environment to have all federal PCBs destroyed at a site set up 
and licensed in Alberta. We will meet our deadline. We are 
working, and I have corresponded with the Minister of Public 
Works. PCBs will be destroyed starting this month, and we hope 
to have all of the work completed, not by the end, but by the 
beginning of 1996.

<P>
	Yesterday the leader of the third party was in Atlantic Canada 
spreading doom. I quote: ``All you can do is say it's over, 
particularly in Newfoundland. It's best to take 15 seconds and 
say the fishery is finished.''
<P>
	Is this true? Are Atlantic fishermen holding onto false hopes, 
as the leader of the Reform Party has stated? Can the minister 
give this House a true assessment of the Atlantic fishery?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Brian Tobin (Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, 
Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, regrettably I have to inform my colleague it 
is true that the hon. leader of the third party, after 15 seconds of 
deep contemplation and thought about the future of the fishery, 
did say-here it is on the front page-``it's over''.
<P>
	After his spending this valuable 15 seconds reflecting upon 
the problem and coming to the conclusion that it is over, I want 
to inform the people of Canada that indeed the Atlantic fishery 
still represents a $1.6 billion export industry employing tens of 
thousands of people in 1995.

	<B>Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George-Peace River, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it came to light earlier this week that the Minister of 
Justice did not consult with the James Bay Cree, as is prescribed 
in the James Bay and Northern Quebec Agreement. As the 
Minister of Indian Affairs knows, they must be consulted on any 
legislation that will affect traditional hunting rights.
<P>
	I ask the Minister of Indian Affairs, did his colleague violate 
the constitutional rights of the James Bay Cree, yes or no?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Ron Irwin (Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern 
Development, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the answer is no.
<P>
	I am pleased the hon. member raised the issue of the James 
Bay and Northern Quebec Agreement, because we were rather 
proud of that. It was the former Prime Minister Trudeau and the 
present Prime Minister, who had this job at the time, who 
actually implemented the James Bay and Hudson Bay and 
northern Quebec agreement. It is part of our culture, part of our 
policy, part of our tradition.
<P>
	I am really pleased that the hon. member has now taken up the 
issue of treaty rights. I hope I see that in the future when we 
bring forth these things, and not not what I hear outside of the 
House with the Reform saying let's get rid of treaty rights, let's 
not have any more treaty process.
<P>
	The James Bay and Northern Quebec Agreement talks about 
fishing and hunting rights. The bill of the Minister of Justice 
talks about guns and regulation. They are two distinct things. 
There are rights under treaty to hunt and fish. To take the logic of 
the Reform, he is saying that the Cree can go out and hunt with a 
Sherman tank and the Government of Canada would have no 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12540"> 12540 </A></B>
<P>
recourse. We are  talking about gun registration, not rights of 
hunting and fishing.
<P>
	Maybe I should not be so pleased. Perhaps it is just a sign of 
desperation of how far the Reform Party has gone in trying to 
save what is now a losing position.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George-Peace River, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, a sign of desperation is when a minister cannot answer 
yes or no. Did he violate the constitutional rights, yes or no?
<P>
	According to Peter Hogg, a leading constitutional lawyer, 
``Any law that had the effect of impairing an existing aboriginal 
right would be subject to judicial review to determine whether it 
was justified impairment''.
<P>
	My supplementary question is for the minister of Indian 
affairs, who hopefully understands the crown's fiduciary 
obligation: Is Bill C-68 a justified impairment of aboriginal 
rights, yes or no?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Ron Irwin (Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern 
Development, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the Minister of Justice has 
said on numerous occasions about the right to gather food as a 
broad right-not necessarily an aboriginal right but an 
aboriginal and non-aboriginal right-that these rights will be 
facilitated.
<P>
	Let us take the logic of the hon. member to the extreme. He is 
saying that it is okay for Cree to go there and hunt seal or caribou 
with an AK-47, with an assault weapon, with a Sherman tank. 
This defies logic; it is incorrect.

miss them.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	I said several times in the House of Commons that the Royal 
Military College of Canada we established in Kingston is fully 
bilingual. We put in place all the procedures required to make 
the college fully bilingual. Most courses are given in both 
official languages, French and English.
<P>
	In the future, most of the teachers will speak both official 
languages, and I think that if the hon. member paid a visit to the 
city of Kingston, he would see for himself that the Royal 
Military College of Canada is a truly bilingual institution.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Roger Pomerleau (Anjou-Rivière-des-Prairies,

<P>
	Can the Minister of National Defence promise in this

from him-that corrective measures will be taken and that, from 
now on, the information about the Kingston college on Internet

<P>
	I have to underscore the fact that all the promotional material 
and all the required documentation in training is in both

	In the report he tabled yesterday, the auditor general confirms 
that 274 Canadian diplomats cashed in their plane tickets for an

However in British Columbia six conspirators who pleaded 
guilty to poaching herring roe were let off with absolute 
discharges, the last one given the absolute discharge on May 5.
<P>
	Will the minister show the same concern for the tiny herring 
and the tiny salmon clinging by their fingernails on the west

	<B>Hon. Brian Tobin (Minister of Fisheries and Oceans,

is skidding on his chin.
<P>
	I know the member has a genuine interest in the health of the 
salmon stocks. The individuals in the case in question, because I 
checked yesterday, pleaded guilty. They entered a guilty plea 
and it was accepted by the court. The amount of product in 
question, contrary to reports in British Columbia, which were 
erroneous, was not $1 million. It was $70 and it was confiscated 
by the court and returned to the crown.
<P>
	On the question of whether or not there was confusion and 
whether these individuals had been advised, I am told by a 
lawyer that they had a right to engage in this fishery. The judge 
came to the conclusion that there was sufficient doubt and that 
no further penalty would be imposed.

<P>
	The Reform Party today made an allegation that the hon.

interest because he was honoured by his constituents. That is a 
fairly serious allegation.
<P>
	We tend to let most things go in the House because there has to

happens to be chair of the aboriginal committee, with a conflict

am saying is that there is a conflict of interest or the appearance 
of a conflict of interest. I said that it was done knowingly or 
unknowingly. I am asking for the minister's clarification. I

through the regular mechanism of question period.

<P>
	<B>Mr. Stephen Harper (Calgary West, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
would like to comment on the minister's point of privilege. I 
did not hear how the minister related this matter to a violation 
of his privileges.
<P>
	I would also point out that in his point of privilege he made 
reference to the non-presence of a member of Parliament, which 
is out of order.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Don Boudria (Glengarry-Prescott-Russell, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, as you know, privilege is defined as anything 
which affects the functioning of the House of Commons.
<P>
	It is stated in Beauchesne's citation 24 that parliamentary 
privilege is ``the sum of the peculiar rights enjoyed by each 
House collectively as a constituent part of the High Court of 
Parliament and by Members of each House individually''.
<P>
<B>(1205 ) </B>
<P>
	Therefore, it is both. It is not just as it affects a member who 
was referred to but all members of the House.
<P>
	The minister was quite correct and quite able to do so. He does 
have a legitimate case in raising a question of privilege even if it 
does not necessarily apply to himself. The question was asked of 
the minister. That is the second reason why it is, I would suggest, 
quite appropriate and the duty of the minister to bring the matter 
up.
<P>
	I want to remind the Chair very briefly of what was said. One 
member of the House was accused of being in conflict of interest 
by being co-opted by a constituent in exchange for getting some 
sort of a reward. Finally, a minister of the crown was said by 
another member of this House to be pig-headed. All of that was 
said in the space of two questions by the same member.
<P>
	The Speaker has ruled on a number of occasions in the past 
that similar language was out of order. I will give a number of 
examples. Someone who has apparently reneged on a promise 
has been ruled out of order by the Speaker. Language far less 
offensive than that heard today has been ruled out of order. 
Members making statements that are untrue have been ruled out 
of order. It goes on and on. Even such words as ignoramus have 
been ruled out of order.
<P>
	To make such accusations as have been made, not against one 
but against two hon. members, one being a minister of the 
crown, is a point of privilege. I suggest that the Speaker would 
probably want to take this matter under advisement and rule on 
it at some point in the future. It is a serious matter that affects all 
of us in the House.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The whip to the government has raised 
a new point of order on the question of the use of the word 
``pig-headed'', if I may quote. Does the member from Powell 
River wish to speak to that second point of order aside from the 
question of privilege?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Duncan:</B> Yes, Mr. Speaker. I have no problem 
withdrawing that word and using the word stubborn if that would 
resolve the issue.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The hon. member then, in the interest 
of better cordiality in the House, is withdrawing that word 
unconditionally.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Duncan:</B> Yes, Mr. Speaker, I am prepared to do that.
<P>
	To further clarify the situation for the member for 
Glengarry-Prescott-Russell, I did not accuse the minister of 
conflict of interest. If he reads the question he will see that I did 
not do that. I did not say that anyone was co-opted by a 
constituent. I did not say that anyone had obtained a reward.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The blues will be reviewed carefully 
with respect to the question of privilege and if it is necessary the 
Chair will report back to the House on that question.

he is questioning a matter of debate. We cannot each be 
correcting everything that is said with a point of order after 
statements are made. We would be doing very little else in the

trust the Chair will provide an opportunity for the member for 
Prince Albert-Churchill River to make whatever contribution 
to the debate that he might want to make.

pursuant to Standing Order 36, I wish to present a petition which 
has been circulating across Canada. The petition has been signed 
by a number of petitioners from the Calgary, Alberta area.
<P>
	The petitioners draw to the attention of the House that 
managing the family home and caring for pre-school children is 
an honourable profession that has not been recognized for its 
value to our society.
<P>
	They also state that the Income Tax Act discriminates against 
families that make the choice to provide care in the home for 
pre-school children, the disabled, the chronically ill and the 
aged.
<P>
	The petitioners therefore pray and call on Parliament to 
pursue initiatives to eliminate tax discrimination against 
families that decide to provide care in the home for pre-school 
children, the disabled, the chronically ill and the aged.

	<B>Mrs. Jan Brown (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
rise again to present a petition to the House in this effort to keep 
Robert Paul Thompson behind bars.
<P>
	These petitioners are attempting to bring attention to the 
government to make our streets safer for law-abiding citizens. 
They are encouraging the government to enact legislation in 
order to do the following: One, allow reclassification of 
offenders as dangerous after sentencing; two, allow the 
indefinite detention of dangerous offenders after warrant 
expiry; and three, allow violent offenders to be ineligible for 
parole until the full sentence has been served.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Elijah Harper (Churchill, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, last year 
Sarah Kelly, a constituent of mine, was brutally murdered by 
Robert Bliss Arthurson, a known sex offender in The Pas, 
Manitoba.
<P>
	Arthurson had been previously convicted for sexual offences 
involving children. He was known to police and social service 
agencies as a potential threat to children, but they felt under the 
current laws of Canada and Manitoba that they could not legally 
warn the community of the threat he posed.
<P>
	Today I present to the House a petition with signatures from 
over 2,000 residents of The Pas and other communities. They 
pray that this Parliament enact legislation to enable courts to 
notify residents when sex offenders and murderers are released 
into the community.
<P>
	I call on the hon. Minister of Justice and my fellow members 
to join me in finding ways to achieve this.
<P>
<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="HUMANRIGHTS">HUMAN RIGHTS</A></H4>
	<B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have three 
petitions today pursuant to Standing Order 36.
<P>
	The first one bears 39 signatures. It indicates that since 
Canadians believe that all Canadians should enjoy the same 
protection in law by virtue of being Canadians, the petitioners 
pray that Parliament not amend the Criminal Code in such a way 
that sentencing be less severe for crimes against persons who are 
not in an especially protected category.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, the second petition bears 280 signatures. It is 
similar to the other but is more specific.
<P>
	The petitioners pray that Parliament not amend the human 
rights code, the Canadian Human Rights Act or the charter of 
rights and freedoms in any way which would indicate societal 
approval of same sex relationships or of homosexuality, 
including amending the human rights code to include the phrase 
of sexual orientation and including amending the Criminal Code 
in such a way that sentencing would be less severe for crimes 
against persons who are not homosexuals.

	<B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the third and 
last petition I would like to present today bears 373 signatures, 
mostly of Elk Island constituents.
<P>
	It is one in which the petitioners say they are already 
overburdened by taxes. They do not believe the expensive 
procedure of registering firearms will have any substantial 
effect on the reduction of the criminal use of firearms. They ask 
that Parliament not enact any laws which would require the 
registration of all firearms.

	<B>Mr. John Duncan (North Island-Powell River, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I rise today to present petitions on a number of issues.
<P>

west coast. They call upon Parliament to revoke the directive 
issued by the government to destaff lightstations. The 
petitioners call for a full public inquiry into the need for staffed 
lightstations and an acknowledgement of the safety they 
provide.

the last by 283 requesting that government not enact any further 
firearms control for responsible gun owners, shooting clubs and

presently written and in any event not to include the undefined 
phrase of sexual orientation, as the behaviour that people engage 
in does not warrant special consideration in Canadian law.

Code of Canada prohibiting assisted suicide be vigorously 
enforced and that Parliament make no changes in the law which 
would sanction or allow the aiding or abetting of suicide or 
active or passive euthanasia.

	<B>Mr. Leonard Hopkins (Renfrew-Nipissing-Pembroke, 
Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have a petition signed by many people 
from all parts of Canada. It deals with one of the greatest assets 
that this country has namely, the Canadian Armed Forces.
<P>
	In recent months the Canadian forces have come under 
intense media and public scrutiny, some of it very unfairly. 
Therefore the petitioners request that Parliament at the earliest 
possible time initiate a wide ranging public inquiry, replacing 
many which are being convened piecemeal, into the Canadian 
Armed Forces, including reserves, which will investigate, 
report and make recommendations on all matters affecting its 
operations, tasking, resources, effectiveness, morale and 
welfare.
<P>
	I want to say that the Canadian Armed Forces is one of the 
proudest elements we have in this country today. We should all 
be supporting our forces very strongly.
<P>
<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="OFFICIALOPPOSITION">OFFICIAL OPPOSITION</A></H4>
	<B>Mr. Lee Morrison (Swift Current-Maple 
Creek-Assiniboia, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, pursuant to Standing 
Order 36, it is my honour and pleasure to table three petitions 
identical in form and content. The total number of signatures on 
these petitions is 719 Canadians. They are mostly residents of 
the Coronach, Swift Current and Bengough districts in my 
riding.
<P>
	The petitioners state that the Bloc Quebecois party is 
composed solely of members from one province. They also state 
that the Reform Party of Canada has only one less member in the 
House and represents constituencies in five provinces and is 
organized throughout Canada. They state that the rights of 
people residing in nine provinces and two territories cannot be 
adequately protected by the disloyal, one province Bloc 
Quebecois as Her Majesty's Loyal Opposition and that this is a 
travesty on the institution of Parliament.
<P>
	The petitioners therefore call upon Parliament, in the interests 
of Canadian unity and parliamentary tradition and to protect the 
rights of all the people of Canada, to prevail upon the Speaker of 
the House of Commons to recognize the Reform Party of Canada 
as the Official Opposition during the remainder of the 35th 
Parliament.

<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="VETERANSREVIEWANDAPPEALBOARDACT">VETERANS REVIEW AND APPEAL BOARD ACT</A></H3>
	The House resumed consideration of the motion that Bill 
C-67, an act to establish the Veterans Review and Appeal Board, 
to amend the Pension Act, to make consequential amendments 
to other acts and to repeal the Veterans Appeal Board Act, be 
read the third time and passed.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Maurice Godin (Châteauguay, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, we 
are now at the third reading stage of Bill C-67, an act to 
establish the Veterans Review and Appeal Board, to amend the 
Pension Act, to make consequential amendments to other acts 
and to repeal the Veterans Appeal Board Act.
<P>
<B>(1225) </B>
<P>
	The purpose of this bill is to revamp the process for awarding 
disability pensions to veterans. The bill also repeals the 
Canadian Pension Commission. It transfers responsibility for all 
first level decisions to the Minister of Veterans Affairs. It 
establishes a Board that from now on will be responsible for 
reviewing decisions and hearing appeals. Finally, the Bureau of 
Pensions Advocates, now an independent agency, will become 
part of the department.
<P>
	Since this bill was tabled in the House of Commons, I have 
spoken in debate on behalf of the Bloc Quebecois as the veterans 
affairs critic. Since first reading of the bill on December 15, we 
have always said we supported any measures that would speed 
up the process that helps veterans obtain a decent pension.
<P>
	Everyone agrees there are substantial delays and backlogs in 
the current process. Consider that the average age of veterans is 
73. A study carried out in 1992 mentioned a turnaround time of 
up to 18 months in the case of first level decisions and delays of 
up to 36 months when objections are raised and a decision must 
be reviewed or appealed. In some particularly sad cases, the 
delay is unbelievable. Something had to be done to improve the 
process.
<P>
	Before the House today is the government's response to this 
need. A response that has generated both criticism and concern. 
The federal government has opted for the tried and true to deal 
with this problem, in other words, for concentrating power in the 
hands of fewer people. That is why, although we welcomed the 
intent of the bill, which is to shorten the delay in awarding 
pensions, we still felt there was considerable cause for 
apprehension and concern.
<P>
	We are in fact afraid this bill will not achieve what we all want 
it to achieve. We are also afraid of the disastrous impact it may 
have on the vested rights of veterans.
<P>
	Throughout the various stages at which the bill was examined, 
we heard many comments, all marked by the same feelings of 
concern and apprehension.
<P>
	Considering the merits of the bill's objectives, no veterans 
organizations took a stand against this legislation. However, 
these organizations found much to criticize, both regarding the 
substance and the form of this legislation.
<P>
	As we approach the final passage of this bill, it may be useful 
to recall these criticisms. In fact, they led us to formulate certain 
conditions we feel are necessary to guarantee some transparency 
in this new process for awarding pensions to veterans.
<P>
	The first criticism that drew our attention was about the 
consultation process prior to the bill. A veterans' association 
complained about the consultation process and wondered why 
the department had not been evenhanded in the way it selected 
its partners. It is, of course, easier to consult someone who 
thinks as you do than someone who objects to your proposals or 
questions your motives.
<P>
	Another objection came from the Royal Canadian Legion. Its 
president said that the proposed changes would not, as intended, 
reduce by half the time required to make the actual pension 
payment. That is, not unless most of the first level decisions are 
affirmative.
<P>
	However, from now on these decisions will be made by the 
department, which is said to have a very negative attitude 
towards veterans. And that is where most of the delay occurs in 
the current process. This is not very encouraging for the Legion.
<P>
	We also heard from representatives of Canadian army, navy 
and air force veterans. They said they were very concerned 
about losing the services of the Bureau of Pensions Advocates at 
the first level. They could not understand why the government 
was proceeding with such sweeping changes when the review of 
pension assessments had been instrumental in implementing 
many measures that were all aimed at reducing the turnaround 
time.
<P>
<B>(1230) </B>
<P>
	They also fear that the minister will use this power to bring in 
restrictive policies regarding the processing of claims. The 
same refrain comes from the Canadian Merchant Service Guild. 
The guild says that Bill C-67 contains very little to convince 
them that the turn around time for claims will be reduced.
<P>
	The guild also fails to see how the new board will be able to 
eliminate the backlog or how putting power into the hands of one 
person will achieve the desired result, which is reducing 
processing time. Therefore, instead of being a reassurance, this 
bill is a worry. Although its objective is to reduce processing 
time, there is no reason to believe that it actually will. The 
government and the officials who drafted this bill are asking us 
to take a leap of faith. The only thing that we can be sure this bill 
will  do is reduce veterans' services, mainly the legal services at 
the first level. We can also be sure that it concentrates power 
within 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12548"> 12548 </A></B>
<P>
branches and the department, and that ultimate power will lie in 
the hands of the minister.
<P>
	Despite all of these criticisms, these worries, there is one 
glaring reality which will not change, that is the time required to 
process claims.
<P>
	I would like to point out to the House how long these lags are. 
We all know that, from the time we are born, we are all 
relentlessly getting closer to our deaths, and that, once we reach 
a respectable age, we all realize how little time we have left. 
How can we tolerate that the applications submitted by veterans, 
whose average age is 73, get bogged down in the bureaucracy, 
that veterans have to wait ages and ages while their health 
deteriorates and their standard of living suffers?
<P>
	I would like to give you two examples. In its February 23 
issue, Le Journal de Québec ran a story on Yvon Bureau, a 
former member of the Royal 22nd Regiment based in Valcartier. 
On April 17, 1964, while on a peacekeeping mission in Cyprus, 
he was injured. After waiting 30 years, the government finally 
decided that he was entitled to a pension. It took them 30 years. 
They maintained that his condition was not related to his 
service, to the accident he had in the line of duty. They even had 
him consult a psychiatrist. And it was only recently, after the 
government obtained opinions from many different experts, that 
his right to a pension was acknowledged. But he is not finished 
waiting yet, because he was not granted benefits for those 30 
years he was waiting. He will have to take his case to all of the 
avenues of appeal, if not to the Federal Court, in order to obtain 
full and true justice.
<P>
	There are many other similar cases. For example, Frances 
Crummer, a very worthy person who was willing to submit a 
paper to the standing committee reviewing this bill. Mrs. 
Crummer, the widow of a veteran, has stopped counting the 
years she and her late husband had to put up with the pension 
system and all of the paperwork they have done. She went 
through three applications, one after the other: the initial 
application, the application for review and the application for 
appeal. She went to the hearings of the review board and of the 
assessment board. After going through nine decisions, two 
amended decisions, one decision in the form of a letter, eleven 
appeals and six hearings, Mrs. Crummer still has not given up, 
but that does not deter her from harshly criticizing this bill.
<P>
	After seeing such examples, how can we claim that the current 
bill will prevent similar situations? In one case, the file was 
studied for 30 years and, in the other, it took 12 decisions for the 
applicant to gain some ground. In my opinion, the problem is 
simple: there is either a lack of will to resolve problems or, 
simply put, people are making sure that they continue to have 
work by taking their sweet time closing files. If this is the 
problem, it is not only scandalous, but absurd.
<P>
<B>(1235) </B>
<P>
	The review of pensions by two consulting firms and the 
department in 1992 at a cost of $670,565 concluded that it could 
take 18 months for a first level decision and up to 36 months, if 
there were complications. Given this information, you will 
understand our desire from the outset to be involved as much as 
we could in a bill that would identify the system's shortcomings 
and propose corrective action to remedy them.
<P>
	This is not to be, however. We note that the shortcomings are 
not clearly identified, that the proposed merging of agencies in 
favour of the department and the new board will serve much 
more to consolidate the minister's authority, that these measures 
limit services to veterans and, finally, that it is not clear that all 
these changes will accelerate the process.
<P>
	Is this not, perhaps, a backhanded manoeuvre by the Minister 
of Finance and his budget to save a few bucks on the backs of the 
veterans? Is it not, perhaps, instead a less than subtle way to find 
positions for the party faithful? I can assure you that these 
questions are foremost in the minds of anyone who examines the 
bill for what it is and not for what it claims to be. Naturally, we 
have received no answer to this sort of question. There is, 
however, one thing we know for sure and that is that the bill will 
do nothing to reduce the time required to settle veterans' 
applications, because it fails to deal with the basic problems.
<P>
	These problems, as the review clearly indicated, are: 
duplication and cumbersome operation, the slowness in 
implementing computerized communications and, most of all, 
the acknowledgement, in practice, of the veterans' right to 
priority treatment at the medical specialist's office. Nothing in 
the bill deals with these problems. Our approach in reviewing 
Bill C-67 was guided by our desire to help reduce delays and to 
ease as much as possible the concerns expressed by both 
veterans' associations and experts.
<P>
	That is what we tried to do during clause by clause 
consideration and at the report stage before the House. Our 
proposals in this regard were rejected, and that is unfortunate. 
We, however, still feel that special measures should apply to the 
physicians and medical experts who become involved in the 
award application assessment process.
<P>
	For example, whenever the minister exercises his power to 
order an applicant or pensioner to undergo a medical 
examination, he should require that the designated medical 
expert give priority to his request by conducting the 
examination and reporting results as expeditiously as possible, 
as is done for any review or appeal application to the veterans 
board.
<P>
	When the board seeks the advice of an independent medical 
expert, it should instruct this medical expert to give the 
applicant or appellant the required examinations without delay 
and 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12549"> 12549 </A></B>
<P>
report examination results as soon as possible. Similar measures 
would save a lot of time, since  many witnesses have testified 
that medical visits and examinations account for a large 
proportion of undue delays, something about which the 
government has not yet summoned the courage to intervene.
<P>
	I can understand that the medical profession is subject to 
quotas, that it is free to decide how to run its business, and that it 
is a very delicate matter to ask a professional to fit more patients 
into his or her appointment book. At least, those are the excuses 
we heard from the Liberal members on the committee. However, 
the question we must ask ourselves is this: When we decided to 
send our young people to the front, on the eve of a promising 
future, to put their lives on the line to defend their country, did 
we ask them if they had appointments? No. We did not ask their 
permission. These young people decided to serve in the military 
because of a sense of duty, a sense of honour, a sense of urgency. 
They were there when their country needed them; they did not 
make anyone wait. It is not the physicians we should be 
concerned about in this case. We should only be concerned with 
the person who is aging and cannot afford to go through the 
regular channels. Our society must recognize that, on the basis 
of the sacrifices they made, we owe our veterans the privilege of 
coming first in our health care system. I hope that physicians 
will hear this reasoned and heartfelt appeal.
<P>
<B>(1240) </B>
<P>
	We also rose in this House at report stage to try and obtain 
guarantees for veterans, in this respect. We suggested ways of 
accommodating concerns expressed regarding concentration of 
powers in the hands of the minister. We suggested a more 
transparent approach to selecting the members of the new board, 
one which would require that the provinces and the standing 
committee be consulted before any member is selected. But this 
solution was rejected by the Liberal majority, who did not want 
this greater degree of openness and democracy.
<P>
	The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of National 
Defence and Veterans Affairs mixed everything up, claiming 
that our initiative would weigh down the processing of 
applications. It would not. We know very well that appointments 
are for ten year terms. Moreover, the bill includes transitional 
provisions that should ensure a smooth transition to the new 
Veterans Review and Appeal Board.
<P>
	This refusal by the federal government to consult the 
provinces and the standing committee on appointments to the 
board shows how little it cares about the provinces and about 
openness. Under the circumstances, the government can well be 
accused of wanting to centralize more than ever and of ignoring 
the provinces. It can well be accused of wanting to put its own 
benefit and that of its friends before the public interest by taking 
advantage of public issues in this way.
<P>
	Bill C-67 fits in perfectly with such bills as Bill C-65, Bill 
C-76 or Bill C-43 on lobbyists. This bill reflects the federal 
government's will to centralize. No wonder it is concerned. Out 
of concern for efficiency, having failed to remedy the 
inadequacies of the Canadian Pension Commission, it is now 
concentrating the whole first level decision making process in 
the hands of the minister, rebuilding a two tiered board, the 
membership of which will come from political appointments 
made without any consultations, and concentrating legal 
assistance at the level of reviews or appeals before the new 
Veterans Review and Appeal Board. These services are being 
transferred to the department so they will be easier to control. 
Now that is typical of this government.
<P>
	There is a great deal to criticize in this bill. However, the need 
for change tends to override any criticism, at least that is the 
message we get from veterans associations that did not openly 
oppose the bill. In their representations we read a desire to 
reduce delays, even if this meant making some concessions in 
terms of services or opening the door to arbitrary decisions.
<P>
	That is the main reason why we will support Bill C-67 on 
third reading. However, as is the case with the veterans 
associations, our support is mingled with a great deal of concern 
and dissatisfaction. I feel we could have done far better. I think 
we could have considered, first and foremost, the interests of 
those who risked their lives and defended our freedom at the cost 
of physical and mental suffering. At a time when we are given 
this opportunity to commemorate our veterans, that we have 
failed to do so is unfortunate, disturbing and indeed distressing.
<P>
	Keeping our commitments to them is even more important 
than expressing our gratitude. We must not forget that the 50th 
anniversary of the end of the Second World War will probably be 
the last time those who experienced these historical events come 
together to participate in these ceremonies.
<P>
	There are still about 3,000 World War I veterans, 505,000 
veterans of World War II, now averaging 73 years of age, and we 
also have 20,000 veterans of the Korean War.
<P>
<B>(1245) </B>
<P>
	I realize that military personnel who participated in UN 
peacekeeping operations will apply for disability pensions, but 
not in the same numbers as after the Second World War.
<P>
	That is why we must deal with the backlog in processing 
pension applications as soon as possible. With our support on 
third reading, I would nevertheless urge the government to 
reaffirm its commitment to our veterans. It must give them the 
assurance that giving applicants for disability pensions the 
benefit of the doubt is not just an empty phrase. The new section 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12550"> 12550 </A></B>
<P>
in the Pension Act, section 5(3) introduced in clause 47 of the 
bill, and also section 39, must become part of the process.
<P>
	It is essential that from all the circumstances of the case and 
all the evidence presented either to the minister or to the new 
board, every reasonable inference be drawn in favour of the 
applicant. Any uncontradicted evidence must be accepted. Any 
doubt, in the weighing of the evidence, as to whether the 
applicant or appellant has established a case must be resolved in 
his or her favour.
<P>
	Only then will the principle of benefit of doubt become part of 
the process, and only then will the new pension award system 
introduced by this bill reflect the initial intent of the legislator 
with respect to our policy for compensating our veterans.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Hart (Okanagan-Similkameen-Merritt, Ref.):</B> 
Madam Speaker, yesterday I returned from the Canada 
Remembers ceremonies in the Netherlands. I will never forget 
this truly emotional experience for Canadian veterans and also 
the genuine expression of gratitude the people of Holland 
displayed for the Canadian liberators of their country. The 
bergermeester of Arnhem told that in relation to their actions, 
Canadian veterans are far too modest.
<P>
	I have always felt a deep appreciation for the veterans of our 
country. Until I visited the graves of fallen Canadian soldiers, 
sailors and airmen in the Netherlands and Germany, I did not 
have a true understanding of the death and devastation that took 
place 50 years ago. Being born 10 years after the war, it was not 
part of my personal experience, aside from Remembrance Day 
each year.
<P>
	Canadians should always remember over 6,000 Canadians 
have their final resting place in Holland and in Germany. As I 
walked through the rows of white headstones in Groesbeck, 
Arnhem, Bergen-Op-Zoom, Holten, Reinberg and Reichwald 
war cemeteries, I was shocked. The events of 50 years ago were 
enhanced in my mind by the ages of those Canadians who died. 
Many were 18 and 19 years old. We truly lost a generation. Their 
contribution must always be remembered.
<P>
	For those veterans who returned to Canada, we have an 
obligation to ensure legislation is in place to effectively and 
efficiently deal with their disabilities.
<P>
	The raison d'être for Bill C-67 is to speed up the time 
veterans wait when applying for a disability pension while 
clearing the backlog of some 12,500 veterans currently awaiting 
a decision on their claim without removing any of the rights and 
benefits veterans currently possess.
<P>
	The government has promised to accomplished this task in 
two years. This is a commendable goal, enthusiastically 
endorsed by the Reform Party. As co-critic for defence and 
critic for veteran affairs, I would be more than happy to speak in 
favour of a bill that promised to accomplish this. However, like 
many veterans, I am doubtful whether this bill will succeed.
<P>
<B>(1250) </B>
<P>
	After carefully analysing Bill C-67 and after consulting 
veterans, grassroot veterans organizations, advocates of 
veterans, former and current employees of the Department of 
Veterans Affairs and former members of the Canadian pension 
commission and the veterans appeal board, I still have grave 
concerns about this piece of legislation.
<P>
	The thing that must be answered is why veterans who 
currently average 73 years of age have to wait up to five years to 
receive a disability pension. For the record, the current situation 
is appalling. When a veteran applies for a disability pension at 
the first level he must wait 18 to 20 months for a decision. 
Seventy per cent of those who apply are turned down. The 
veteran then must appeal the decision and is often forced to go 
through two levels of appeal before a final decision is made. 
This can take another three years. Seventy per cent to eighty per 
cent of those who appeal do receive a pension, albeit often at a 
lower amount than expected. This is for those who are still alive 
after applying or appealing.
<P>
	It is sad to say that because of the age of these veterans many 
never collect their disability pension due to the time factor and 
actually pass away during the process.
<P>
	Let us look at the reasons for these delays. In an enlightening 
presentation to the Standing Committee on National Defence 
and Veterans Affairs that ruffled more than a few feathers, Mr. 
Hugh Peacock, a pension advocate with the Royal Canadian 
Legion and a former employee of the Canadian pension 
commission, stated the delays are caused by a variety of factors 
that can be addressed without introducing the reforms presented 
before us today in Bill C-67.
<P>
	He gave the example of a typical case that he had chosen 
randomly from his files and outlined where the delays come 
from. When the advocate sent the first level application to the 
Canadian pension commission in Charlottetown for processing 
it took eight weeks from the time it arrived to create a file on a 
case. Then documents were ordered from the National Archives. 
They took 10 weeks to arrive in Charlottetown because the 
National Archives does not like original documents to be sent to 
Charlottetown, which is completely understandable.
<P>
	Therefore photocopiers at the Department of Veterans 
Affairs, headquartered here in Ottawa on Wellington Street, 
must photocopy some 200 pages of material so the case can be 
sent to the CPC in Prince Edward Island. Once in Prince Edward 
Island it took five weeks for someone to review the documents 
and to write a precis of the case so medical advisors to the 
Canadian pension commission could read all of the documents. 
The 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12551"> 12551 </A></B>
<P>
medical advisors took another seven weeks to make a 
recommendation on that case.
<P>
	The Canadian pension commission then took six weeks to 
make a final decision. After its decision was rendered it took 
another six weeks for DVA to inform the veteran of that 
decision. That totals 42 weeks for an elderly veteran to wait for a 
decision on his claim. It is clear where the delays lay. It is clear 
the fateful decision to move the Canadian pension commission 
to Charlottetown is largely responsible, though not exclusively, 
for the delays.
<P>
	This experiment in regional economic development has cost 
veterans dearly and I hope the government has learned a very 
valuable lesson from this unfortunate and unnecessary story.
<P>
	I have spent a considerable amount of time detailing where 
the delays come from because I want to establish a very 
important fact. The current independent bureau of pension 
advocates, its lawyers and paralegals are not responsible for 
these delays.
<P>
<B>(1255 ) </B>
<P>
	The goal of the legislation is to speed up the time it takes 
veterans to get their disability pensions without the veterans 
losing any of the rights they currently possess. This is also the 
aim of the Reform Party, yet we disagree on the means to this 
end.
<P>
	One of the main points of disagreement centres on whether the 
bureau of pension advocates should remain an independent body 
at the disposal of veterans at the first level or whether it should 
be moved and made a part of the Department of Veterans Affairs 
at the appeal level only.
<P>
	A number of arguments have been made by the standing 
committee on defence and veterans affairs and in the House in 
this regard and I have reviewed them extensively. After careful 
consideration I have concluded the bureau of pension advocates 
should remain an independent body at the disposal of veterans. 
Why? I fail to see how removing the bureau from the first level 
will save any time in the current system. The only way to speed 
up the system is to ensure more applications are accepted at the 
first level. These applications must be well prepared because the 
department currently rejects 70 per cent of them but goes on to 
accept 80 per cent of the appeals at the second or third level.
<P>
	The typical time it takes for the bureau lawyer to prepare an 
application is in the area of two to three months, a modest period 
of time to prepare a case when the veteran knows he will be 
forced to do battle with the department to receive his disability 
pension.
<P>
	The remaining delays at the first level, which commonly take 
a year and a half, are the responsibility of the department. 
Ironically, the government feels removing the bureau from the 
first level will speed up the system because it will focus on 
appeals only.
<P>
	Under this legislation the government intends to have a 
departmental clerk assist the veteran in filling out the first level 
application. The first level decision will then be adjudicated by 
the department, not the Canada pension commission. It could be 
true that the first level decision will be faster, but will the 
acceptance rate be greater than 30 per cent? Given the 
department's past record of rejecting 70 per cent of first level 
applications, I have to question that.
<P>
	If the veteran has to appeal the case he has to then go to a 
bureau lawyer who now is not working for the veteran but 
working for the Department of Veterans Affairs. The lawyer who 
answers directly to the minister must start to prepare the 
appellant's case from scratch, which will take months or years 
because nothing in the bill speeds up the appeal process which 
currently takes up to three and a half years.
<P>
	If the government intends to focus all of the bureau's 
resources at the appeal level it is obvious the first level 
acceptance rate will not increase. The intent is obviously not 
there. The majority of veterans will still have to wait years to get 
their disability pension. With the average age of veterans 
approaching 74 this is too little, too late.
<P>
	I firmly believe that if the process is to be speeded up the first 
level acceptance rate must be increased so there are few appeals. 
The way to accomplish that is twofold. First, have first level 
applications expertly filled out by a bureau lawyer so the 
veteran's case is solid. Second, the department should consider 
the success rate for past appeals, which is about 80 per cent, and 
use the benefit of the doubt clause more liberally to increase the 
first level acceptance rate. This two track approach would 
substantially speed up the system and serve the best interests of 
veterans.
<P>
	Now I will tackle the issue of veterans' rights. Last week the 
hon. member for Bonavista-Trinity-Conception stated the 
bill would not take away any of the current rights of veterans. 
This is not fact but it is a point of debate. I would argue that Bill 
C-67 takes away the rights of veterans in a number of areas.
<P>
<B>(1300) </B>
<P>
	It removes the Bureau of Pensions Advocates from the first 
level of decision making by adding it to the department. This 
calls into question the veterans right to solicitor/client 
privilege.
<P>
	At the first level the veteran will deal with a pension officer or 
paralegal who works directly for the department, not an 
independent lawyer or paralegal under the direction of a lawyer. 
Thus at the first level solicitor/client privilege is lost.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12552"> 12552 </A></B>
<P>
	If the veteran errs in the information given to his pension 
officer who works for the Department of Veterans Affairs, it 
could be used against the veteran when his case is adjudicated 
by that department. This is a conflict of interest. It presents an 
arrangement that precludes any sort of confidentiality between 
veterans and pension officers.
<P>
	The veteran<I> </I>also loses solicitor<I>client</I> privilege at the appeal 
level. He has access to a bureau lawyer. However the lawyer is 
no longer an independent solicitor who keeps the veteran's case 
in confidence. He is now an employee of the Department of 
Veterans Affairs. His paycheque comes from the Department of 
Veterans Affairs. I conclude this is a conflict of interest and 
works against veterans.
<P>
	How can the veteran be confident that the information he 
gives the bureau advocate will not be used against him when the 
advocate works for the department and not for him? The veteran 
is already angry and frustrated that he has to appeal his case in 
the first place. Now he has to trust another departmental 
employee with his case. Therefore under this legislation 
veterans will lose the right to solicitorclient privilege.
<P>
	I foresee another difficulty with the Bureau of Pensions 
Advocates being removed from the first level. Under Bill C-67 
the size of the bureaucracy will be increased and the minister 
will be getting more power to influence the department's 
internal affairs.
<P>
	I think every member of the House would agree that 
bureaucracies in the country are too big as it is. Under these 
proposals the minister may have undue influence over the whole 
decision making process, the quality of service or the rate of 
acceptance.
<P>
	Departmental employees will be vulnerable to receiving 
direction that could deter from encouraging veterans to pursue 
benefits and services to which they are entitled. They will also 
be under pressure to take part in fiscal restraint. Even an 
offhanded comment by the minister could affect the way his 
staff deals with veterans. We only have to look at the way the 
money markets danced and sang to the finance minister's 
prebudget comments, to the detriment of Canadians.
<P>
	Veterans will lose a number of other rights under the 
legislation. I have offered the government a number of 
amendments that would have corrected the situation. I was in 
consultation with many groups of veterans including the Royal 
Canadian Legion which represents some 250,000 veterans. The 
member opposite does not have an ear for listening to grassroots 
consultations.
<P>
	However it must be stated that it is totally unclear at this point 
what the regulations will say. We have not even seen the 
regulations or even know for a fact that they exist. The rights of 
veterans under Bill C-67 will no longer be law. The government 
has said that they will be in regulations. This is extremely 
important. Regulations can be easily changed behind closed 
doors, while laws must be changed in full view of the public.
<P>
	I conclude my remarks by stating that Bill C-67 is a bad piece 
of legislation for Canada and for Canada's veterans. This is 
unfortunate because we have lost an opportunity to speed up the 
process so that veterans get the service and the pensions they 
deserve. Instead veterans face more delays and a decrease in 
their rights and services.
<P>
<B>(1305) </B>
<P>
	Without a commitment on the part of the government to 
increase first level acceptance rates this cannot be legislated. 
The majority of veterans will be locked into a lengthy appeal 
process without an independent advocate or paralegal to guide 
them through. The veteran is now faced with the prospect of 
dealing with yet another bureaucrat that works for the 
department.
<P>
	I call on all members of the House to vote against Bill C-67. 
During the Remembrance Day ceremonies in the Netherlands 
that I took part in ``The Last Post'' was played at each and every 
one of the ceremonies. Let everyone in the House vote against 
the bill which sounds the last post for the rights of Canadian 
veterans. They fought and some of them died so that we would 
have the freedom to vote for what is right and for what is just. 
For once, let us have the courage to vote that way.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Leonard Hopkins (Renfrew-Nipissing-Pembroke, 
Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, Canada has the best veterans legislation in 
place of any country in the western world. Only France comes 
close to it.
<P>
	Let us not be too negative. As we discuss the bill and talk 
about these issues in the House of Commons let us remember 
that the veterans whom we have honoured, and rightly so, over 
the past number of days were not always against something. 
They were for something. They went out and fought for 
freedom. They fought for the world we enjoy today. They fought 
for this country today. We should not say all the time that they 
fought against something.
<P>
	We have legislation before us now that is among the best in 
the House. We have another example of the new decorum 
brought to the House by the Reform Party. Its members are 
trying to shout across the floor and raise a disturbance. They 
were to come here to bring a new dignity to Parliament.
<P>
	I would like to add a few words of support for the legislation 
that the Secretary of State for Veterans has brought forward to 
improve the veterans pension process. Veterans pensions are 
awarded for disability or death related to military service. 
Civilians who served in close support of the Canadian Armed 
Forces during wartime may also be entitled to pensions. Addi-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12553"> 12553 </A></B>
<P>
tional pension benefits can be paid to a pensioner's spouse and 
dependent children. Survivor pensions are payable to the spouse 
of a deceased pensioner.
<P>
	When we take all recipients into consideration we find that 
some 150,000 Canadians receive veterans pensions. The 1995 
rates provide for a minimum of $81.50 per month for single 
pensioners and $101.88 for married pensioners. The maximum 
benefit paid per month is $1,629.97 for single pensioners and 
$2,037.46 for married pensioners.
<P>
	Most of my colleagues on both sides of the House already 
have direct experience with the current pension process. In 
every province and territory we find veterans or other 
dependants who receive the benefits. In Ontario alone we find 
over 51,000 pension recipients. This is because Canadians from 
all provinces and territories served our country in the two world 
wars, Korea, and with the regular forces on peacekeeping 
missions. They served Canada well. Now it is time for Canada to 
pay its dues by making sure veterans receive the pensions they 
deserve.
<P>
<B>(1310) </B>
<P>
	Veterans do not deserve the delays they have encountered 
under the current system. Systems have to be updated. It is a sad 
state of affairs when a veteran has to wait 18 months or up to 
three years in some cases after the first application before he or 
she can receive a pension.
<P>
	The people at Veterans Affairs Canada are doing their best to 
speed the applications through the system, but the people at the 
Bureau of Pensions Advocates, the Canadian Pension 
Commission and the Veterans Appeal Board are trying hard to 
clear away the backlog of applications, but it gets harder every 
day.
<P>
	The whole system is overloaded right now. I understand that 
about 13,000 veterans are expected to apply for pensions this 
year. The administrators are doing what they can with the 
system that is now in place. It is high time we changed that 
system. The people who work in the current system want to see it 
changed. They know they could serve veterans more effectively 
if the process were streamlined. Veterans also want to see their 
cases settled more quickly.
<P>
	I am sure there is hardly a member in the House who has not at 
one stage or another been asked by a constituent to help them out 
on a veteran's case.
<P>
	The current process dates back to 1971. Individual parts of the 
administration of veterans pensions have been studied and 
changed since that time, but there has been no comprehensive 
reform of the entire process. The consequence of the piecemeal 
changes has been that an already complex process has become 
even more complicated and cumbersome. The measures before 
us will simplify the process from start to finish.
<P>
	In 1992 Veterans Affairs Canada conducted a study that 
identified a number of ways to improve the pension process. 
One of the most important ways of improving it was to speed up 
the turnaround times. Many of the recommendations of that 
1992 study have been implemented. However, to reduce 
turnaround times we now need the legislative changes included 
in Bill C-67.
<P>
	The legislation before us provides legislative change directed 
to giving effect to three proposals. First, responsibility for 
decisions will be transferred to Veterans Affairs Canada for the 
Canadian Pension Commission. Second, the Bureau of Pensions 
Advocates will become part of Veterans Affairs Canada and will 
concentrate on preparing cases for appeal. Third, the Canadian 
Pension Commission and the Veterans Appeal Board will be 
merged to create the new veterans review and appeal board.
<P>
	There will be no changes to benefits under the legislation. The 
two-tier appeal system will be maintained. Whereas the 
Canadian Pension Commission now decides on first 
applications and first appeals and the Veterans Appeal Board 
decides on final appeals, under the legislation before us the new 
veterans review and appeal board will be responsible for two 
levels of appeal.
<P>
	It is important to make very clear that veterans are not losing 
their appeal rights under the legislation before us. The new 
board will speed up the turnaround time. It will address the 
current backlog of cases awaiting appeal, but it will not deny 
appeal rights to veterans who have been told by Veterans Affairs 
Canada that they are not eligible for pensions, or who are not 
satisfied with the amount the department has awarded them.
<P>
	The new board will continue to report to Parliament and its 
members will continue to be governor in council appointees. 
The permanent membership of the combined board will 
eventually be reduced by eight, but only after the backlog has 
been eliminated. By unifying the Canadian Pension 
Commission and the Veterans Appeal Board into a single appeal 
body, the government is helping to pare down the system. This is 
part of the government-wide review of agencies and 
commissions led by the minister responsible for public service 
renewal. The objective is to simplify public sector structures 
and streamline their operations wherever possible, while 
improving service to the public.
<P>
<B>(1315) </B>
<P>
	That is why we should support this bill. I am sure that all 
members of this House recognize the importance of providing 
better service and faster turnaround times for our veterans. I am 
sure that all members endorse the objectives of streamlining the 
operations of government agencies, boards, and commissions.
<P>
	In the recent days of remembering the veterans who fought 
and remembering the 50th anniversary of the ending of World 
War II, we saw many heart-rending circumstances. I remember 
on one occasion when I was in Holland with a number of 
members from this House  of Commons we had ceremonies 
before our cenotaphs over there. In the Groesbeek cemetery, as 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12554"> 12554 </A></B>
<P>
we prepared to have our memorial cenotaph ceremony the 
farmers in the field surrounding that area left their horses 
standing in the field and left their hoes and other tools in the 
field and came over and stood around the cenotaph with us.
<P>
	We know that the Dutch feelings have been poured out to 
Canadians, not only during the last number of days but indeed 
during the last 50 years. It is one reason why we cannot hesitate 
for one moment to try to provide better medical services for 
veterans in this country. At the same time, we must remember 
the people who today are serving in the Canadian Armed Forces 
in very difficult areas of this world.
<P>
	Medical attention to veterans is very important. When we 
consider that the average age of World War II veterans today is 
73 years, it becomes more important that the process for their 
receiving pensions that are coming to them is speeded up.
<P>
	We all remember the days of our youth when young people 
were going off to war, whether it was the Korean War or the 
second world war. Others remember people leaving for 
peacekeeping operations. I remember very well that when I was 
in elementary school we had truckloads of these young 
Canadians passing by our rural school on their way to their 
training base and indeed some of them on their way overseas. 
They threw chocolate bars and candies to us in the schoolyard as 
they went by. Today these are the people we are talking about in 
this House of Commons. If there is any way we can speed up the 
process, get them their pensions, and make their days more 
comfortable at this time, then I am sure that is the objective of 
every member of this House.
<P>
	If we do not remember our veterans, if we do not look after 
them, then we as a nation are not keeping faith with those who 
died. They are their buddies. For those who returned home, it is 
our duty and the duty of any government and the Parliament of 
Canada to support anything that can be done to make the lives of 
our veterans more comfortable in the days they have left.
<P>
	I would ask the House to give third reading to this bill today so 
that we can get on with the process of putting it into place to try 
to get that backlog cleaned up in the meantime and make the 
process much speedier for the future without damaging the 
quality of service that is given to veterans in the hearing of their 
cases.
<P>
<B>(1320) </B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Godin:</B> Mr. Speaker, because I was a member of the 
committee that studied this bill, and since they are talking about 
fast-tracking the process at some point or other, I would like to 
ask my colleague to explain why it is such a long process, 
because it makes no sense at all that it takes so much time.
<P>
	Earlier, I gave two examples: the case of the veteran who has 
been trying to obtain a pension for 30 years and the case of the 
applicant who has now received, I think, some 12 or 14 
decisions, but is still awaiting the verdict.
<P>
	In committee we were told that only 30 per cent of all cases 
brought before the Canadian Pension Commission were 
accepted while 70 per cent of all cases subsequently submitted 
for review were accepted. Why? The commission could not 
explain this, it never looked into it, wondered, etc. The question 
I have always asked myself is whether partisan appointments to 
this commission were the reason.
<P>
	At a certain point, the Bloc Quebecois proposed that from now 
on-do not forget that these people are appointed for 10 
years-the provinces be consulted, that the process become 
more transparent and that the government start appointing 
people for their competence and not their political affiliation. I 
was surprised that the Liberal Party opposed the idea at the time. 
I would like to hear the hon. member's comments on the issue.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hopkins:</B> Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the hon. member 
for his question. He is quite right. If we want to talk about 
partisanship, I do not know the people who served in those 
positions, so I am not in a position to comment on their 
partisanship or otherwise on the floor of the House. However, I 
can tell the hon. member that it is the policy of the government 
to appoint well-qualified people to any boards or commissions 
that require appointments in the country, and the level of 
appointments to the various veterans boards will indeed be of 
good quality people.
<P>
	The other thing that has to be considered is not just their 
qualities academically, but they also have to have humanitarian 
qualities. They must have an understanding and a feeling for 
what they are doing. If you do not have a feeling for what you are 
doing when you deal with people's problems, that is when you 
run into difficulty.
<P>
	The hon. member probably hit it on the head when he 
mentioned partisanship. Anybody can talk about partisanship 
when they are in opposition. We used to do it ourselves. We are 
hearing the same thing today. However, I do not want to get into 
that, because it is a non-winner for everybody. The only thing 
that is a winner for the veterans of this country is that they get 
speedier service and that the people who are making those 
decisions are indeed qualified to make them, both from the 
understanding of the case before them and their feeling for the 
subject with which they are dealing.
<P>
	Sometimes cases are held up because all of the information is 
not there. I have dealt with cases myself where if I had had the 
information that was given to me several days or months 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12555"> 12555 </A></B>
<P>
afterwards I could have had the case pushed forward much more 
quickly for the veteran. Everyone along the line must have a real 
feeling for veterans issues. The appropriate information must be 
in the hands of the decision makers.
<P>
<B>(1325 ) </B>
<P>
	I could not agree more with the hon. member that the quality 
of people making the decision is extremely important. That is 
why any appointees in that area of decision making or any other 
area of decision making in government, in the public service, on 
boards or commissions, must be of the highest calibre of both 
personal and academic qualities.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ringma:</B> Mr. Speaker, is this on debate?
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> We are still on questions or comments. 
Is the member rising on questions or comments?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ringma:</B> No, I am not.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> I see no one else standing. Resuming 
debate, the hon. member for Nanaimo-Cowichan.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bob Ringma (Nanaimo-Cowichan, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I would like to talk about waiting. I have been waiting 
all week to get in a few words on this bill, with the vagaries of 
government.
<P>
	I would like to ask the Speaker if this debate is now cut off in 
five minutes.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Yes.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ringma:</B> So I have five minutes.
<P>
	I would like to start by saying that the intention of Bill C-67 is 
indeed good. I agree with the words of the hon. member for 
Renfrew-Nipissing-Pembroke that we must give veterans all 
the recognition possible and speed things up.
<P>
	This bill proposes to reduce the existing backlog of appealed 
pension cases and shorten the decision time. I do not think, with 
the way they are going about it, this will be achieved.
<P>
	The big thing I want to put front and centre is that I totally 
object to the removal of the Bureau of Pension Advocates from 
the first level. This is something that has given veterans the real 
representation they need to make their cases. By withdrawing it 
from that level and putting it into the second level the 
government is doing them a real disservice.
<P>
	The intent of the bill is to cut down the waiting time. I really 
wonder about that. I would like to share some of my experience 
with members of the House.
<P>
	Let us look at recognition of veterans today. How long does it 
take for us to recognize what is happening? It has taken us over 
50 years as a government, the Liberals or the Conservatives or 
whoever, to recognize the merchant navy. Merchant navy people 
have been trying to plead their case for all those years. Finally 
we are doing something about it.
<P>
	It took veterans of the Korean War 40 years to get a medal of 
their own. They said they thought they deserved something more 
than just a British Commonwealth medal or a United Nations 
one. It took 40 years for that.
<P>
	Dieppe was one of the costliest battles of World War II, the 
Dieppe landing. It took 50 years to get just a little clasp for a 
medal to recognize that very significant action, debatable action 
though it may be, at Dieppe. It took 50 years for that.
<P>
	We are still waiting for a Canadian volunteer service medal 
for peacekeeping operations. A proposal was put to the House to 
achieve it, but it was negated by the House. So those veterans are 
still waiting.
<P>
	All in all, National Defence and Veterans Affairs are very 
slow in reacting to anything. I suspect that C-67 is not going to 
improve that at all.
<P>
	Over my lifetime I can look at hearing problems within the 
military and of course with the veterans today. Hearing was 
recognized as problem, with people going onto the firing ranges 
and practising weaponry with no ear covers whatsoever. The 
result is that many of us have hearing loss today. It took years, 
literally decades, for the departments to recognize the problem 
and do something about it. That has left today's veterans with 
the same problem.
<P>
	Many of us went up to Atomic Energy of Canada Ltd. in Chalk 
River to clean up nuclear spills. The departments of national 
defence and veterans affairs to this day are putting their hands 
out saying that they will not talk about it.
<P>
	I went to clean up a spill in 1952 or 1953 and as a result, I 
became ill. When I retired some 30 years later, I put down as part 
of my release procedure that I had been subjected to this 
problem. Neither national defence nor veterans affairs would 
give recognition to it.
<P>
	On agent orange, our people have been to Vietnam. Perhaps 
they have been subjected to the effects of agent orange.
<P>
	I could go on but I see the Speaker is getting ready to close off 
debate. I must respect the Speaker's right.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The hon. member will have 15 minutes 
the next time the matter is debated. I apologize for interrupting 
his speech.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Boudria:</B> I rise on a point of order, Mr. Speaker. I know 
there are differences of opinion on some of the clauses of the 
bill. Notwithstanding that, I wonder if there would be consent to 
proceed to the vote. We could amend the bill as some members 
want in committee. I know that Monday is a very important 
veterans day for the war amputees in Canada. Perhaps we could 
do that. Some of the remarks of the hon. member could perhaps 
<P>

<B><A NAME="12556"> 12556 </A></B>
<P>
be heard at third reading instead. I found his remarks very 
profound and interesting, given his vast knowledge.
<P>
	Given the interest of so many people, I wonder if by 
unanimous consent we could do that because it involves 
improving benefits to so many Canadians who deserve it so 
much.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The point has been made that we are at 
third reading of the bill, so there will not be a committee process 
for the bill to go through. We can do it by unanimous consent.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> No.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> There is not unanimous consent.
<P>
	It being 1.30 p.m., we will now proceed to Private Members' 
Business.

	<B>Mr. Janko Peric </B><B>(Cambridge, Lib.)</B> moved that Bill C-316, 
an act to amend the Immigration Act and the Transfer of 
Offenders Act, be read the second time and referred to a 
committee.
<P>
	He said: Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to rise today to debate Bill 
C-316, an act to amend the Immigration Act and the Transfer of 
Offenders Act.
<P>
	I would like to start by thanking the members of the Private 
Members' Business subcommittee for realizing the importance 
of this legislation to the social fabric of our nation. Moreover by 
making this private member's bill votable, subcommittee 
members have acted upon a key principle which has been 
advocated by our minister of immigration in many forums.
<P>
	The minister and I on numerous occasions have said that 
Canada has a proud tradition of welcoming immigrants. 
Members know that both of us have personally benefited from 
that tradition.
<P>
	When I came to Canada from Croatia in 1968, I agreed to obey 
the laws of this nation. At that time I did not have the same rights 
as those who were already citizens. I could not vote. I could not 
have been a member of Parliament nor work for the federal 
government. I obeyed the law and was particularly careful to be 
on my best behaviour.
<P>
	The day that I finally did become a citizen was one of the 
happiest days of my life. To this day I have continued to uphold 
the laws and virtues of this country and I will continue to do so.
<P>
	The majority of our immigrants are model citizens. They 
work very hard to succeed in this country and they do so in a 
law-abiding manner.
<P>
<B>(1335 ) </B>
<P>
	However, a very small group of immigrants, and for that 
matter visitors, do not play by the rules. Some in this very small 
group have come to this great country, taken advantage of its 
generosity and disobeyed its laws. I would like those individuals 
to know that law-abiding immigrants and for that matter all 
Canadians, firmly believe that those individuals who are not 
citizens and who repeatedly show disrespect for the laws and 
people of Canada do not deserve to be here.
<P>
	Our laws have always recognized that serious criminality 
should have the consequence of removal from Canada. The 
current Immigration Act explicitly states as much and my bill 
reinforces that principle.
<P>
	The immigration enforcement improvement act simply aims 
to improve the way in which removal of violent offenders is 
executed. It streamlines a deportation procedure which has 
failed in the past, a procedure which has led to several 
inexcusable tragedies. Members may recall two of these 
inexcusable tragedies which occurred last spring.
<P>
	In April of last year, a 23-year old young woman by the name 
of Georgina Leimonis was murdered in the trendy Toronto 
restaurant, Just Desserts. She had been having coffee with her 
boyfriend. One of her killers, O'Neil Grant, was a non-citizen 
with a lengthy criminal record. Prior to the murder, he had been 
granted a five year stay of his deportation. Lawrence Augustus 
Brown, the shooter, had immigrated to Canada 10 years earlier 
and also had an extensive criminal record.
<P>
	The murder of Georgina Leimonis sent shock waves through 
Toronto and the entire country. In my riding of Cambridge, 20 
grade 10 students from Galt Collegiate took the time to express 
their shock and anger over the murder of this young, vibrant 
woman. Their letters moved me to a point where I knew 
something had to be done. I would like to share some of their 
comments with members here today. Amy Gibson wrote:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>We like to think of Canada as the best country in the world and I agree most of 
the time. We have a lot of freedom here-but what happens when we have so 
much freedom that we lose security? The murder of Georgina Leimonis is a 
good example. She didn't do anything wrong, she was innocently sitting in a 
cafe when she was shot. Soon we will be afraid to leave our houses.</BLOCKQUOTE>

	Devon Edwards echoed the comments of the majority of his 
classmates when he expressed how deeply saddened he was to 
read of the murder of Georgina Leimonis.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12557"> 12557 </A></B>
<P>
	The death of Georgina Leimonis was tragic but it was not an 
isolated incident. Less than two months after her murder, a 
25-year old metropolitan Toronto police officer, Constable 
Todd Baylis, was killed while on duty.
<P>
	Constable Todd Baylis and his partner had been out on a 
routine foot patrol when they spotted a suspect who was a known 
drug trafficker. As they began to pursue the suspect, a gun fight 
broke out and Constable Baylis was shot in the head before he 
could even draw his weapon.
<P>
	Constable Baylis' killer, Clinton Gayle, was very well known 
to police and immigration authorities. He had a lengthy criminal 
record which included several convictions for trafficking in 
narcotics, possession of unregistered and restricted weapons, 
assault, attempted theft and escape from custody. It was because 
of his criminality that Clinton Gayle had been ordered deported 
in 1991. At the time of Constable Baylis' murder, Gayle was out 
on $2,000 bond and had been awaiting deportation for a two year 
period.
<P>
<B>(1340) </B>
<P>
	I truly believe that Clinton Gayle would have been deported 
prior to the murder of Constable Todd Baylis had the measures 
contained in Bill C-316 been in place.
<P>
	Before I go any further, I would like members to know that the 
two cases I have just outlined are not isolated incidents. This is 
not just a Toronto problem. Tragedies such as these could have 
occurred and have occurred in Montreal, Vancouver and other 
parts of the country.
<P>
	The Minister of Citizenship and Immigration has made great 
strides to limit access by serious criminals to immigration 
procedures that delay their removal from Canada. As a result of 
measures contained in Bill C-44, the rights of serious criminals 
to appeals under the immigration system have been limited. 
These same individuals will no longer be eligible for any form 
of early release or parole if they are serving a sentence for a 
criminal offence.
<P>
	I applaud the minister for his swift action on these two 
elements and for his efforts to improve enforcement of 
deportation orders. However, I remain concerned that there is 
still room for serious offenders to fall through the cracks from 
the time they are sentenced to the time they are deported. My bill 
aims to fill those cracks.
<P>
	Bill C-316 would permit a court, in addition to any other 
sentence, to order the removal of a non-citizen convicted of an 
offence punishable by 10 years or more. These serious criminals 
would have access to appeals within the criminal process but not 
to appeals currently available under the Immigration Act.
<P>
	I understand there is some concern that the measures 
contained in this bill could be interpreted as a double 
punishment against non-citizens, a harsher sentence than a 
Canadian citizen committing the same crime would receive. The 
reality is that distinction currently exists. Non-citizens do not 
have all the rights of citizenship and non-citizens who commit 
crimes are currently subject to  a criminal sentence and 
deportation. The only difference is that with Bill C-316, sole 
responsibility for both matters would lie with the courts rather 
than with the immigration department.
<P>
	The measures being proposed would not only accelerate the 
deportation process of violent offenders but would also save the 
Canadian taxpayers money. The savings would primarily come 
from not having to duplicate the court hearing process. An 
offender's immigration status would be determined by the 
sentencing judge after an individual has been convicted of an 
offence punishable by 10 years or more as opposed to having one 
court determine criminality and the other immigration status.
<P>
	Although it may take judges some time to get their heads 
around this legislation, if we have the courtroom, the lawyers 
and a judge familiar with an individual's past and present 
record, does it not make sense to deal with both issues at once? I 
submit to you that it does and that the Canadian taxpayers would 
prefer to see it done this way. I also know that there are judges 
and crown prosecutors who would prefer to have it done this 
way.
<P>
	There are two additional measures of significance in this bill 
of which members should be aware. The first relates to how we 
treat offenders who came to Canada at an early age. Immigration 
advocates have argued that deporting someone who came to 
Canada as a child is unjust.
<P>
<B>(1345 ) </B>
<P>
	Some have even said our society should accept some 
responsibility for the way Clinton Gayle acted because he came 
to Canada in his early teens and was essentially a product of our 
environment. I agree with that argument to a certain degree. 
There has to come a point when we as Canadians say enough is 
enough.
<P>
	My bill proposes anyone who came to Canada prior to the age 
of 16 and has remained free of criminal conviction for a period 
of at least five years should be exempt from deportation.
<P>
	The second measure provides for the removal by court order 
of foreign offenders to their country of origin if reciprocal 
conditional release provisions exist in that country. The 
Transfer of Offenders Act currently makes provisions to transfer 
an offender to his or her country of origin if the offender chooses 
to be transferred and if a bilateral agreement exists.
<P>
	Bill C-316 will remove that decision from the offender and 
will transfer it to courts thereby allowing a judge to order that an 
offender will serve the remainder of his or her sentence in their 
country of origin. I acknowledge my proposal may require 
certain bilateral agreements to be amended but I am confident 
that can be done with relative ease.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12558"> 12558 </A></B>
<P>
	Concerns have been raised in reference to the possible 
deportation of family members with the offender. I advise the 
House these measures are currently contained in the 
Immigration Act. The reason for this is if the family members 
are financially dependent on the offender or if the offender was 
their sponsor, once the offender was transferred to his or her 
country of origin there would be an absence of financial support 
for the offender's family. This is currently done at the 
discretion of an immigration officer and under my bill it would 
be left to the discretion of the courts.
<P>
	The two key elements of the bill, namely that sentencing 
courts be allowed to order the deportation of a person convicted 
of an indictable offence carrying a penalty of 10 years or more, 
and that the crown be permitted to initiate the transfer of foreign 
nationals to their country of origin, were contained in the final 
report of the safety net conference held in Hamilton last fall.
<P>
	At this conference parliamentarians of different political 
stripes, immigration officials, immigration lawyers, 
enforcement authorities and victims groups specifically 
recommended the changes today being proposed in Bill C-316.
<P>
	The bill has received the endorsement of the Canadian Police 
Association, the Metro Toronto Police Association, Victims of 
Violence and CAVEAT. The Minister of Citizenship and 
Immigration has on several occasions stated consideration 
should be given authorizing judges to issue deportation orders at 
the time of sentencing rather than requiring a separate step. He 
included this suggestion in his strategy for immigration and 
citizenship entitled ``Into the 21st Century''. He mentioned it 
during his speech on Bill C-44. I know he has been giving Bill 
C-316 the utmost consideration because we have discussed it on 
numerous occasions.
<P>
	I have received a great deal of co-operation from the 
minister's office in preparing for today's occasion. However, I 
am aware the minister has some technical concerns with the bill 
and I have advised him I am prepared, willing and able to accept 
any amendments required to address the technical and drafting 
elements of the bill he is concerned with.
<P>
<B>(1350 ) </B>
<P>
	In conclusion, I leave members with the following to ponder. 
On April 2, I attended a memorial service for Georgina 
Leimonis in Toronto. Although the Leimonis family is still 
grieving the loss of Georgina, it does not want such a tragedy to 
be repeated. Members of the family have asked me to do 
everything in my power to see these amendments are enacted, 
and I am asking members for their support.
<P>
	I would also like members to remember these often repeated 
words which Miss Kristina Kolesnyk of Galt Collegiate shared 
with me in her letter following the death of Georgina Leimonis: 
those who do not learn from history are doomed to repeat it.
<P>
	Please support Bill C-316 so Canadians can feel more secure 
in their homes, neighbourhoods and on their streets.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Philip Mayfield (Cariboo-Chilcotin, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am pleased to have this opportunity to speak on behalf 
of the Reform Party on Bill C-316 put forward by the hon. 
member for Cambridge.
<P>
	It is very encouraging after a year and half to see the Liberals 
finally starting to realize Canada has a crime problem and action 
does have to be taken. Part of this action by necessity involves 
taking a hard look at our immigration policy. We must examine 
the safeguards now in place to deter immigrant criminals from 
coming to Canada.
<P>
	We must also scrutinize how to remove those who slip by the 
safeguards and cause pain to Canadian people. Our constituents 
expect no less from us.
<P>
	I will go through the bill in some detail and outline some of 
the flaws I see in it. I understand the Canadian Police 
Association had a major part in the drafting of the legislation. 
Nevertheless, there are some problems. I hope as I go through 
these the hon. member can either ease my concerns about some 
of the problems I see or commit himself to strengthening the 
provisions, intents and phrasing of Bill C-316.
<P>
	My first concern lies in what I see as the basic discriminatory 
nature of the bill. The purpose of Bill C-316 is to give Canada's 
judges an extra option when dealing with criminal immigrants. 
Not only could criminal charges be laid but the judge as a 
punishment could order deportation of the criminal, a unique 
sentencing option available only for immigrant criminals.
<P>
	Compare this with section 15(1) of the Canadian Charter of 
Rights and Freedoms:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Every individual is equal before and under the law, and has the right to equal 
protection and equal benefit of the law without discrimination and, in particular, 
without discrimination based on race, national or ethic origin, colour, religion, 
sex, age or mental or physical disability.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Under the bill those immigrants charged with a serious 
criminal offence will be under added pressure to plea bargain 
away the threat of deportation, a threat not facing a Canadian 
citizen in the same position. This provision appears to 
discriminate on the basis of national origin. For this reason 
alone I am fearful the bill would be struck down on its first 
charter challenge as being unconstitutional.
<P>
	Section 3.8 raises questions on the constitutionality of the 
bill. Under this section criminal immigrants ordered deported 
by a judge could never be entitled to a conditional release, 
statutory release, temporary absence or accelerated review 
under the Corrections and Conditional Release Act. There will 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12559"> 12559 </A></B>
<P>
be instances when a judge will be unable to have a criminal 
immigrant deported. I will touch on these instances later.
<P>
	If our criminal justice system is unable to carry through on a 
deportation it will have once again discriminated against a 
non-Canadian. Canadian criminals will be eligible for parole. 
Non-Canadian criminals, however, will have to serve out their 
full sentence no matter what circumstances surrounding their 
behaviour while in custody.
<P>
	Without a deportation an individual under these 
circumstances could spend the rest of his or her life in prison at 
the expense of the Canadian taxpayer. This again potentially 
violates both the word and spirit of section 15.1 of the Canadian 
Charter of Rights and Freedoms.
<P>
	Reform MPs believe in effective laws to deter crime, like the 
member who sponsored the bill. Reformers, however, believe in 
laws that will stand up under the scrutiny of our most basic 
rights, even challenges from the Trudeau charter, which many 
feel has failed to protected the basic fundamental rights of 
Canadians. That is another debate.
<P>
	We want laws will stand the test of time and unfortunately the 
bill as it is written fails to deliver.
<P>
<B>(1355 ) </B>
<P>
	Aside from these basic concerns there are a number of other 
serious problems with the bill that must be addressed at some 
point. Section 4.3 is one example of the short-sighted nature of 
the bill. As I mentioned earlier, a judge can add deportation as an 
additional punishment for non-Canadian criminals with any 
chance of parole removed. Yet section 4.3 states the criminal can 
only be deported to his home nation with the consent of that 
foreign state.
<P>
	Many countries like Somalia and Vietnam refuse to take back 
criminal nationals. Under the bill we could develop a backlog of 
criminals in limbo ordered to be deported but not allowed to 
leave, all the while with the Canadian taxpayer on the hook for 
their time in jail.
<P>
	Section 4.6 again highlights the seriousness of the bill's 
flaws. This section states no foreign criminal can be deported 
unless the criminal's home state either has conditional release 
laws similar to Canada's or agrees to conditional release 
provisions similar to Canada's.
<P>
	In effect the hon. member is asking the rest of the world to 
adopt Canada's haphazard criminal justice and parole systems. 
If others do not do so, and there are dozens such as Vietnam and 
the state of California, the federal government would be unable 
to deport them.
<P>
	I now ask the House to look at section 4. 5 of Bill C-316. It 
reads: ``The order may provide for the removal from Canada to 
the foreign state of members of the family of the foreign 
offender on the same basis as described in section 33 of that 
act'', that being the Immigration Act.
<P>
	When an individual commits a crime care for dependent 
children is assumed to be passed on to another family member, a 
wife, husband or other relative. When this is not possible, as is 
the case with a single parent, these dependants become wards of 
the state. Whether the provincial family services departments 
across the country would allow for the deportation of children 
into uncertain and potentially dangerous circumstances is not 
clear. This is an issue that should be examined at length before 
the House debates Bill C-316 again.
<P>
	Finally, I wish to bring to the attention of the House what I see 
as the largest oversight in the bill. Section 2 states section 3(f) of 
the Immigration Act would be amended by adding the 
following: the bill is to ``ensure the expeditious removal from 
Canada of any person who has entered Canada and has 
subsequently been convicted of a serious criminal offence while 
in Canada''.
<P>
	What does the word ``entered'' mean and to whom does it 
apply? The answer can be found in the Immigration Act 
definitions. According to the act the word ``entry'' and all its 
derivatives are defined as follows: ``Entry means lawful 
permission to come into Canada as a visitor''. The bill will only 
apply to those in Canada on a temporary basis. The bill will not 
affect criminal immigrants at all, only those temporarily in 
Canada who will have to leave in any event when their visitor's 
permit expires.
<P>
	I share the hon. member's concerns over criminal immigrants. 
During my time with the Standing Committee on Citizenship 
and Immigration these concerns were brushed aside time and 
again by Liberal MPs. The hon. member for Cambridge is a rare 
exception to that rule. This general indifference to criminal 
immigrants is sad to see since the small majority stains the 
entire immigration process.
<P>
	After all, each of us in the House has a family history that 
extends beyond this country's shores. Each of us is an immigrant 
or a descendant of immigrants.
<P>
	I and the rest of the Reform Party share this member's basic 
concerns that those who come to Canada unwilling to contribute 
peacefully to the betterment of our country but choose instead to 
violate its laws and threaten its people have no legitimate place 
in Canada.
<P>
	Regrettably Bill C-316 as it now stands has too many loose 
ends and too many unanswered questions. Should the member 
seek the unanimous consent of the House to withdraw the bill 
and have the material referred to the Standing Committee on 
Citizenship and Immigration, I would be more than willing to 
support him. The issue is too important to leave any longer and 
certainly has merit for further consideration.
<P>
	If he chooses to push ahead with the bill as is I will support it 
in second reading on principle and intent. If, however, each 
issue mentioned in my speech is not addressed and the numerous 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12560"> 12560 </A></B>
<P>
loose ends in the bill are not tidied up I will be unable to support 
it at third reading.
<P>
<B>(1400 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Derek Lee (Scarborough-Rouge River, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am very pleased to speak to this private member's bill 
introduced by the hon. member for Cambridge.
<P>
	One of the things that makes Canada so great is the make-up 
of its population. People have come to Canada from all over the 
world, including those who came hundreds and hundreds of 
years ago over the land bridge from Asia.
<P>
	However, as delightful and as strengthening as all of that is, 
there are a very small minority of immigrants from time to time 
within the country who refuse to take the benefit of and 
contribute to this longstanding tradition. Those relatively very 
few people break our laws and victimize our citizens. Some of 
these people are dangerous. This is unacceptable. Our country 
must deal with that very small group of people.
<P>
	The hon. member's bill focuses on that very small number of 
immigrants or others who come into this country illegally and 
have committed serious criminal offences, sometimes violent. 
This bill distinguishes the criminals from the overwhelming 
majority of law-abiding immigrants.
<P>
	I attended the CAVEAT Safety Net Conference this past 
September in Hamilton, Ontario. The conference was composed 
of leading justice reform and community activists as well as 
victim advocacy groups and persons from many other 
disciplines. The main goal of this conference was to put together 
draft legislation and public policy that would improve the safety 
of every Canadian. This bill takes into account many or some of 
the concerns raised at that conference.
<P>
	The bill would do the following. It permits a criminal court to 
order the removal of a non-citizen convicted of an offence 
punishable by 10 years or more. It would accelerate the 
deportation process that already exists today. Currently 
deportation orders can only be issued by immigration officials. 
However, this bill would authorize criminal court judges to 
issue deportation orders at the time of sentencing and obviate 
the need for a second deportation step procedure.
<P>
	The bill would not apply to anyone who arrived in Canada 
prior to reaching the age of 16 with some provisos.
<P>
	Canadian laws have always recognized that serious 
criminality should have the consequence of removal from this 
country. The bill aims to improve the procedure under which 
violent and serious offenders are deported. Offenders will be 
required to serve at least a portion of their sentence in Canada in 
order to ensure that fundamental justice from the perspective of 
Canadians will be served.
<P>
	The bill also provides for the removal by a court order of 
foreign offenders, that is non-citizens and persons illegally 
here, to their country of origin if reciprocal conditional release 
provisions exist in that country.
<P>
	I should bring a few background facts to the attention of the 
House. The current state of immigration procedures reveals that 
approximately 40,000 to 50,000 persons-a layman's guess 
based on publicly available information-remain in the country 
in violation of the terms of their admission or for whom arrest 
warrants have been issued. That includes people who have been 
ordered deported.
<P>
	Of this huge number, about 70 per cent are in the metro 
Toronto area. Many of those individuals will already have left 
the country on their own accord without checking in. Their 
names should not be on the system any more but we do not have 
a viable way of checking people out. There are about 2,000 
warrants for people who have been ordered deported due to their 
criminal conduct.
<P>
	We have a relative shortage of immigration officials. We have 
a great number of other government tasks we must do across this 
huge country and the people who are there are doing their best to 
manage our immigration laws and procedures.
<P>
<B>(1405 ) </B>
<P>
	In short, the bill would take the current two step procedure of 
conviction and deportation and combine them into one for 
serious offences, not for minor criminal offences.
<P>
	In a private member's bill intended to amend existing 
legislation, as my hon. friend opposite has pointed out, there are 
always some procedural and substantive issues which arise. We 
in the House realize that. The procedure today is to adopt the bill 
in principle and refer it to a committee. My friend opposite has 
mentioned a number of things which will have to be looked at in 
this bill. I do not agree with everything on his list, but he has hit 
most of the hot buttons.
<P>
	I would want colleagues to look closely at the application of 
this bill to the dependents of deportees. In addition, there would 
have to be some procedural preparation for criminal court 
judges to enable them to handle this type of procedure in the 
sentencing procedure at the end of a criminal trial. That needs 
some work as well. I know that colleagues on the citizenship and 
immigration committee will be able to do exactly that if the bill 
is adopted and referred by the House.
<P>
	All of this would only happen with the co-operation of the 
Minister of Citizenship and Immigration, which I hope the hon. 
member for Cambridge will have. I would like to congratulate 
him on putting forward a private member's bill which addresses 
a procedural need. I hope it will fill the arguable procedural void 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12561"> 12561 </A></B>
<P>
which exists now, the arguable duplication procedure which 
exists now, and that at the end of the day we will have a good and 
fair  procedure, one which is efficacious for the intended 
purpose.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Mary Clancy (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Citizenship and Immigration, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, let me begin 
by stating the obvious. There has always been crime in Canada. 
It is an unfortunate part of our society and of every society. Let 
us face it, there always will be an element within any population 
that disobeys the laws which govern the land.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	However, we have the good fortune of being spared, for the 
most part, the violent criminal activity that goes on in other 
parts of the world. Despite what some newspapers and television 
shows would have us believe, we really are a peaceful and 
law-abiding people. But that does not mean that nothing bad 
happens here. Let us not delude ourselves, such incidents can 
occur and indeed already have.
<P>
	Fortunately, we have a strong judicial system to deter crime. 
It is a system that I like to believe is impartial and fair. It is not 
perfect. Nothing is perfect in this world. But, in my opinion, the 
system works reasonably well.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Times do change. What may have been relevant 10 or 20 years 
ago may not be adequate to deal with the realities of the 
mid-1990s. New technologies are creating new types of 
criminal activity and new challenges for enforcement officials. 
The government recognizes that times change and that 
legislation must follow suit. Take, for example, the justice 
minister's proposed gun legislation. That is but one example of 
how the government is acting to curb crime. That is an example 
of good legislation; thoughtful legislation which weighs the 
pros and cons and comes up with a reasoned, rational and 
workable solution to a problem which faces us all.
<P>
	It is with a similar intention that my hon. colleague and 
friend, the hon. member for Cambridge, has introduced his 
proposed legislation today. He is to be commended for his 
commitment to keeping the streets of his community and his 
country safe. No one here can doubt that his heart is in the right 
place. However, I cannot support the motion before the House 
today, for unlike the aforementioned legislation on gun control, 
Bill C-316 is not workable in its present form.
<P>
<B>(1410 ) </B>
<P>
	While on the surface some of its proposals may sound 
persuasive and may even make some sense in practice, they 
would simply cause more problems than they would fix.
<P>
	We are all in agreement that we must deal firmly with violent 
criminals. We must deal firmly with those who come to this 
country to commit crime. Canada is a generous and welcoming 
place but we will not be used as fools. The Canadian government 
will protect Canadian citizens and institutions from becoming 
the target of foreign criminals.
<P>
	When someone comes to our country and betrays our 
generosity and good nature with criminal activity we must not 
allow them to remain. The message is clear: Play by the rules or 
leave. However, Bill C-316 does not give us the tools we need to 
remove these people. If anything, it would complicate an 
already complex removal process.
<P>
	First, the legislation raises some serious constitutional 
questions. The Supreme Court has established that deportation 
is not a form of punishment but rather an administrative 
decision taken by Canada. Bill C-316 seeks to change this. By 
making deportation a sentencing option, it suddenly becomes a 
criminal punishment. If this were to be the case, then there are 
no fewer than three constitutional clauses that could be used to 
argue against the sentence.
<P>
	Section 15 of the charter is one example. It could be argued 
that two tiers of punishment would be available to judges if Bill 
C-316 came into effect, one for citizens, the other for 
non-citizens. There would be a case where people commit the 
same crime, yet the punishment would be more harsh for one 
than for the other. This goes against the fundamental idea that 
Canadian justice treats everyone fairly and equally.
<P>
	It could also be argued that removal from Canada would 
represent a second form of punishment in addition to any other 
sentence. In effect, non-citizens would face the prospect of 
being punished twice for the same offence.
<P>
	Finally, if deportation is seen as a criminal punishment, it 
could perhaps be construed as cruel and unusual punishment. It 
could be argued that removing a permanent resident from 
Canada is tantamount to denying for life that person's right to be 
with family and friends, to earn a living or to communicate 
freely in the course of daily living. This would put it in direct 
opposition to section 12 of the charter.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	As you can see from this brief overview, the legislative 
provisions raise serious potential problems. If they are adopted, 
there is a strong possibility that even the most minor matter will 
give rise to constitutional free-for-alls that could last years and 
cost taxpayers hundreds of thousands of dollars, even millions.
<P>
	Using measures that, in all likelihood, would slow down the 
enforcement of the law when the public is clamouring for better, 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12562"> 12562 </A></B>
<P>
faster and more efficient government management of the 
country seems irresponsible.
<P>
	We have to find a way to speed up the deportation process and 
not to paralyze the judicial system with excessive legal 
considerations.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	I have touched on the constitutional arguments against this 
bill. Now let me discuss broader reasons that I cannot support it. 
If it were to pass we would be transferring the responsibility for 
removing potentially dangerous criminals from the federal 
immigration department, whose representatives are experts in 
the field, to provincial crown attorneys and judges. We should 
not dilute federal responsibility for something as important as 
the deportation of violent offenders.
<P>
	I am not questioning the competence of provincial crown 
attorneys or judges, far from it. However these individuals 
already have exceptionally busy dockets and in many cases do 
not have the time or the expertise to deal with complex 
immigration cases.
<P>
	As well, the international obligations Canada has with respect 
to immigration matters are not well known to judges acting in 
criminal matters. As a result it would take both time and money 
to train lawyers and judges to deal with immigration cases.
<P>
	Furthermore, we must recognize that recommendations to the 
provincial court may take into consideration many factors which 
should not be part of a deportation hearing. Plea bargaining 
could become a convenient way for people who should not be in 
this country to stay in this country. Who is to say that 
deportation could actually be carried out?
<P>
<B>(1415 ) </B>
<P>
	Once a judge orders an offender removed, is it the court's 
responsibility to deport the individual? What would happen with 
the order of a judge that cannot be executed because the 
individual cannot be received outside Canada? Is the court to 
find a suitable country? Is the jurisdiction to be transferred back 
to the immigration department after the order has proven to be 
impossible to execute?
<P>
	Deportation can be a complex process requiring travel 
documents and international co-operation. These are affairs that 
are best handled by the immigration department which will 
continue to be responsible for all other deportations of persons 
who have entered Canada illegally, have been convicted of 
serious crimes in other countries, or have otherwise violated the 
Immigration Act.
<P>
	This is not the only part of the bill which neglects to take into 
account the fact that Canada cannot unilaterally remove people 
to other countries. The section concerning changes to the 
Transfer of Offenders Act also seems to forget that we need 
international co-operation to have an effective removal system.
<P>
	The purpose of the act is to accommodate non-Canadians 
serving sentences by making it possible, on the basis of an 
arrangement between states, to transfer offenders so that they 
can serve time in their homeland. The act is not meant to support 
orders that may have been made by courts. In fact the act has 
nothing to do with the legal system. It is based on arrangements 
of an administrative nature between sovereign states.
<P>
	Bill C-316 wants to change this. It proposes that the act be 
amended to allow Canada to remove any foreign criminal 
serving time in a Canadian prison. This just is not realistic. 
What would be the incentive of a foreign country to pass a treaty 
with Canada whereby we would transfer to them the cost of 
punishing offenders who have committed crimes here? The 
answer is simple. There is none.
<P>
	The legislation may also be potentially unfair to a defendant 
in a deportation hearing. The government wants to ensure that 
all dangerous foreign offenders are ordered removed. We also 
want to ensure that humanitarian concerns which are an 
important part of the immigration system are consistently 
applied to all persons subject to removal orders.
<P>
	I think we would all agree it is generally pretty easy to stand 
and criticize something. What is difficult is to work hard to find 
alternatives that do work. I am happy to say that we in 
government do not just sit and listen. We act.
<P>
	Many of the proposals the bill would seem to resolve have 
already been dealt with in Bill C-44. As members know, the 
legislation was recently approved by the House and is currently 
before the Senate. Bill C-44 is good legislation. A serious 
criminal element, no matter how small, that has infiltrated our 
immigration system can be handled by Bill C-44.
<P>
	In closing, the government is making progress in tackling the 
small number of criminals who have infiltrated our immigration 
program. The system works but it could work better. We 
recognize this and as a result we have taken action. I can assure 
members that we will continue with the progress, but we must 
take measured steps and weigh our options carefully. All too 
often there is a difference between what sounds good and what is 
practical.
<P>
	We congratulate the hon. member for Cambridge for his 
initiative, but at this time Bill C-316 just does not fit the 
situation.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Tom Wappel (Scarborough West, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
am pleased to rise today to offer my thoughts on the bill 
presented by my friend and colleague from Cambridge, Bill 
C-316, an act to amend the Immigration Act and the Transfer of 
Offenders Act.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="12563"> 12563 </A></B>
<P>
	I congratulate the member for Cambridge, first, for bringing 
forward the bill that would amend the Immigration Act and, 
second, for being able to convince the appropriate House 
committee that the matter is of such urgency that it should be 
a votable item. This demonstrates that the issue the hon. 
member has brought forward is one of concern to a significant 
number of people across Canada.
<P>
	I congratulate the hon. member because he has brought an 
interesting perspective to the debate in the sense that he is an 
immigrant to the country. He had to comply with the rules and 
regulations that were in place at the time he came to Canada. He 
knows what a privilege it is to be a Canadian citizen and how 
lucky those of us who were born in Canada are.
<P>
	The hon. member did something that I could never do. He 
chose his country. In choosing that country he knew what the 
rules and regulations were. His hard work in this country has 
been rewarded by the fact that he is sitting in the most august 
House of Commons and is able to represent his constituents on 
matters of concern to them.
<P>
	The issues raised by the hon. member in his private member's 
bill are issues of concern not only to the people of Cambridge 
but also to the people of Scarborough West. I say with some 
certainty that they are the concerns of many Canadians across 
the land.
<P>
	The reason I say this is that in the 34th Parliament I was the 
immigration critic for the Liberal Party for a period of time. In 
that capacity I was asked by my leader to travel across the 
country and speak with Canadians about immigration issues, 
which I did. Time after time after time, regardless of whether it 
was in Victoria, Moose Jaw, Halifax, St. John's or Scarborough, 
one issue that was raised was that of people who arrive in 
Canada, are not citizens, do not appreciate the privilege of being 
here and commit heinous crimes.
<P>
	In my own riding there was a situation where someone came 
from a country and pistol whipped a McDonald's employee for 
the pure pleasure of pistol whipping this person. It was clearly 
identified in the evidence. He committed armed robbery. He was 
obviously armed with the pistol that he assaulted the person 
with. He was committed to jail for a period of time. Then 
through a series of legal manoeuvres over a period of five years, 
extending through the first period of time that I was a member of 
Parliament, he succeeded in thwarting the immigration system 
and the deportation system. He was able to use every so-called 
legal manoeuvre to remain here in spite of the fact that 
subsequent to being released from jail for the armed robbery he 
was caught, charged and convicted of trafficking in drugs. He 
was still allowed to remain here through a series of legal 
technicalities.
<P>
	After persistent pushing by the immigration department 
through a series of frustrating events involving the meshing of 
the judicial system and the immigration system, about which the 
parliamentary  secretary was talking earlier and which caused 
delay and frustrated the department of immigration, the person 
was finally deported at the end of 1994. It was to the great relief 
of everyone concerned about the activities he had been involved 
in, including the immigration department, myself and my 
constituents who were personally attacked by the individual 
who was nothing but a downright, low-down criminal that 
should have been thrown out of the country upon his first 
conviction.
<P>
	This is a private member's bill. We have heard from others 
that private members' bills are never perfect. I speak from 
experience of private members' bills that have been accepted by 
the House. We do not have departmental officials and 
departmental awareness of the issue on a day to day basis to help 
us. We come up with a germ of an idea. We see if people 
generally like it and we try to get it approved in principle so that 
it can be looked at in committee and amended if necessary. This 
is precisely what the hon. member has done.
<P>
	Let us look at the bill in the very short time that I have left. 
The purpose of the bill is to provide the following:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>If a person is convicted of an offence punishable by 10 or more years 
imprisonment and is or is seeking permission to remain in Canada but is not yet a 
citizen, the court may, on application by the prosecution, order, in addition to any 
other sentence, that the person and anyone dependent on the person be removed 
from Canada.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	I would be hard pressed to find a constituent of Scarborough 
West who on principle would disagree that a person who has 
committed a crime in this country, punishable by more than 10 
years in prison, should not be deported. The proposition is the 
correct one. It is supported by the vast majority of Canadians, 
certainly those with whom I have interchanged on the subject.
<P>
	We get into technicalities and that is true. We get into 
potential constitutional arguments and that is true. How do we 
even deal with the problem if we are afraid to bring something 
forward because it might possibly in the future contravene some 
section of the charter? We cannot operate like that. We have to 
do the best we can.
<P>
	For example, it was brought up, and legitimately so, that there 
could be some constitutional arguments, such as how does the 
crown know anything about the immigration system. One 
potential amendment one could suggest immediately upon a 
cursory review of the bill might be in subclause 3(2) of this bill, 
dealing with section 32.1 of the Immigration Act, whereby one 
could put an amendment that the crown, on the recommendation 
of the immigration department, could make an application to the 
court to have the person deported.
<P>
	Where there is a will there is a way. It is that simple. Once we 
recognize that there is a principle that is worthy of proceeding 
with, it is simply a question of figuring out how to do it. If Bill 
<P>

<B><A NAME="12564"> 12564 </A></B>
<P>
C-316 is the way, fine. If it is not the way, then we know the 
problem, we know what Canadians want, we know what the 
solution is, and it is  the job of the people of this House to figure 
out the way to accomplish that solution.
<P>
	That in itself is a reason for the hon. member to be 
commended. I agree with the parliamentary secretary that this 
government should be commended for having dealt with part of 
these issues in the bill that we recently passed in this House. I 
agree that that bill will help, but it is not by itself the answer.
<P>
	I dare say, Mr. Speaker, I do not think you would be too hard 
pressed to find anyone in Canada who would not say as a starting 
principle that if you are not a citizen of the country and have 
committed a serious offence in which you could be sentenced to 
10 years or more, out you go, and you had better have a mighty 
good reason to convince Canadians that you should stay.
<P>
	The bill provides for that. It provides for an opportunity for 
the potential deportee to have counsel and to speak. It provides 
for the appeal mechanism. It also provides for the situation 
where someone perhaps came here at age five and for all intents 
and purposes is a Canadian, has forgotten for technical reasons 
to apply for Canadian citizenship, has not been involved with 
the law before and perhaps at age 30 commits an offence. The 
person for all intents and purposes is a Canadian citizen except 
technically. The bill deals with that. It provides that it would not 
apply to circumstances of that nature.
<P>
	In brief and in closing, I simply want to congratulate the 
member again for identifying a problem that certainly irritates 
Canadians-Canadians who are tolerant, Canadians who are by 
and large either immigrants themselves or the descendants of 
immigrants, who tolerate and want immigration, who are happy 
to see immigration to this country and who realize that 
immigrants are a benefit to this country.
<P>
	We know as surely as we stand here that for every person who 
is convicted of an offence and abuses the hospitality of the 
country, there are 10,000 who would come here tomorrow and 
never even get a parking ticket.
<P>
	I say that we have to look at those people who are prepared to 
come here and abide by the laws of this country and have very 
little tolerance for those who abuse our hospitality.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The time provided for the 
consideration of Private Members' Business has now expired.
<P>
	It being 2.23 p.m., the House stands adjourned until Monday 
at 11 a.m.
