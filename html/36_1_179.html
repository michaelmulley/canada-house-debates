somewhat suspect for a number of years.  There is suspicion among 
people that it is using the money it brings in from regular mail 
to subsidize other aspects of its operation, for example its 
courier service and electronic mail, and to drive its private 
market competitors out.  In Calgary we had people who went ahead 
and had their own mail delivery service called T2P overnight. I 
think we can deliver better service with Canada Post by allowing 
competition so people can see what other options there are out 
there.

</I></B></P><P align=left>He said:  Madam Speaker, it is my pleasure to introduce my 
private member's bill in the House today.  This bill would 
establish a minimum two year sentence for second or subsequent 
convictions of break and enters on dwelling houses.  I am proud 
to state that I have the support of the justice ministers of 
Alberta and Manitoba.  It is my hope that this private member's 
bill will receive support from my colleagues so we can 
effectively address this national problem. Canadians view break 
and enter crimes as more than just property crimes.  They view 
them as crimes against the person.

in the sense that it requires all legislation and new programs 
introduced by the government to be costed.  That costing or the 
anticipation of that cost is then scrutinized by the auditor 
general.  It essentially allows us as legislators to understand 
the basic costs of new programs.

<A NAME="LINK44">&nbsp;</A>
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That, in the opinion of this House, the 
government should take steps to alleviate the burden of poverty 
in Canada by encouraging self-sufficiency and self-reliance, and 
to that end, should increase the basic Income Tax credit to 
$10,000, index the tax brakets and index the Child Tax Benefit. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>She said: Madam Speaker, I would like to inform you that I will 
be sharing my time with my colleague, the member for 
Madawaska—Restigouche. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have decided today to put a matter of national urgency before 
the House, a matter that cannot wait any longer. I am referring 
to poverty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Barely a few days before the next federal budget is tabled, I 
consider it entirely appropriate to hold a public debate on this 
national scourge, which continues to be one of the main 
obstacles to equal opportunity in Canadian society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like right off to establish the parameters of the debate 
I am initiating today with the aid of a historic reminder.  On 
November 24, 1989, this House witnessed a rare act of solidarity 
on a matter of national urgency, the unanimous passing of a 
resolution expressing a common desire to eliminate child poverty 
in Canada by 2000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Despite this desire, clearly and—I said it and I repeat 
it—unanimously expressed, there are today 564,000 more children 
living in poverty than there were in 1989.  In fact, the rate of 
child poverty rose from 15% to 21% during this period. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In other words, this means that one child in five is exposed 
daily to the cruel consequences of misery and poverty.  The 
reason these children are living in such conditions is that 
their parents are among the 20% of the Canadian population who 
live below the poverty line. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These alarming figures have moved me on numerous occasions in 
recent months to beg the Minister of Finance to make children a 
priority in the next federal budget, among other things by 
indexing the national child benefit in order to ensure that 
families receiving it maintain their purchasing power. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have reminded him of how vital it is to invest right now in 
the well-being of our children, so that they may develop to their 
full potential and contribute to Canadian society later on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yet every time I have tried to get a commitment from him, or 
from any other minister of the Liberal government, I have had to 
settle for a nicely recited litany, always the same one, of 
nothing but columns of figures.  All these statistics are, of 
course, aimed at singing the praises of this government and how 
well it has done in improving the economy and creating 
employment.

<A HREF="#LINKT4"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Instead of openly admitting the deplorable situation in which 
some of the children of this country are living, and instead of 
assuming their responsibilities by putting their shoulders to 
the wheel in order to correct this national aberration, the 
members of the government are content to issue glowing reports 
about the excellent health of our public finances.  Yet they 
cleverly forget to point out that, in order to attain that 
excellent health, they have given up providing a social safety 
net for Canadians.  They also cleverly neglect to mention that 
this race toward economic recovery leads to an even more marked 
deterioration in the living conditions of those whose financial 
situation is already precarious. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The director of Repas Granby et Région Inc., a social advocacy 
group in my riding, recently informed me of the dramatic impact 
this insane pursuit of economic recovery can have sometimes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I hear him tell the story of this single mother who must 
sometimes resort to prostitution in order to support her 
children or that of a welfare recipient who committed suicide 
upon learning that her benefits had been cut, I understandably 
cannot applaud the government's approach to putting its fiscal 
house in order. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think therefore that it is appropriate to mention an important 
fact, which has been overlooked in the government's rhetoric. 
In its two terms, the government opposite will have chopped more 
than $10 billion from social transfer payments, yet it continues 
to portray itself as the champion of the young, the old and the 
unemployed and of social programs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, the Prime Minister was nowhere to be seen yesterday 
morning, when victims of his so-called sound management rallied 
on Parliament Hill to condemn his vision of wealth distribution. 
I was there, along with my leader, the right hon. Joe Clark, and 
my colleague, the hon. member for Madawaska—Restigouche. I can 
tell you that the government's triumphalist statements about its 
good management of public affairs are not very well received by 
this bitter and desperate constituency. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On behalf of these and of all Canadians who bear the brunt of 
this government's economic policies every day, I urge my 
colleagues not to give up. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These people, who came to Ottawa to express their anger and 
despair, need our vigilance and support. They are a living 
reminder of this government's economic failure. In spite of what 
the Prime Minister and his government colleagues may say, they 
failed miserably in their most basic duties by letting some of 
their fellow citizens become so impoverished that they have to 
do without food and shelter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not the only one who is running out of patience with the 
government's indifference. 
The Prime Minister should ask young people if they are happy to 
wait, to hear nice speeches, to see their debt reach excessive 
proportions, and to find out that post-secondary education is 
becoming increasingly inaccessible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Young people are not any more gullible than us. They know that 
it is the Liberals who contributed to the gradual and systematic 
erosion of our public education system. Again, the Liberals' 
wealth redistribution record has been absolutely dismal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since 1989, the year which I used in my introduction as our base 
year for this debate, average family income in Canada has fallen 
by roughly 4%. It has gone down, not up. 
Yet, the Minister of Finance claims that the economic 
fundamentals are right, that unemployment continues to go down, 
and that inflation is below 1%. Despite all that and despite the 
fact that the economy, as the minister says, is doing better, 
the question is: Better for whom? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is certainly not better for the average Canadian family, 
whose income has gone down by 4% in recent years. It is not 
better for the children I met this morning at a school in the 
national capital region, where we served breakfast. These 
children, who were shamelessly abandoned by the state, must rely 
on charitable organizations to start their day with some food in 
their stomachs.

<A HREF="#LINKT5"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is definitely not better for families on welfare, which must 
face a daily reality that most of us cannot even imagine. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my riding, the co-ordinator of the Association coopérative 
d'économie familiale de Granby recently told me about the 
anguish experienced by these families toward the end of a month, 
when the fridge and the cupboard are empty, or when spring 
heralds the arrival not of flowers and birds but of the letter 
they will receive from Hydro-Quebec demanding that they pay the 
arrears accumulated during the winter, otherwise power will be 
cut off. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This may all be very new for our well-fed and well-lodged 
ministers, but it is nothing unusual in the lives of a growing 
number of our fellow citizens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The proof is in the number of food banks, which have almost 
tripled in Canada since 1989.  According to the Canadian 
Association of Food Banks, the number of communities relying on 
this service has risen from 180 in 1989 to 508 in 1998. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I must confess I have long been puzzled by cabinet's 
indifference to the national tragedy I have just described. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>After all, this is the same government that signed the 
Copenhagen accords in 1995, committing it to take concrete 
action to improve the living conditions of the poorest of the 
poor in Canada. 
I would almost have to conclude that this attitude on the part 
of government members indicates a flagrant lack of compassion 
for the more unfortunate members of our society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That would certainly confirm the popular belief that 
legislators, the very people with the power to change things, 
are often indifferent to the basic needs of those they 
represent.  But I am an optimist by nature and I refuse to 
believe that the government will not listen to reason. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Time is running out.  Something must be done.  The issue of 
poverty must be addressed without further delay.  Canadians want 
a proactive government that will get moving and do whatever it 
takes to put an end to the national disgrace of poverty in this 
country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Solutions exist. 
All that is lacking is the willingness to do something.  One of 
the things the government could do is to remedy the inequality 
of taxation practices and not tax low wage earners to death.  It 
could also encourage self-sufficiency and self-reliance by 
increasing the basic income tax credit to $10,000 and indexing 
the tax tables and the child tax benefit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On behalf of our society's most disadvantaged members, I call on 
the government to show leadership and compassion.

bringing this issue once again before the House for debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have been very concerned about the issue of bracket creep 
which is more or less what she is talking about.  I do not want 
to play cheap politics, but I was taken aback when she said that 
she and Joe Clark were outside yesterday with the poor on 
Parliament Hill.  I thought:  Where was Mr. Clark in 1984 when 
legislation was introduced which created bracket creep? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This problem was created by that party.  That party, in its 
wisdom, said it was not going to index anything unless it was 
over 3 percentage points.  She is absolutely correct that since 
that time low income families of the country have been devastated 
by a constant erosion of their incomes.

people cannot get out of.  In other words if someone is making 
something like $10,000 or $15,000 and wants to make an extra 
dollar, the marginal rate of tax is 50%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Her motion talks about assisting self-sufficiency.  I agree with 
her that we have to something about it, but she should not stand 
and say that she and Mr. Clark were very concerned about the poor 
people outside this door the other day.  Mr. Clark was sitting in 
these very chairs as a minister when that legislation was passed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I always hear about the great wonderful things we should do.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Diane St-Jacques:</B> Madam Speaker, I am very sensitive to my 
colleague's comments, and I also think he is sensitive to the 
issue of poverty.  However, his remarks today concern a period 
of full blown economic crisis.  The federal government did what 
had to be done at the time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since 1993, however, the economy has recovered, and the 
government still continues to overtax employees at hugely 
excessive rates.  It cut over $10 billion in social transfers. 
It made bad choices. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are here today to debate, and not necessarily to toss the 
ball back and forth. 
We have to find solutions now.  We have to stop talking and find 
ways to help these people.  The things that happened in the past 
are in the past, and there are reasons why they happened. 
Today, let us take the time to find ways to help people who are 
suffering now. 
<P><A NAME="LINK46"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. André Harvey (Chicoutimi, PC):</B> Madam Speaker, I would first 
like to congratulate my colleagues from Shefford and 
Madawaska—Restigouche. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the past two years, my colleague has shown concern about the 
situation of the poor and the disadvantaged, and I think that 
this is a very important matter.  I was smiling, because my 
colleague from the Liberal Party was talking about the situation 
in 1984, when the Liberals had just increased the debt eleven 
fold, from $18 billion to $200 billion.  We doubled it in nine 
years, for reasons he is familiar with, namely debt service. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would ask my colleague, given that the fight against poverty 
concerns taxation, if there might not be one time measures to be 
taken.  One of the greatest growth sectors of the economy are 
the soup kitchens and shelters for the homeless.  Right now, 
there is no program to help these two types of agencies, which 
need funding urgently. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to ask my colleague whether she thinks the upcoming 
budget could contain a specific program to support these two 
types of agencies, which are helping the most disadvantaged. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Diane St-Jacques:</B> Madam Speaker, I would like to thank my 
hon. colleague from Chicoutimi, who shares my great concerns 
about poverty, for his words. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I agree there ought to be programs to help these people.  As I 
said, food bank use has nearly tripled.  There are, I believe, 
some things that need to be done on this score. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I could give a number of examples in my riding of people whose 
income is not enough to cover housing and clothes, and when the 
end of the month is approaching, there is nothing left in the 
cupboard to eat. Something must be done.  Food is a primary 
need.

this motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a motion of vital importance to me.  There is no doubt 
that a lot of statistics will be recited to us today, some more 
disquieting than others.  In my own riding, nearly 20% of 
families were low income families in 1995.  That same year, 
close to 50% of single people were in the low income category.

</I></B></P><P align=left>In other words, the problem of poverty is not only an urban one. 
It does not manifest itself only in major centres.  Poverty is 
a scourge in all regions and in all communities in Canada.  We 
have a duty to address this problem in a concrete manner.  We 
could spend weeks and months throwing up our hands at the huge 
scope of the problem, but that will do nothing to help the poor 
of this country, 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion we are presenting today offers some really down to

income individuals such as the elderly, young people and 
children, single mothers, low wage earners, and many others. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The issue of poverty is very complex, which is why we know very 
little about the true state of poverty in our country.  As a 
country we have not developed an effective way to identify and 
measure poverty.  We have not identified all the causes of 
poverty and we do not have an effective and complete strategy to 
eliminate poverty.  That may be a tall order, but unless we take 
specific first steps poverty will continue to grow. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House has always been full of good intentions.  In 1989, 10 
years ago, members of the House gave their unanimous support to a 
motion which sought to achieve the goal of eliminating poverty 
among Canadian children by the year 2000.  A mere 10 months away 
from this critical date, the rate of children living in poverty 
has grown by 500,000, from 1 million in 1989 to 1.5 million in 
1999.  This is a true shame and a national tragedy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to quote one parliamentarian who spoke in the 1989 
debate: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I never hear the Minister of Finance talk about the real deficit 
of this country, which is those one million kids in poverty. That 
is the real lack of investment.  That is the real tragedy. That 
is the greatest deficit we face.  That is the problem, and there 
is nothing being done to address that kind of issue. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The person I have just quoted is the current foreign affairs 
minister of the Liberal government.  I look forward to hearing 
his comments today to find out if he is proud that many more 
children go hungry every night because of his government's 
policies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The growing rate of poverty has become an international 
embarrassment for Canada.  Last December a United Nations 
committee chastised Canada for its inaction in this domain.  The 
1998 report of the United Nations Committee on Economics, Social 
and Cultural Rights is less than flattering and Canada has a long 
way to go to meet the covenant obligations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The UN report pointed out that since 1994, in addressing the 
budget deficits by slashing social expenditures, Canada has not 
paid sufficient attention to the adverse consequences of the 
enjoyment of economic, social and cultural rights by the Canadian 
population as a whole. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It also notes that the absence of an official poverty line makes 
it difficult to hold federal, provincial and territorial 
governments accountable for their obligation under a covenant. 
There has been little or no progress in the alleviation of social 
and economic deprivation among aboriginal peoples.  In all but 
two provinces the national child benefit is in fact only given to 
children of working poor parents instead of all children of low 
income families as it was meant to be given.

</I></B></P><P align=left>A reading of the UN committee's report leaves us with the 
impression that, in recent years, poverty has become an even 
more serious problem in Canada. Our country boasts about being a 
champion of human rights, co-operation and compensation.  This 
means the international community should see us as a country 
that is trying to eliminate poverty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, based on our Prime Minister's recent actions, it looks 
like the tarnishing of Canada's international reputation is no 
big deal for this government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Reports such as this one serve two main purposes. First, because 
they tarnish our international reputation, they motivate us to 
take quick action to solve the issue and thus limit the damage. 
Second, they make us see the point of view of outsiders who have 
no direct interest in the affairs of our country. Consequently, 
these reports are generally quite objective, honest and fair. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Most people are prepared to talk about poverty and are concerned 
about the poor. Unfortunately, when the time comes to act, they 
usually decide to use their time and energy for other purposes. 
To merely talk about poverty does not help alleviate the problem 
at all. If we really want to eliminate poverty, we must 
immediately take concrete action. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is only one way to eliminate poverty and it is by placing 
more money in the hands of Canadians.  The government can do this 
through lower taxes and tax exemptions, better education and the 
creation of an environment that will stimulate economic growth 
and development. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the motion we have proposed today we have identified but a 
few simple steps that would go a long way toward helping poor 
people.  We suggest that the government should increase the basic 
income tax credit to $10,000.  It should index tax brackets and 
index the child tax benefit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are many other measures that could be undertaken and I am 
sure we will hear many other suggestions today from all parties 
in the House during the debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>No one party can lay claim to the best solutions to eliminate 
poverty and no one party can appropriate social conscience to the 
exclusion of all others.  Within our chosen parties we are 
individuals who serve the people that live in our communities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The people in my riding want us to act to better the lives of 
many of our neighbours, our friends and even strangers we have 
never met.  I for one look forward to listening to my colleagues 
in the House in the hope of having a non-partisan and productive 
debate on this burning issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I stand before the House I am reminded of the words of John 
Donne, a 16th century English poet and clergyman who wrote the 
following:

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, 
I say at the outset that I agree with the sentiment of the motion 
before the House today on poverty.  It is an extremely important 
issue.  It is an issue that puts our children particularly as 
having the first call on the resources of the nation, and with 
that I agree. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With regard to the specifics of the motion I do not agree. 
I want to quickly share why I do not agree on each of the points 
and ask for the member's comments. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1045"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT10"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT10"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1045

<A HREF="#LINKT9"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first item is with regard to increasing the basic amount, 
the non-refundable tax credit from the current $6,456 up to 
$10,000.  That action would in fact be a benefit for all 
Canadians right across the board.  It would be a tremendously 
expensive proposition and certainly would not focus dollars. 
Therefore I am not in favour of across the board increases. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, indexing the brackets would simply only benefit those 
who are currently making over $30,000 a year.  Again it misses 
the target. The target is not those making more than $30,000 a 
year.  We all know it is something much less. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, with regard to the child tax benefit, there is no 
question that is one that specifically does go because it is 
income tested to our lowest income Canadians.  An indexation of 
that in the current year would only generate an additional $14 a 
year to a family.  That itself is absolutely insignificant 
compared to the cost of the other matters the Conservative Party 
is raising today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All of the things his party is proposing have nothing to do with 
real poverty.  Given that, would the member not agree that the 
important element in addressing poverty is first to define real 
poverty, not relative poverty, and to establish ways in which we 
can focus and target our resources to deal with real poverty in 
Canada?  Real poverty is what they were talking about in 1989, 
food, shelter and clothing, and not what they are talking about 
today on child poverty, when they say that child poverty exists 
when children cannot go to a birthday party because they cannot 
afford a good enough gift. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jean Dubé:</B>  Madam Speaker, before I answer that 
question I would like to propose an amendment to the motion, that 
the words— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B>  I am afraid 
at this point the member is not permitted to propose a motion. 
The member may answer the question. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jean Dubé:</B> Madam Speaker, I am pleased to answer the 
question. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As far as measuring real poverty, yes, there is a problem with 
that in Canada.  I do agree we have to find a way to measure the 
real percentage of real poor people in Canada.  With the way it 
is now measured with the LICO, the low income cutoff, we know and 
Statistics Canada knows that it is not the right way to measure 
it. Yes, we must identify first of all what the real rate of 
poverty is. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As far as tax exemptions, we have spoken about the $10,000 as 
proposed by us today.  It is certainly a first step.  I do not 
see where a government can charge taxes to people earning under 
$10,000.  It is absolutely ludicrous to even think that people 
earning under $10,000 have to pay taxes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to note something here.  The 1990 Liberal caucus 
task force, which was co-chaired by the finance minister, 
recommended: more funding for affordable housing in provincial 
transfers; new federal-provincial programs to assist working poor 
with housing costs; holding a national conference on the 
homeless; increasing the funding of housing co-ops; looking for 
new ways to use housing co-ops; making surplus crown lands 
available below market value for low income housing; encouraging 
public-private partnerships to build affordable housing; and 
eliminating substandard aboriginal housing by 2000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those were recommendations made by the current finance minister 
in 1990.  Like so many other Liberal promises, all of these 
remain unfulfilled. 
<P><A NAME="LINK49"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Tony Valeri (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Finance, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, since this government first 
came to office, the overall level of the tax burden and 
especially how it impacts the most vulnerable in our society has 
been a major consideration in our budget deliberations. This year 
is no exception. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to thank the hon. member for raising an issue that 
is not only timely but also is of considerable importance and 
relevance to our underlying success and stature as a nation. 
It provides an appropriate opportunity to highlight actions that 
our government has taken in budget after budget. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1050"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT10"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Both the Prime Minister and the Minister of Finance are on 
record as saying that our government is committed to reducing the 
tax burden on Canadians. The 1998 budget gave concrete proof of 
this commitment and that this commitment is real, with over $7 
billion over three years to the benefit of 14 million Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Both the Prime Minister and Minister of Finance have made it 
clear that our priority within tax reduction is to give first 
place to those who are in the greatest need, those in poverty or 
those with low incomes and especially families with children. 
Here again our budgets have given proof to this priority through 
real performance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, in the 1998 budget we acted to increase the amount 
of yearly income that low income Canadians can receive on a tax 
free basis by $500.  That took 400,000 Canadians off the federal 
tax rolls completely. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even more important in my mind has been the work we have done 
with the provinces and territories in the development of the 
national child benefit system. Our goal is to ensure that 
children are always better off when their parents leave welfare. 
That is why the 1997 budget announced an $850 million increase in 
our support to low income families through the Canada child tax 
benefit.  That was followed up in the 1998 budget with measures 
to provide an additional $850 million increase in the child tax 
benefit, $425 million in July 1999 and $425 million in July 2000. 
Taken together, these measures benefit about 1.4 million Canadian 
families with 2.5 million children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me make one thing clear.  Our government recognizes 
completely that such measures are but steps, though important 
steps, in a much longer journey. We make no claims that we have 
done enough in the battle against need and hardship, but what we 
have done is what we could afford to do.  This is the reason that 
while I respect the intent of today's motion, I cannot endorse 
its sweeping menu of action. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to remember that just five years ago this nation was 
burdened with a deficit of $42 billion.  Interest payments on our 
surging debt were consuming about 33 cents of every tax dollar. 
Our fiscal follies were exacting a painful price.  It was 
measured in interest rates that were too high and job creation 
that was too low.  That is why our government has constantly 
balanced our commitment to tax reduction and our priority to ease 
the burden on low income Canadians with another equally binding 
commitment, that is, before all else to get the government's 
books back in balance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is important to understand is that these two binding 
commitments are not in conflict.  They actually reinforce each 
other. The proof of this is also very visible today.  The surest 
form of sustained assistance for Canadians in need is the 
opportunity to earn a better living, and that means jobs. The 
surest way for the government to obtain the revenues to better 
assist Canadians in need is through real economic growth, the 
type of growth that is helped by low interest rates and marked by 
growing employment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We were not going to achieve these things if we were to continue 
as a nation to borrow against the future.  That is why we took 
tough consistent action to put an end to government that lived 
beyond its means.  Our success here is also a matter of record. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the fiscal year 1997-98 we eliminated the deficit for the 
first time in over 25 years and we committed ourselves to 
balanced budgets again this year and in 1999-2000.  It was not an 
abstract achievement.  It has helped to position us so that 
despite a difficult global economy, Canada is still recording 
moderate growth.  More importantly, this January our unemployment 
rolls fell to 7.8%.  Yes that is still too high, but it is also 
the best performance since June 1990. In other words more 
Canadians are working than we have seen in almost a decade.  That 
is the best way, the most sustained way to hit poverty head on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was our fiscal success that made it possible for last year's 
budget to begin the process of broad based tax relief so many 
Canadians desire.  We were able to undertake investments such as 
the millennium scholarship fund, an investment that will help 
thousands of young Canadians obtain a higher education.

<A HREF="#LINKT11"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I emphasize once again that there is much more to be done but we 
will not do it in a way that jeopardizes the sustained advances, 
fiscal and economic, that have been hard earned by Canadians. 
That is why we did not and still do not have the luxury of moving 
toward the menu of actions the hon. member opposite is 
suggesting. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The world economy is still volatile. Private sector forecasts of 
Canadian economic growth have been consistently ratcheted down 
over the last nine months. While there have been some positive 
indications currently, the time is much too soon to make the kind 
of tax reduction commitments that are being suggested in this 
motion which we would pay for year after year after year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yes we will continue our process of expanding tax relief as the 
Prime Minister and the Minister of Finance have stated, but we 
will also place continuing value on prudent planning and fiscal 
forecasts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We dare not repeat the error of the hon. member's own party when 
it was in government of relying on rosy forecasts today that 
deliver economic turmoil and fiscal failure in the years that 
follow.  No, we will continue our balanced approach because it is 
the approach that helps the most Canadians in the most need in 
the surest way. It is the approach that best ensures our 
government can continue to provide real assistance where it 
matters and in a way that can be sustained. Let me remind the 
House that this targeted approach to helping those in need has 
been a constant in budget after budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know that charities are vital partners in the battle against 
poverty.  That is why in our very first budget we lowered the 
threshold by which charitable donations begin to earn the 29% tax 
credit. We know that taking targeted action to boost assistance 
to students and to people trying to improve their economic 
condition by upgrading their education helps address poverty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, it is hardly strange that our government's record 
of tax relief may not be as dramatic or all encompassing as some 
opposition members say they would like it to be. It is always 
easy to spend money when one is not answerable to the future 
consequences. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A responsible government has to address more than just good 
intentions.  It also has to face hard facts and deal with real 
risks. That means facing up to continuing fiscal constraints and 
dealing with the real risk of economic volatility. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The most important fact of all is that this government has 
proven year after year and budget after budget that a balanced 
and moderate approach delivers the results that Canadians want 
and that Canadians deserve. These results are positioning all 
Canadians for a more secure future whereby we can continue to 
deliver genuine gains for Canadians in need, rather than just 
pontificate politically as we just heard from the party opposite. 
<P><A NAME="LINK50"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Scott Brison (Kings—Hants, PC):</B>  Madam Speaker, I 
would urge that the parliamentary secretary not reduce this to 
pure partisanship.  This issue requires all parliamentarians to 
work to ensure that this issue is addressed because poverty and 
particularly poverty affecting children is something that all 
parliamentarians should take very seriously. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My question for the parliamentary secretary relates to the 
employment insurance fund.  The fact is that EI premiums are a 
regressive tax on the poorest of Canadians. Somebody making 
$39,000 per year in Canada pays the same amount of EI premiums as 
somebody making $300,000 per year.  It is grossly unfair in that 
regard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The changes made by this government to EI benefits has hurt 
significantly.  The draconian changes have savaged benefits for 
instance for seasonal workers. In my riding 4,580 people 
qualified for EI in 1994.  That was reduced to 3,130 in 1997. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to read from correspondence received from one of my 
constituents.  I want the parliamentary secretary to hear this so 
that he has some awareness of how his government's changes in 
employment insurance have affected people living in rural Canada 
and the rural poor. 
This is one letter I received: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>How do you expect people to live on $200 per month for food, 
clothes, fuel, lights.  Try to run a vehicle when the nearest 
town is 40 miles away.  The government has never fought for 
seasonal workers.  Seasonal workers need fairer treatment.  How 
do you think small businesses, stores, farms can deal without 
crop pickers, without road work, without forestry workers, 
without strawberry pickers and planters, blueberry rakers, what 
about landscapers and roofers?

</I></B></P><P align=left>The changes made have impacted significantly, particularly rural 
Canada, and have created a sense of poverty that is egregious and 
unacceptable in our country.  It is time we stand up and take off 
our ideological blinders in the House.  It is time to do what is 
right and either reduce the EI premiums such that more Canadians 
can go back to work or take that fund for what it was designed, a 
fund to benefit those people who paid into it.  It is absolutely 
grossly unfair that the EI fund which was designed to benefit the 
poorest of Canadians is being taken now by this government to pad 
its books to look better for the finance minister's records. It 
is no good to have a country that is in the black when Canadians 
are in the red. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Tony Valeri:</B>  Madam Speaker, for the benefit of the 
hon. member I will repeat what I said when I first stood up.  I 
indicated that the raising of this issue was not only timely but 
of considerable importance and relevance to our underlying 
success in stature as a nation.  If the hon. member would like, I 
would certainly take the time to provide him with a transcript of 
what I had said. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to his comments on EI, one only has to remember not 
too long ago when the Conservative government was here in Ottawa 
when it did nothing but increase EI premiums, devastate the 
economy and increase poverty in this country.  That government 
did nothing but have employment insurance premiums going up, 
unemployment going up and the economy going down.  And this hon. 
member has the audacity to get up and talk about what this 
government has done in a negative way. January was the seventh 
consecutive month in which employment increased.  There has been 
an average increase of about 57,000 jobs per month over those 
seven months. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We all know the issue of poverty is an issue we would like to 
deal with.  Every parliamentarian in this House would like to 
deal with poverty but most parliamentarians in this House 
understand that whatever it is we do as a government, we must do 
it in a measured fashion.  On one hand he talks about doing 
something on the benefit side while on the other hand he talks 
about ripping seven or eight billion dollars out of the bottom 
line to deal with his EI premiums because he thinks it is going 
to create jobs. When I speak to small business people they say 
“reduce my EI premiums and I will hire as many people as you 
like”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Small business is concerned about the relevance of the economy. 
That means interest rates, a growing economy and growing 
opportunity which is what this government is providing.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):</B>  Madam Speaker,  it is an 
honour to stand in the House of Commons, this place of debate on 
the behalf of Canadian people, to debate this Progressive 
Conservative Party motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important to be aware of what that motion actually says. I 
will address a technical problem in it shortly.  It states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That, in the opinion of this House, the government should take 
steps to alleviate the burden of poverty in Canada by encouraging 
self-sufficiency and self-reliance and, to that end, should 
increase the basic income tax credit to $10,000, index the tax 
brackets and index the child tax benefit. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is interesting to me when the word poverty is used.  We 
always characterize Canadians as caring.  That is what we are in 
this country. That is one of the great benefits of being a 
Canadian.  That is one of the things that makes me so grateful to 
be a Canadian, that we can help one another.

this statement.  We want to address the problem of poverty.  We 
want to alleviate poverty.  Second, what is the method whereby 
one does that? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to address the question of the definition of 
poverty.  I believe I have stated this in this House before but 
it bears repetition.  I think it is very important. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our eldest son spent some time in different countries working 
with Christian relief organizations.  I remember the time when he 
was in southern Sudan where there was a lot of poverty and 
famine. Brent communicated back to us “We are having great 
success where we now are.  When we first came there were 150 
children every day dying of starvation. We have reduced that 
number to 60”. He then put into brackets “of course, by 
Sherwood Park standards,” a town near where we live, “we have 
not yet reached the goal”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think it boggles our minds.  It wrenches our hearts to think 
of moms and dads and family members burying their children 
because they have died from starvation.  That is true poverty.  I 
sometimes think maybe as a country we are very selfish because of 
the definition we use for poverty when there are children around 
the world who literally are starving to death because there is 
absolutely no food. I have seen these pictures. I am sure that 
all members have seen them, little children with the distended 
abdomens swelling from starvation.  It is very sad. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe that not very many children in Canada actually die of 
starvation.  There may be some but I believe it is very few. Of 
course, if there are any, that is not acceptable.  Surely in our 
country, the richest country in terms of resources, an eager 
population willing to work, we can provide for every one of our 
citizens so that they do not live in poverty but rather have 
sufficient food, adequate clothing and adequate shelter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I taught mathematics for 31 years.  One thing I always resisted 
was a statistical application to marks in my classes.  I always 
set out standards.  I said to my students “When you graduate, I 
want you to have competence”.  When I taught surveying students 
I said “You will not survive as a surveyor if you do not have a 
mark of 70%, 80% or 90% in trigonometry because that is the basic 
building block of your program.  I expect you to get more than 
70%.  I will not fail one-fourth of you because you are in the 
bottom quarter of the class”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yet that is part of the statistical measure that we use in 
Canada to define poverty.  I simply question the integrity of 
that measure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the measures used is that any child living in a family 
whose income is less than one-half of the median income is living 
in poverty.  If our median income in Canada for a family is 
$56,000, which I think is close to the number, that means anyone 
with a family income of less than $28,000 is living in abject 
poverty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yet I know many people who earn $18,000 a year who have families 
and children.  They do not consider themselves living in poverty. 
They have adequate food, clothing and shelter.  So I think we 
should be intellectually honest. 
We should exercise integrity in our definition of poverty, always 
remembering there are people who are having trouble making ends 
meet.  There is no doubt about that.

</I></B></P><P align=left>It goes without saying, it is inevitable that living in a 
country where every penny earned is subject to taxation, where 
the governments confiscate 55% of everything earned, there is not 
enough left for us in order to alleviate poverty.  We are causing 
the poverty.  Think of how many millions of people who would not 
have a problem of poverty if we stopped taking that money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a technical error in the bill.  I am sure the PCs did 
not mean this, that they wanted to increase the basic income tax 
credit to $10,000 since that is about 10 times what it is now. I 
move: 
<A NAME="LINK52">&nbsp;</A>
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Replace the words “increase the basic income tax credit to 
$10,000” with “increase the tax free threshold to $7,900”. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have two reasons for this amendment.  The income tax credit is 
an income tax term which basically relates to the amount of money 
returned to families based on their taxable income.  There used 
to be a basic exemption, a certain amount of income on which we 
did not have to pay income tax. That amount is now nominally 
about $6,400 for an individual and a little less for a spouse. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The tax credit given on the income tax is actually $1,098.  I am 
sure the PCs did not mean to increase the tax credit from $1,098 
to $10,000.  That is unreal.  The amount I propose is a more 
realistic figure.  Instead of having about $6,400 exempt from 
taxation, it is about $7,900.  It is still an increase and the 
basic personal credit would be increased to $1,300.  That is the 
wording of it and I am sure that the members of the party that 
proposed the motion today will agree with this amendment since it 
clarifies what they want.  It brings it to a more realistic 
number and basically should settle the issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B>  The debate is on the 
amendment. 
<P><A NAME="LINK53"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Bryden (Wentworth—Burlington, Lib.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, the member pointed out there is a flaw in the motion and 
he has moved an amendment correct that flaw. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Mississauga South pointed out that the two other 
aspects of the motion would have very little effect. Limiting 
bracket creep to all incomes means that it would affect all 
Canadians and it would have very little effect on the 
impoverished.  The member for Mississauga South also pointed out 
that the recommendation with respect to the child tax benefit 
would result only in a net benefit of about $14 a year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A motion like this really is a partisan motion because it is not 
so much the content of the motion or whether the content of the 
motion is worthy or practical. 
It is a motion that is designed to put us in the situation where, 
if we voted against it, it would appear we were voting against 
combating poverty.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope the member and his party will examine this motion on its 
merits and show courage when they vote, and not support it simply 
because they are afraid to be branded as being against combating 
child poverty.  They should treat this motion for what it is 
worth, and it is not a very practical motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp:</B>  Madam Speaker, I think it is an eminently 
practical motion, as amended.  I believe it is high time that we 
start leaving more money in the hands of families so they can 
avoid poverty, instead of driving them into poverty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are many businesses which end up declaring bankruptcy 
because of the high levels of taxation.  They lay off their 
people and they land in poverty.  If we had a tax regime that 
would allow them to thrive and survive, then we would have less 
poverty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have seen people who are jobless.  My family used to serve 
soup in the evenings to homeless people.  We used to minister to 
them.  We provided basic food to them. The best thing possible 
that we could do for them would be to provide them with a job. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How does one do that?  It is not by overtaxing Canadian 
businesses, families and individuals and then having a huge army 
of bureaucrats to distribute the money.  The answer is very 
simple.  Leave that money with the people.  They will drive the 
economy because they will have money for food, for housing, for 
shelter, for clothing and for some of the luxuries of life.  That 
is what drives the economy.  That is what provides jobs. These 
people now, in much greater numbers, would have jobs. Meanwhile, 
we would still have a greater income, even at lower rates, 
because more people would be employed and the economy would 
thrive.  With that additional money we could generously provide 
for those who because of physical and other problems cannot work. 
I know those people too.  I have friends who are unable to work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wish I had more money in my pocket so I could help them 
directly.  I have done that from time to time.  However, the 
taxation level is such now that after we pay our bills we have 
scarcely anything left.  It is unfortunate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The way to handle this is through organizations.  Yesterday we 
talked about the homeless.  There are many private organizations, 
such as Habitat for Humanity, which more efficiently handle 
limited resources in providing homes for the homeless than does 
any government bureaucracy.  That is what I am talking about. 
<P><A NAME="LINK54"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Scott Brison (Kings—Hants, PC):</B>  Madam Speaker, did 
the member actually say that some Canadians may starve, but not 
many?  Does he actually believe that the homeless have chosen 
somehow to be homeless?  Does he believe that there are not 
children who are going to school hungry in the mornings?  Does he 
recognize that in constituencies like mine there are families of 
four making less than $10,000 per year, living in squalor? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps it is easier for him.  Based on statistics, he has a 9% 
poverty rating in his riding.  But for those of us who represent 
ridings with significantly more poverty this is a real issue.  It 
is very easy for someone in the House making around $100,000 a 
year to pontificate about Adam Smith, but there is a lot of 
poverty out there and there are a lot of people who need our 
help. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp:</B>  Madam Speaker, yes, I am aware of the fact 
that there are some people who are hungry.  However, I do not 
believe—and my words were specific—that they are starving to 
death.  That is what I was talking about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I insist—

<P><A NAME="LINK55"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe—Bagot, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
wish to thank the hon. member for Shefford for this opportunity 
to debate an issue as important as poverty, and children living 
in poverty in particular. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I must congratulate the hon. member for Shefford, who has done a 
wonderful job on this issue. Ever since she was elected to this 
place, she has had a thought-provoking input. To her credit, she 
also made representations at various levels to denounce the 
alarming growth in poverty, especially among children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Like the hon. member for Shefford, we have noticed that the 
poverty situation is critical. 
There are at least 5 million Quebeckers and Canadians living in 
poverty today. Since 1989, poverty has grown by approximately 
45% in Canada. That represents a substantial deterioration of 
the situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>You will recall that 1989 is the year when Canada signed the UN 
Convention on the Rights of the Child. Since 1989, not only have 
we not managed to reduce child poverty in this country, but the 
number of poor children has actually increased by 500,000. In 
1989, we had 1 million children living in poverty, with parents 
who were themselves living in poverty; today their number has 
grown to 1.5 million. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The situation has worsened particularly since 1993, when this 
government took office. 
There are three reasons for the spiralling poverty of parents 
and children in Quebec and in Canada, all of them attributable 
to the policies of the Liberal Party and of the Minister of 
Finance, who loves to tell us about his record surpluses. What 
he fails to mention is that his pockets are full because those 
of the public, particularly the poor, are emptier. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since it first came to power in 1993, this government has 
deliberately set out on three courses of poverty creation. 
First, it has increased taxes.  Since the Minister of Finance, 
the member for LaSalle—Émard, brought down the first Liberal 
budget in 1994, individual and corporate taxes have gone up by 
$34 billion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of this $34 billion, over $20 billion comes out of the pockets 
of individual taxpayers.  People pay $20 billion more in taxes 
today than they did before the Liberal Minister of Finance 
brought down his first budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Corporate taxes have increased by over $14 billion since 1994 
and this has led to pockets of poverty.  When corporations are 
overtaxed—as they are by the Minister of Finance—they do not 
create enough jobs, nor do they make the contribution to the 
community's prosperity that they should.  This is the first 
problem created by this government that has led to an increase 
in poverty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second is the cuts in social transfers to the provinces, 
particular those for social assistance, post-secondary education 
and health. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1125"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT18"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT18"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1125
<A HREF="#LINKT19"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border=0 alt="+"></A>
<A HREF="#LINKT17"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>With his 1995 budget, the Minister of Finance inaugurated a 
regulatory mechanism for his various transfers to the provinces 
for social programs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Every year, the provinces have $6 billion taken from them, to 
finance social assistance in particular.  Social assistance is 
an anti-poverty program which helps those in greatest need. 
Since 1995, this government has set in motion a totally 
hypocritical policy which means that, year after year, without 
any need for the Minister of Finance to make any announcement, 
$6 billion is taken away from the provinces, in part to finance 
social assistance, all the anti-poverty programs, and health. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By the year 2003, some $40 billion will have been drained off by 
this government to finance social programs.  After all that we 
have the Minister of Finance standing up, hand over heart, to 
talk about poor children.  This is shameful.  This is hypocrisy, 
pure and simple.  This Minister of Finance ought to be ashamed. 
He would like to bask in praise for his success in improving 
public finances, but this success has been achieved at the 
expense of the most disadvantaged, at the expense of middle- and 
low-income taxpayers.  He deserves no congratulations.  He ought 
to be ashamed of his part in destroying the legacy of his 
father, a man who was a great builder of social programs in his 
day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The third deliberate action by this government that has had an 
effect on poverty is the creation of an employment insurance 
plan that is so Manichaean and so removed from its initial 
objectives as to have only 36% of the unemployed in 1999 benefit 
from it.  That is a shame.  And if it does not amount to 
throwing families and children deliberately into poverty, what 
does it do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the moment, only 36% of the unemployed receive employment 
insurance.  That means that 64% of the unemployed, who should 
receive benefits, are marginalized on the labour market, forced 
to take welfare and impoverished by this government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore, we have three primary sources of poverty arising from 
a term and a half of Liberals in office and an unscrupulous 
Minister of Finance cutting wildly everywhere it hurt the most, 
that is, in the pockets of the public already hit by poverty and 
struggling with every month end.  Then they come bleating about 
poverty and talking about returning the money the provinces had 
cut.  Are they hypocrites or what?  They are the ones who cut 
the funds to the provincial governments to pay for health care, 
social welfare and antipoverty programs and now they come crying 
over the fate of the poor. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Human Resources Development even wrote a book 
during his term of office.  I have criticized that enough, it 
would be overdoing it if I did it again today.  He was going on 
in his book about the most disadvantaged when he was the artisan 
of the marginalization of whole families. 
Thousands of children are living in poverty because of him. He 
bleats on in his book, when he should sit down in his office and 
redo the entire employment insurance program.  He should propose 
something reasonable, which does not exclude the unemployed from 
a plan intended to help them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the subject of these three sources of poverty, we in the Bloc 
Quebecois have presented our proposals on several occasions 
since September, following our prebudget tour of Quebec.  The 
first time was before the Standing Committee on Finance.  The 
second was when we tabled a minority report in the context of 
the prebudget activities of the Standing Committee on Finance. 
And finally, the third time was when we held a press conference 
in December to identify our budget expectations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Given these three deliberate measures that have pushed people 
toward poverty, the motion should have asked the government—and 
I say this with all due respect to my colleague—to, first of 
all, improve access to employment insurance, because that 
program no longer makes any sense. The EI program systematically 
puts families on the street and increases poverty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, the motion should have asked for an increase in 
transfers to the provinces. Not one quarter or one half of what 
should be given, but the whole amount taken from the provinces 
year after year, that is $6 billion annually until the year 
2003. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Third, we agree with the Conservative Party that tax tables 
should be indexed. Clearly, these tables should be indexed. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1130"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT19"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT19"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1130

<A HREF="#LINKT18"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our three suggestions are within the budget limits that a 
responsible federal government must set for itself. If we look 
at the anticipated surpluses for this year and next year, our 
three proposals are fully within the limits of the federal 
government's financial authority. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are asking the government to improve access to employment 
insurance by providing up to $6 billion. We are also asking it 
to set aside another $6 billion for transfers to the provinces. 
This makes a total of $12 billion, to which we must add $2 
billion to index the tax brackets. We arrive at a grand total of 
$14 billion, while this year's surplus is expected to be around 
$15 billion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By contrast, the Progressive Conservative Party's proposals, 
including those made in its minority report, in December, 
largely exceeds this anticipated surplus. I wish to point that 
out to the hon. member for Shefford. When one makes proposals, 
one must evaluate them thoroughly and, based on an initial 
assessment, it would cost $21 billion to implement the proposals 
made by the Conservatives. This would largely exceed the moneys 
available for this year and next year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also want to say something else. 
With all due respect to my colleague from Shefford—as I said 
earlier, this does not apply to her as she has been doing a 
wonderful job of fighting child poverty—I cannot help but feel 
a little uneasy with a motion like this one coming from the 
Conservative Party, especially since it was a Conservative 
government that de-indexed the tax tables in 1986 and redefined 
the statistics on child poverty so that, on paper at least, it 
would appear that things were looking up, while in fact they 
were not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am also a little— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B> I am sorry to have to 
interrupt the hon. member, but time has run out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvan Loubier:</B> Could I have the unanimous consent of the 
House to finish my sentence? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B> Is that agreed? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvan Loubier:</B> Madam Speaker, to conclude, while I salute the 
work done by my colleague from Shefford, my uneasiness comes 
from the fact that the measures that plunged the people of 
Canada and Quebec into poverty in the first place were 
Conservative measures. I would simply ask her to take note of 
this fact and perhaps accept on behalf of her party the blame 
for its past actions. 
<P><A NAME="LINK56"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Diane St-Jacques (Shefford, PC):</B> Madam Speaker, I wish to 
thank my colleague, the member for Saint-Hyacinthe—Bagot, for the 
kind remarks he made at the beginning of his speech. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As for what was done back then, I would remind him that we were 
in a major recession at the time and had to take certain 
measures accordingly.  I will say nothing further. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a question for the member for Saint-Hyacinthe—Bagot about 
the UN committee's report, released in December 1998. 
In its recommendations, the committee expressed its concern over 
the fact that, in all the provinces except New Brunswick and 
Newfoundland, the national child tax benefit intended for all 
children of low income families only went to children of low 
income parents holding down jobs, because the federal government 
allows the provinces to deduct the full amount of the child tax 
benefit from the social assistance received by parents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The committee recommended that the child tax benefit program be 
amended so that provinces may no longer use it to reduce social 
assistance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to have the hon. member's opinion on this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvan Loubier:</B> Madam Speaker, as I was saying earlier, I have 
a lot of respect for the hon. member and her work.  My initial 
remarks, good ones, carried through to the end.  I did not 
betray my thought, even though I took a shot at her party and 
past actions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That said, there are a number of ways to reduce poverty.  We 
chose three targets, because the government has acted and can 
act rapidly on these three, which are the primary source of 
increased poverty over the past five years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not deny that a review of the child tax benefit could help 
children but, if we analyze the situation, we can see that the 
government exacerbated the situation in three ways. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First there was a tax increase for middle income families.  Many 
of them were pushed into the low income bracket because of 
government taxes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, accessibility to employment insurance has dropped to 36%. 
It seems to me that the effects on poverty of working to raise 
this 36% average back up to the 80% of a few years ago would be 
direct, effective and unbiased.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Third, we cannot cut $40 billion by the year 2003 from transfer 
payments to the provinces for social programs without that 
having an impact on poverty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have taken this approach because we know that the federal 
government can address these three parameters starting with its 
next budget. I do not, however, deny the UN recommendation, and 
once again I say to my colleague that she is doing a good job, 
and I hope she will keep at it. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK57"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Alex Shepherd (Durham, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, as I 
listened to the dialogue between the two members it occurred to 
me that the member for Saint-Hyacinthe—Bagot did not answer the 
question so I will repeat it for him because obviously he did not 
hear it.  It must be the only reason that he would not reply to 
it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The question was whether provinces should be allowed to claw 
back the increased tax benefit zeroed in on tax credits for child 
tax credit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is very appropriate because that is exactly what Ontario 
has done.  As we know through some of our discussions on the 
social union, this is where we lose the whole concept of our 
policy even though we in our good intentions in this House may 
well say we should increase the tax credit to ensure that money 
gets into the hands of low income families.  It means nothing if 
the province turns around and says that under its social 
assistance system that is additional income entering the 
household and therefore it will reduce the social assistance 
payment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How does the member want to address it?  Will he answer the 
question or not?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvan Loubier:</B> Madam Speaker, such 
statements denote a lack of judgment, because of course the 
provinces have fewer means, after they have been pushed to the 
wall, after funds have been taken from them.  All the surplus 
the government has accumulated has had two sources, the 
provinces and the unemployed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since the provinces have their backs to the wall because of the 
federal government's actions, the hon. member ought to look in 
his own back yard and look at what the government has done and, 
as a responsible MP, get his Minister of Finance to change his 
attitude.  The minister is more concerned with his success in 
connection with the record surpluses than with the plight of 
Canada's poor.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Libby Davies (Vancouver East, NDP):</B>  Madam Speaker, I 
am pleased to have this opportunity to rise in the House to speak 
on the motion brought forward by the member for Shefford. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Any time we have an opportunity to speak on issues about poverty 
and what is happening in the country it is important that we do 
that.  I thank the member for the work she has done and for 
bringing forward this motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I begin by talking about this kind of motion and the kinds of 
debates we have in the House because it speaks to the issue of 
needing to look at the record of what has happened. Unfortunately 
the reality is that for the last two decades poor Canadians have 
heard again and again many promises about reducing unemployment 
and eliminating poverty in Canada. But the reality is that none 
of those promises has been fulfilled, not by the Tory government 
when it was in power and certainly not by the Liberal government 
since 1993. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reality for poor Canadians is that they are sinking deeper 
and deeper into poverty and more and more people are facing 
unemployment, facing part time work, low wages, underemployment, 
shrinking welfare rates and poor bashing.  That is the reality of 
what is going on in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will take the issue of the record and the credibility of what 
it is we do as political parties and talk about what happened 
yesterday on Parliament Hill because certainly the media today 
are full of news stories of how Mr. Clark was jostled in the 
crowd and that he went there with good intentions to speak to 
people but poor Mr. Clark, look what happened to him. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was there yesterday at that rally. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1140"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT20"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I saw what happened and I saw the reaction of people.  First, it 
was not a little nest of two or three people who decided to take 
on Mr. Clark and give him a hard time.  It was 200 or 300 people 
who were outraged that he came unannounced, uninvited to that 
rally basically with a media entourage to take away from the 
rally. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If Mr. Clark had genuinely wanted to find out how people were 
feeling, if he wanted to understand what people were experiencing 
he could have gone to the Bronson Centre the night before, 
Tuesday night, where people had arrived on buses and where people 
were sitting down in the cafeteria eating their supper. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He could have gone in quietly, talked to people and said “I am 
the leader of the Progressive Conservative Party.  I want to find 
out what your concerns are”.  But he chose not to do that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was a media show that arrived with Mr. Clark.  I talked to 
many people in that rally.  The reaction they had to Mr. Clark 
was absolutely genuine because they were angry.  They understood 
what the record was. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>People do not forget.  The rally was not a rent a crowd.  It was 
not people who professionally demonstrated.  These were people 
who are hurting, who are homeless, who are poor.  They came to 
Parliament Hill to meet with the Prime Minister and were turned 
away. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reaction that Mr. Clark got was no surprise to me and no 
surprise to anyone who was there.  If he did not understand that, 
if he did not understand the reaction he got, then he does not 
understand much about this issue.  That is very important for the 
record.  Poor Mr. Clark, he got a rough time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As far as the motion goes, it is basically supportable even though 
we will not be voting on it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The issues we have to address are not just tax credits.  What we 
have to address is a systematic problem of chronic poverty and 
unemployment in this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we have called for in the New Democratic Party is for the 
government to set real targets, achievable targets for 
eliminating poverty and reducing unemployment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is something the Liberals are very proud they have done in 
terms of the deficit.  What we have been saying is we have to do 
this regarding poverty and unemployment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again, if members look at the record it becomes very clear.  I 
heard one Liberal member speak about how the Liberals have 
produced a balanced and moderate approach. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to understand that the so-called balanced and moderate 
approach has been at the expense of more and more people living 
below the poverty line.  It has been at the expense of more and 
more unemployment in this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the Tories are serious, if the Liberals are serious about 
dealing with this issue of poverty, if we truly did have a belief 
in 1989 through the unanimous resolution of the House that we 
would eliminate child poverty, then we need a systematic 
approach.  Unfortunately that is lacking in this motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the issue of tax credits I believe we should have fair 
taxation.  The reality is the richest one-fifth of Canadians 
receive close to half of all the income in Canada while the 
poorest one-fifth of Canadians receive just 3.1%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we look at the child tax benefit, there is an injustice 
because it is not indexed.  I would certainly agree with the 
motion on that basis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This simply does not go far enough.  We need to talk about fair 
taxation.  We need to look at what the Vanier Institute is saying 
in its recent report, that tax cuts benefit mostly wealthy and 
upper income Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we are talking about tax credits, we have to look at the 
taxation system and say why is it that wealthy Canadians are 
paying less in taxes proportionately and poor Canadians are 
paying more. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to address what I heard when listening to the 
debate today as the member from the Reform Party was speaking to 
the question of what a poverty line is.  I was really outraged by 
the comments the Reform member came out with. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He talked about what true poverty is.  He said true poverty is 
basically kids who are starving to death.  He said that actually 
there are not that many children who die of starvation in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One had to infer from this that we probably do not have much of 
a problem relative to, say, the third world. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1145"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT21"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member should take the time to go to almost any 
community in Canada to see the poverty that exists.  There are 
kids who go to school hungry.  They do not do very well at school 
because they do not have enough to eat.  There are hundreds of 
thousands of people who live in substandard housing.  There are 
about 100,000 Canadians who are homeless.  That is poverty.  It 
is poverty in our country.  It has been recognized by the United 
Nations committee that has done research on our compliance with 
the UN covenant on social, economic and cultural rights. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would ask the member from the Reform Party what he is really 
saying when he says that we do not have poverty in this country. 
Is the member saying that he wants to see people dying of 
starvation on the street before the Reform Party will acknowledge 
that we have huge income inequities in this country and serious 
problems with the inequitable distribution of wealth and 
resources? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform Party's answer is simply to cut taxes.  I would ask 
Reform members to look at our neighbours to the south, whom they 
always like to use as an example.  If tax rates are lower in the 
United States, and I believe the Reform Party thinks they are, 
why does it have an even higher poverty rate than Canada? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These issues require very serious examination and a serious 
program if we are to address poverty in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member who introduced this motion has done good work in 
bringing this issue forward.  It is important that we work 
together as much as possible, particularly on bills such as Bill 
S-11 which seeks to have social condition included in the 
Canadian Human Rights Act as a ground against which there cannot 
be discrimination.  We also have to have credibility and 
acknowledge what has been done in the past. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I say to those members, in terms of the policies of their party, 
if they are truly committed to eliminating poverty, then they 
should stand in defence of social housing.  It was actually under 
the Tory government that social housing was gutted in this 
country and the job was finished off by the Liberal government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us get the record straight and let us make a real commitment 
to reduce poverty and unemployment in Canada. 
<P><A NAME="LINK59"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, 
anytime is the right time to talk about poverty in Canada in this 
place.  We should do it more and I wish we could have an allotted 
day or an emergency debate on poverty so that we could hear from 
more members of parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This debate about poverty so far has been about taxes.  People 
who are living in poverty do not pay taxes because they do not 
have an income. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am a little disappointed because, as of yet, I have not heard 
one mention in this debate about the family.  The member will 
know that lone parent families—and I say lone parent, not single 
parent—number about 12% of all families in Canada and account 
for about 46% of all children living in poverty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Child poverty is a politically convenient term for family 
poverty.  We have to understand that point fundamentally and we 
have to deal with it.  If we are to deal with child poverty, 
family poverty, and we know that almost half of it is due to 
family breakdown in Canada, then the member should be prepared to 
deal with the reasons the Canadian family is under attack and the 
reasons the Canadian family is breaking down. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Divorce, domestic violence, alcohol and drug abuse, adultery, 
and all kinds of other reasons for the family breaking down are 
the root causes of the majority of poverty in Canada.  I want to 
know whether the member would agree and if she would encourage 
her colleagues in the House to start talking about the real 
fundamentals of poverty, the breakdown of the Canadian family. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Libby Davies:</B>  Madam Speaker, I thank the member for 
his comments.  I would agree that the issue of child poverty is 
really a political term that has been created.  I have to say, 
though, that it has come mostly from his own party which has 
chosen to characterize poverty as a children's issue.  The 
Liberal Party has campaigned on the child tax benefit.

<A HREF="#LINKT22"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would agree that when we look at poor children we have to look 
at poor families and the fact that most of those families are 
unemployed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Families are under attack, but if we look at what has happened 
over the past few decades, families are under attack because of 
public policies that have undermined the ability of families to 
cope in our society.  We see rising unemployment, shrinking EI 
benefits, the lack of housing, the lack of social programs and 
even welfare rates that have been attacked by many provincial 
governments because of the shrinking health and social transfers. 
Those have all been public policy decisions which have attacked 
the family. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It all depends on how one wants to look at this.  If lone parent 
families live in poverty they will have a lot of difficulties, 
but that does not necessarily mean that family breakdown has to 
do with economic and social conditions or the lack of housing and 
decent paying jobs for women. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Maybe the member and I have different perspectives on how we 
look at this issue, but I would agree that when we talk about 
poverty we should talk about the whole family.  We should also 
talk about single people.  Some Canadians who are feeling the 
worst effects of poverty are single people.  However, we do not 
like to talk about single people because it is unpopular to do 
so. 
<P><A NAME="LINK60"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):</B>  Madam Speaker, my 
intervention is more a comment than a question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I appreciate the member pointing out that what I said may have 
been misinterpreted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I look at the pictures of our kids and the things that I 
have seen secondhand from third world countries, it tears my 
heart out.  That is what I was trying to communicate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Certainly, if we have people who are hungry here, we need to 
look after them.  There is no question about that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Libby Davies:</B>  Madam Speaker, I am glad the member 
from the Reform Party clarified his comments.  We only have to 
look to our own backyards, to our own communities, to his 
community and to my community, to see that those same situations 
exist.  Maybe they are not as stark, maybe we do not see them as 
much on the media, but they are visible, they do exist and it 
means that we have to work here at home. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Stoffer:</B>  Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
This certainly has no reflection on yourself, but I cannot help 
noticing that in debates of this nature, throughout the time that 
I have been in this House, the first person who asks a question 
or makes a comment generally gets four to five minutes and the 
second person gets thirty seconds.  Thus, the second person, or 
possibly the third, does not get an opportunity to reflect upon 
what they may want to say or the reaction to it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am wondering if it is at all possible for that to be a little 
more balanced, where the first person could have a minute or two 
and then the second person could have a minute or two. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B>  The hon. member 
certainly has a good suggestion.  Maybe we could now proceed with 
one minute questions and one minute answers.  Is that agreed? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Agreed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B>  Very well, I have no 
objection to that. 
<P><A NAME="LINK61"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gilles Bernier (Tobique—Mactaquac, PC):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, I am pleased to speak today to the motion proposed by my 
hon. friend from Shefford.  I will be sharing my time with my 
good colleague from Chicoutimi. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps the most visible sign of poverty in Canada's cities is 
the growing number of homeless people.  In the 10 minutes I have 
available to me I would like to discuss the cause of homelessness 
and the lack of adequate housing for many low income families.  I 
will also show how this government has failed Canadians in need 
of housing and suggest some ideas on how we might begin to tackle 
this problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the recently released Toronto task force report on the 
homeless, Dr. Anne Golden noted that there are four principle 
causes of homelessness.  First, there are social factors that 
have contributed to the breakdown of families and other social 
support networks.  Domestic violence, physical and sexual abuse 
and the alienation of individuals from family and friends have 
all added to the problem of homelessness.

<A HREF="#LINKT23"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Poverty as well continues to aggravate this problem.  In recent 
years the incidence and depth of poverty have increased because 
of changes in the structure of the labour market.  For example, 
Canada's unemployment rate continues to be about double that of 
the United States.  As well, reductions in transfers from the 
federal government to individuals have left low income Canadians 
with fewer resources to pay for housing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Third, many people who suffer from mental illness and addiction 
become homeless after being deinstitutionalized because 
communities lack adequate support programs.  Inadequate discharge 
planning of hospitals and jails also results in people being 
released on the street with no support systems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, since this Liberal government was elected in 1993 the 
supply of affordable housing has shrivelled.  The dwindling 
supply of low cost rental units and rooming houses, the 
withdrawal of federal support for new social housing programs and 
the abandonment of social housing by the federal government have 
all made affordable housing much harder to find. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All these factors have combined to send the numbers of Canadians 
who are either homeless or who lack adequate affordable housing 
skyrocketing in the last six years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Ironically, the current finance minister, the man who has had 
the ability to address this problem for the last six years and 
who has done nothing, once promised that he would fix it.  Yes, 
it is hard to believe, but the hon. member for LaSalle—Émard who 
has been Minister of Finance for the last six years once cared 
about homelessness in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1990 he co-chaired, along with the member for London North 
Centre, a Liberal caucus task force on the homeless.  He told us 
that he was concerned about this important social problem.  He 
and his Liberal cronies shuffled all across the country.  They 
met with all the right groups.  They said all the right things. 
They smiled for the cameras.  They tried to look concerned.  Then 
they wrote a flowery report.  The finance minister said “Trust 
me.  I have the answer.  If you elect Liberals we can fix the 
problem”.  We all know what happened.  They got elected and 
promptly and conveniently forgot their promises. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us take a look at exactly what the finance minister promised 
to do for the homeless when he got the power.  He said that 
housing is a fundamental human right.  The Liberals promised to 
discuss housing rights at a first ministers' conference and they 
promised to enshrine in the Constitution, no less, the right to 
adequate shelter.  What happened?  When they got elected they 
said “Thanks for your vote” and they tossed out their promise. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The finance minister also promised to provide more money for 
housing to the provinces through the Canada assistance plan, now 
called the CHST.  Guess what?  They got elected and instead 
slashed provincial transfers by 40%.  So much for the promises of 
the member for LaSalle—Émard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They said we would get a new federal-provincial social program 
to assist the working poor with housing costs.  It never 
happened. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They promised they would hold a national conference, bringing 
together federal, provincial and municipal governments to fix 
the problem.  The Liberals still have not set a date. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The finance minister promised a few other things.  He assured us 
that if Canadians elected a Liberal government he would increase 
funding for housing co-ops and look at new ways of using co-ops. 
He gave us his word that he would make surplus crown lands 
available below market value for low income housing.  He said he 
would encourage private-public partnerships to build affordable 
housing.  Get a load of this:  he promised that he would 
eliminate substandard aboriginal housing by the year 2000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we were keeping score, so far the finance minister has hit 
zero out of eight. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I could talk all morning about the failures of the Liberal 
government, but that would not help solve the problem.  Let us 
talk about some of the things we can do.  This is a solvable 
problem which does not take brain surgeons to fix. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, let us hold the national conference on the homeless which 
the finance minister promised nine years ago.  I realize that 
there are those who will roll their eyes and say that we need 
less talk and more action, but I am not talking about a bunch of 
politicians sitting around, complaining about how awful a problem 
this is and that someone should do something about it.  What I am 
proposing is that all three levels of government come together to 
devise and implement a strategy to address this problem.  We need 
to identify measurable targets with time lines and divide up the 
task between the three governments with respect to their 
jurisdictions.  And then we need to do it.

<A HREF="#LINKT24"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, the federal government needs to stop the downloading of 
social housing to the provinces.  You cannot fix your house if 
you have given all your tools away and we cannot fix the housing 
problems if the Liberals have given up control over social 
housing.  Let us be frank here.  The decision to offload the 
responsibility for social housing to the provinces has been an 
unqualified disaster. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not a conspiracy theorist, but if the housing minister had 
purposefully set out to royally screw up our system for providing 
affordable housing to Canadians he could not have done a better 
job than he already has.  Half the provinces will not sign the 
agreement and those are the provinces with the vast majority of 
social housing units.  The provinces that have signed are the 
smaller provinces which are also cash starved. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us not kid ourselves.  Look at what happened to job 
training.  The Liberals had this bright idea that they would 
transfer job training to the provinces.  We all know what 
happened.  The provinces gladly accepted the job training money 
and then had to use that money for hospitals, schools and social 
services because this same federal government cut those transfer 
payments by 40%.  Now there is no more job training in Canada and 
the exact same thing will happen with social housing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can raise the supply of affordable housing in Canada, but 
that is only half the answer.  We also need to address the income 
problem, and there are two things we can do.  No Canadian who 
earns $10,000 a year or less should have to pay personal income 
tax.  We need to raise the personal income tax exemption to 
$10,000, not the $7,900 the Reform member said we should raise it 
to.  This will immediately put cash into the hands of low income 
Canadians.  We need to create more jobs for those on the margins 
of society.  Let us make it less expensive for employers to hire 
by reducing payroll taxes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I reiterate that this is a solvable problem.  Despite its 
promises the Liberal government has abandoned the homeless and 
allowed this problem to get worse.  Some people may wonder why 
the Tories are interested in helping the homeless.  Why worry 
about the homeless?  None of them ever voted PC.  If we think 
about what it means to be a Conservative,  we will understand why 
this is important.  We believe in family and in our communities. 
We are the party of nation building and we believe in equality of 
opportunity.  Homelessness strikes at all these core beliefs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we can deal effectively with these issues it will solve 
problems in our families.  It will strengthen our communities and 
our country.  It will ensure that Canadians who have been 
forgotten by the government will once again have access to the 
same opportunities as everyone else.  This is why we need to act 
now. 
<P><A NAME="LINK62"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Stoffer (Sackville—Eastern Shore, NDP):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, I listened intently as the Conservatives talked about 
what it is like to be a Conservative.  I remind them that they 
had nine years in government to fix a lot of the problems and to 
set the way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wanted to talk to the member about the summit he proposed. 
What happens in non-aboriginal communities is very severe but not 
as severe as what happens in our aboriginal communities.  Should 
the leaders of our aboriginal communities be invited to 
participate in such an active dialogue? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gilles Bernier:</B>  Madam Speaker, when I talk about 
Canada as a country, natives are Canadians also.  If there would 
be such a conference of all leaders, I believe aboriginal leaders 
should be involved. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I live four kilometres from the second biggest native community 
in New Brunswick.  It is no fun to take a ride on that reserve 
and see how natives are living.  Many have to live and feed their 
families on $68 a week.  It is a disgrace to Canada for them to 
be living in such conditions.

to the some of the comments from members of the NDP. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It find it quite ironic they would point out that we were in 
government when in fact they had a provincial government for many 
years and impacted very negligibly on the situation of the poor 
in the province of Ontario.  Similarly there was a very scathing 
and unwarranted attack on Mr. Clark and his decision to attend 
the rally on Parliament Hill yesterday.  It is ironic 
particularly in light of the fact that he is in Montreal this 
morning at another such event aimed at helping poor and homeless 
people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Similarly I point out that this day of debate that was initiated 
by the Progressive Conservative Party comes on the heels of the 
NDP decision to debate an issue concerning Canada's water, a 
national resource.  I am not diminishing that initiative.  It is 
important, but it was the Progressive Conservative Party that 
brought this debate forward today in a very non-partisan way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To bring this kind of politics into it at this level is very 
destructive.  Let us keep the focus on what this is about.  It is 
an issue of trying to help the poor, trying to do something 
positive about the issues that exist for the homeless.  We will 
not even raise the fact that the Prime Minister chose not to meet 
with them and would rather be snowboarding in Alberta. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gilles Bernier:</B>  Madam Speaker, I respect the points 
of my colleague from Nova Scotia.  They were really just a 
comment. He referred to some of the comments the NDP member made 
earlier. I totally agree with my colleague from Nova Scotia. 
<P><A NAME="LINK64"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Tony Valeri (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Finance, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is somewhat ironic that the 
motion in essence makes reference to the working poor and yet 
every time I hear Conservative colleagues speak they talk about 
the homeless. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am trying to understand how the motion helps address the 
homeless issue.  The Conservatives are talking about the working 
poor and about increasing the basic income tax credit to 
$10,000—it was amended by the Reform Party to something less 
than that—and the cost of indexing the tax bracket. 
Collectively they are talking about $28 billion or $30 billion of 
tax measures over three years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They keep talking about the homeless in their speeches but their 
motion makes reference to the tax system.  How does the motion 
assist those individuals who are not working?  They are talking 
about homeless people.  They are just making political hay. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gilles Bernier:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the Parliamentary 
Secretary to the Minister of Finance talks about what poverty has 
to do with homelessness.  To be poor means people cannot afford 
housing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member does not have to go far because he works for the 
minister responsible for the task force report he produced back 
in 1990.   At that time the finance minister promised to make 
affordable housing accessible to all Canadians.  That was part of 
the task force of 1990. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not know what the parliamentary secretary is talking about. 
Before he refers to me he should refer to the finance minister in 
that regard. 
<P><A NAME="LINK65"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. David Price (Compton—Stanstead, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
most of my colleagues today have talked about poverty in Canada 
for all Canadians.  However I want to speak to the issue of 
poverty in the Canadian forces.  It relates directly to the 
motion: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That, in the opinion of this House, the government should take 
steps to alleviate the burden of poverty in Canada— 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a big part of poverty in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Like other members of the House I have served on the Standing 
Committee of National Defence and Veterans Affairs which spent 
the best part of last year studying the quality of life in the 
Canadian forces.  “Moving Forward: A Strategic Plan for Quality 
of Life Improvements in the Canadian Forces” is a benchmark 
study and one that I hope the Liberal government will implement. 
What members of the committee heard was very sad, actually 
pathetic. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At one point in time there used to exist a kind of social 
contract between the people, their representatives, the 
government and the military.  It existed for hundreds of years 
based upon a contract of unlimited liability. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1210"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT26"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The unlimited liability for those in the military profession 
meant that they would go off and fight and if necessary die when 
governments, the contractor, tells them to.  In return, 
governments have given militaries a quality of life, their own 
special society and veneration when they retire or later die. 
There once was a quality of life, not poverty, but not with this 
government.  To date it has broken its part of the contract. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our soldiers, sailors and air crew go wherever they are told and 
do so outnumbered, ill equipped, if equipped at all, and uncared 
for by our government.  They go without a whimper. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must remember that this is the Liberal government that sends 
its soldiers to the army surplus store for boots and clothing. 
This is the Liberal government that sends its air crews on search 
and rescue missions with the Labrador helicopter or on flight 
training with parachutes that do not open.  This is the Liberal 
government that says to the navy that there are no problems with 
the Sea Kings.  Of course they are serviceable only 40% of the 
time and their mission systems fail at least 50% of the time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is the Liberal government whose Prime Minister travels all 
over the world offering the same Canadian military to whoever 
might want them, whether they have been asked formally, 
informally or not even asked at all, and without care or thought 
for their well-being.  Last but not least, this is the Liberal 
government that sends military families to food banks and soup 
kitchens, poverty at its very worst. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This Liberal government has broken its portion of the contract. 
Shame.  We hear the stories of military families going to food 
banks.  It is heartbreaking to the hardest of hearts.  We hear 
stories of sailors delivering pizzas at night to feed and clothe 
their young families.  It is absolutely unacceptable.  We hear 
stories of PMQs in such bad shape that one is afraid to go 
through the door. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Things just went from bad to worse when the Liberal government 
dispatched our military to far off places.  People went from 
poverty with family support to abject poverty in some cases and 
with loved ones thousands of miles away and until recently with 
no support at all.  Mothers are forced to shoplift for 
necessities.  Then there are the injured from our peacekeeping 
operations that were abandoned.  Lastly our veterans, some with 
benefits, some without like the merchant navy vets. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The anger and frustration the committee met on the road were 
incredible.  I for one am changed by what I saw and heard.  I 
would like to think that all of us were changed by it and for the 
better. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We came forward with a report, a blueprint to help the Liberal 
government deal with the problems of poverty in the Canadian 
forces.  This was the committee's first priority and I hope it is 
the government's when it comes to the men and women in our 
Canadian forces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We as a party want to see the quality of life study implemented 
but not through troop reduction or delays in much needed 
equipment.  We can give a corporal a paycheque so he does not 
have to go to a food bank, but we cannot give his family his life 
back if he is lost in a Sea King helicopter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The problems with poverty and the qualify of life in the 
Canadian forces are easy to solve.  The problems are as clear as 
the solutions.  In large measure the solutions involve something 
that has no monetary value, compassion.  Sometimes it is 
important to say that we care.  The solutions also involve the 
expenditure of money, about $700 million, but surely it must be 
worth it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The committee recommends several improvements in the quality of 
life for military personnel, solutions that will ease poverty in 
a large measure if not eliminate it.  There are some 
recommendations in the quality of life report which I think are 
key in fighting poverty in the Canadian forces and 
re-establishing a quality of life erased by the Liberal defence 
cuts.  I want to paraphrase them quickly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The pay levels for entry level ranks of private, second 
lieutenant and lieutenant must be increased by 10% no later than 
April 1, 1999.  Reservists deserve a pension plan and deserve to 
be paid on time and correctly.  The Department of National 
Defence should establish a global cost of living allowance. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1215"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT27"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The department should ensure that personnel at all bases have 
access to well maintained single quarters.  The housing agency 
should provide adequate and sufficient services, including 
emergency repairs.  The accommodation allowance should not be 
considered taxable income.  The department should ensure that 
base housing remains suitable and affordable.  There should be 
rehabilitation training for injured members of the Canadian 
forces prior to their release and a commitment to supporting 
military family support centres. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All these recommendations and the many more found in the report 
sound so natural, even logical, maybe a better word is expected, 
that people actually shake their heads in disbelief when we tell 
them that is not the case right now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The men and women of the Canadian forces put it on the line for 
us every day, as do their families.  They deserve our support and 
our compassion.  It is time for the Liberal government to put its 
slash and burn policies behind it and do its part in giving the 
Canadian forces they require and deserve. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My party and I are also concerned about the plight of our 
veterans.  We have veterans struggling to survive.  They are 
living just below the poverty line and need assistance.  We have 
all heard the horror stories of how some have been treated or 
their widows.  It is an outrage.  As Canadians I hope we do not 
have to start selling neckties and bow ties like the Gurkha Trust 
to help support our Canadian veterans.  I hope it does not come 
to that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As for our merchant veterans, we all saw those delightful old 
gentlemen sitting the steps of Parliament Hill fighting for what 
they deeply believed in, just as they had crossing the grey, 
unforgiving Atlantic.  I hope they have not been starving 
themselves in vain.  It is plain to every member of the House 
that there are veterans both recent and old living in poverty. It 
is a shame. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberal government has a chance ahead of it to rehabilitate 
itself in the coming budget and give the Canadian forces and our 
veterans the money they need to have quality of life and to 
survive.  This is the time for Liberals to move forward and bring 
in a budget that will allow the Department of National Defence to 
implement the quality of life study and to buy new maritime 
helicopters.   This is the time for the Liberals to put a few 
dollars aside to compensate merchant navy veterans. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion the report called on the Liberal government and 
future governments to make a national commitment, a moral 
commitment to the Canadian forces.  We must recognize military 
life is different and unique from civilian life.  But just 
because they are trained for war does not mean they have to spend 
every day of their service lives and after until death in the 
trenches. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These measures I have talked about will ease poverty in the 
Canadian forces or end it.  The 60,000-strong Canadian forces 
deserve better.  I hope the Liberal frontbenches recognize that 
and redeem themselves in the eyes of the Canadian people at 
budget time.

for bringing up the problem with our veterans and those in our 
military. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member is talking about compensation for the merchant 
marines which I wholeheartily support.  But he would also apply 
that compensation to our Buchenwald vets as well.  I would like 
his comments on what he thinks Canada should do for our

well? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. David Price:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for 
the question.

</I></B></P><P align=left>In my riding of Saint John, New Brunswick, the largest city in 
the province of New Brunswick, we have the largest percentage of 
people living in poverty of any other part of the province.  This 
has never happened before. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we get up in the House and ask the hon. Minister of 
Industry to please bring in a national shipbuilding policy, he 
just stands up and says he is not looking at subsidies.  I am not 
looking at subsidies.  I am looking at addressing poverty, giving 
people back all their dignity and that can only happen if we have 
a lot of co-operation from across the floor. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask my hon. colleague what does he see.  What should we be 
doing to correct the problem we are having with our armed forces? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. David Price:</B>  Mr. Speaker, we have gone through this 
quality of life study.  It is probably one of the best things 
this government has done in a long time and the interesting thing 
about it is that the Liberal backbenchers who were sitting on 
that committee agreed with it totally.  We were able to put in 
different amendments.  They even agreed with the amendments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have a solid document in front of us, something that will 
help out our armed forces.  So I think we should follow through 
with the quality of life report. 
<P><A NAME="LINK68"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Karen Redman (Kitchener Centre, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I am pleased to address the opposition motion concerning poverty 
and the tax burden.  I will be splitting my time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They are matters of real concern for Canadians and they deserve 
the full attention of the House.  However, I am worried about the 
underlying assumption of the hon. member's motion, that the 
government is in a position to take extreme action, to take 
action to dramatically bring down our national tax burden. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no politician, certainly not on this side of the House, 
who does not want to bring tax reform to Canadians, especially to 
help reduce poverty.  But, and there is a very big but, appealing 
politics often does not make good public policy.  The national 
pocketbook can simply not pay for the wish lists many of us have. 
If we cannot afford it, we cannot do it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Too many governments in the past have had good intentions that 
have outweighed fiscal reality. As a result of two decades of 
deficits we had a national debt that was the second worst, the 
second highest among G-7 major industrial nations.  It affected 
our growth.  We lagged in growth and there were too many 
Canadians, despite the spending, who remained in need.  That is 
not to deny that easing Canada's tax burden must be a priority. 
It is a priority for the government.  Tax cuts should be focused 
first on those in the greatest need.  That is just what we did in 
the last budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians made it very clear in the last two federal elections 
that it is a fundamental priority for them that the government 
continue to give good financial management, both of the nation's 
resources and of government itself. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I speak to my constituents in Kitchener Centre as well to 
Canadians from coast to coast, which I have had the opportunity 
to do being a member of the finance committee, I have not heard 
any voices saying that cutting taxes is more important than 
maintaining the gains we have made. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians remember too well the price we paid for relying on 
deficit spending, resulting higher interest rates, lower economic 
growth and the jobs that have been lost.  A key priority for the 
government is to avoid returning to the vicious cycle that was 
dominated by federal policy in the two previous decades. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Priorities are neither simple nor self-evident when it comes to 
the budget of a government.  This debate attempts to focus on a 
single issue, an issue dealt with in isolation, and even one as 
compelling as poverty can make this conversation simplistic and 
self-serving.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me again emphasize that we are committed absolutely and 
aggressively to tax relief, especially for low income Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will not do so through knee-jerk decisions that ignore fiscal 
reality, the world environment and the appropriate role for 
government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The finance minister addressed this in his October economic 
update before the House finance committee.  Our work as a 
government reflects that the pursuit of frugality had to become a 
defining feature of everything we do.  This is a principle that 
must govern all policy making and debates such as ours here 
today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Given the volatile condition in many parts of the world economy, 
we are in a situation that calls for great care and extreme 
caution.  We must be realistic about the resources at our 
disposal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some seem to believe we have mountains of money to spend, that 
we should step back and take action immediately.  I suggest we 
need to continue with a more balanced look, a look that takes 
global trends into consideration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a government we need to continue to make hard choices.  I 
suggest we will continue to do that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister pointed out what has happened in the average 
forecast of economic growth by private sector experts over the 
past year. In January 1998 they were estimating a nominal income 
growth of 4.7% for that fiscal year.  By the fall, it was revised 
downward to 3%.  For 1999, a 4.9% nominal income growth was 
projected.  By the fall, that too was down significantly, reduced 
to 3.5%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What do these revisions mean in the size of the possible fiscal 
surpluses projected by the private sector?  The answer is it 
would take out over $5 billion of government revenues in the 
coming fiscal year, 1999-2000.  This is what next 
week's budget will address. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In our last budget many criticized us for being too prudent, too 
cautious in their estimation.  We are hearing that same criticism 
in today's debate.  We have been attacked for not moving quickly 
to slash taxes but the dramatic downward revision of private 
sector forecasts illustrates that as a government we must stick 
to a careful approach to budget planning. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We simply cannot afford the risks associated with the changing 
of planning assumptions so drastically month by month.  This is 
not an academic argument or some arcane point from economic 
theory. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Consider the result if we followed the advice of some not long 
ago to take $9 billion to $10 billion of tax burden action, 
action they claimed we could afford. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If they were wrong, the result would push us back into deficit 
virtually overnight.  It is easy to be wrong.  Projecting 
government revenues and spending pressures, very large numbers, 
is dealt with in a matter of a mere 12 months. The fact is 
government revenues and spending, including interest payments on 
the debt, are both in the range of $150 billion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If forecasts are off by merely 1%, an amount statistically not 
particularly significant, in each of these sectors, if the 
revenue is out 1%, it is lower and costs are up 1%, the answer is 
that they are out by $3 billion.  That is $3 billion we do not 
have. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we committed the $6 billion to $7 billion in tax cuts with 
little more than 1% shortfall in revenues and 1% again in costs, 
we would be back into the world of deficit financing.  To get out 
we would simply have to raise taxes.  Then they would be higher 
and we would be back into that downward spiral. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is these risks based not on ideology but mathematics that the 
finance minister must consider when planning his new budget. That 
is why I share his concern that the fiscal dividend over the next 
two years must be estimated to be modest, much less than would be 
required to provide sufficient funding for the types of 
initiatives on tax reduction that today's motion calls for. 
Clearly careful consideration and choice in allocating that 
dividend will be required. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again in the words of the finance minister, the very reason that 
we have met our targets, the very reason we are now able to say 
that despite the global economic crisis we are still on track not 
only to balance the books but to have a dividend, all this is 
anchored in the caution we have applied from the very beginning.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Some have said we should implement major personal income tax 
cuts, for example, an average of $600 annually per taxpayer. That 
comes with a price tag of about $9 billion per year.  Others are 
demanding that employment insurance premiums be reduced to a 
so-called break even level.  That comes with a cost of $6 billion 
per year.  Still others are saying we should mount a larger 
attack on the debt.  That would cost in the neighbourhood of $3 
billion a year.  If we add that up, our total bill would be $18 
billion each and every year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is not a complete inventory; this is merely a highlight of 
some of the requests that have been made of the government. 
Adopting all of these principles very clearly would put the 
country back in a situation of serious chronic deficits. Adopting 
any one of these proposals could put us in financial difficulty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me again emphasize, I do not intend to understate the 
significance that Canadians and our government put on easing 
taxes and reducing poverty.  It is only by looking at the sum of 
our priorities that we will be able to give long term security to 
all Canadians.  That is why it would be irresponsible of us to 
accept, as this motion does, the easy assumption that government 
has all kinds of money at its disposal. 
<P><A NAME="LINK69"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George—Peace River, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I cannot understand how the hon. member across the way 
can stand in her place and talk about this government, her 
government, governing by frugality.  If it were not so serious, 
it would be laughable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Her government took power back in 1993.  The present Liberal 
administration has had close to one and a half mandates and it 
has yet to hit its budgeted target for spending.  And she has the 
audacity to stand in her place and talk about governing with 
frugality. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The facts are that last year in the budget the finance minister 
estimated the spending to be about $104.5 billion.  He is over 
that by an estimated $3 billion already.  And he is talking about 
another $2.5 billion for health care that he is going to 
retroactively put back into last year's budget which will put him 
somewhere around $6 billion or $7 billion over budget. How is 
that governing with frugality? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Karen Redman:</B>  Mr. Speaker, as we travelled across 
Canada one of the things we heard from economists, everyday 
Canadians and business people was that they embraced the kind of 
prudent forecast the finance minister had made. In fact revenues 
have consistently come in over budget.  It is that kind of 
forecasting that has led us to a balanced budget and being able 
to pay down the deficit. 
<P><A NAME="LINK70"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Stoffer (Sackville—Eastern Shore, NDP):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, earlier in the debate one of the member's colleagues 
mentioned the child tax credit that was given to the provinces 
and how the provinces were clawing some of that back. He is 
right.  The provinces are clawing some of that back but the 
reason is that the federal government allowed them to do it in 
their negotiations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why did the federal government allow the provinces the ability 
to claw back the child tax credit? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Karen Redman:</B>  Mr. Speaker, provinces are allowed the 
autonomy to do that in order that those moneys can then be 
redirected to that target group of people. I would also add that 
is one of the reasons last week was so exciting for all members 
of this House.  With the signing of the social union we see a 
demand for transparency. Any money flowing from the federal 
government to the provinces will then go directly to the people 
it is targeted at. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think we will see this government continue to refine 
federalism in a way that is meaningful to all Canadians in

There is no question that 1.5 million people have been put back

</I></B></P><P align=left>When we talk about self-reliance, what the member is suggesting 
and I would like her to comment on is the fact that the 
government has a clear plan.  We cannot do everything. We are 
criticized by the opposition when we do not spend money, and when 
we do spend money they criticize.  When we give tax cuts they say 
it is not enough.  Clearly it is a lot easier to talk than it is 
to act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This government is acting.  This government has a clear plan of 
what it is doing.  It is taking a step by step approach.  Not 
everything is done in one year.  Governments are elected for a 
maximum of five years.  I would like the hon. member to comment 
on that type of approach. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Karen Redman:</B>  Mr. Speaker, consistently as we 
crossed Canada last year and this year, we heard a call for a 
strategic plan for targeted investment by this government and for 
programs that can be sustained as opposed to throwing money at 
quick fixes to problems.  This is exactly the kind of thing my 
colleague points out.  This government is here for the long haul, 
for strategic investment and to continue a balanced approach for 
governing Canada. 
<P><A NAME="LINK72"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Alex Shepherd (Durham, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am 
certainly happy to participate in this very important debate on 
the issue not only of child poverty but of our income tax system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Once again I think the member for Shefford has brought to the 
floor of the House her concerns and indeed the concerns of many 
people in this country to deal with the issue of child poverty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First I would like to talk about the issue of bracket creep, and 
issue which has been thrown around the House.  I do not think a 
lot of people fully understand what bracket creep means. Back in 
1984 when inflation was something like 10% the then government in 
its wisdom decided that it would only index the taxation system 
to the extent that it exceeded three percentage points. At the 
time that meant a 7% address to the inflationary factor. In those 
days it did not seem like a big problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of course it is the stated policy today of the Bank of Canada to 
keep our inflation rate within a very specific band of between 1% 
and 2%.  Consequently the entire inflation that is occurring 
within the Canadian economy is not being recognized in the income 
tax system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is an insidious growth because of course we think of 3% as 
not being a lot of money in any one particular year, but 
obviously over a 10-year period it is a very significant amount. 
As years have gone by and the issue of bracket creep has 
constantly impacted on the system this disparity has become 
greater and greater. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I looked at some of these numbers and the total cost of doing 
away with the problem in income brackets that it affected. I was 
struck with how the peaks of this tax had gone from little bumps 
on the graph to significantly huge amounts, and it continues to 
do so. These brackets and tax escalation occur around the income 
tax brackets themselves in a change of income of $30,000 and at 
$65,000.  The total money that our taxation authority gleans from 
the process is about $840 million.  So that is an answer to the 
Conservatives who refuse to answer the question on how much would 
it cost to solve this problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The real issue is, is that money an entitlement of our tax 
collection system?  Quite frankly it is not.  It is taxation on 
increases in income that never in fact occurred.  People's income 
rose, if they were so fortunate to have it do so in keeping up 
with inflation and many people were not, but their tax brackets 
did not.  At the same time so did the consumer price index. They 
have had a constant squeeze on their disposable income and we 
keep taxing them. There are some tremendous examples of where 
people whose income rose $900 in a year actually saw their tax 
burden increase $1,400.  That is an overview of the problem.

<A HREF="#LINKT32"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Quite frankly, I do not think if anybody is honest about it they 
will think that is not a systemic problem within the taxation 
system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The next question is how do we solve it?  Those of us who are 
bold enough and do not have any responsibility for the system 
itself will say fix it and will pay the $850 million or almost $1 
billion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reality of government finances is that we cannot fix it all 
at once.  I am very hopeful that we will fix it slowly over a 
period of time.  It has taken since 1984 for it to get embedded 
in our system.  It may take two or three years to get it back out 
of our system.  I think the government's intentions are well 
founded to try and do that. The members on this side have been 
veracious in trying to move some of those amendments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The issue of child poverty is something that bothers all of us. 
I have heard people in this House asking what the definition is 
and how do we define it.  It gets very difficult. Various people 
mentioned the United Nations declaration of income levels and 
said it is very hard to hold the government's feet to the fire 
because there is no real definition, and we talk about low income 
cutoffs. That is the problem we in government see reported across 
Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reality is that $20,000 can buy more goods in one part of 
the country than somewhere else.  A $20,000 income to somebody 
living in downtown Toronto no question is poverty.  I have had 
farm clients over the years who made $20,000 and have lived quite 
well, but of course they are eating their own produce and so 
forth.  When we talk about using low income levels to define 
poverty there are discrepancies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is another thing that has always bothered me about this 
issue.  When people talk about child poverty, I think what they 
are really talking about is child neglect or child nutritional 
problems.  There must be another way to measure the nutrition of 
our youth. That is really the problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have talked to nurses and teachers in my riding.  I have 
discovered that it is not necessarily low income people, although 
there would be a high quotient related to income levels, but 
there are also people in the so-called middle income bracket 
whose kids are not getting the proper nutrition.  It is a bigger 
problem than just setting out low income levels. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to get us off this stereotype debate with the New 
Democratic Party saying to just redistribute all the income and 
the problem will go away. The issue has changed tremendously over 
the years between this business about rich and poor, between a 
knowledge based society and a lack of knowledge society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When people phone me and say they cannot get a job, that they 
are living in poverty and so forth, invariably the first question 
is what is their educational background, how much investment have 
they personally put into their human capital.  If they are in 
what we think is the high risk area, because we are responsible 
for the employment insurance system, ages 17 to 24, invariably 
they have very little education. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What obligations do governments have to solve this so-called 
disparity between rich and poor?  We have to encourage people 
even at a very young age.  Of course, they have to be properly 
fed for their brains to absorb knowledge, but we have to instil 
at a very young age and a consistent age a greater celebration of 
the importance of getting a better education. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not have to tell the members here that this is a provincial 
jurisdiction. This is the problem in this issue. When it comes to 
our problem, adults are standing outside our doors complaining to 
us that the provincial education system may well have failed them 
in the past. How do we as legislators do a quick fix of that? 
There is no real quick fix.  The scholarship millennium fund was 
hotly debated in this House.

<A HREF="#LINKT33"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reality is that is one way in which the federal government 
can be proactive in looking at people who for some reason whether 
economic or otherwise cannot get a better education.  The 
government can step in and say we realize we have a basic 
obligation to you to get you a good education and to ensure that 
you and your children will be able to plug yourselves into the 
basic economy and earn a living from it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We cannot keep thinking about this debate as just a matter of 
money.  It is a matter of human capital.  As legislators we 
should spend a little more time trying to find programs to 
increase the nutrition of our young people and to ensure they 
have the skills to make sure this is a problem that will 
eventually go away. 
<P><A NAME="LINK73"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Stoffer (Sackville—Eastern Shore, NDP):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, I agree that we should be talking about finances and 
issues of taxation, exactly what the hon. member spoke about for 
the first eight minutes of his speech.  He talked about the NDP 
wanting to redistribute the wealth.  I remind him that we have 
not said that.  We have said that it is better to redistribute 
allocation of resources. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>An example is our fishing communities on the east and west 
coasts. DFO's practices and policies have allocated that common 
property resource to fewer and fewer hands, which is the 
corporate sector. That sector gets richer and richer while 
thousands of people lose their livelihoods to partake in the 
economy he talked about. Would the member not agree that a better 
allocation of resources, which would enable people to work in 
their coastal communities, would be a better way to end child 
poverty in those communities? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Alex Shepherd:</B>  Madam Speaker, according to my reading 
of the coastal fisheries issue no matter what coast you are on in 
Canada there are no more fish.  We can talk about it being a 
terrible thing that the fishery is in decline but the bottom line 
is there are no more fish. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We really need aggressive policies to ensure there are different 
resources available so we can restructure and diversify these 
economies. That is happening but it may be happening a little 
slower than it should be.  The Nova Scotia Technical College is a 
great resource for the people of Nova Scotia to glean that 
knowledge. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The regional disparity in Canada in this age of the information 
highway is ridiculous.  It does not really matter where you live 
in this country, everybody should have equal access to those 
skills that will sustain them over a good number of years. 
<P><A NAME="LINK74"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Eric Lowther (Calgary Centre, Ref.):</B>  Madam Speaker, 
I appreciated the comments of the hon. member for Durham.  I know 
that in his professional life he worked a lot in financial 
situations and accounting and that he is well respected in that 
field. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I particularly appreciated his comments on the impacts of 
bracket creep.  I was reminded as he was speaking about a recent 
report from the C.D. Howe Institute that talks about how Canada's 
personal income tax system has not been adjusted properly for 
inflation since 1985.  As a result more taxpayer income has 
become effectively subject to tax.  For Canadian families this 
means higher taxes on the average of about $1,000 per family due 
to bracket creep.  I certainly concur with his comments.  Now 
that we are moving into the days of surplus, is it the member's 
priority that we address this with the surplus money? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We may be saying there are no tax increases but in effect with 
bracket creep real tax increases are taking place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Alex Shepherd:</B>  Madam Speaker, it is an issue the 
government has recognized as a problem.  We are moving in a 
direction to eradicate it.  I do not think it will disappear 
overnight.  It will take time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have another observation which is often given by the real 
opponents to fixing the system, to index the taxation system may 
well lead to inflation, in other words what creates inflationary 
pressures. 
I remember the days when everybody's labour contracts were 
specifically tied to the consumer price index.  When the consumer 
price index went up 7% their wages went up 7%.  Wages went up 7% 
and the products they bought in the store went up 7%.  We got 
into an inflationary spiral.  There is an argument within the 
taxation system that said we are trying to control things at zero 
or break even inflationary rate, so why should we index the 
taxation system which may well lead to a cascading effect? I am 
not a strong believer in that argument but it is an argument that 
we have to take into account.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Eric Lowther (Calgary Centre, Ref.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I 
will be sharing my time with the hon. member for Souris—Moose 
Mountain. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We appreciate the good intentions of the motion to address the 
indexing of the child tax benefit and the increase of the 
threshold on when people begin to pay taxes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Part of my concern is that a motion like this couched in the 
terms of addressing poverty is perhaps not comprehensive enough. 
To take a small part of the issue, a piecemeal approach, probably 
does not serve all Canadians well.  That is part of the reason 
why Reform has done such a diligent job in our budget alternative 
package we presented to the House, to various members and to 
people across the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is prudent for us to pause for a moment to reflect back as we 
are in the throes of this debate on poverty and ask what we can 
do in the tax system to address it.  In Canada over the last 15 
or 20 years we have incurred a $600 billion debt, the highest 
debt ever, massive tax increases combined with that.  There has 
been lots of money drawn from the taxpayer and also borrowed and 
yet we are in a country where we talk about one in every five 
children is supposedly in some state of poverty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we think about that it does not seem like getting more 
money both through borrowing and through taxation into the hands 
of government has really done much to address poverty if it is 
true that one in five is in a state of poverty as some would 
claim.  We had a debate on poverty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is time to review quickly some of our own points that are 
more comprehensive.  I do not have time today to go through our 
complete budget submission but there are some things I want to 
highlight to show it is more than just the components that are in 
this motion before us today that would address some of the 
challenges of the less fortunate in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Certainly our budget submission calls for very substantial tax 
reduction with the surpluses that are available. As well we call 
for a very substantial reduction of the debt which is really 
borrowing on the future of our youngest Canadians.  The core 
programs that are so important to Canadians must be strengthened. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the speakers today quoted from the recent Vanier 
Institute study.  The study states that in 1996 family incomes 
were only $600 above their 1980 level, 16 years.  Family incomes 
on an after tax basis declined by over 5% in real terms from 1989 
to 1996. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Taxing is impacting families.  We are talking about poverty 
today and it is within that context I would like to talk on the 
impacts of taxation on the financial future of Canadian families. 
I want to quote from another study in 1998 by the National 
Foundation of Family Research and Education talking about bracket 
creep which we just heard some comments on. It says bracket creep 
and the clawing back of tax credits from families with incomes as 
low as $20,000 per year means that families earning between 
$20,000 and $40,000 per year are now paying the highest marginal 
tax rates in the country.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we are creating with this heavy level of taxation is a type 
of a working poor scenario.  That is of real concern to me as it 
is to many Canadians and I know many members House share that 
concern. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is interesting also from the Vanier report that in 1980 
financial stress on families was relatively low.  In the 1990s 
this most current report states that most measures under 
financial stress are reaching record highs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Families in Canada are under financial stress and I think it is 
incumbent on members of the House to find ways to relieve that 
stress and tax reduction is certainly one of the most obvious and 
straightforward ones that I know we could find a lot of agreement 
on in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to talk a bit about some of the specific proposals in 
Reform's budget alternative better way budget.  One of them has 
to do with reducing or at least considering and investigating the 
impacts of the current tax legislation on marriage.  One 
submission states that single income families may pay 
considerably higher amounts of federal tax than two income 
families with the same level of family income. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Take a family earning $30,000 annually. While a dual income 
family splits the income 50:50, the single income family will 
generally pay about $4,317 a year in federal and provincial 
income taxes, whereas the dual income family pays a combined 
$3,492 a year.  So it is 24% more in tax for a single income 
family.  These are the kinds of inequities that I think should be 
investigated to bring some greater fairness and equity into the 
way families are treated and taxation is applied. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a specific step we could take in this direction, we are 
suggesting that one of the easiest and most straightforward 
things to do is to increase the married credit by setting it 
equal to the basic personal credit at $1,098 from its current 
maximum of $915.  The proposal provides for a tax reduction when 
coupled with the increase to the basic personal credit that we 
advocate of $675 for single income families across Canada.  This 
is an important proposal for a couple of reasons.  It is 
important because why should the spouse who is in the home and 
maybe not employed in the private sector have some type of 
exemption that is less than the basic exemption? We are 
advocating that it should at least be equal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another important point we call for to address some of the 
taxation impacts on family is that the current system allows for 
deductions of $7,000 for children under seven and $4,000 for 
children aged seven to sixteen.  That is the current situation. 
We propose to replace this system with one where all families 
with children become eligible to receive a refundable child care 
expense credit of 17% of $7,000 or effectively $1,190 for all 
children up to seven years of age.  Further, a credit of 17% on 
$4,000, or $680 in hard cash return, will be made available for 
parents of children seven to twelve years of age.  The credit 
would be available to all families with children whether they are 
earning income or not and provide benefits for each child under 
the age of seven and for children seven to twelve. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are costs I could provide on that.  We have quantified 
that. 
We have examined the impact of that recommendation to make sure 
that it is consistent with our overall budget proposal.

<A HREF="#LINKT36"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another area I would like to address is directly related to the 
impacts of capital gains taxes in Canada.  Let me quickly touch 
on a reduction of capital gains and how that could help us 
strengthen opportunities for the less fortunate.  The increase in 
economic activity which would result in a reduction of capital 
gains taxes would lead to greater employment and thus higher 
income tax revenues.  In other words, the economic benefits of a 
reduction in the capital gains rate far outweigh the short run 
costs of them.  There are a number of studies I could quote if I 
had the time to do so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To sum up, the thrust of the motion today is to alleviate the 
burden of poverty and calls for two specifics on tax policy.  We 
must meet the needs of those who are not able to help themselves 
and are facing harder times.  However higher taxation and 
increasing debt are not working. 
<P><A NAME="LINK76"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Roy Bailey (Souris—Moose Mountain, Ref.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, I am pleased to join in the debate.  I congratulate the 
Conservative Party for putting the motion forward.  It is a very 
timely motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will not deal with the taxation part of the motion so much as 
I will deal with some terms used in the motion such as burden of 
poverty.  I doubt if any member of the House has more firsthand 
knowledge of poverty than I have.  It did not really affect me 
too much, but I was born in a period of time in southern 
Saskatchewan known as the dirty thirties.  That period of time 
had a great commonality: everybody was poor.  In our house we 
were so poor we did not even have mice.  That may be a joke, I 
say it in fun, but I know what poverty is all about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I travel across the country it bothers me to come face to 
face with poverty, particularly young children suffering from 
poverty.  That to me is the most horrendous sight.  It is bad 
enough to see it on television in third world countries, but when 
it is face to face it shakes me up because I have been there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not know if I was ever hungry.  I do not know if I ever had 
too much cake or pie.  I do know that my mother could make 
beautiful loaves of bread, fry some sour dough and we could 
afford a bit of syrup. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today the burden of poverty should not exist.  I encourage the 
House to listen to the words in the Progressive Conservatives 
supply day motion where it says “encouraging self-sufficiency”. 
That begins in the home. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Because of my background we grow a huge garden every year.  My 
wife and I have taught our children to do the same.  What is the 
reason for it?  I grow a huge garden to give it away.  Before I 
was elected I set a goal to grow a tonne of vegetables.  With the 
modern black squash which they call zucchini, I did not have to 
wait very long to get 300 or 400 pounds of those. 
We would give them away.  I would pick out families I knew in a 
huge area to come and get vegetables mainly because they had 
children.  There are ways in which to encourage self-sufficiency 
not only from an individual level but from the level of the 
provincial government and the level of the federal government.

</I></B></P><P align=left>It bothers me that we declare to society what the poverty line 
is and we have a mother and a father with two children living 
below the poverty line and Revenue Canada is still extracting 
taxes.  Let us think about that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the words of the motion, self-efficiency is destroyed. People 
ask themselves what is the use.  Dad is out working. Mother is 
out working.  Grandma may be looking after the children.  They 
have to pay income tax when they are many thousand of dollars 
below the declared poverty line. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What about self-reliance, in the words of the motion? 
Self-reliance brings to the individual a sense of pride in what 
can be accomplished.  It broke my heart less than three weeks ago 
to have somebody come into my office to say:  “Thank you for 
getting me a job but I am only $5 a week better off with a job 
than I was before”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How by government's means do we create and encourage a sense of 
self-sufficiency and self-reliance when we fall prey to heavy 
taxation?  I want to give a couple of examples. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While I was in Estevan, Saskatchewan, which is part of my 
constituency, a young fellow came to my office and told me about 
his dilemma.  His EI had been cut off.  He was employed by a 
construction firm that often lays its people off but he was on 
call.  They had to get the machinery ready to remove the snow 
from that small city.  He got in three days of work and bingo. He 
would have been better off if he had not got that work.  We do 
strange things to destroy pride in the individual.  He did not 
have very much money.  I went down to his boss and got his boss 
to get him a loan to spare him until he got back on EI. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us take a look at some very serious problems.  Let us start 
teaching people.  Let us start seeing an attitudinal change and 
looking at the things we can accomplish.  I picked up the list of 
boo-boos that governments make in spending. I think of how that 
money could be used through proper channels.  We could certainly 
alleviate a whole lot of poverty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What would happen if this became an issue not only at the 
federal level but at the provincial and municipal levels?  We 
should somehow get the politics out of it, from what I am hearing 
today back and forth.  Do we think that five and six years old 
who do not have enough to eat at home know what a Liberal, a PC, 
an NDP or anyone else is?  Do we think they care?  We care when 
it comes to wanting to provide all the help and dignity we can to 
elevate the self-sufficiency, pride and self-reliance of these 
people.  Too often we go about it the wrong way.

government that all it needs to do to cure a problem is to dump 
more money into it.  I could spend from now until midnight 
talking about programs the government has dumped money into which 
have not solved the problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A World War I veteran lived eight miles up the road from me. 
During the thirties when I was a boy he decided to raise sheep. 
It was not too profitable, but he shipped three carloads of sheep 
to the Burns slaughterhouse in Winnipeg.  Mr. Kimmerly got a 
letter back reminding him that the sale of the sheep did not 
cover the cost of freight and asking him to kindly remit $3.78. 
He wrote a letter back saying very nicely that he did not have 
any money but he could send some more sheep. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Money is not always the answer.  We should look at the question 
of poverty in the light of becoming involved not from the 
political viewpoint but from the human viewpoint.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gilles Bernier (Tobique—Mactaquac, PC):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, I respect my colleague from the Reform Party and thank 
him for his nice comments.  I had hoped to hear some of the same 
comments from his other colleagues this morning. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are talking about poverty.  I am a person who knows about 
poverty.  I understand my colleague was born and raised in the 
thirties during the great depression.  I was born and raised in 
later years.  I was born in 1955.  Today we have been talking 
about how we differ, how to establish where poverty starts and 
ends.  When I was first married I had to go on welfare.  I know 
what it is like to be on welfare and to be on EI.  I also know 
how it feels to have small kids and not have enough money to buy 
a loaf of bread or a quart of milk.  I went through that.  That 
is poverty.  One Reform member mentioned those starving to death 
in Sudan. I would give my shirt to somebody who needed it because 
I was one of them before. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last summer we in the House of Commons gave ourselves a salary 
increase.  I took my salary increase and gave it to charity.  Is 
the hon. member willing to do the same? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Roy Bailey:</B>  Madam Speaker, I do not want to use this 
opportunity to talk about charity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am assuming the hon. member has heard of the term tithing or 
one-tenth.  Since my children are raised and finished university 
I have more than exceeded that every year.  I am very proud to do 
so.  In order for me to do that, I doubt if anyone in the House 
lives in an older house than the one in which I live. 
<P><A NAME="LINK78"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Myron Thompson (Wild Rose, Ref.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I 
have a quick comment and question to remind people in television 
land just how ridiculous some things are. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have gone across the country and seen the poverty that exists 
in the cities and on the streets.  I know what we are talking 
about.  First it was a million children in 1993 and now we are up 
to a million and a half.  This leads me to understand that we are 
not doing a very good job. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know what living in squalor is like on reserves.  I have 
personally been in their homes and have talked with native people 
who are suffering.  They provided great hospitality with what 
little they had.  I have reviewed the public accounts that come 
out every year.  We also have a member who puts out a waste 
report. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member is probably a couple of years older than I am 
but not much more.  Three years ago the government—and it is 
just one small example of millions of dollars—put together a 
committee which according to public accounts cost $116,000 to 
study seniors and sexually.  I wonder if the old fellow, like 
this old fellow, feels a whole lot better that this wonderful 
Liberal government is spending big money to study us old guys and 
our sexuality.  How does he feel about that?

particular study.  I might say, as well, that I am glad I was not 
a candidate for the study.  But I do appreciate the member's 
point. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have noticed a difference.  We have these soup kitchens in our 
community.  I phoned a soup kitchen last summer because I had 
almost 300 pounds of potatoes to give away.  The response I 
received was:  “Could you bring them up when they are cleaned?” 
Can they not even clean the potatoes they are given? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This goes back to my original point of self-sufficiency and 
having some pride. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I turned the TV on that night and saw:  “Wanted:  people to 
help serve”.  Why not serve the people and have those people who 
have eaten serve the others?  The process should be about 
self-sufficiency and self-reliance.  I really believe that could 
do a lot. 
<P><A NAME="LINK79"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, 
the issue before the House today is probably one of the most 
important challenges facing our country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Poverty is a complex problem and for every complex problem there 
is a simple solution, but this one is wrong.  Today we have had 
a suggestion that we can deal with poverty by giving tax breaks 
to the poor.  Not only do the poor not pay tax, the poor do not 
have income.  In fact the poor are those in our society who are 
unable to help themselves.  They are the ones who are on welfare 
and social assistance.  They are the ones who need Canadians to 
re-establish their value system so we ensure that all Canadians 
can live in dignity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A parliamentarian once said in this place that when dignity is 
lost, everything is lost.  We should never forget that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Child poverty is a convenient political synonym for family 
poverty.  We should talk about family poverty in Canada.  Nobody 
but nobody could ever argue against dealing with child poverty. 
It tugs at the heartstrings.  However, by dealing with the issue 
of child poverty we ignore the reality that family poverty is the 
real issue and that the root causes of poverty rest with the 
conditions of the Canadian family. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada does not have an established poverty line.  Statistics 
Canada has announced on many occasions that we do not have a 
defined poverty line.  We do have, however, the low income 
cut-off, which is a measure of income levels which provide a 
certain amount for the basic necessities of life plus an 
additional amount for all other good things necessary for general 
Canadian life in terms of the lifestyle that Canadians would seek 
to enjoy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those kinds of calculations tend to generate high numbers.  In 
1989 when the Canadian Council on Social Development announced 
its numbers of so-called children living in poverty, it said the 
number was one million children, one out of six children in 
Canada.  Ten years later the same agency reported that 1.5 
million children are living in poverty, which is one out of five 
children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The calculation used to determine poverty in 1989 had to do with 
the ability to provide food, clothing and shelter.  Today the 
definition includes much more than that.  What we have done is 
allowed the definition to float in a way which tends to increase 
the numbers to levels which nobody but nobody believes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe that Canadians have actually become desensitized to 
what poverty really is in Canada.  It has become so inflated that 
we have lost our focus on what real poverty is.  StatsCanada and 
the LICO are talking about relative poverty, not real poverty. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1320"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT40"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is about time that we understood what the level of real 
poverty in Canada is so that we can focus our attention and make 
sure that our limited resources are focused on those who are 
really living in poverty, and there are many people in Canada who 
are living in real poverty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1989 the House unanimously passed a resolution to seek to 
achieve the objective of eliminating child poverty in Canada. 
“Seek to achieve” basically means to do something, to try.  It 
does not mean to eliminate child poverty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members will be interested to know that that particular event 
was not as momentous as they would think.  The motion of that day 
was made by Ed Broadbent on the very last day that he served as a 
member of parliament in the House of Commons.  It was a Friday. 
There were four hours of debate only and most of that debate 
concentrated on tributes to Ed Broadbent.  There was very little 
actually said about the real issue of poverty, except about 
references to the third world and children starving to death. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The discussion and the debate then, if members would check 
<I>Hansard</I>, was clearly not the discussion of poverty that we 
think it was.  In fact, with 10 minutes to go in the debate 
before the House adjourned, the then secretary of state for 
youth, Jean Charest, entered the House huffing and puffing and 
said “Mr. Speaker, considering the exceptional circumstances 
today”, referring to Mr. Broadbent's resignation from the House, 
“and pursuant to discussions that we had before the debate, I 
move that the motion be passed unanimously”.  <I>Hansard</I> then 
recorded some hon. members saying yes and the House adjourned. 
That was it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House did not actually have a serious debate about poverty, 
except for one speaker, to whom I want to give credit, and that 
was Perrin Beatty, the current chair of the CBC.  Perrin Beatty 
spoke very eloquently in the House about the changing nature of 
the family and the reasons that was contributing to this whole 
problem of child poverty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Poverty in our case today is somehow determined to be a measure 
of income.  It is not just a measure of income, it is a measure 
of resources.  That means income and assets, plus the value of 
social benefits and services that are available to Canadians so 
they are able to live in dignity, to have food, clothing, shelter 
and the basic necessities of life.  Those are the things we 
should be measuring. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we look at the root causes of people living in poverty in 
Canada we will see that a lot of seniors are on that list.  A lot 
of seniors are on that list because they did not have the 
opportunity to provide adequately for their retirement income. 
Their income levels on their tax returns show them to be below 
some artificial low income cut-off. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are immigration problems.  Many immigrants, in particular 
the refugees who come to Canada, are unable to assimilate and to 
care for themselves as well as they should.  They are also on 
this list. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then there are the mentally and the physically disabled, those 
who are unable to care for themselves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is not something which we can simply pass a resolution on 
and then eliminate.  It is a fact of life, which means that the 
social values of Canadians should be:  How are we going to 
protect and care for the physically and the mentally disabled, 
those who are not able to care for themselves?  That is a 
separate issue in the whole complex dynamic of poverty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How about the youth?  There are tens of thousand of youth 
floating around this country.  If we look at the condition of 
today's Canadian youth we have to ask ourselves:  Why is it that 
about 25% of Canadian youth drop out of high school?  How is it 
possible for a high school dropout to even think of fully 
participating in the opportunities of Canada?  To opt out of high 
school is to sit on the curb and watch the parade go by.  This is 
an important aspect of poverty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again though, as members will notice, that falls under 
provincial jurisdiction.  Federal issues are involved, municipal 
issues are involved, and there are also Canadian issues.  If we 
are going to deal with poverty, we have to get Canadians on side 
as well.  There has to be a minimal expectation that all 
Canadians will act in good faith and will work hard to get 
themselves out of the situation.  Those are the things that we 
have to do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Drug and alcohol abuse and addiction are very significant 
contributors to poverty in Canada.  There are people who have 
illnesses and we are not providing services to help them. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1325"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT41"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is part of the situation.  It is mostly a provincial issue, 
but we as a federal government have to support serving Canadians 
with those health care needs.  That is why we have a social union 
agreement.  That is part of the agenda. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The single largest contributor to child poverty in Canada has to 
do with the breakdown of the Canadian family.  Twelve per cent of 
all Canadian families are lone-parent families.  They account for 
46% of all children living in poverty.  Almost half of the 
poverty situation we are talking about today has to do with the 
breakdown of the family. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why does the family break down?  It is a very complex area.  It 
has to do with domestic violence.  It has to do with substance 
abuse.  It has to do with the lack of a job.  It has to do with 
adultery.  It has to do with a lot of things. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us not deal with poverty as a linear problem that has linear 
solutions.  We have to deal with poverty as a complex problem, 
requiring a multiplicity of solutions that we can all support at 
all levels of government and embrace all Canadians to be part of 
the solution, not part of the problem. 
<P><A NAME="LINK80"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Stoffer (Sackville—Eastern Shore, NDP):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, it is amazing to hear a Liberal backbencher talk about 
poverty when it was his government that gutted the EI system and 
caused a lot of the problems in this country today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact is that people want to work.  Fishermen in the coastal 
communities and farmers on the prairies want to work.  When they 
could not work they had to rely on the EI system, an EI system 
that is failing well over 65% of the people in this country.  It 
is not just lone parents and families that break up which are 
suffering, there are many families with a husband and wife who 
find it difficult to make ends meet today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like the member to respond to the fact that it was this 
government's drastic cuts to EI, to satisfy its fiscal objectives 
and banking needs, which created a huge social deficit in which 
parented families are greatly suffering as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Szabo:</B>  Madam Speaker, the EI debate has taken 
place in the House on many occasions.  I will not try to repeat 
those arguments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would rather spend the couple of moments that I have to 
reiterate to the member that if we are serious about addressing 
the complex problem of poverty in Canada, one of the most 
significant elements has to do with the Canadian family.  It has 
to do with the erosion of the Canadian family, the breakdown of 
the Canadian family, which leads to many broken homes, 
homelessness and real poverty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us make a commitment now to at least admit that the 
breakdown of the social and moral fabric in Canada is 
collectively our fault, which will take our collective will to 
change. 
<P><A NAME="LINK81"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jean Dubé (Madawaska—Restigouche, PC):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, once again the member opposite, when he talked about 
education, referred to provincial boundaries.  We all know that 
if our kids are going to survive in this global market they need 
a better education. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He also spoke about the compassion his government has for broken 
homes, family split-ups and school dropouts.  Let me remind the 
hon. member that transfer payments to the provinces were slashed 
by his government.  Broken homes, split-ups and dropouts are 
caused by this government's lack of job creation.  That is the 
real problem with this government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the member had control of the EI surplus, if he could decide 
what to do with the EI surplus, what would he do? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Szabo:</B>  Madam Speaker, we are not here to debate 
the issues that the member raises.  We are here to talk about 
poverty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me use my one minute to make reference to the Golden report 
on the homeless in Toronto. 
It was a very good report. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1330"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT43"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT43"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1330

<A HREF="#LINKT42"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was found that half the homeless in Toronto actually had no 
roots in Toronto.  They had migrated from other places across the 
country. It reminds me of the <I>Field of Dreams</I> statement if 
you build it, they will come. Toronto's experiences found that 
yes, they built it and they did come. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Golden tries to suggest that somehow we have preventative 
strategies to deal with homelessness and with poverty.  In fact, 
their idea of addressing poverty was to mask it.  It was to deal 
with making poverty invisible.  It had nothing to do with dealing 
with the root causes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The root causes are more fundamental than a tax break because as 
I said at the beginning of my speech, the poor in Canada do not 
pay taxes because they do not have income. Tax credits as 
proposed by the Conservative Party are really an inappropriate 
approach to dealing with poverty.  It is going to take the 
collective will of all three levels of government as well as the 
Canadian people to understand that we are the cause of this 
problem collectively and we collectively must be the solution. 
<P><A NAME="LINK82"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lynn Myers (Waterloo—Wellington, Lib.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I am pleased to rise in the House today to debate this 
very important motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion of the hon. member for Shefford states that the 
government should help to fight poverty in this country by 
encouraging self-sufficiency and self-reliance.  These are 
excellent goals and underscore several programs and initiatives 
which we in the federal government have undertaken especially in 
partnership with the provincial and territorial governments to do 
precisely that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The new national child benefit is one of the most obvious 
examples of this kind of movement.  As hon. members know, this 
initiative came into effect last year following extensive 
discussions between the federal, provincial and territorial 
governments on how to most effectively address the issue of child 
poverty.  Even though Canada is one of the most successful and 
socially advanced countries in the world, the very sad fact is 
that far too many children in our country still live in poverty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Poverty is a numbing and degrading experience for anyone, but it 
is particularly difficult for children.  It can mean a child is 
not only deprived of proper food, clothing and other essentials 
but also has long term health and social consequences that come 
up later in life. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In order to address this issue, as of July last year the federal 
government invested an additional $850 million per year in 
support of children under the national child benefit.  By July 
2000 the federal investment will be at least an additional $1.7 
billion per year.  That is over and above the roughly $5 billion 
annually the federal government already invests in families with 
children through the Canada child tax benefit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a result of this initiative, more than two million children 
are receiving higher federal payments each month to help ensure 
that they have adequate food, clothing and shelter.  It will help 
provide for some of the necessities that children need for a 
healthy start in life. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What does this have to do with self-sufficiency and 
self-reliance?   It has a great deal to do with it.  The problem 
is that too many parents on social assistance cannot accept a low 
wage job without penalizing their children.  They are often 
caught behind that infamous welfare wall, meaning that when they 
move off social assistance and into a job, they can actually end 
up with fewer benefits and services for their children than what 
they had received while on social assistance.  That truly is a 
shame.  They lose social assistance benefits, things like dental 
plans, transportation allowances, housing allowances and other 
supports which come to an end when they take that job. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The new program will help to lower the welfare wall with a 
higher Canada child tax benefit for all low income families 
whether they are in the workforce or not.  That is an important 
change.  This in turn means that provincial and territorial 
governments will be able to reduce the amount they pay to 
families on social assistance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not simply a windfall for the provinces.  As part of the 
deal, provincial and territorial governments have agreed that 
they will take the money they save and reinvest it in income 
support and services to help poor families; services such as 
provincial child benefits, child care support for working 
parents, basic skills training and other preventative services 
for children that reflect the needs of individual communities. 
As a result of the first phase of the national child benefit, 
most provinces already have these complementary programs in 
place. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1335"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT43"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The provinces will also be investing more as a result of the 
government's commitment to further increase the national child 
benefit supplement by an additional $850 million per year 
starting this July and next July.  These complementary provincial 
services range from child benefit and employment supplements for 
low income recipients to child care tax credits to programs for 
optical care and prescription drugs for school age children and 
many other initiatives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The end result is that more low income parents will be 
encouraged to get back into the workforce. More children will 
therefore benefit because of a higher household income. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government does not suggest for a minute that this new 
program solves all the problems, not at all. What it does 
represent is a new beginning, a fresh start if you will, a chance 
to provide a more comprehensive way to meet the challenge of 
poverty in this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the same time the government is working to ensure that it has 
better information on which to base policy decisions, something 
that is extremely important as our society and the economy 
undergo the increasingly rapid pace of change that has 
characterized the past number of decades. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The national longitudinal study of children and youth will be 
enhanced to provide more specific community based data that will 
greatly assist all governments in making policy choices that are 
better targeted and more effective. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government believes that making an investment in our 
children and our young people is in our own long term best 
economic and social interests. Certainly it is.  That is why the 
government has also implemented other measures, such as 
increasing the deductions for child care expenses, providing a 
family income supplement for roughly 200,000 low income parents 
receiving employment insurance benefits, enhancing the community 
action program for children and putting more emphasis on prenatal 
nutrition programs for children at risk. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is also why the government has a number of programs to help 
Canadians find and keep jobs.  The Canada jobs fund is helping to 
create jobs in high unemployment areas.  The youth employment 
strategy is helping thousands of young Canadians with that all 
important transition from school to work.  We also have a program 
called employment assistance for persons with disabilities to 
help those persons with disabilities join and stay in the 
workforce. The government has also introduced the Canada 
opportunities strategy that helps more Canadians, young and old, 
to gain access to a good education and to acquire the skills they 
need to get a good job. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has a clear strategy to fight poverty in this 
country.  Many great initiatives are well under way and are 
directly addressing the concerns raised in this motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The strategy is to get as many people as possible into the 
workforce, or certainly back into the workforce so that they can 
earn a living and support themselves and their families. Since 
1993 some 1.6 million new jobs have been created in this country. 
I believe that when the Minister of Finance presents his budget 
next week, Canadians will see that this government intends to 
continue to pursue the strategy of job creation and growth which 
we have done and which has invigorated our economy and helped 
give more and more Canadians the chance to be full participants 
in the economic and social life of this great country of ours. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>No one should have any doubt that this government is serious 
about fighting poverty in this country, nor should anyone doubt 
that this government believes that the best way to do so is to 
encourage the self-sufficiency and self-reliance referred to in 
this motion.  That is important to note and I think we on all 
sides of the House should do so.

respect by the way, about the recent letter which was referred to 
by us last week in the House of Commons.  Is one of those 
programs he talked about the quota that HRDC personnel are now 
required to meet to take money from EI recipients in order to 
protect their jobs from the wrath of this government?  How is 
arbitrarily taking people off EI especially in remote communities 
going to help them feed their families and end child poverty?

for the question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We on the government side have a tremendous record when it comes 
to issues of poverty, especially child poverty.  The kinds of 
things that we have implemented over time and the kinds of things 
that we will be implementing over time are truly in the best 
interests of Canadians wherever they may live. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians understand that what we as a government are doing is 
in the best interests of everyone. It is done so with compassion 
and tolerance, knowing that we need to pursue that and ensure 
that poverty as we know it is eradicated to the best extent 
possible.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I listened 
to the hon. member's thoughtful comments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One can say one cares, as the hon. member does, and he is 
undoubtedly sincere, but he is a member of a government that 
showed no compassion, that did not anticipate the impact on 
people of its cuts to employment insurance and to transfers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us not forget that it is this government that decided to 
turn funding for education, health and the Canada assistance 
plan into a single transfer. Once that was done, the government 
was quick to reduce federal funding from $19 billion in 1994 
down to $11.5 billion. The result is that the provinces had to 
make cuts in health, education and social assistance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They are now saying “We will allocate money for the poor. We 
will help the poor”. People are people. How many have found 
themselves in dire straits? Poverty is not just a question of 
money, it is a question of despair, of repeated failure, of 
dignity, or lack of dignity, as was pointed out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would appreciate it if the hon. member could comment. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lynn Myers:</B>  Madam Speaker, I thank the member 
opposite for the question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I reject out of hand her premise of failure.  I reject out of 
hand her premise of our lacking compassion. On the contrary we 
have not failed.  We do have in place a system of compassion to 
help Canadians wherever they may live in this great country of 
ours. We have built in the kinds of programs necessary to assist 
Canadians and to help them, not only people in poverty and 
especially our young people, but in all kinds of ways.  We have 
done so through the transfer payment system and will continue to 
do so in a very meaningful way that underscores our government's 
commitment to this all important policy area.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Howard Hilstrom (Selkirk—Interlake, Ref.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, the government speakers have indicated that the 
provincial governments were at fault, that it is not really the 
government's fault as it has great programs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Over the past 130 years or so that this country has been 
governed, the Liberal Party has been a big part of it.  Where we 
are at today in child poverty is a direct result of its 
performance as a government.  It cannot avoid responsibility for 
that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Besides the broad issues, there is one area which is clearly the 
responsibility of the federal government and that is aboriginal 
affairs.  Our Indian reserves are pockets of poverty which I have 
been trying to do something about in my riding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask the member if the tax issues cannot be fixed, can those 
areas of aboriginal affairs be fixed where there is no 
accountability for the money that is going into those reserves? 
People are getting incredibly rich and the poor and the small 
children are literally starving and in poverty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lynn Myers:</B>  Madam Speaker, of course we have had a 
long history of helping people and we will continue to do so. We 
will do so for aboriginals and for all Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is interesting that a member from the Reform Party, which 
stands for opposing every initiative that our government has ever 
tried to put in place with respect to poverty, including child 
poverty, would stand in the House and make those kinds of 
statements. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we came to the child tax benefit for example, the Reform 
Party voted against it.  When it came to CAPC, the community 
action program for children, the Reform Party voted against it.

<P><A NAME="LINK86"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Christiane Gagnon (Québec, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, it is a 
pleasure to speak today on the motion put forward by the hon. 
member for Shefford, which reads as follows: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That, in the opinion of this House, the government should take 
steps to alleviate the burden of poverty in Canada by 
encouraging self-sufficiency and self-reliance and, to that end, 
should increase the basic income tax credit to $10,000, index 
the tax brackets and index the child tax benefit. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a pleasure because, today, we will have an opportunity to 
debate the issue of poverty in Canada and in every province. 
I can see that, on the government side, members are very 
compassionate. They seem to be familiar with the issue and its 
adverse effects and to know what constituencies are affected by 
poverty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleague from Mississauga South not only has the gift of the 
gab, he also has a great deal of compassion, as I heard. Too bad 
he is not the Prime Minister of Canada. I think he might just 
implement some of the suggestions made in this motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It seems to me that he contradicted something he said earlier. I 
see him every day applauding the Minister of Human Resources 
Development and his EI reform. We are aware of the fact that 
this is a social policy that has taken a serious toll on the 
public. It has made poverty grow worse day by day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Compassion is one thing, but action is what is needed. What good 
is it to recognize and lament the fact that some people cannot 
afford basic necessities like food and housing, if nothing is 
done about it. The Liberal government could take a variety of 
measures to remedy the problem, but it is not taking action. 
Everyone knows that poverty is growing. There are many more 
children living in poverty today than there were ten years ago. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois has been actively involved in fighting 
poverty. I mentioned earlier the employment insurance issue, 
which is a major social policy. Several of my colleagues have 
worked on private member's bills that they have introduced in 
this House. Time and time again, they have suggested various 
approaches to the government, which brushed all of them off, 
without any consideration for the effort that had gone into 
developing these proposals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unlike the hon. member for Mississauga South, I congratulate the 
hon. member for Shefford for bringing this motion to the House 
today.  It allows us to focus on poverty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a motion that is praiseworthy in itself, but we are not in 
agreement with its wording. We find the motion financially 
irresponsible.  It is all very well to bring in solutions, but 
they must also be affordable.  The main weapons against poverty 
are not contained in the motion of the hon. member for Shefford. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This morning, the political parties admit that poverty is a real 
shame.  It is time to act, and the Liberal policies in this area 
have been a total failure.  The only ones who can do anything 
are the Liberals. However, we do not see even a hint of 
willingness to do something to change the situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yet in 1989, the House unanimously passed the following 
resolution: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This House express its concern for the more than one million 
Canadian children currently living in poverty and seek to 
achieve the goal of eliminating poverty among Canadian children 
by the year 2000. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are well aware that the Liberals had a great deal to say on 
this when in the opposition.  They criticized the Progressive 
Conservative government.  Now the shoe is on the other foot and 
the Progressive Conservatives are criticizing the Liberal 
government for not attacking poverty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Ten years later, we have a 60% increase in the number of poor 
children, to a record high of 1.5 million poor children in 
Canada.

<A HREF="#LINKT46"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Each successive government has passed the buck on to the next. 
I think it was under the Progressive Conservatives that social 
transfers to the provinces were first reduced and UI eligibility 
requirements tightened. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are two enormously important social measures that have a 
major impact on people, and that play a key role in contributing 
to poverty if corrective action is not taken. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois is not pulling figures out of a hat and it is 
not alone in condemning the situation.  There are a number of 
bodies that advise the government and that examine the problem 
of growing poverty in Canada. 
The National Council of Welfare, the Canadian Council on Social 
Development, the UN and Campaign 2000 have criticized the 
government on several counts and asked it to take action where 
it could. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The National Council of Welfare is not just any old council.  It 
is a body that advises the federal government on poverty.  In a 
report entitled “Poverty Profile 1996”, it was already 
identifying poverty as an issue: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our child poverty is at its highest level in 17 years. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>With 20.6%, or 1,481,000, of Canada's children living in 
poverty, the Liberals are the clear winners when it comes to 
driving people into poverty. 
The poverty rate for all categories of families is 14.8%. The 
rate for single mothers under 65 years of age with children 
under 18 is 61.4%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The policies set up by the Liberal government are nothing to 
brag about. If we look at the figures, the result is rather 
disastrous. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>According to the National Council of Welfare, the decline in 
government income support programs, particularly social 
assistance and employment insurance, is the primary cause of 
poverty. The federal government hurt people in two ways, by 
reducing transfers to the provinces for social assistance and by 
making it harder to qualify for employment insurance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The cuts affecting transfers to the provinces total $42 billion, 
or $6 billion per year. 
The National Council of Welfare says that, since the deficit has 
now been eliminated, the government is in a position to change 
its approach and to fulfil the commitment it has often made 
regarding children and their families. This means restoring 
transfers to the provinces and improving the employment 
insurance program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian Council on Social Development also released a 
report on progress achieved by Canadian children in 1998. That 
report is even more scathing. It says that improvements in the 
lives of Canadian children and young people were offset by 
negative social and economic patterns. The council blames the 
bad coverage provided to the unemployed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So, the Bloc Quebecois is not the only one to condemn the 
government's attitude regarding transfers to the provinces and 
employment insurance, with all the restrictions that it has 
imposed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The United Nations is also a very important body. It released a 
report, on December 4, in which it strongly condemned Canada for 
the rapid deterioration of the living conditions of Canadians. 
Under the UN's human development index, Canada does not take 
first place, but only tenth place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we all know, Canada prides itself in being the best country 
in the world, but with figures such as those there is nothing to 
brag about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Campaign 2000 is another organization dedicated to fighting 
poverty in Canada. Its report published in 1998 provides very 
disturbing figures.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The number of children living in families with incomes under 
$20,000 has increased by 65%.  The number of children living in 
families experiencing chronic unemployment has increased by 33%. 
The number of children living in families on social assistance 
has increased by 51%.  The number of children living in low cost 
but unaffordable housing has increased by 91%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government can tell us all it wants about how it is trying 
to combat child poverty, that it has made it a priority and that 
its programs take the needs of children and their families into 
account, but its attitude to the problems of EI and the Canada 
social transfer put it at the bottom of the class in social 
policy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We would like to come back to the member for Shefford's motion 
and make a few suggestions, because we in the Bloc Quebecois 
think that she did not go far enough and that her figures are 
unrealistic.  We feel that her motion is financially 
irresponsible and that the measures proposed do not go far 
enough. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion is financially irresponsible and merely repeats some 
of the dissenting views of this party with respect to the 
December report of the Standing Committee on Finance. 
The Progressive Conservative Party is making suggestions which 
individually have some merit but collectively would clearly push 
the Liberal government back into a deficit situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to outline the costs associated with this motion of 
the Progressive Conservative Party. The motion would lower EI 
premiums by $6 billion without making any improvement to the 
program. We in the Bloc Quebecois have asked repeatedly that the 
government improve the system, so that more people can qualify, 
but this concern is not reflected in the motion put forward by 
the hon. member for Shefford. At present, 60% of the unemployed 
are excluded from the EI program. This means that many do not 
qualify, which contributes to the growth in poverty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second suggestion in the hon. member's motion is about fully 
indexing tax brackets, at a cost of $2 billion. This is in 
addition to the $6 billion for EI premiums. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>She is also asking that the basic income tax credit be increased 
to $10,000. We know that this would cost $9 billion and that the 
cost to the public purse per $100 increase— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B> I am sorry to interrupt the hon. member. She has 
seven minutes left to complete her speech, which will be 
followed by a 10-minute question and comment period. Since this 
would take approximately a quarter of an hour, I think we should 
now proceed to Statements by Members. The hon. member can resume 
her speech after Oral Question Period.

studies showed that rBST caused a significant increase by 
approximately 50% in the incidence of lameness in injected dairy 
cattle, the department made a clear decision to reject rBST use 
in Canada. It is a decision which and I and the dairy farmers of

</I></B></P><P align=left>On Saturday night friends of radio in southern Alberta lost a 
true pioneer.  George began his distinguished radio career in 
Lethbridge in 1939.  During World War II he enlisted in the Royal 
Canadian Corps of Signals where he helped the allied forces 
intercept enemy communications.  After the war George returned to 
southern Alberta where he embarked on a long and illustrious 
career on the airwaves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A dedicated community member, he served on many voluntary boards 
and societies sharing his talents.  George was a distinguished 
performer himself performing in choral groups across southern 
Alberta.  A member of the Broadcasting Hall of Fame, George 
reminded us of an era when radio was our window to the world. 
George used his love and knowledge of music, particularly his 
love for big band music, to create a bond with the listeners of 
his unique Sunday morning radio program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our prayers and condolences go out to his family.  Thank you 
George, thanks for the musical memories.

Bill C-55 is the best solution to a complex situation, for it

</I></B></P><P align=left>It will ban a practice which threatens the continuing success of

in the U.S.

publishers, without imposing a tax or in any way limiting the 
content of periodicals, creating subsidies, or limiting readers' 
choice.

the bulk export of water from Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, what they announced falls far short of the motion.  For

necessarily immediate, if some of them happen at all.

cannot and we will not be able to until the Liberals face up to

have to change or scrap NAFTA.

we have reduced taxes every year we have been in government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To give an example, when we formed the government the EI premium 
was $3.30.  We reduced that to $2.55.  We made reductions in 
taxes every year, including last year.  The surtax for those

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Miss Deborah Grey (Edmonton North, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
the Prime Minister could check his books.  Taxes have gone up, 
not down.  Average Canadians are paying $1,800 more this year in 
taxes than when the Prime Minister took over in 1993, yet they 
have had $1,150 cut out of their health and social programs. 
That is $1,800 more in taxes and they have cut $1,150 on health 
care.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Next week in the budget we will probably hear about a $2 billion

little”.  Incredibly, we are still paying more taxes, not less.

since we formed the government, from $3.30 to $2.55. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the same time, we managed to eliminate the deficit which was 
$42 billion.  I guess the people of Canada know we are doing our

since the Bloc Quebecois has a very narrow focus, it was likely

safety, is a scathing indictment of the Can-Tox study 
co-sponsored by Health Canada last year regarding Frederick 
Street.  The findings of the now flawed Can-Tox study were the 
basis for the government's inaction.

along with the Minister of the Environment I met with the 
residents of Frederick Street some months ago when I was in 
Sydney.  I said to them then and I repeat now that our concern is 
for their safety and for their health. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me say two things.  First, the Can-Tox study was made 
public.  We believe it was right, but we are going to look at the 
report which we are receiving this afternoon and we will study it 
carefully.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Scott Brison (Kings—Hants, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
Canadians' after tax income has declined by 7% since the early 
1990s.  One in five Canadian children are now living in poverty. 
All Canadians, particularly low end Canadians, need tax relief 
now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the last budget the finance minister took $2.5 billion of 
Canadians' money to put into a millennium scholarship fund.  How

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Jim Peterson (Secretary of State (International 
Financial Institutions), Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the member 
certainly outlines how from day one in our first budget, even 
though we had a huge deficit, we have been investing in the 
future of Canadians.  One of our first major investments was to 
increase the floor of the transfers for health care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We realize that we cannot have a strong country unless we have 
the best trained and best educated young people.  That is why we 
have made this huge investment in the future of our young

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Scott Brison (Kings—Hants, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, that 
was the long answer.  The short answer is zero.  Not one red cent 
of that $2.5 billion taken from Canadians was reinvested in 
Canadians this year.  Will the minister stop playing Mother 
Hubbard with Canadians' money?  Will he reduce taxes for low 
income Canadians next week by fully reindexing tax brackets and 
by raising the basic personal exemption to $10,000? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask the secretary of state not to say that he cannot comment

</I></B></P><P align=left>From day one tax cuts have been important to us.  We started out 
with targeted tax cuts to those who are most in need, to those 
who are disabled, to charities in the voluntary sector, to poor 
families.  In the last budget we doubled the amount of the child 
tax benefit and provided $1.7 billion to the poorest families in

greatly missed.

fellow British Columbian member of parliament, I wish to pay 
tribute to a former member of this House, the late Ron 
Huntington, who passed away in December. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Huntington represented west Vancouver and British Columbians 
in this House for a decade.  During that time, when in 
opposition, he served diligently on several committees of this 
House, making a substantial contribution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Later when the Progressive Conservative Party under Mr. Clark 
took office he served as minister of state for small business. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As minister of oceans I should point out that Mr. Huntington was 
a man who knew the oceans well, serving, as was mentioned by my 
hon. friend, as a member of the Royal Canadian Navy during the 
second world war, rising to the rank of lieutenant commander.  He 
also served as chairman of the Canada Ports Corporation from 1985 
to 1991.  In recreation he enjoyed the waters of the Pacific 
coast as commodore of the West Vancouver Yacht Club. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On behalf of the government and all my colleagues, I would like 
to extend to his wife Miriam and to his family our most sincere

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Reynolds (West Vancouver—Sunshine Coast, Ref.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I rise on behalf of the official opposition to pay 
tribute to the Hon. Ron Huntington. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A lot of honourable people have served this precinct.  Ron 
Huntington is one parliamentarian who served this House with 
particular distinction and honour. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First elected in 1974 and re-elected in 1979 and 1980, Ron 
Huntington immediately became known to his colleagues on both 
sides of the House as a gentleman, respectful of the dignity and 
history of this esteemed institution. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1510"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT62"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps it was Ron's belief in hard work and what a diligence to 
task could bring to those who persevered.  Perhaps it was Ron's 
parents, Sam and Winifred, who instilled in Ron what service to 
community and country meant.  Perhaps it was Ron's naval career 
and his service in the Royal Canadian Navy from 1941 to 1945 that 
ingrained in Ron a love of this nation and a desire to maintain 
its honour by serving as a member of parliament. Knowing Ron as a 
colleague, I believe it was all that and much more. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Ron Huntington was a focused man.  He once told me he came to 
Ottawa with an objective, a goal and a vision.  He wanted to make 
this country a better place and he worked hard each day as a 
member of parliament for the riding of Capilano to realize these 
goals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Anyone who knew Ron Huntington knew of his no nonsense approach 
to getting the job done.  At the same time, anyone who knew Ron 
Huntington knew of his sensitive and caring side. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many an employee of Ron Huntington, some who are still working 
in these precincts, can attest to his nurturing side and his 
genuine concern for the future of those who worked for him. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Forever humble, it was particularly difficult for Ron to accept 
the mantel of honourable when he was appointed small business 
minister in 1979.  No one more than Ron deserved this 
acknowledgement for his contribution to this House and this 
country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>His work in public accounts, transport, finance, estimates and 
procedure remains as examples of enlightened and progressive 
thinking, and his authorship of “Closing the Loop”, a working 
document on how to make the spending of the taxpayer's money more 
realistic, is testimony to his deep passion for making things 
better. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When Ron decided not to run in the 1984 election, he was far 
from finished with the public service and served as chairman 
Ridley Terminals from 1985 to 1990. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Following that, Ron returned to Ottawa as chairman of Canada 
Ports Corporation from 1990 to 1995.  Ron had something to offer 
and his contribution was welcomed by everyone. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Ron lost the woman he brought to Ottawa in 1974 to cancer. Those 
of us who had the pleasure of knowing Jean knew a woman of grace 
and dignity.  She was Ron's pillar during the tumultuous and 
trying times and she never wavered. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1990 Ron married Mim and until ill health befell her, Ron and 
Mim resided in peace and serenity in White Rock, British 
Columbia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Ron Huntington was a man of passion.  His indomitable spirit for 
good and righteousness is unquestionable.  If there was one spot 
he enjoyed even more than these precincts, it surely was at times 
aboard his yacht in Desolation Sound.  It was his refuge and I 
will not tell any story or any tales about his times out there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Ron Huntington left a mark on this institution.  Let us work to 
ensure this mark is not erased and let us each day emulate this 
most complete and compelling gentleman. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On behalf of the official opposition, I extend to his family our 
sincerest condolences.  We liked Ron and he will be missed.

rise today to pay tribute to the Hon. Ronald Huntington, a 
former member of this House, who died December 28 at the age of 77. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Born in Vancouver, Mr. Huntington studied at the University of 
British Columbia.  From 1941 to 1945, during World War II, he 
served in the Canadian navy, in the Mediterranean and the North

Progressive Conservative member for Capilano—Howe Sound, a riding 
he would represent for 10 years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During that period, Mr. Huntington served as minister of state 
for small business and industry from 1979 to 1980 in the 
Progressive Conservative cabinet and as president of the 
Progressive Conservative Party from 1982 to 1983.

I concur with what was said by the member from the Reform Party 
who is his successor for the part of Vancouver he represented in 
the House of Commons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remember very well when he first came to the House in 1974. He 
was re-elected in 1979 and 1980.  I remember him very well.  He 
was one of those members of parliament who were very outspoken. 
He spoke very directly.  He spoke in a very straight way to what 
he believed in passionately. 
He was also a very dogged, determined person in terms of pursuing 
the ideals that he thought were correct.  Obviously he was also 
very partisan and we often disagreed with him in terms of our 
ideology, but I always admire someone who will stand up and say 
what they believe in.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed consideration of the motion and of the 
amendment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The hon. member for Québec has seven minutes 
left. 
<P><A NAME="LINK247"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Christiane Gagnon (Québec, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I will 
continue to speak to the motion of the hon. member for Shefford, 
asking the government to “take steps to alleviate the burden of 
poverty in Canada by encouraging self-sufficiency and 
self-reliance”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To that end, the government should “increase the basic Income 
Tax credit to $10,000, index the tax brackets and index the 
Child Tax Benefit”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will not support that motion for two reasons. First, we think 
the motion is unrealistic from a financial point of view and 
could generate another deficit, after we just got rid of one. 
The second reason is the restrictive nature of the proposed 
measures. Indeed, the Bloc Quebecois has more all encompassing 
suggestions to fight poverty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion includes some elements found in the dissenting 
opinion expressed by the Progressive Conservatives in the 
December report of the Standing Committee on Finance. The 
Progressive Conservative Party proposes what are essentially 
good ideas. However, if all these proposals were implemented, it 
would surely create another federal deficit. We know that the 
Progressive Conservative Party has already largely contributed 
to the federal deficit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member for Shefford proposes to reduce employment 
insurance contributions by $6 billion. We too are strong 
supporters of that idea. We want to reduce employment insurance 
contributions, but we also want to improve the program. 
This means more people eligible for employment insurance.  We 
know that 40% of people now have access to employment insurance 
benefits.  Three young people out of four no longer qualify.  A 
number of men and women cannot draw benefits.  We cannot agree 
with the first measure of a $6 billion cut, because this does 
not take improvement of the program into account. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Total indexation of the tax tables, at the cost of $2 billion, 
on top of the $6 billion for employment insurance contributions, 
brings us to $8 billion for these proposals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we include raising the basic personal exemption from its 
present $6,500 to $10,000—we know that every $100 increase costs 
the treasury $250 million—the total cost would be $9 billion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>She is also calling for a $2 billion increase in the Canada 
social transfer. While in agreement with some of these measures, 
we believe her proposals total $21 billion.  If we had one 
criticism to make of the Progressive Conservative Party, it 
would be its failure to provide figures for the proposals made 
here today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There was no provision made for the surplus, which, according to 
a very conservative estimate, will be in the vicinity of $15 
billion.  More idealistically, it could be around $19.13 
billion.

<A HREF="#LINKT64"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Obviously, we are a few billions short of meeting the 
expectations of the hon. member for Shefford. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know that the Conservative Party is in the habit of passing 
its deficits on to the next government when it is no longer in 
office, but there is still a need to remain realistic and think 
about the budget, which must be taken into account. The Bloc 
Quebecois is proposing measures that are better suited to the 
real budgetary situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I said earlier, there is some merit to what our colleague is 
proposing, but there is also a lack of vision due to the 
restrictive nature of the motion. Obviously, we are in favour of 
indexing tax brackets and tax benefits, but that is not enough. 
We feel this should be part of a comprehensive antipoverty 
strategy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By refusing to index the child tax benefit, the tax brackets and 
the GST credits, the Liberal government is picking the pockets 
of low income earners to the tune of billions of dollars. By not 
indexing tax brackets, GST credits and the child tax benefit 
between 1993 and 1997, the federal government took $5 billion 
out of the pockets of low income earners. By not indexing these 
things, the whole structure of transfers to individuals was left 
to change according to the cost of living. This in turn resulted 
in a complete distortion of the tax system, which affects the 
effectiveness of tax policies and makes the system unfair. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me give members an example of the type of distortion 
resulting from this decision not to index credits. 
A person earning between $32,000 and $33,000 paid $821 more in 
income tax between 1994 and 1997.  However, a person earning 
$92,241 paid $752 more in income tax during that period.  We can 
see the unfairness in the system and its unfair effect, a tax 
bias. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Which of the government's measures actually caused the 
impoverishment?  For the Bloc Quebecois it is surely the 
reduction in provincial transfers, reductions of $6 billion 
annually for a total of $42 billion.  That affects education, 
health care and social assistance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>People in vulnerable situations, living below the poverty line, 
need more support for help with children.  They need more health 
care.  They often need social assistance.  It is sad to say, but 
it is the truth. 
When the federal government cuts transfers to the provinces, it 
impoverishes the public too. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then there is the employment insurance reform.  Six out of ten 
unemployed individuals are excluded; 32% of unemployed women 
received benefits in 1997; 15% of young people are eligible for 
benefits.  These two government measures could have been 
effective in the fight against poverty.  The Liberal government 
could have decided, with $20 billion in the employment insurance 
fund, to help part of the population without employment and 
often without financial assistance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These people are often not eligible for social assistance for 
other reasons: because a partner is working, earning a bit, they 
have to give up their possessions, their small savings.  This is 
how poverty grows. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not, unfortunately, have time to continue.  It is always a 
shame when a speech is split in two with one part delivered 
earlier and one later.  It is never fair in terms of time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I respect the Chair.  Since I am told that my time is up, I will 
stop here.  I hope I will have other opportunities to speak of 
all the measures the Liberal government could implement to stop 
poverty.  I hope I will have the opportunity to do so in the 
weeks following the tabling of the budget and I hope you will 
give me more time to address this issue.

<P><A NAME="LINK248"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John McKay (Scarborough East, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
would like to mention at the outset that I will be splitting my 
time with the hon. member for St. Paul's. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also like to thank the House for this opportunity to 
speak on the motion as put forward by the Progressive 
Conservative Party. I will take the opportunity at this point to 
read the motion into the record: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That, in the opinion of this House, the government should take 
steps to alleviate the burden of poverty in Canada by encouraging 
self-sufficiency and self-reliance and, to that end, should 
increase the basic income tax credit to $10,000, index the tax 
brackets and index the child tax benefit. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>My first observation is that this is a bit of a jumble.  We are 
dealing with tax credits, we are dealing with poverty, we are 
dealing with indexation, we are dealing with a variety of tax 
credits.  Frankly I have even heard members speak about 
homelessness in this whole debate.  About the only problem that 
is not here is that of original sin. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we eliminate from the motion the concept of poverty, I think 
the motion starts to make a little more sense.  Really the motion 
does not deal with poverty.  It deals with the person who cannot 
find enough money from month to month to make ends meet. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In order to make any sense of this motion, I believe it should 
simply deal with the efficacy of tax credits, the efficacy of the 
child tax benefit as a means by which fairness can be introduced 
into the tax system. If I may be permitted, I would like to 
restate the motion along those lines and address that issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The real question then becomes as to what this government has 
done in order to alleviate the working poor, the person who 
really cannot make it from month to month and is forever in 
danger of slipping into poverty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the outset it is not really rocket science.  The first thing 
we should do is move up the threshold at which taxes get paid. 
When means were available this government at the first 
opportunity moved up that threshold.  The last move on the 
threshold was $500 which eliminated about 400,000 Canadians from 
the tax rolls.  That is a great number of Canadians to remove 
from the tax rolls and alleviate them from paying any taxes at 
all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other measure that was introduced in the last budget which 
will alleviate poverty was with respect to another 13 million 
taxpayers who no longer have to pay the 3% surtax on incomes 
below $50,000. Hopefully the 1999 budget will go the entire route 
and eliminate that surtax in its entirety.  It was after all a 
surtax that was introduced for the purpose of deficit 
elimination. The deficit is now eliminated and has been 
eliminated for two years running now, and it is appropriate to 
eliminate that tax. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The 1998 budget also helped families with child care expenses by 
significantly increasing the limits of the child care expense 
deduction from $5,000 to $7,000 for children under seven, and 
from $3,000 to $4,000 for children seven to sixteen. These 
measures will add to tax relief for approximately 65,000 working 
families in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>May I say as a point of general observation that I for one am 
not as thrilled about that particular child tax expense credit 
because it has two flaws as I see it.  First, it has Revenue 
Canada preferring the arrangements that families might make with 
respect to children in one manner over another which I do not 
think is any business of Revenue Canada.  Second, one has to have 
a very decent income in order to maximize out on this particular 
benefit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While I support the government's initiative in this area, it 
seems to me in some respects a bit of a crude instrument in terms 
of achieving certain benefits to taxpaying families which might 
otherwise be done in another fashion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government introduced other initiatives to assist low and 
middle income families as well.  Effective July 1, 1998, $1.7 
billion per year was introduced in the child tax benefit.  It 
provides $1,625 for the first child and $1,425 for each child 
thereafter.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>When those cheques started to go through the system in July of 
last year I received quite a number of telephone calls at my 
constituency office.  The calls were to the effect:  “Thank you 
for that cheque.  It really helps.  This month my family and I 
will not have to go to the food bank.  This month we will catch 
up on some of our bills.  This month we will be able to avoid the 
embarrassment of being so close to continually slipping into 
debt”.  I received quite a number of calls along that line. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>About two weeks later I received an additional set of calls. 
This time it was calls from the people on social assistance.  The 
people on social assistance in the province of Ontario were cut 
back by an equal amount of money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We had the worst of all possible worlds.  We had raised 
expectations.  We had met expectations with money and by another 
branch of another government had taken those moneys away.  Those 
expectations and that reality were dashed.  I can still hear 
those conversations in my constituency office. People were 
literally crying on the phone that they had to go back to the 
food bank for another month and saw no hope. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberal caucus put a lot of political capital into that 
initiative.  As a Liberal member on this side of the House I am 
very proud to see that initiative adopted by this government. 
However I am very frustrated that initiative was in some respects 
defeated by a government that has no commitment to the reduction 
and alleviation of child poverty in the province of Ontario. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why I take some encouragement, though I must admit some 
skeptical encouragement, from the social union discussions.  I am 
hopeful that kind of undercutting will not occur in the future 
once this government takes a particular initiative in an area to 
relieve child poverty or any other kind of poverty which is 
perceived to be in the national interest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not think the government wants to micromanage a provincial 
economy or a provincial government's priorities.  It does not 
want to be in the position of backfilling tax cuts, tax cuts 
which are ideologically driven, tax cuts which are a priority to 
all other priorities.  It also does not want to be in a position 
of having its initiatives in the national interest being defeated 
simultaneously.  I am skeptical but I am hopeful these social 
union talks will go in a direction so these kinds of initiatives 
are not defeated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In summary, the motion does not deserve to be supported.  It is 
poorly drafted.  It looks like it was a bushel basket that 
everyone got around and threw a whole bunch of stuff into.  It is 
not a coherent motion.  It tries to connect tax credits and 
poverty.  When one is in poverty and not filing tax returns and 
has no income, tax credits are the least of one's worries.  One 
certainly is not terribly interested in indexation and all of the 
ratcheting up that might be going on simultaneously. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Moving up the threshold by $500 was a smart move on the part of 
the government.  It simply eliminated 400,000 taxpayers from the 
roles.  It gave additional relief to something in the order of 
4.6 million Canadians just by moving up $500. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Tax credits, be they for children or poverty or otherwise, are 
limited in their usefulness because one needs to have an income 
in order to use them.  They are also limited in their usefulness 
because provincial governments ideologically driven in other 
directions can defeat them by their own policies.  Partially 
eliminating the 3% tax on $50,000 incomes is worth $1.4 billion 
and is a relief to 90% of all tax filers.  Hopefully the budget 
will see it completely eliminated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are not motions, not even poorly drafted motions.  These 
are concrete measures which the government has achieved.  That is 
why I am urging all members to speak to the motion and to defeat 
it.

matter is that the surtaxes apply mostly to higher income people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion as amended deals with increasing the tax credit or 
the basic exemption which would primarily reduce to the greatest 
percentage the taxes paid by poorer people.  In other words, a 
person with a family income of $12,000, which is a pitiful amount 
by today's standard, would pay taxes.  If we increased the limits 
and applied the same kind of exemption to spouses they would be 
eliminated from the tax roll.  Surely he would be in favour of 
that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John McKay:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am not entirely sure that 
I understood the question, if in fact there was a question.  I 
apologize to the hon. member.  I was listening carefully. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We could do one of several things.  We could move up the bottom. 
Once in the tax system we could put some credits on and eliminate 
the taxes in the system.  Or, we could reduce from the top and 
presumably make more moneys available. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our response has been to initially move up the bottom.  When we 
can take 400,000 people off the tax rolls we are doing something 
right.  That is and of itself one of the most effective means by 
which to eliminate poverty.  It is a substantial cost to the 
treasury but I think it is worth paying.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. René Canuel (Matapédia—Matane, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, how do we 
get to zero poverty?  I will read a resolution passed by all 
members of this House.  It was supported by all parties in 1989. 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>[That] this House ... seek to achieve the goal of eliminating 
poverty among Canadian children by the year 2000. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This resolution was passed in 1989.  Today, there are 1.5 
million poor children, 500,000 more than in 1989.  What has this 
government done since 1993 to put into effect what the members 
voted for in 1989? 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John McKay:</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is a good question and I 
appreciate it.  In my view that is a worthwhile motion and a 
worthwhile goal.  It is something that the government has 
attempted to move toward.  It is always put in the context of 
realism.  The first realism is limitations on government 
revenues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another concrete reality is that the government role in society 
is a diminishing factor of GDP.  As the government role in 
society reduces, its ability to address the concern the member 
has, that is eliminating child poverty, is reduced as well.  We 
cannot be increasing government and increasing the ability to 
eliminate child poverty as well.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Stoffer (Sackville—Eastern Shore, NDP):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, what does the hon. member think should be done with the 
EI surplus?  Should it go to balance the deficit and other 
programs?  Or, should it go back to the workers so they can look 
after their families, especially those in remote communities? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John McKay:</B>  Mr. Speaker, if I had my way I would 
entirely separate out the EI account just like we handle it off 
books and deal with it that way instead of getting into this 
whole fictional exercise. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member opposite does not appreciate that if there is a 
surplus of $13 billion, $17 billion, $20 billion or whatever the 
number is, it is ratcheted here and ratcheted there. 
That revenue will need to be replaced on the books somewhere.  If 
the member can tell me how it will be replaced somewhere then we 
can deal with the other issue.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Carolyn Bennett (St. Paul's, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, poverty, 
in a country as rich as Canada, is very disturbing for this 
government and for all Canadians.  Unquestionably, we should not 
tolerate even one Canadian living in poverty. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As members of the House well know, poverty is and continues to 
be a major preoccupation of our government.  We are particularly 
aware of the importance of addressing child poverty, recognizing 
that giving children in Canada a good start in life is one of the 
most important investments Canada can make for its future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I assure the hon. member for Shefford that we are working 
aggressively to achieve this goal.  I remind the House that as of 
last July we began to invest $850 million per year into the 
national child benefit.  These new funds are over and above the 
$5.1 billion we already invest in families with children.  By 
July of the year 2000 that additional investment will reach $1.7 
billion per year into the national child benefit.  That more than 
compensates for inflation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will clearly need to sustain and enhance the benefit over a 
number of years, something we have committed to do.  We do not 
pretend that this first phase of the program will solve child 
poverty.  Nor do we suggest that a single program can be expected 
to reduce poverty on its own. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As part of our comprehensive plan to fight poverty we have 
provided a range of supports to low income families such as the 
family income supplement for roughly 200,000 low income parents 
on unemployment insurance and increased deductions for child 
care.  We have also strengthened the community action program for 
children as well as the Canadian prenatal nutrition program for 
children at risk. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>No one on this side of the Chamber would disagree that there is 
still much more to be done.  However, my hon. colleague must not 
overlook the government's track record in endowing the country's 
children with a legacy of greater opportunity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Neither can the opposition ignore the fact that money is not the 
entire answer.  The fact is the share of government transfer 
payments to Canadians such as child tax benefits, goods and 
services tax credits and old age pensions has doubled over the 
past quarter century.  In 1995 these transfers contributed 14 
cents of every dollar of income compared with 11 cents in 1990 
and less than 7 cents in 1970. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While my hon. colleague's motion is undeniably well intended, it 
is highly doubtful that simply raising the tax threshold would 
make a meaningful difference in the war against poverty.  Poverty 
is a deeply entrenched and complex challenge that defies easy 
solutions.  It will take not only money but time and a lot of 
hard work on the part of all Canadians to turn this situation 
around.  There is no magic formula, but we can work to provide 
more opportunities by creating the right conditions to fight 
poverty through a strong labour market. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reality is that reducing poverty ultimately depends on 
putting underemployed and unemployed Canadians to work.  That has 
more to do with the individual's age, skills, experience and 
personal motivation than it does with tax brackets. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Very obviously addressing these difficult issues extends beyond 
the purview of the finance department or any one level of 
government.  Alleviating poverty requires the concerted efforts 
of federal and provincial governments along with the co-operation 
and support of the private and voluntary sectors as well as 
individual Canadians themselves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am pleased to see that the opposition motion acknowledges the 
need to foster self-sufficiency and self-reliance.  Canadians 
have always striven to maintain a successful balance between 
taking responsibility for themselves and sharing responsibility 
for others. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We believe strongly in compassion and fairness as we value 
individual independence and achievement.  This philosophy is 
reflected in many of the initiatives our government has brought 
forward aimed at addressing the root causes of poverty and 
empowering people to help themselves.  We have focused much of 
our efforts on equipping Canadians with the skills and knowledge 
that they need to succeed in a changing working world because 
Canada's economic prospects and the eventual elimination of 
poverty increasingly depend on a highly trained and highly 
educated workforce. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Anyone doubting this fundamental fact of life in the new economy 
need only look at the employment numbers.  Since 1981 jobs for 
Canadians with a high school education or less dropped by two 
million while jobs demanding higher qualifications grew by more 
than five million. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Clearly Canadians with more education have better job prospects, 
greater job security and higher earnings.  Just as clearly this 
is key to narrowing the gap between the haves and the have nots. 
That is why the government introduced the youth employment 
strategy which helps young people make the transition from school 
to work, especially those youth at risk.

</I></B></P><P align=left>There are active employment measures under employment insurance which 
provide opportunities for skills upgrading, wage subsidies and 
job creation partnerships, financial assistance to those who want 
to go back to school and self-employment assistance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada jobs funds create sustainable jobs in areas of 
high unemployment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The employment assistance for persons with disabilities 
initiative, a federal-provincial partnership introduced last 
year, is helping increase the participation of Canadians with 
disabilities in the workforce. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The aboriginal action plan is to ensure the integration and the 
equality of aboriginal people in the economy and all sectors of 
society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian opportunities strategy helps Canadians upgrade 
their skills and knowledge whether they are still in school or 
already in the workforce to improve their prospects for 
employment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The overriding objective of all these initiatives is to help 
ensure that Canadians, especially those at greatest risk of 
exclusion, have better and more opportunity to participate in the 
demanding new economy and to share in its benefits.  The evidence 
to date indicates that this strategy is working.  Unemployment is 
now at the lowest rate since 1990.  Since we took office 1.6 
million new jobs have been created, 449,000 last year alone.  Of 
those 449,000 new jobs, 143,000 went to young Canadians and some 
299,000 women found work in 1998, the majority in full time jobs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Tinkering with tax brackets as the opposition proposes will not 
result in numbers like these.  Ensuring more Canadians receive 
the supports they need to help themselves to better jobs and 
better futures will. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe the hon. member for Shefford is truly committed 
to bridging the divide between rich and poor.  I encourage her to 
work with the government to help us as we prepare young children 
to get off to a good start in life and as we prepare Canadians 
for the challenges and opportunities of the 21st century economy. 
I am convinced that together we stand a much better chance of 
helping all Canadians shake off the shackles of poverty.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. René Canuel (Matapédia—Matane, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would 
like to remind my colleague of what is in the Universal 
Declaration of Human Rights, the 50th anniversary of which was 
just celebrated.  It includes the following statement “Everyone 
has the right to a standard of living adequate for the health 
and well-being of himself and of his family, including food, 
clothing, housing and medical care and necessary social 
services”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It seems that this is not the case here in Canada, a country 
said to be very rich.  When children do not get enough to eat, 
when they are not dressed properly because their parents are 
waiting for the last week cheque, I wonder just how motivated 
the government is to help them. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Carolyn Bennett:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am delighted with 
this question in that it is the reason when we are held 
accountable to international standards that we need the kinds of 
national standards that have come part and parcel of our new 
social union negotiation.  It is only when we have strong 
national standards that we will be able to ensure that the 
provinces are not able to let down Canadians in the way I think 
Ontarians feel has happened in the government of Michael Harris. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am delighted that the hon. member understands that when we sit 
on the international stage with the Canadian flag before us that 
we as a federal government need a way to ensure that all 
Canadians are able to achieve their visions and values of this 
country.

</I></B></P><P align=left>When she talks about national standards and caring Canadians why 
did her government abandon social housing in my province of Nova 
Scotia? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Carolyn Bennett:</B>  Mr. Speaker, in this complicated 
federation it is extremely important that when the provinces have 
requested certain programs it is a collaborative effort. 
Now when we realize what happens with social housing, what is 
happening in terms of affordable housing and when we realize that 
there is going to be no way of ensuring food security when some 
people are paying more than 50% of their income on rent, we have 
to look at how we establish national standards.  So it is not a 
matter of who delivers the program.  It is a matter that all 
Canadians feel there is a security that those programs will be 
delivered.

have greatly appreciated having the hon. member for St. Paul's 
provide us with some examples and solutions for eradicating the 
situation we have in Canada at the present time of 1.6 million 
children living in poverty.  We are not talking of figures here, 
we are talking about children.  They are our future.  We should 
stop talking about this and that.  We are told what Mr. Chrétien— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> I must interrupt the hon. member. She is

or riding name, and not by name.

Resources Development has been going on and on about this for 
weeks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like my colleague to come up with some concrete facts 
and examples that will lead to elimination of poverty by around 
the year 2000 in Canada. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Carolyn Bennett:</B>  Mr. Speaker, as of July 1, by merely 
increasing the personal tax exemption, we took 400,000 Canadians 
off the tax rolls.  I think it is extraordinarily important that 
we look at the future in terms of the 3% surtax, which came off 
last year, and understand that those are the simple things that 
the federal government can do in just taxation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The sentinel event I think last week where the provinces agreed 
to the way they will co-operate to make sure that the vision and 
values of this country come to be I think is something we should 
not underestimate.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Stoffer (Sackville—Eastern Shore, NDP):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I will be sharing my time with the hon. member for 
Regina—Qu'Appelle. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First of all I thank the hon. member for Shefford and her party 
for introducing the motion today.  I think it is an extremely 
timely debate with the crisis of this country, although it is not 
a crisis that just happened yesterday, this is an ongoing crisis 
which has been going on for many years. I am glad that today is a 
good day to discuss this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Next week my hon. colleague from Acadie—Bathurst will be 
bringing out his long awaited EI report.  After his travel across 
the country from coast to coast to coast he will be relating the 
report and putting a human face to exactly what this government 
and the previous governments have done to people who are 
collecting EI and exactly what has happened to these people.  He 
will be relating their personal stories for the House of Commons 
for all parliamentarians to have. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If I may digress to a personal experience, my mother and father 
and I were born in Holland.  In 1956 when Holland was discussing 
the closure of the coal mines, and my father was a miner then, my 
mom and dad and six brothers and sisters plus thousands of other 
people in Europe at that time had no other opportunities but to 
abandon not only their homes but their countries and migrate to a 
great country like Canada and other countries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am very proud to say that my mother and father and all my 
brothers and sisters have done very well in Canada in terms of 
the social fabric of this country.  The only unfortunate part is 
I now speak to my mother and father on a regular basis and what 
they see around them is the degenerating of the social fabric of 
this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For over 20 years my mother and father ran a group home for 
various children from across this country who were abandoned or 
abused, neglected or just basically forgotten about. They had 
well over a few hundred children go through their home. It was 
their way of thanking Canada for opening up Canada's doors when 
we needed a place to come and live and survive.

they feel now that Canada is reverting to dog eat dog, forget 
about them society, a user pay, merger monopoly society aided and 
abetted by the provincial and federal governments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A tax program like the GST is not implemented without having 
some detrimental effect on the lowest paid citizen.  To give a 
tax break to citizens start lowering the GST.  That is probably 
the most balanced and fair tax break that every single Canadian 
in the country can be given, especially for those who are the 
lowest paid. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Ravage cuts to EI cannot be introduced without a negative 
effect.  I would like to give a quote of a very famous Canadian 
from February 17, 1993: “By reducing benefits and by imposing 
even higher penalties on those who leave their jobs voluntarily, 
it is clear that the government has little concern for victims of 
the economic crisis. Instead of addressing the underlying cause 
of the problem it attacks the unemployed”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Believe it or not that was a quote by the Prime Minister. If 
that is not a metamorphosis in the Liberal Party I do not know 
what does. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals have abandoned all the principles of the great 
leader Lester Pearson.  They have abandoned all the principles 
and the moral fabric of Mr. Warren Allmand.  They have abandoned 
all it was to be a Liberal in the 60s and 70s.  Their agenda is 
tax breaks for the wealthy and their friends high on the economic 
scale while completely abandoning poverty, those who are homeless 
and those who are disenfranchised in society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I work on the Standing Committee on Fisheries and Oceans.  When 
we had the previous member from Gander—Grand Falls as the chair 
of the committee, we were on extensive tours across the country, 
especially in small isolated coastal communities.  It did not 
take a rocket scientist to understand the problem these people 
were going through. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What the government with those in the corporate sector has done 
is take a common property resource, the fish, and given most of it 
through the ITQ, IQ and EA programs to their friends in the 
corporate sector. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Someone like John Rifley of Clearwater can go from 15 years of 
selling lobsters individually and on a small scale to a grand 
scale.  People will say that is really great but what has 
happened is that Clearwater and also Highliner Foods have managed 
to grab most of the licensing in the scallop sectors for example. 
Literally thousands of people on the east coast and the west 
coast have now been taken out of an economic opportunity in terms 
of their livelihood which is fishing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The same thing is happening to our farmers, especially in the 
prairies.  Back in 1977 there were 110,000 
registered farmers in the province of Saskatchewan.  These were 
family farms.  They were independent and proud people who did not 
want to rely on the handouts of government to put food on their 
tables.  These were people who put food on our tables. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately now in 1999 we are probably down to about 58,000 
registered farmers in Saskatchewan and with the recent crisis in 
the country, by next year we will probably have fewer and fewer 
farmers.  That indicates that instead of being individually run 
and family owned by people who are proud to call themselves 
Canadian who support us and put food on our table, now we are 
going to the corporate sector of farming. We are literally giving 
these farms away because of the policies of the government.  It 
is the same as in the fishing industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I find it absolutely abominable that the government can talk 
about its pride when it comes to the financial record of the 
country when in essence over $20 billion has been taken out of 
the unemployed of the country.  It is proud of that record. It is 
absolutely scandalous when only 35% of people who pay EI can 
actually qualify for it now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last week the government again got its hand caught in the cookie 
jar with a memo that was leaked from HRDC that indicated that if 
HRDC personnel in Prince Edward Island did not cut enough people 
off EI and maintain a certain quota they themselves would be on 
the unemployment line.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Knowing the way this government works, it probably would not 
have been able to collect EI.  This government is absolutely 
hollow when it comes to the concerns of the unemployed, the 
homeless and those who have to rely on shelters and the 
generosity of food banks in order to get by in their daily 
living. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For Canada to have an increase in food banks should send alarms 
right across the Liberal caucus telling them very urgently that 
we have a crisis and a problem in this country. But no, the 
Liberals talk about the 1.3 million jobs they have created.  They 
never ever talk about the thousands and thousands of jobs that 
have been lost in most cases by people with limited education but 
with great vocational skills.  They are proud working people. Now 
they are in their forties and they no longer can look after their 
families. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Recently I was in Sointula, British Columbia.  There was a 
gentleman in his forties with his wife and his three children. 
The man was extremely proud to be living in that community but he 
stood in front of the committee, a group of total strangers, and 
he started weeping.  He no longer knows how to survive.  He no 
longer knows how to look after his family.  And all this 
government does is say it will probably give him a tax break or 
try to look at some sort of program.  All the man ever wanted was 
a job. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Years ago a Cape Breton woman wrote to Prime Minister Mulroney 
saying “Go ahead, threaten me with a full time job”.  I 
encourage every single one of the Liberals and my fellow 
opposition members to go ahead and threaten the unemployed with a 
full time job that pays them a decent salary, that gives them 
proper labour standards, that gives them the opportunity to look 
after their families and live in their communities without being 
forced to abandon their homes like they do in Catalina or Burgeo 
or up in Canso, Nova Scotia.  They literally board up their homes 
and then leave. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The track record of this government is very poor and abysmal. I 
thank the hon. member for Shefford for this opportunity. I know 
the work she does very well with the homeless and impoverished. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is time that the government understood the crisis of what it 
has done.  Not only is it important to pay attention to the 
fiscal problems, but it is also important to talk about the 
social deficit that has been caused by the previous Tory 
government and this current Liberal government. 
<P><A NAME="LINK257"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Tom Wappel (Scarborough Southwest, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I listened carefully to the speech of the hon. member 
from the NDP. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would ask the hon. member to correct me if I am wrong but my 
information is that in 1997 the NDP's document “A Framework for 
Canada's Future” called for the elimination of federal surtaxes 
on low income earners. It is my information that during the 1997 
federal election campaign the NDP leader asked for tax relief for 
low income Canadians. If those things are true, would the hon. 
member agree with me that this Liberal government delivered on 
both of those requests in our respective budgets? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have begun by helping low income Canadians with tax relief 
first. That is why our last budget reduced taxes for 13 million 
Canadians and completely eliminated taxes for 400,000 of the 
poorest taxpayers in the country and also eliminated surtaxes. 
Would the member not agree that we have delivered on many of the 
things that the NDP wants? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Stoffer:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am glad to see that the 
hon. member of the Liberal Party recognizes the pressure and the 
good work the New Democratic Party can put on the Liberals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The problem is that if a tax break is given to the lowest income 
earners and then they are charged user fees on products that they 
obtained before, it does not work.  The private services that 
have been downloaded from the federal government on the health 
care issues would be an example. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What used to be taken care of by the government for these low 
income workers, they now have to pay for.  The government gave 
them back 10 cents but now they are charged $1 for the services 
that they had before. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government did not go all the way with it.  It credited them 
in one hand and debited them in the other, which was most 
unfortunate.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Howard Hilstrom (Selkirk—Interlake, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I certainly agree with the member that cost recovery for 
instance is simply just another tax.  It is affecting many 
sectors but primarily it is affecting agriculture.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The member mentioned agriculture in his speech.  Because of the 
poverty we have on farms I was wondering what solutions the 
member could recommend the Liberal government take to alleviate 
poverty in the agriculture sector.  Does the member have an 
answer for that? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Stoffer:</B>  Mr. Speaker, there is one thing the 
government can definitely do.  The government could work closely 
with the farmers to find out about the Crow rate.  We cannot take 
$200 million off the Crow rate and expect the farmers to be able 
to pick that up.  We cannot abandon grain elevators in a lot of 
the communities and expect the farmers to drive an additional 100 
miles with their product and still keep it at the same price. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Selkirk—Interlake knows very well that farmers 
are the breadbasket of our country.  If we cannot look after them 
and their families so that they in turn can look after us, we 
have a very serious problem.  I think this government has 
completely abandoned farmers in terms of the agriculture crisis 
that is happening with the pork farmers and the wheat farmers. 
We negotiate trade deals that do absolutely no good for the 
farmers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is time we sat down and talked to the farmers to find out 
exactly what their concerns are instead of telling them from 
Ottawa what they should be doing.

of the solution?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lorne Nystrom (Regina—Qu'Appelle, NDP):</B> Mr. Speaker, I wish 
to congratulate the hon. member for Shefford for asking that 
there be a debate on poverty in the House. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The whole issue of poverty is becoming more and more prevalent 
as we look around this country.  Just yesterday on Parliament 
Hill there were hundreds of homeless people who had come here 
from the Ottawa area, the Montreal area, the Toronto area and 
other parts of this country to demonstrate the need for some real 
help. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was thinking about this speech this morning and I came across 
a very interesting statistic.  In the last while the gap between 
the rich and the poor has been widening in this country and in 
much of the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I was first elected in 1968 I was very proud of the 
progress being made in our country with the implementation of 
medicare and social programs toward the narrowing of the gap 
between the rich and the poor. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remember you, Mr. Speaker, when you were member for Kingston 
and the Islands, an ordinary member of the House, making a 
statement in the House that we had virtually eliminated poverty 
among senior citizens in this country because of the Canada 
pension plan, the old age pension and the supplement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then somewhere around 10 years ago we started going in the other 
direction and the gap between the rich and the poor began to 
widen.  If we look around the world, we are now in the midst of 
creating through this technological revolution and the Bill Gates 
and so on, a class of the super wealthy and also a class of people 
who are getting poorer and poorer all the time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I came across an interesting statistic this morning which said 
that the 358 wealthiest people in the world—and I suppose that 
includes none of us in this chamber—have more wealth than the 
income of the 45% poorest people in the world, or 2.3 billion 
people put together.  This is a startling statistic.  Two 
billion, three hundred million people have less income than the 
wealth of the 358 wealthiest people in the world. I am sure you 
are not one of those people, Mr. Speaker, but they are people 
like Bill Gates and probably people like Conrad Black. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can see the hon. member of the Reform Party shaking his head 
over there.  I know a while back they called for a tax break for 
Conrad Black and some of these wealthy people and it strikes me 
as very puzzling that they would do that.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That gap is widening in this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also remember when Ed Broadbent was retiring as the leader of 
the New Democratic Party of Canada.  In December 1989 he moved a 
motion in the House of Commons that was supported unanimously by 
all members of the House and all political parties including the 
then Prime Minister Brian Mulroney. The motion said that we are 
going to set as a goal the elimination of child poverty in this 
country by the year 2000, that in 11 years we are going to 
eliminate child poverty in this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What has happened?  Child poverty has not been eliminated.  In 
fact, there is more child poverty now than there was 11 years 
ago.  More kids are going hungry. There are about three times as 
many food banks now as there were 11 years ago.  There are more 
kids out there with fewer opportunities.  There are more homeless 
people with fewer opportunities.  There is more sadness and 
dispossession out there now than there was 11 years ago. We have 
to ask why.  There are three or four reasons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, we have poor kids because we have poor parents.  We have 
poor parents because for all too long this country has had a very 
high unemployment rate.  It has gone down recently, but it is 
still very high at 7.8%.  For many years and many, many months we 
had an unemployment rate of over 10%, month after month after 
month.  Because of that we have driven more and more people into 
poverty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, even with the creation of more jobs, the average income 
in real terms for most Canadians now is lower than it was in 1989 
when that laudable objective of eliminating child poverty was set 
by the House of Commons.  It is lower because there are more and 
more part time jobs, more and more low wage jobs and more and 
more jobs with fewer and fewer benefits for Canadians.  Because 
of the belt tightening in this country, for all but the very 
rich, incomes have actually gone backward instead of ahead. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why there is more poverty now than 11 years ago. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is an issue we are going to have to tackle. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yesterday I talked with a former prime minister. I do not want 
to use his name, but he told me that he was surprised at the 
anger that he saw among people demonstrating yesterday compared 
to five or ten years ago.  That is true. More and more people are 
getting the short end of the stick in terms of economic fairness 
and justice in this country.  It is because of years of high 
unemployment. It is because even though there are more jobs now, 
they are low wage jobs, part time jobs, fewer benefits and fewer 
opportunities. Those are two reasons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another reason, and I think members of the Liberal Party have to 
hang their heads in shame on this one, is the cutback of some $6 
billion in transfers to the provinces, primarily for health care 
but also for education and social programs. Turn on the 
newscasts. What is happening in every province? What is happening 
in Montreal, Toronto, Vancouver, Regina, Halifax, wherever we go? 
There are waiting lists in emergency rooms and hospitals are 
being closed.  People are waiting in every province primarily 
because the federal government has cut back by $6 billion in the 
funding of social programs in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can go back to the sixties and people of that day like Lester 
Pearson, Tommy Douglas, Stanley Knowles, Bob Stanfield, when this 
country had the foundation of national medical care.  At that 
time the federal government funded 50% of medical care.  What is 
it today in some provinces?  It is 12% or 13%. Put up a dollar 
and only 12 or 13 cents is paid by the federal government.  It 
used to be 50%. We have gone backward. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reason for poverty is that the federal Minister of Finance 
in February 1995 cut back by $6 billion and it is no wonder 
members in the Liberal Party hang their heads in shame over this 
massive cutback, a bigger cutback than any Conservative 
government ever made in terms of social programs. Yet some 
Liberals like to think that they are really progressing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know that you agree with me, Mr. Speaker, because you are a 
very progressive Liberal from the Kingston and the Islands 
constituency. I do not know why I always commend you so much but 
you are a very progressive man.  Perhaps that is why you occupy 
the chair.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally we have the issue of taxes.  The Reform Party might 
think it has a monopoly on talking about taxes in this country. 
The important thing when it comes to taxes is that we need tax 
fairness and a cut in taxes for the poorest people of this 
country.  They need the money, they will spend the money and they 
will stimulate the economy in doing so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1986 this parliament passed a bill to end the indexation of 
income taxes.  That has put more and more people in the tax 
brackets.  It has meant that the poorer people are paying more 
and more taxes all the time.  We have also had the partial 
deindexation of the child tax credit and the GST tax credit for 
poorer people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If it wants to do something about poverty, in the budget next 
Tuesday the government should end bracket creep for low income 
people and it should index the taxation system for low income 
people. There should be a fully indexed taxation system for the 
GST tax credit and for the child tax credit.  I agree with my 
friend from Nova Scotia that we should have a 1% cut in the GST 
right across the board. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those are some of the things we could do.  I would like to see 
Liberal members opposite stand in the House of Commons and speak 
out on the issue of poverty.  There is a minister of the crown 
about to take his place in the front row, the minister of 
fisheries.  I am sure that he too was scandalized by the Minister 
of Finance in February 1995 when he cut social programs by $6 
billion, throwing more and more people in this country into 
poverty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The time has come for Liberal backbenchers to speak their piece 
and say how they feel about restoring funding to social programs. 
We should have a fair taxation system in this country.  We should 
make sure that we fight for full time, meaningful and well paying 
jobs.  That is the way to end poverty.  We have gone backwards. 
The gap between the rich and the poor is widening, which is why 
this debate today is extremely important. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Once again, I thank the Conservative member for Shefford for her 
motion.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Marlene Catterall (Ottawa West—Nepean, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, it seems that by suggesting this government has done 
things wrong the member is suggesting that an NDP government 
would do things better and correctly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He tried to blame difficulties in the health care system on 
federal cuts to health care spending.  However, there is an NDP 
government that he knows very well.  Hospitals were being closed 
in Saskatchewan by an NDP premier long before the federal 
government, under the Liberals, started taking responsibility for 
the deficit and getting it under control.  One of the areas in 
which we did that was in reducing transfers to the provinces for 
health care, which we have since started to augment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Did Premier Romanow of Saskatchewan, as an NDP premier, not 
close hospitals long before there was any decrease in federal 
funding? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lorne Nystrom:</B>  Mr. Speaker, if the member was 
listening, I said that we have had problems in every single 
province, including the province of Saskatchewan.  I made that 
very clear.  I also said that the biggest single cutback in the 
country was the $6 billion cutback made by the federal 
government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member should also know that Saskatchewan was the only 
province, if not one of only two or three provinces, which 
backfilled the cutback dollar for dollar.  There was no cutback 
in the province of Saskatchewan in terms of health care funding. 
Every single dollar was backfilled by the provincial government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The premier of her province did not do that.  She defends her 
premier as a great and wonderful man, but that did not happen in 
the province of Ontario.  Premier Romanow did that and that is 
one of the reasons he is one of the most popular premiers in this 
country.  Can she say that about her premier?  I doubt if she 
can.

of all, I wish to thank the hon. member for Shefford for putting 
this motion before the House, in spite of the fact that my party 
is somewhat uneasy with its possible financial implications. 
Still, her concern is a very healthy one. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to ask my hon. colleague from the NDP if he agrees 
that, looking back on the last 60 years, it would be difficult 
to find a government as heartless, unfair, incompetent and 
stupid in the management of antipoverty efforts as the one 
opposite. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a rather unique case of a government that is not only 
facing particular conditions but also making people poorer 
though its fiscal policies. Does my colleague agree that the 
best thing that could happen to the poor in this country would 
be for this government to be defeated? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lorne Nystrom:</B> Mr. Speaker, I agree with most of what my 
friend, the hon. member for Hochelaga—Maisonneuve, said. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would not go as far as to say that the government is stupid, 
but I do agree that it is not fair. Never in the history of 
Canada have I heard of a government making a $6 billion cut to 
social programs. That is not fair. It has been very hard on 
thousands of Canadians. This government is more conservative 
than the Conservatives are. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not fair to cut $6 billion. It is the doing of the current

has realized that we have to have a sound financial base”.  He 
went on to say “You can't do anything for people unless you have

Government of Saskatchewan under Roy Romanow. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The legacy of the Saskatchewan CCF and NDP has been that of 
governments which have always had balanced budgets, contrary to 
my Conservative friend and those who sit in the Reform Party.  In

Conservatives.  They ran up the biggest deficit in the history of

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Steve Mahoney (Mississauga West, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I am pleased to address this motion today, put clearly by a party 
in search of an identity, in search of policies, in search of 
anything.  It has been searching for a leader and I think it is 
still looking for him.  I saw him coming through the gallery 
earlier today, or maybe it was a look-alike. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It would appear that having gone through the metamorphosis of 
being in government under Brian Mulroney, having led this country 
into record deficits, massive debts and doing nothing whatsoever 
for poor people in the country, it is now on a policy hunt, so it 
put forward a motion which I would have thought would have come 
from the NDP. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is interesting to hear the New Democrats, particularly the 
previous speaker, defend the government of Mr. Romanow.  We 
should give credit where credit is due.  Mr. Romanow balanced the 
provincial budget.  It is too bad that Mr. Rae in Ontario did not 
go to the same school as Mr. Romanow.  That was a New Democratic 
government, leading by its adopted principles, which 
intentionally ran up deficits of $10 billion every year.  It kept 
piling up the debt and left the once strong and healthy province 
of Ontario, arguably one of the engines of economic growth in 
this country, over $100 billion in debt.

</I></B></P><P align=left>To hear the New Democrats in debate on a Conservative motion on 
poverty cite an example of great economic leadership by a New 
Democratic government is really rather ironic.  To try to pretend 
that they have the answers on how to run the ship of state 
financially is really quite laughable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to focus on the Conservative motion which is before us. 
The solution, the solution du jour we might call it, the solution 
of the moment, seems to be that the way to help poor people in 
this country is to cut taxes.  It really is an interesting 
notion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At least members of the Reform Party are upfront.  They would 
cut taxes and have a flat rate right across the land.  They think 
that in some miraculous way that will trickle down and solve 
poverty.  The rich will get richer and somehow, according to the 
Reform Party's mentality, that will help the poor.  We know that 
is not the case. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the case of the Conservative Party, it is suggesting in the 
motion that we increase the basic income tax credit, index the 
tax brackets and index the child tax benefit.  Most of the people 
who are truly poor in this country do not pay taxes in the first 
place.  Even Homer Simpson would understand that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am at a loss to understand how this party in this motion could 
try to perpetrate the fraud upon the people in this place and the 
people of Canada that the solution is simply to reduce taxes and 
that will make poverty disappear. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That party could have made some constructive suggestions.  It 
could have recognized, as we all do, that we have a void in the 
provision of social housing.  We have a responsibility, and I am 
hopeful that our government will work with provincial governments 
and municipal governments to put in place some serious housing 
programs, which I know will be opposed by Reform.  That is a 
given.  Anything that is in any way constructive, that in any way 
would deal with social policy, will be opposed.  We know we will 
have that battle. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the Conservatives really want to find a new identity and do 
something to help solve poverty in this country they should 
recognize what their leader recognized yesterday.  I dare say, he 
was assaulted, insulted and might have been attacked if it were 
not for the RCMP intervening.  The new leader of the Conservative 
Party found out yesterday that popping in for a photo op might 
not be the smartest thing to do when one has an angry mob on 
one's hands. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What did they say?  I will not use the words.  I heard them on 
CPAC.  They are not for family hour viewing, so I will not repeat 
them.  In any event, expletives were hurled in the face of former 
Prime Minister Clark.  There was also a Reform member who tried 
to get a photo op with all of these folks, thinking that by 
snuggling in and cuddling up and being warm and friendly these 
folks would realize that Reformers are really not the big, bad 
right wingers from the west.  The Conservative leader might have 
realized that this was an opportunity to forge some kind of 
coalition or position or relationship with these folks.  They got 
a very blunt message.

would stand here and say: “That was then and this is now.  We 
have changed”.

I appreciate we hear rumblings that might occur.  Why not put 
forward some positive resolutions to deal with housing?  They 
must have the ability to contact the premier of Ontario.  He 
might return their phone calls.  I am not sure he would return 
mine.  They could contact him and say “Why have you gutted the 
housing programs and passed everything on to the municipalities? 
Why do we not work together to try to come up with a national 
housing strategy?” 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If they put that forward in this place they might find that 
there is not quite the criticism or the cynicism that exists when 
we see this motherhood and apple pie in their trying to wrap

suggestion.

The Prime Minister, the health minister and the finance minister

substantial investment in health care, in medicare, in taking 
care of sick Canadians.  Recently an accord was signed, 
interestingly enough, by all 10 premiers including the Premier of 
Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Lest I be accused of neglecting the Bloc, let me refer to a 
comment made by one of its members who said that the best thing 
that could happen to the country would be for the government to 
be defeated.  The best thing that could happen to the country 
would be for a strong, united country working together to solve 
poverty.  The only way that could happen would be if we were able 
to witness the historical demise of the Bloc. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would that not be a lovely day for Canada?  Then we could have 
motions and debates that could rebuild this great country, build 
on Confederation, deal with health care, deal with balancing 
budgets, paying down our debt, reducing taxes and building 
housing for the poor.  These are things the government cares 
about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We do not talk in rhetoric.  We talk in action.  They will see 
more of it on Tuesday when the new budget comes down.  They will 
continue to see the kind of leadership Canadians have come to 
expect from the government over the balance of the mandate of 
this term.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Diane St-Jacques (Shefford, PC):</B> Mr. Speaker, I want to tell 
the hon. member opposite that I thought he would express more 
compassion toward the poor. Poverty is an issue that concerns 
everyone. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Earlier, criticisms were leveled at all the parties that try to 
find solutions. As regards Mr. Clark, he at least had the 
courage to meet those who were outside yesterday, unlike the 
member's leader, who was nowhere to be seen. Mr. Clark showed 
courage and we went with him. Some people were pleased to see us 
and others were not, but one must face the music. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In his speech, the hon. member even gave the impression that he 
finds poverty funny. I guess he is not concerned by this issue. 
Perhaps there is no poverty in his riding. I would like to hear 
his suggestions, because this debate is about finding concrete 
solutions. Let us stop talking and start finding solutions to 
help the poor. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Steve Mahoney:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the member for Shefford 
is perhaps a minor exception to some of my criticism.   In fact, 
in September 1997 the member moved a motion that was debated on 
November 19 which read: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That, in the opinion of this House, the government should review 
the level at which the child benefit is indexed.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>She has at least shown some sympathy prior to this debate for 
the issue of child poverty.  I give her recognition and credit 
for that as perhaps being a small beacon of light in a party that 
searches for an identity.  Perhaps it should have made her the 
leader instead of Mr. Clark. 
<P><A NAME="LINK266"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lorne Nystrom (Regina—Qu'Appelle, NDP):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, in February 1995 the federal government cut back 
spending on social programs and transfers to the provinces by $6 
billion, most of it for health care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is the member, who at least had a very progressive past, ashamed 
his government did that?  Did he stand in caucus and fight 
against that measure? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Steve Mahoney:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am not sure I got the 
date.  Was it 1995 he was referring to? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lorne Nystrom:</B>  Yes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Steve Mahoney:</B>  I was not in caucus to be able to 
stand and do anything.  In 1995 I was recovering from a rather 
sudden career change, leaving politics for a couple of years due 
to health and fatigue reasons.  The voters were sick and tired of 
me, I am sorry to say.  I was out for a couple of years, only to 
recover and come back and have the great honour of serving in 
this government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me say in direct response to the member that there are tough 
decisions which need to be made in government.  To inherit a 
government as this government did in 1993 with a $42 billion 
deficit, it has to look at what is in the cupboard and what it 
can afford. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The courageous actions of the Canadian people, supported by the 
policies of the government, have led us to the time today where 
our economy has never been stronger. 
<P><A NAME="LINK267"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Eric Lowther (Calgary Centre, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it 
is a shame the hon. member across the way has such a gift of 
presentation.  He is a powerful orator but he lacks so much in 
substance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I follow on the comments of another hon. member.  This member 
was telling us in the Reform Party that when it comes to social 
programs we are not there.  Yet I remind him again about the $6 
billion cut in social transfers.  I was in the House when his 
party voted against compensating some of the hepatitis C victims. 
If we are talking about social conscience I would like to see him 
demonstrate it in a number of those areas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, I will point out some of the expenditures that 
party is concerned about that I would rather see go to those 
truly in need.  For example, there was a $1.3 million study for 
the development of better bananas in Honduras. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is that what he sees as a priority for the government?  That is 
where it is spending dollars that could go to people who have 
legitimate needs in this country.  I ask him to add a lot more 
substance to his comments to match his ability at presentation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Steve Mahoney:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I will take that as a 
compliment, I think.  I will give some substance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform Party has been against the child tax benefit.  It 
voted against the government when it increased funding for the 
community action program for children.  It voted against the 
government when it increased funding for prenatal nutrition 
programs.  It fundamentally opposed any expenditure increase 
initiative to assist with child care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can provide substance all day long about the position of the 
Reform Party.  The Canadian people know they could never trust 
the Reform Party to care about children.  They could never trust 
the Reform Party to care about the poor.  They could simply never 
trust the Reform Party. 
<P><A NAME="LINK268"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Marlene Catterall (Ottawa West—Nepean, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, there is a benefit to having sat through a Conservative 
government as an opposition member and watching what the 
Conservatives did and then watching them bring forward a motion 
like this one.  For the five years I listened to Tory budgets in 
which they increased the deficit, increased interest payments and 
reduced the capacity of the Government of Canada to invest in 
Canadians, to invest in dealing with issues such as poverty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me tell the House what they did on the issues brought 
forward in the motion.  The motion says the government should 
increase the basic income tax credit to $10,000. 
It was a Conservative government that deindexed the tax brackets 
and therefore allowed more and more Canadians to become taxable 
at very low income levels.  They suggest we should index the tax 
brackets.  It was a Conservative government that deindexed the 
tax brackets and therefore created a heavier burden on Canadians 
as time went on.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I find it a little ironic to be debating with a Conservative 
member a motion to undo those measures which the government of 
the party she represents put in place.  That is what she is 
asking us to do.  I guess that is the luxury of moving from 
government to opposition and being able to forget the actions of 
one's government when it was in a position to take some positive 
measures instead of the negative measures which the member now 
wants us to undo. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By contrast, let me tell members of some of the things of which 
I am proud that our government has done.  Last year's budget was 
the first time we have had the opportunity and the luxury of 
looking at reinvesting.  We chose to use some of the benefit of 
our first surplus to deal with very low income Canadians.  I 
applaud that.  I think that should be our priority. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We chose to increase the basic exemption from any income tax. 
That was a modest increase, but it took 400,000 very low income 
Canadians totally off the tax rolls.  It reduced taxes for 
millions of more Canadians.  We also took off the 3% surtax but 
not for everybody.  We took it off for very modest income 
Canadians and left it on for higher income Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think those are the right priorities.  We should leave the 
most money we can in the hands of those in the country who have 
the least.  It also makes economic good sense because those 
people who have the least spend what they do have on essential 
goods and services.  If they have a bit of additional money it 
gets spent on essential goods and services produced by other 
Canadians and it helps substantially in our efforts to further 
reduce unemployment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Despite the constraints of the last few years we also initiated 
the first new national social program in a long time, the child 
tax benefit, with an expenditure of close to $2 billion.  We know 
that has to increase.  We know it has to go up and it will as 
fiscal resources are available.  It was a very important 
initiative that will help every child across the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What does the Conservative member want us to do?  She wants us 
to increase the basic income tax credit to $10,000.  That would 
help a lot more low income Canadians.  I hope we are able to do 
more in that direction in the budget that is coming out next 
week.  It also reduces taxable income for somebody making 
$100,000, $150,000 and $300,000.  Guess who benefits most from 
that reduction?  It is not the lowest income Canadian who pays 
tax at a low rate but the highest income Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are not prepared to do that.  If the Minister of Finance is 
listening, I would certainly hope that giving greater tax relief 
to high income Canadians than to low income Canadians is not 
something that will be in his budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I really do not want to talk partisan politics but I think we 
are heading in the right direction.  The whole issue of poverty 
is too important to leave superficially with the issues brought 
forward in the motion.  Health care needs more money.  We have to 
look at that in the budget.  There is no secret about that.  It 
needs different approaches as well. This is an extremely 
important issue for low income Canadians.

<A HREF="#LINKT81"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Poverty and health are inextricably linked.  We know that poor 
children are much more likely to become seriously ill.  So it is 
important that we do the kinds of things in health care such as 
the community action program for children's health, the prenatal 
nutrition program and other investments in our young children to 
ensure they will get a healthy start in life and remain healthy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important for us to support the health and service centres 
which link social problems with health problems and which deal 
with the whole family and the whole health of the community so 
our children do have a better chance to grow up strong and 
healthy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Money is important.  A good friend said a long time ago “when 
the problem is poverty I cannot think of anything better to throw 
at it than money”.  However, there are other things we have to 
do.  Our investments in health care and education are extremely 
important. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the things I am currently concerned about is young 
children growing up in poverty who are entering school without 
any access to the technology that their better-off peers will 
have as soon as they get into kindergarten.  Our government has 
done a number of things to make sure that every child has access 
to those skills of learning, which are now basic skills of 
learning in our schools, so that one barrier between well off and 
poorer children is eliminated or at least alleviated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are so many other issues involved in poverty.  While this 
motion would have us give tax breaks to poorer people, and I hope 
we will do that, it also gives tax breaks to very wealthy people. 
It ignores completely the need to also invest in other areas of 
our society and our economy to alleviate the problems of poverty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I represent a lot of poor families and a lot of them would not 
be helped one bit by this motion.  The motion is aimed at working 
Canadians not women who are living on extremely low incomes of 
social assistance.  The attitude and emotion about people 
becoming self-reliant and self-sufficient ignores totally the 
fact that those women with two or three children are also working 
parents.  The only difference is they do not get paid for it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I find the motion narrow.  It would deliver more tax relief to 
well off Canadians than to those who most need it.  I also find 
it ignores the need to balance tax relief against the other areas 
that we need to invest in.  If we truly want to help those who 
have been hurt most by hard economic times and by, I will admit, 
decisions of governments, we need a supportive society and a 
budget and programs that help them to deal with their situation 
and create for all of us a healthier society. 
<P><A NAME="LINK269"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Stoffer (Sackville—Eastern Shore, NDP):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I have a very quick question for my hon. colleague from 
Ottawa. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would she not say that one of those reinvestment programs that 
she is suggesting for the future should have been and always 
should have been a national housing program from coast to coast 
to coast and not leave it to the provinces to look after, as one 
of her previous members has stated? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The abandonment of a national housing policy by the federal 
government is one of the major causes as to why we have such 
homelessness in this country.  The government says it was for 
fiscal restraint.  However, in my province of Nova Scotia that 
has caused tremendous hardship for an awful lot of people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would the member not agree that would be a great reinvestment to 
start on Tuesday with the budget? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Marlene Catterall:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I would not presume 
to second guess what might or might not be in the budget on 
Tuesday afternoon.  I will be here waiting with bated breath as 
will my colleagues opposite.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the former chair of the executive committee of a municipal 
non-profit housing corporation, I very much appreciate the value 
of social housing across this country.  I am very well aware of 
the billions of dollars that the federal government continues to 
invest in social housing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am also very well aware that we reinvested significantly in 
the RRAP which allows people on very low incomes to improve their 
housing situation.  There is no question right now we are all 
extremely concerned about this. I am counting on the federal 
government to take a major role in alleviating that. 
<P><A NAME="LINK270"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Herron (Fundy—Royal, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, some of 
the comments my hon. colleague made during her speech I found to 
be somewhat inflammatory and almost offensive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What this member was trying to convey was that since we are the 
government, we have the luxury of being there right now, that 
everything is good in our economy and that everything that has 
gone wrong in the past is the Tories' fault. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the reasons we have the growth in the last number of 
years is that we have an export driven economy compliments of 
free trade in the 1988 election.  I think she might remember that 
election because those members actually opposed free trade. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, the government likes to take a lot of credit for all the 
jobs it created.  Two-thirds of the jobs created in this country 
were created in Ontario by the government of Mike Harris. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Marlene Catterall:</B>  Mr. Speaker, if the member 
opposite knows anything at all about trade, he knows that the 
major benefits we have in trade right now are due to a dollar 
that slipped from 87 cents to 67 cents on the dollar and are not 
due to any trade agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to be careful.  Let me also point out to the member that 
if he wants to give credit to Mike Harris for improving 
employment in the province of Ontario, I would really like him to 
point out to me how that was done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know what the Liberal federal government has done.  It has had 
results in every province right across the country.  I find it 
very hard to credit the Conservative government in Ontario for 
benefits of federal programs that are being felt right across 
this country fairly evenly.  Mr. Harris really cannot take credit 
for that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not interested, nor have I ever been, in politics in 
casting blame on one place or the other.  I think we have the 
situation we find when we get elected to government and it is our 
responsibility to address it in the best way we can. 
<P><A NAME="LINK271"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Howard Hilstrom (Selkirk—Interlake, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, over the past 100 years there have been a number of 
programs and efforts to address poverty and homelessness.  That 
has not worked out.  We would not see it today if it was gone. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member opposite has a small problem in Canada with 600,000 
people, a very clear responsibility of the government to 600,000 
people.  How come government policies of both the Liberals and 
Conservatives over the last 100 years have not at least been able 
to provide housing for our aboriginal people, a lot of whom are 
poor. Where is the plan for that? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Marlene Catterall:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I do not want to 
speak specifically on this.  There are other members in this 
House who are far more familiar than I am with that but the 
member is very well aware of initiatives in that area by this 
government. 
<P><A NAME="LINK272"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Herron (Fundy—Royal, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to have the opportunity to speak to today's motion.  I am 
very pleased that our caucus has actually taken the initiative to 
select this very important subject that affects all Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Throughout the day we heard a number of different statistics 
with respect to the number of individuals who actually live in 
poverty. One in five children lives in some form of poverty. 
December 10 represented the 50th anniversary of the declaration 
of human rights which was written by a former constituent in my 
riding of Fundy—Royal, John Peters Humphrey, who comes from the 
town next to mine. I consider Canada to be one of the most gifted 
and affluent countries in the world.  Having citizens in any form 
of poverty in a country with the resources and wealth we have I 
consider a national shame. Given the resources and the 
capabilities we have we need to do more for people who live in 
the margins of our society, give them that hand up so they can 
live with the dignity they clearly deserve.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Poverty is much more than just a lack of money.  It affects 
children's health, education, welfare and general well-being. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remember during the election campaign of 1997 there was one 
day toward the end of the campaign when I campaigned just outside 
of Havelock, New Brunswick. I might from time to time think of 
myself as an idealistic person. I am someone who considers 
himself to be a fiscal conservative who believes in certain 
ideals and certain doctrines. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remember campaigning at one door which will leave a memory 
with me for many years.  I think it will help to shape some of my 
politics.  I was there talking about some of the things I thought 
we could do in order to grow our economy.  After the conversation 
at that door the constituent said to me “I like what you have to 
say, but the thing which actually affects me most today is 
whether I have bread in my cupboard or milk in my fridge”.  In 
this forum that is a very difficult situation for us to imagine. 
Poverty exists in every riding in this country. It affects way 
too many people in a society of this nature. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my riding there are some initiatives which I would like to 
take this opportunity to point out.  It is what has been done on 
a community basis in order to address the physical needs of some 
of the poor, individuals living in poverty.  I would like to 
salute the Sussex Sharing Club, the Lakewood HeadStart 
Association, the Kennebecasis Valley Food Basket, Chipman 
Community Care, Minto Community Resource Centre and the Hampton 
Food Basket. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also know there are a number of initiatives that are done from 
a church level and a community level as well.  I can look at a 
church in my nearby region, the United Church in Hampton and 
Reverend Stephen Mills, in terms of some of the initiatives that 
we have done for our local community. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This issue touches us on a more macro basis as well.  Given the 
non-partisan nature of the subject of poverty and the desire of 
the Progressive Conservative Party, in fact all parties in the 
House, to address poverty, I ask for the unanimous consent of the 
House to continue this debate until midnight. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B>  Is there unanimous 
consent? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Agreed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  No. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Herron:</B>  Madam Speaker, the reason I asked that 
is in the few hours we have had here today I think all 
parliamentarians would like to have some constructive time to 
continue to discuss this issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The deputy whip made the comment that lowering taxes would be a 
bad thing for the poor. I am not exactly sure what she was trying 
to say. 
It makes no sense to tax low income Canadians, people who 
actually make very little money.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the initiatives we are speaking about today is raising 
the personal exemption from around $7,000 to $10,000.  That one 
initiative alone would take two million Canadians off the tax 
rolls overnight.  Those are two million Canadians who simply 
should not have been there in the first place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I think of public policy and taxation rates I look at them 
from this standpoint.  Many people believe, depending on where 
they live in the country, that the poverty line is around 
$21,000.  If that were true we would be saying as a society that 
it is okay to tax individuals who make $14,000 less than the 
poverty line.  I just do not think that is acceptable in any way, 
shape or form. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are also focusing on another sector within society, the 
working poor.  Those individuals get up every day, work hard and 
are very proud, but every day they keep working they find 
themselves falling further and further behind.  One reason for 
that is that it has been far too long since our income tax 
brackets have been indexed for inflation.  Some individuals may 
be making a bit more money from time to time but are actually 
taking home less money.  Those are the persons who really need 
tax relief. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In order to grow our economy the Progressive Conservative Party 
is advocating providing Canadians with broad based tax relief but 
primarily concentrating on lower and middle income Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are looking at indexing the child tax benefit.  In the fall 
of 1997 the member for Shefford was successful in having a motion 
passed in the House with respect to that issue.  That shows her 
commitment to children and to citizens who actually live in 
poverty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The issue of poverty affects a vast number of Canadians. 
Canadians are becoming more and more sensitized to the issue. 
They are now seeing that we have turned the corner with respect 
to our fiscal house as a nation and at the provincial level in 
some cases, for example with the record growth we are now seeing 
in Ontario.  We are at a state where we have a balanced budget 
which is a good thing for all Canadians regardless of on what 
side of the House members sit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What I mean by saying that Canadians are becoming more 
sensitized is that they want us to address these issues.  In a 
country as wealthy and innovative as ours we need to ensure that 
all Canadians live with a decent level of income so they can have 
decent shelter and food and their children who go to school can 
have a healthier diet and function in school.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Eric Lowther (Calgary Centre, Ref.):</B>  Madam Speaker, 
those were interesting comments from the member.  I concur with 
much of what he said.  One key issue of concern to me and to many 
members of my party is the efficient use of tax dollars.  Nowhere 
today have we actually touched on that too much.  We have talked 
a lot about poverty and compassion for the less fortunate which 
are good things for sure.  I am concerned about whether we are 
efficiently using tax dollars to meet the needs of those who are 
less fortunate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am looking at some of the current expenditures of the Liberal 
government.  What is the member's position on some of these 
expenditures?  Could some of this money be better redirected to 
those with legitimate needs?  For example, the current Liberal 
government has spent money on some studies. 
On a study of feasting and the origin of inequality $75,000 was 
spent.  On a study of women's dress in the 19th century in 
Istanbul $28,000 was spent.  Also there was one for $1.2 million 
to General Electric Canada which is a large corporation.

fortunate?  What is the hon. member's opinion on that? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Herron:</B>  Madam Speaker, the hon. member 
highlighted a couple of examples in his question.  Clearly there 
are some places within government spending where some better 
choices with the public purse can actually be made.  I do not 
think some of the initiatives he just mentioned would be very 
high up on my priority list, to say the least. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would not want to make a comment that we are spending enough 
money on the poor and probably do not need to do too much.  We 
have to be able to challenge ourselves to ensure that we are 
getting the best bang for our buck with respect to our social 
programs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I still think there needs to be a governmental role, whether 
that be provincial or federal, to address those needs.

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>ALLOTTED DAY—POVERTY IN CANADA 
</H4><P align=left>

</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed consideration of the motion and of the 
amendment. 
<P><A NAME="LINK283"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Scott Brison (Kings—Hants, PC):</B>  Madam Speaker, it is 
with pleasure today that I rise to speak to this very important 
opposition day motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The issue of poverty is one that touches each and every one of 
us as members of parliament, as parliamentarians and as 
Canadians.  One of the things we value and on which we pride 
ourselves in Canada is equality of opportunity, not necessarily 
quality of outcome which cannot be guaranteed by government. 
There is no area of government that is more important if we are 
serious about dealing with equality of opportunity than to ensure 
that children in Canada are not living in poverty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One in five children is living in poverty.  The government likes 
to say the fundamentals are strong.  That is one of the 
fundamentals, that one in five children are living in poverty. 
That is absolutely atrocious.  It is unacceptable in a country 
like Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The personal debt rates in Canada are an unprecedented high. 
Personal bankruptcy last year set record highs.  We have never 
had as many people declare bankruptcy as have declared bankruptcy 
last year.  Personal disposable income has dropped 7% over the 
past six years.

<A HREF="#LINKT86"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>John Kenneth Galbraith, an ex-patriate Canadian economist, once 
said beware of governments who say their fundamentals are strong. 
That is extremely appropriate for the government.  Despite its 
assertions, its fundamentals are not strong for the average 
Canadian and most egregiously for the poorest of Canadians who 
are not doing well under the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the most regressive and pernicious taxes on the poor in 
Canada is EI premiums.  The EI premiums are the most regressive 
form of taxation that we now have in Canada.  Someone making 
$39,000 per year is paying the same amount of EI premiums as 
someone who is making $300,000 per year.  Yet when a lower income 
Canadian needs employment insurance less than 35% are now 
qualifying.  This is scandalous.  The government is effectively 
doing the reverse Robin Hood theory.  It is taking from the poor 
and redistributing to everybody else.  This is absolutely, 
fundamentally unfair. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our party believes that equity for all Canadians, starting with 
the poorest of Canadians, is more important than padding the 
books of the federal government.  We believe that a Canadian 
making less than $10,000 should not be paying income tax.  We 
believe very strongly in those principles. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The issue of equity and the issue of doing the right thing are 
only possible when governments have economic growth to make it 
happen.  I do not have to remind anybody in the House, 
particularly not the Liberals who at one time opposed these 
initiatives, that the fundamental structural changes made by the 
previous PC government, including free trade, the elimination of 
the counterproductive manufacturers sales tax, the deregulation 
of the financial services industries, the transportation sector 
and energy, were the cornerstones that provided any opportunity 
for economic growth to eliminate the deficit over the past 
several years.  It was those basic changes that provided the 
strength for the Canadian economy to grow today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A Conservative government, having recognized the need for those 
changes then, implemented them.  The Conservative government had 
a vision for Canada that would provide economic growth and 
opportunity to all Canadians.  We did not anticipate that there 
would be a government in Canada which would take advantage of the 
changes it previously opposed when it was politically convenient. 
It took that money and failed to deliver the equity to Canadians 
that we value as a cornerstone of Canadian social policy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members opposite have argued today that increasing the basic 
personal exemption would not be a good idea.  Then I heard a 
member make the ludicrous argument that increasing it by $500 was 
a good idea because it would take 400,000 Canadians off the tax 
rolls, but increasing it to $10,000 which would eliminate two 
million people from the tax rolls was a bad idea.  I would have 
thought the logical corollary of his argument would have been 
that if we further increased the basic personal exemption to 
$10,000 it would be even better.  Somehow this is Liberal 
economic logic or lack thereof. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am very concerned about the trends of the government in terms 
of accountability relative to spending programs.  There is the 
issue of the millennium scholarship fund.  There is not a member 
of the House today who would not agree that investment in higher 
education is an important activity and an important initiative 
that needs to continue if we are to ensure that Canadians can 
compete in the 21st century.  The structure the government 
chooses to engage in these types of programs is absolutely 
ludicrous. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the last federal budget the government took $2.5 billion out 
of the federal treasury and away from Canadians for a millennium 
scholarship fund that will not help any Canadian until after the 
year 2000. 
Even then it will only benefit 4% of students seeking higher 
education.  It is the Mother Hubbard theory on spending.  Stock 
the government's cupboard for the time being.  It is fancy book 
work.  It is the type of accounting principle that offends the 
auditor general.  It is the type of social policy that offends 
right headed Canadians because they know that if the money is 
stocked away in some type of self-gratifying government program 
for the future, it cannot benefit Canadians when they need it. 
Canadians need help today and the poorest of Canadians need help 
today.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We believe very strongly that at this time we should be 
increasing the basic personal exemption significantly to reduce 
the disincentives for Canadians at lower income brackets to 
participate in the workforce and to provide more money in their 
pockets. We also believe very strongly that at this point it is 
not just appropriate but right to eliminate bracket creep and to 
reindex the tax brackets. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are members opposite who say the previous Conservative 
government was the party that implemented deindexation back in 
1984.  At that time that initiative, as were other tax 
initiatives, was implemented to eliminate the deficit.  Given 
that some of those initiatives have obviously worked and we have 
eliminated the deficit, now is the time to recognize the role 
Canadians have played in eliminating that deficit and giving them 
some money back in their own pockets. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One million, four-hundred thousand low income Canadians have 
been dragged kicking and screaming on to the tax rolls since 1993 
by bracket creep.  This has to stop.  It is fundamentally unfair 
and we are calling for the government to fully index tax 
brackets. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Next week will be the week of the federal budget.  We have our 
alternative program and I just want to share with members and 
Canadians that a single earner making $20,000 per year will save 
$694 with our tax relief versus a Canadian making $20,000 with 
the current Liberal plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last year the Liberals said they were giving tax breaks to low 
income earners.  The fact is someone making $10,000 per year, 
according to the government's own figures, would only receive a 
benefit of $80 per year.  That is a pittance.  It is an insult. 
That is one cup of coffee per week at Tim Horton's, one per month 
at Starbucks.  That is clearly unacceptable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This government does not get it.  It is out of touch with 
reality.  It is out of touch with Canadians and very soon after 
the next election it will be out of touch with power.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Réal Ménard (Hochelaga—Maisonneuve, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
want to ask my colleague whether he agrees with me that, if we 
looked through the past fifty years of history, we would be hard 
pressed to find such eloquent examples of governments 
deliberately contributing to people's impoverishment.  My 
colleague will recall, because I know he is interested in 
history and is a reasonable and educated man, that, in 1968, for 
example, the Liberals talked about a just society.  He will 
recall, despite his young age—I think he must be several years 
my junior—that the Liberals were going to create a just society 
and eliminate poverty in Canadian society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would my colleague agree with the three measures I propose for 
fighting poverty?  The first, as the member for Shefford said, 
is that social condition must be included in the Canadian Human 
Rights Act. This would make it possible to invalidate provisions 
in the Employment Insurance Act and in the Banks Act.  The 
second is to convince the banks to intervene in disadvantaged 
communities.   The United States has had a law since 1977 called 
the Community Reinvestment Act.  Can I count on my colleague to 
promote these measures?

for his question.  The hon. member always has erudite 
interventions in the House and has been consistent with his 
intervention today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He points out something very interesting, that the Liberal 
government has betrayed the basic principles that the Liberal 
Party of Canada based itself on for so long, social justice, 
equality, recognizing that all Canadians deserve to succeed in 
this great country of ours. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was at a conference a couple of weeks ago, the international 
democratic council meeting.  It was centre-right parties around 
the world and we were talking about different policies.  They 
asked to describe the difference between a political leader and a 
politician.  What we came up with after some discussion is that a 
politician is someone who does what is necessary to get 
re-elected.  A political leader is someone who does something 
that is right for the people they represent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the other side of the House we have a lot of politicians but 
we do not have any political leaders. 
<P><A NAME="LINK285"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Tom Wappel (Scarborough Southwest, Lib.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, I listened carefully to the speech of the hon. member. 
He mentioned Robin Hood, Mother Hubbard and the definition of 
politicians and political leaders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My question to the hon. member concerns financial information. 
This motion includes something that is not particularly new.  I 
believe it was in “Let the Future Begin” which was to increase 
the basic income tax credit from $6,459 to $10,000.  This is 
simply a rehash of the 1997 election platform on this issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Will the hon. member tell Canadians exactly how much it would 
cost the treasury to increase the tax credit tomorrow from $6,500 
to $10,000 and where would the money come from? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Scott Brison:</B>  Madam Speaker, I thank the hon. member 
for his softball question.  I feel like we are on the other side 
of the House now and he is a backbencher asking a question to try 
to make us look good. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member is right to point out the consistency in our position 
since before the last federal election.  What a stark contrast to 
his party's position.  They change positions more often than in 
the <I>Kama Sutra</I>. This year raising it would cost $1.8 
billion. Next year raising it to $8,500 will be another $2.5 
billion.  The following year would be $3.75 billion to raise it 
to the full $10,000.  I was happy to be given the opportunity to 
answer his question unequivocally.  The money would come from the 
economic growth that is available to Canadians.  It would also 
come from the fact that we do have a projected surplus this year 
that will be quite significant.  It will not come from more 
boondoggle spending programs, the Mother Hubbard ones he has 
referred to, that will benefit no Canadians today and few 
Canadians tomorrow.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Bonnie Brown (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Human Resources Development, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I do not 
question the goodwill of the mover of the motion and I do not 
question the compassion that has been very well expressed by 
pretty well all the speakers on the opposition side today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I admit that some of the social ills that have been described by 
the members of the opposition do exist.  But I reject the basic 
premise of their arguments that suggests all the social problems 
are based on the actions of the government.  Nowhere in any of 
their remarks did I hear mention of the changes that have been 
happening all around the globe.  The whole world is in the middle 
of something called the technological revolution.  Some people 
view this as a period of transition and turmoil between the 
industrial age and the information age.  Historically such 
revolutionary periods are periods of social dislocation.  Some 
people who live during those periods adjust quickly to these 
changes and they prosper, but others find these periods of change 
difficult and they experience economic insecurity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To govern during such a period of economic revolution is both a 
privilege and a challenge.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unlike the opposition, this government is not looking 
nostalgically backward to a safer time and wanting to revive and 
apply the solutions of the past.  We do not want to go back to a 
time, for example, when unemployment insurance was mainly a 
passive income support system, a system which encouraged people, 
generation after generation, to languish in semi-poverty with 
little hope of a better future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We want to motivate and actively support Canadians to enter the 
labour market of the 1990s.  For example, our youth employment 
strategy and our Canada jobs fund are helping young people across 
the country and workers in areas of high unemployment to get on 
board the train that is rushing us forward toward the 21st 
century. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are proud of our post-TAGS program for fishers and our 
package for Devco miners because these packages prove that we are 
not abandoning some people who are in trouble; our family 
supplement for families on EI; our national children's benefit; 
our removal of 400,000 low income Canadians from the tax rolls, 
our recognition on our part that some Canadians are struggling 
and that we want to help them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the same time, though, it must be recognized that this 
government has created the right climate of no deficit, low 
interest rates, low inflation and lowering taxes, the climate 
most conducive to job creation and, I might say, a climate the 
previous government tried to achieve and failed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are also proud of our ever decreasing unemployment rate, 
another phenomenon the previous government failed to achieve. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no purpose in being outraged at poverty.  It is far 
more intelligent to be looking at its causes to understand where 
we are in the historical evolution of the country and to apply 
measures to alleviate that poverty as we are doing.  We want to 
bounce people back into the labour force because a job is the 
best economic security we can provide and we are doing those 
things. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, we are not denying that there are social problems out 
there, poverty and homelessness.  We approaching them one by one 
because they are tasks of work to be done.  This government has 
its shoulder to the wheel.  It has its intentions in the right 
place.  As we have sufficient money to tackle of these problems, 
one at time we will tick them off the list that the opposition 
has provided us with today.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Motion No. 1 
</UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That Bill C-247, in Clause 1, be amended by replacing lines 2 to 
4 on page 2 with the following: 
</UL><UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>“human sperm, zygote or embryo for the purpose of cloning a 
human being. ” 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>She said: Mr. Speaker, I would like to clarify my reasons for 
moving this amendment to Bill C-247. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During the committee's review of Bill C-247 prior to approval, 
some scientists from Health Canada were there to answer our 
questions and clarify a number of sections. On one provision in 
particular, namely clause 1(<I>b</I>), concerns were expressed 
regarding the actual impact of the clause at it stands. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Indeed, according to Ms. Colvin, from Health Canada, the scope 
of this wording goes beyond human cloning and includes any 
genetic manipulation, regardless of its purpose. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The issue is not whether or not we must prohibit this type of 
manipulation. Bill C-247 merely seeks to prohibit human cloning. 
Two clauses of Bill C-247 seemed to by saying two different 
things, but the real and fundamental object of this legislation 
is simply to prohibit human cloning. Any other form of genetic 
manipulation should be discussed at another time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The original intent of Bill C-247 concerned only human 
reproductive cloning, and that has not changed. This bill is 
obviously not the answer to all the issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, things must be done clearly and accurately when we are 
legislating in the area of medically assisted reproductive 
technologies. 
There must not be any grey areas or vague provisions preventing 
us from knowing what is authorized and what is not. This is why 
I am moving and amendment which clarifies the object of this 
bill by amending clause 1(b) to read as follows: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>No person shall knowingly 
</UL><UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>(b) alter the genetic structure of an ovum, human sperm, zygote 
or embryo for the purpose of cloning a human being. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>On February 27, 1997, the scientific magazine <I>Nature</I> published a 
research paper that people will talk about for a long time. The 
creators of Dolly describe how the team of researchers succeeded 
for the first time in history in producing a healthy lamb from 
breast tissue taken from an adult sheep.

<A HREF="#LINKT91"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Not long after the announcement that Dolly had been cloned, it 
was learned that two monkeys had been cloned in Oregon from 
embryonic cells.  This was a first for primates. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have all heard of Dr. Richard Seed, the American scientist 
who has publicly announced his intention to clone humans for 
sterile couples.  Today, a technique using cells from aborted 
foetuses could change the face of modern medicine. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Science is evolving at a dizzying pace, often to the advantage 
of society.  There are also cases, however, where society itself 
needs to set limits for the progress of science, and the cloning 
of humans is one such case. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even if Bill C-247 is adopted, it will not put an end to the 
debate on medically assisted reproductive techniques, far from 
it.  This initiative must be seen as a starting point.  We 
certainly have to start somewhere.  This can lay the first brick 
of a wall delineating where we, in conjunction with the 
individuals, organizations and governments concerned, want the 
line drawn between what we want as a society and what we will 
not accept. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The key issue involved in cloning, once the possibility of 
cloning merely for the purposes of reproduction has been 
eliminated, involves mostly therapeutic considerations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us imagine someone with Parkinson's disease.  If human 
cloning were possible, an embryo could be produced from an adult 
cell from a patient and someone's egg.  A few months later, the 
embryo, which would be implanted in a woman's uterus, would 
develop into a foetus genetically identical to the patient. 
The foetus is aborted, the brain cells are extracted and grafted 
onto the patient's brain, which will not reject them because 
they are identical to its own cells. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yes, indeed, the advances in genetics mean benefits for society. 
But the fact that the research provides benefits must not 
prevent us from imposing limits on its development, according to 
values dear to the human race.  Otherwise, certain unfortunate 
science fiction scenarios could become real. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Scientists wonder why not have access to various human cloning 
techniques in order to create full, living, but brain absent 
clones. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Impossible, you say.  Science, however, is at the point of 
making this sad scenario possible. 
In England, they have managed to alter certain genes to 
transform the physiological development of animals.  With this 
manipulation, it is now possible to prevent the development of 
the head, the trunk or the tail in some animals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The same method could be applied to human embryos as well. 
Instead of creating and keeping a human embryo as such, it could 
be genetically reprogrammed so as to prevent the growth of 
unwanted body parts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Can we imagine the conception of an embryo that could ultimately 
become a baby solely for therapeutic purposes, noble though they 
may be?  It is not just a matter of having something be possible 
for it to be acceptable.  The problem is controlling the new 
powers developed by science and technology. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, increasingly, scientific discoveries keep pushing 
back the frontier of the possible. 
The more humanity learns about genetics and reproduction, the 
more it is tempted to apply these discoveries to itself. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All the possibilities that have recently come to light have 
tested the limits of what is morally and socially acceptable. 
In his book <I>The Imperative of Responsibility</I>, the philosopher 
Hans Jonas wrote that modern technology has brought with it 
actions on such a staggering new scale, with objects and 
consequences so unheard of, that the old school of ethics is no 
longer able to keep up. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With genetic discoveries evolving so rapidly, and human cells 
less and less of a mystery, it is obvious that cloning for 
reproductive purposes is no longer in the realm of science 
fiction.  It is upon us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is this what we really want?  I think not, and Bill C-247 is a 
response.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Having said that, it is of the utmost urgency that we take the 
time to consider the other technologies and possibilities that 
genetic engineering has to offer, those that do not produce 
quite the same reactions as human cloning but that will 
nonetheless have an impact on the very composition of the human 
race, such as gene therapy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before events overtake us, society itself must agree on a new 
ethical framework.  We must decide how far we are prepared to 
venture into what was, only yesterday, beyond our reach: 
defining humankind.

<P><A NAME="LINK296"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Bev Desjarlais (Churchill, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today in support of this motion to amend Bill C-247.  I feel that 
this change will clarify the intent of the bill and represents an 
improvement over the original wording. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As you know, Mr. Speaker, I also support Bill C-247 itself, 
although with some regret.  I have no hesitation in supporting 
the intent and content of the member's bill.  My regret stems 
from the fact that we are here today dealing with a private 
member's bill instead of comprehensive government legislation. I 
also regret that we are only addressing one lone aspect of the 
many critical issues developing around reproductive technology. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was 10 years ago that new reproductive technology was 
critical enough for the government of the day to appoint a royal 
commission to investigate.  The Royal Commission on New 
Reproductive Technologies spent four years gathering information 
and formulating 293 resolutions.  Among these was a 
recommendation to prohibit seven specific activities under the 
Criminal Code.  Cloning was one. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By the time it issued its report in November 1993, the royal 
commission had travelled to 17 centres across the country. Two 
thousand Canadians participated in these hearings.  Six thousand 
more phoned in their views on toll free lines that had been set 
up and 15,000 more responded to commission surveys. The 
commission spent $28.3 million during this massive consultation. 
What do we have to show for all this? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the commission's report was released, the New Democratic 
Party called on the government for quick action to implement its 
recommendations.  We challenged this government to convene a 
meeting of federal, provincial and territorial health ministers 
to establish a common framework for moving forward but that came 
to naught. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Instead in 1995 this government asked researchers and health 
practitioners to observe a voluntary moratorium on cloning and a 
number of other practices.  Needless to say this misguided 
substitute for comprehensive legislation went nowhere.  Only in 
1996 did the Liberal government finally introduce legislation, 
Bill C-47, that would have among other things banned human 
cloning.  Bill C-47 died on the Order Paper the next year and was 
never reintroduced. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberal government has been silent on cloning and indeed all 
reproductive technology ever since.  To let these issues that 
impact so seriously on the lives of Canadians, especially women, 
go this long without action is intolerable.  There were problems 
with Bill C-47, there is no doubt about it.  But that does not 
mean the minister just withdraws in fear never to be heard of 
again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How can the government say one day that cloning and 12 other 
practices are so serious they should be criminalized and the next 
day through its inaction say it is not important any more.  It is 
important.  It is important to many Canadians.  The response to 
the royal commission showed that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Not only do Canadians want action, they want the government to 
stop dithering around and act now.  They realize that it is going 
to be a lot more difficult to regulate reproductive technologies 
after the fact. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Cloning is no longer just science fiction. Everyone remembers 
Dolly the cloned sheep.  Rats, cows, monkeys have all recently 
joined that circus.  Now others, both professionals and amateurs, 
have declared that they are working on human cloning. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>American Dr. Richard Seed, who has attracted a great deal of 
media attention with his cloning enthusiasm has announced he will 
open a clinic in Japan specifically for the purpose of human 
cloning.  He has $15 million in backing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last fall a group of Korean scientists proudly announced that 
they had successfully taken human cloning one generation of cells 
closer to reality.

</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a claim by a Massachusetts laboratory that a nucleus 
from a human cell was inserted into a cow's egg which then 
progressed to the 32 cell stage before it was destroyed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are just the experiments that have been publicized. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Organizations have sprung up, like Clonaid, with money and 
hundreds of volunteer couples who, for a variety of reasons, are 
more than willing to risk experimentation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is this government waiting for? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The health minister has a wealth of information to draw upon 
from the royal commission and the debate around Bill C-247. 
There is nothing standing in his way.  He could quite quickly 
consolidate his position on reproductive technology, consult 
stakeholders, including women's organizations, about his 
proposals and bring in new legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must send a clear message to the scientific community that 
its efforts on human cloning are not welcome in Canada. Canadians 
have unequivocally told the government that human cloning is not 
acceptable.  They have also, in good faith, come out to hearings, 
filled out questionnaires and written letters indicating their 
views on other reproductive technology issues.  The government 
has once again shown an appalling lack of leadership. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In an effort to fill that leadership void I am here today in 
support of private member's Bill C-247.  With the passage of this 
bill one of the many reproductive technology issues will have 
been dealt with in parliament.  We can only hope that the 
government will then finally see fit to do the responsible thing 
and introduce comprehensive legislation to address the rest. 
<P><A NAME="LINK297"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Maurice Vellacott (Wanuskewin, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
there are some categories of genetic manipulation which Bill 
C-247 responds to and some which it does not.  However, the broad 
concept of genetic manipulation can be broken down into several 
categories and sub-categories. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The unamended Bill C-247 dealt with cloning and germ-line 
manipulation.  The unamended bill prohibited two kinds genetic 
manipulation, cloning on the one hand and germ line genetic 
changes on the other. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We were supportive of the bill in its original form, prior to 
the amendments.  We have some reservations with respect to some 
very important parts of the bill which were removed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Most of us understand what cloning is about because of news 
reports on Dolly, the very first cloned animal.  With respect to 
the second practice, we believe that subclause 1(b) of the 
unamended bill should be retained.  It reads: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>No person shall knowingly 
</UL><UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>(b) alter the genetic structure of an ovum, human sperm, zygote 
or embryo if the altered structure is capable of transmission to 
a subsequent generation. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Whenever genetic manipulation results in changes that can be 
passed on to the next generation—and not all genetic 
manipulation has that result—it is referred to as germ-line or 
genetic alteration.  This bill prohibits that kind of alteration. 
It does not address non-germ-line genetic alteration that has no 
consequences for subsequent generations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to speak to the purpose of the prohibition of germ line 
changes, which is found in the second part of the unamended bill. 
The intention of subclause 1(b) in the unamended bill was to 
prevent scientists, and rich parents as their clients, from 
altering human beings who would then pass on their new gene 
structures to subsequent generations, since that would result in 
the engineering of the human race.  Put differently, its purpose 
was to prevent all artificial tinkering with the human gene pool. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The purpose of the second prohibition of the unamended bill was 
to prevent eugenics.  We all know about that.  That has been 
described and talked about before.  We believe that there are 
some real flaws and major moral and ethical problems with moving 
in that direction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are implications in Bill C-247 for research on gene 
therapies.  The member from the Bloc acknowledged the concerns 
expressed at committee stage by the Liberal member from East York 
who argued that the bill might prevent researchers from finding 
cures for genetic disorders.  Briefly, the unamended version 
allows individuals to be treated for genetic disorders as long as 
the treatment does not result in the possibility of their 
offspring carrying the genetic alteration.  That provision was in 
the unamended bill. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1750"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT94"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In other words, the gene therapy must not involve changes at the 
germ line.  It is very important to make clear that the unamended 
bill does not affect current gene therapy or current research on 
gene therapy.  Present day gene therapy, called somatic cell gene 
therapy, involves manipulating cells in the body, except the 
reproductive cells.  It involves the insertion of a gene into the 
patient.  As we have said, the germ line is not affected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The germ line genetic alteration prohibited in the unamended 
bill would involve replacing affected genes in reproductive 
cells—the sperm, the egg, a zygote or an embryo—with unaffected 
genes.  It is not feasible in human beings at present.  It is 
really still the stuff of science fiction.  Some believe that 
technological advances may one day make germ line changes 
feasible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why we need the unamended Bill C-247, the prohibition of 
germ line genetic alteration.  The germ line changes would 
involve unacceptable health risks for the individual.  The risks 
associated with germ line alteration are much greater than those 
surrounding what is called somatic cell gene therapy since any 
mistakes would affect all of the embryo cells.  An inserted gene 
could interfere with other vital gene functions or conceivably 
activate genes associated with cancer development or other 
disorders.  It would be kind of like making one move on a 
chessboard.  If we make a move on a chessboard it affects the 
values or the functions of the other pieces.  It changes the rest 
of the scenario. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These risks have caused some to propose a solution, one that I 
find ethically unacceptable.  Some suggest that germ line genetic 
alteration is not necessary since it is only needed when an 
embryo is found that is abnormal.  It is pointed out that it is 
an easy thing to simply discard such embryos and implant only 
healthy embryos.  Therefore we would be using aborted fetuses, 
discarding those embryos that we did not want and implanting only 
healthy embryos.  Therein lies some of the beginning of the 
problems with not having this as a prohibition on germ line 
genetic alteration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need the unamended bill to be retained because germ line 
changes would involve an unacceptable health risk for the larger 
society.  Altering the genetic make-up of the human genome does 
more than risk the future of the individual involved and the germ 
line.  The fact that humankind possesses a certain amount of 
genetic mutation is what is believed to provide the reservoir of 
the species to adapt to changes in environmental circumstances. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The human genome has incurred constant but subtle changes to its 
structure in response to environmental demands.  That has 
resulted in certain recessive disorders which actually enhance a 
person's ability to exist under certain conditions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>An example of this is the gene for sickle cell anemia that 
provides resistance to malaria.  It is impossible to determine 
the possible benefits or risks of seemingly aberrant genes as the 
scope of their interaction with other genes and gene products 
remains unknown. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need to retain Bill C-247 in its unamended form because germ 
line changes, if possible, someday would lead to eugenics. 
Contrary to what many suppose, the line separating therapeutic 
and non-therapeutic genetic alteration is very fuzzy.  Any 
introduction of germ line changes to address the most 
debilitating of childhood diseases, like cystic fibrosis, would 
prepare society for changes intended to address genetic mutations 
whose impacts would be delayed until adulthood, until much later 
along.  A predisposition to diabetes, heart disease, asthma and 
various forms of cancer fall into that category. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At a later point germ line changes would be used to inoculate 
people against various infectious agents such as HIV.  Then germ 
line changes to address problems such as mental diseases and 
anti-social behaviour would be attempted, and the list goes on 
and on from there.  Some commentators believe that ultimately 
genetic enhancements of all sorts that have nothing to do with 
health would then be attempted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The unamended Bill C-247 is right.  It is an appropriate bill to 
ban germ line genetic changes.  It is foolhardy to hold out germ 
line changes as the means to eradicate genetic disorders.  The 
potential risks involved range from the creation of even worse 
disorders or the inadvertent loss of important traits we 
currently possess to the collapse of social structure and ideals, 
following a disregard for the overall, most important, 
all-embracing concept of the sanctity of life.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough, PC):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I am very pleased as well to rise in the House and 
have the opportunity to speak to Bill C-247, an act to amend the 
Criminal Code as it relates to genetic manipulation or what is 
more commonly known as human cloning. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I look forward to taking part in this debate.  This is a very 
laudable initiative that has been taken by my colleague from the 
Bloc Quebecois.  The amendment is one that has been clarified by 
her remarks and by the amendment put forward, and the bill is 
certainly a very positive one that we in the Progressive 
Conservative Party embrace. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I commend the member for Drummond for her efforts in sponsoring 
the bill.  The issues surrounding human cloning and development 
to the use of reproductive technologies touch upon many moral and 
ethical concerns, but we in parliament cannot shy away from 
challenges that are presented by the leaps and bounds presently 
occurring in scientific research. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As mentioned by other speakers, Bill C-247 would amend the 
Criminal Code by adding after section 286 a prohibition for 
genetic manipulation that leads to human cloning.  This in and of 
itself is an important and necessary step. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is no easy task to bring forward a private member's bill, 
particularly to this stage in the legislative process.  Bill 
C-247 is a very timely motion in light of recent technological 
developments that have resulted in, among other things, the first 
successful cloning of sheep.  I am not talking here about the new 
Liberal re-election strategy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As was once thought impossible becomes reality, we as lawmakers 
must be prepared to act in advance of other new reproductive and 
genetic technologies, which are NRGTs for short. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While not making too partisan a point I wish to point to the 
former Progressive Conservative government's positive 
contribution to this issue.  When our party formed the government 
we had the foresight to lay the groundwork on the development of 
policy options which reflect on this matter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1989 the P.C. government of the day established a royal 
commission on new reproductive technologies chaired by Patricia 
Baird.  The Baird commission's mandate was to examine the social, 
medical, legal, ethical, economic and research implications for 
new reproductive and genetic technologies with particular regard 
to their implications for women, reproductive health and 
well-being. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Following extensive consultation with Canadians the Baird 
commission report tabled its findings and the new Liberal 
government in November 1993 had that in hand.  That was five 
years ago.  Now the commission has highlighted the need for the 
federal government to adopt a comprehensive public policy on new 
reproductive and genetic technologies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In response to the Baird commission the Liberal government 
announced a voluntary moratorium on NRGTs in 1995 and that 
continues to stand today.  As other members have pointed out, the 
effectiveness of this moratorium has been seriously undermined 
due to its voluntary nature. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1996, for the record, the Liberals recognized the weakness of 
the moratorium and introduced Bill C-47, the Human Reproductive 
and Genetic Technologies Act.  This law prohibited 13 specific 
practices:  the cloning of human embryos; the buying and selling 
of eggs, sperm and embryos including their exchange for goods and 
services for other benefits; germ line genetic alterations; the 
transfer of embryos between humans and other species; the 
creation of human animal hybrids; and the use of human sperm eggs 
or embryos for assisted human reproductive procedures or for 
medical research without the informed consent of the donor or 
donors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those were among the initiatives.  This comprehensive list was 
certainly a welcome attempt to restrict the misuse of new 
reproductive technologies.  However sadly the bill died on the 
order paper. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberal government committed to developing in consultation 
with the provinces, territories and stakeholders additional 
legislative means.  However that did not occur. 
The Liberals did not consider Bill C-47 to be a priority and 
since it died on the order paper, we have not seen any 
reintroduction.  I again commend the hon. member from the Bloc 
Quebecois for taking such initiative.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Furthermore, as with so many other pieces of important 
legislation that died on the order paper from the previous 
government, the Liberals have yet to introduce anything even 
remotely similar to Bill C-47.  We have remained in a vacuum with 
nothing but a flimsy, practical, unenforceable moratorium. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Thankfully the member for Drummond has taken this initiative and 
has attempted to fill the void left by the government's inaction. 
Thankfully it appears that the government is prepared to put 
partisanship aside and support this worthwhile measure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On behalf of the Progressive Conservative Party I am pleased to 
reiterate our support for Bill C-247.  This legislation draws a 
very clear line in the Criminal Code against human cloning. There 
is a very eerie and perhaps unnatural black hole that we must be 
cautious about leaping into without knowledge of where we are 
going. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important to note that although Bill C-247 is an important 
first step to fill the void left by the Liberals, there are 
plenty of other legislative initiatives that have to be taken by 
the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Indeed out of the 13 specific procedures that would have been 
prohibited by the government's legislation in the last 
parliament, only two are proposed for prohibition under Bill 
C-247.  Furthermore, this bill does not include a national 
regulatory regime with a mandate to enforce controls on improper 
genetic testing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberal government, therefore, has an obligation to 
introduce a comprehensive piece of legislation similar in content 
to what was introduced in the previous parliament.  This would 
build on the great merits that are presently before the House in 
the means of Bill C-247. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Along with completing the work that has been commenced by the 
member for Drummond, any legislation from the government should 
also reflect the emerging consensus for a national regulatory 
regime to manage the field of reproductive and genetic 
technologies.  This regime must also be managed in a way that 
will protect the health and safety for those most affected and 
those most affected, as was previously referred to by the member 
from the New Democratic Party, are for the most part women. Women 
are the ones who will be most affected by this area of scientific 
change. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are approaching the third anniversary of this government's 
tabling of the Human Reproductive and Genetics Technologies Act. 
In light of this dubious anniversary, I hope the government will 
soon stop dragging its heels on this important issue and follow 
the example set by the member for Drummond and introduce wide 
ranging legislation to control new reproductive and genetic 
technologies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The health minister was very active, although perhaps 
misdirected, in his previous portfolio as minister.  I encourage 
him to start moving in the direction set by the member for 
Drummond. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I commend the member for this action.  I give her the support of 
the Progressive Conservative Party and we hope this bill will 
receive the unanimous support of all members in this House. 
<P><A NAME="LINK299"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I would like 
to say a few words about this bill and the amendment.  I have to 
candidly admit that this is not a mathematical subject and so I 
cannot stand here as a good expert on this matter.  But I can 
read. I have read the bill and I have some concerns specifically 
about the amendment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members will find it unusual that we actually stand up in report 
stage and speak specifically to an amendment that is proposed at 
report stage.  We will hold off the debate on the whole bill 
until the whole bill comes back to the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to talk about the amendment that is before us right now. 
It seems to me that it is, if not redundant, slightly different 
from the clause before it.  Perhaps just to give some clarity for 
those people who do not have the bill before them, in Bill C-247, 
section 286 of the Criminal Code is to be amended: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>No person shall knowingly 
</UL><UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>(a) manipulate an ovum, zygote or embryo for the purpose of 
producing a zygote or embryo that contains the same genetic 
information as a living or deceased human being or a zygote, 
embryo or foetus, or implant in a woman a zygote or embryo so 
produced. 
</UL></UL>
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1805"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT98"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT98"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1805
<A HREF="#LINKT99"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border=0 alt="+"></A>
<A HREF="#LINKT97"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I look at that, unless I do not understand, I see the 
definition of cloning.  They are taking genetic information from 
a living or a dead person and putting the genetics together to 
produce a new person. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This clause suggests that shall not be done.  Also it 
specifically says it cannot be implanted.  That implies that it 
cannot be done in a Petrie dish or in a human being. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The amendment that we have before us changes the very next 
clause.  I will read the original: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>No person shall knowingly alter the genetic structure of an ovum, 
human sperm, zygote or embryo if the altered structure is capable 
of transmission to a subsequent generation. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleague has given a very good explanation of the 
implications of that.  We favour that restriction as well.  In 
other words, we are not about to get into genetic manipulation to 
produce a new form of human being, a new species or subspecies of 
our race. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is good to be against that lest somebody takes it upon 
themselves to create everybody from here on in with a Reform 
genetic structure.  That would perhaps make too much of a good 
thing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The amendment actually calls for the striking out of those 
words.  The motion as amended would be that “no person shall 
knowingly alter the genetic structure of an ovum, human sperm, 
zygote or embryo for the purpose of cloning a human being”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unless I missed something, this is a redundant second way of 
stating what the first said.  It is pretty well the same thing. 
The only difference is that the first one said manipulate and 
this one says alter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We should be careful here because in making this change we do 
two things.  If we adopt this amendment, the one thing we change 
is that we no longer restrict the manipulation or the altering of 
the genetic structure of one of these basic building blocks of 
life.  We no longer restrict it from being done and carried on 
from generation to generation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other thing we do is merely introduce what appears to be a 
redundancy.  I am afraid that if we have two clauses in a bill 
that becomes law with slightly different wording, all this does 
is give big business to the legal beagles around the country.  It 
adds to uncertainty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My view on the actual amendment of striking these words and 
replacing them is that it ought not to be done.  Therefore I 
recommend strongly that members in the House of Commons reject 
this amendment. 
<P><A NAME="LINK300"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Elinor Caplan (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Health, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, as all members in the House have 
acknowledged, the federal government has been concerned with the 
issues of cloning and germline genetic manipulation for some 
time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1993 the report of the royal commission on new productive and 
genetic technologies recommended banning these practices and 
bringing forward a regulatory environment.  The government 
followed up immediately with a call for a moratorium on these and 
other practices in 1995.  That moratorium is in place and exists 
today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a result of Bill C-47, the government understands the 
concerns that Canadians have about the variety of egregious 
technology, those things that we are worried about, not just 
cloning and germline genetic manipulation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We acknowledge the widespread desire for a comprehensive regime 
to govern the unacceptable and regulate the acceptable 
technologies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The committee discussed Bill C-247. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1810"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT99"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT99"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1810

<A HREF="#LINKT98"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is general agreement in principle that human cloning 
should be banned.  That was originally in the government Bill 
C-47 and recommended by the commission that was established. 
There are many days in this place where I think all members would 
like to have a clone of themselves so we could be in two places 
at the same time.  That is a joke. We know that the idea of 
having a complete replica of any human being, not just in this 
place but anywhere, is not only scary but it is the kind of 
serious ethical dilemma that we are all very clear on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to be very clear that we do not support the ability to 
clone humans.  We support a ban on human cloning.  At the same 
time, in speaking to this amendment before us today, we recognize 
that this is a very complex issue.  What is proposed in this bill 
is a Criminal Code prohibition.  What we believe is required and 
what this amendment points out is that we need not only 
prohibitions but a regulatory regime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What concerns me is the amendment that has been placed today by 
the member for Drummond because it points out that we have 
concerns, as I believe she has, with the original wording of the 
bill.  We do not want to, for example, stop research on those 
technologies that I referred to as acceptable, the kind of 
technologies that would lead to a perfect match for bone marrow 
to cure leukaemia or a perfect match of a valve to fix a heart or 
the perfect match of an organ. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I therefore say to the member and to all members that the fact 
that this amendment has been placed at this time in the House is 
of great concern to me.  We have to think very carefully before 
we try to frame complex legislation by amendment in this House of 
Commons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have received communications from experts in this field 
following the discussion at committee.  Dr. Arthur Leader, 
professor of obstetrics, gynecology and medicine, the 
chief of the division of reproductive medicine at the University 
of Ottawa, and president of the Canadian Fertility and Andrology 
Society, would like to appear before the committee to express his 
concerns and reservations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In speaking to this amendment I believe we cannot support this 
amendment at this time without having further discussion and 
debate of the implications that it would have on this very 
important topic. 
<P><A NAME="LINK301"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Eric Lowther (Calgary Centre, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
appreciate the opportunity to speak to this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As has been stated by a number of members, I think of how 
critical these kinds of issues are.  It is good for us to reflect 
for a moment on the impacts on some of the new technologies and 
new developments that are almost exploding out there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On these technologies, be it in the biotechnology area, on the 
Internet or in other things, this House often wrestles with key 
issues of what is in the public interest and how do we as 
custodians of the public trust serve the people who put us here 
effectively. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My primary and underlying concern on this bill is the 
requirement for us to ensure that public safety, as these new 
technologies come forward, has been properly addressed.  I think 
of some of the developments in pharmaceuticals and even in food 
additives in the past that we were told were safe, that 
supposedly were tested.  People took the experts at their word 
and either took the medication or consumed the product with very 
grievous results. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Sometimes we are so concerned and compassionate to quickly bring 
a product to market that may help those who are suffering or who 
are facing a very traumatic physical illness or life threatening 
illness. 
It is incumbent upon all of us to be very cautious.  In our 
compassion to meet the short term need we may in fact cause a 
very serious disaster. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1815"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT99"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is within that context that I support the bill and I support 
the unamended bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As these things come forward in the future, as they will for us 
to deal with, the overriding concern we must all have is what is 
in the public interest.  Let us make sure that the controls are 
in place to allow the experts and those who develop these things 
to do all the appropriate testing, the long term testing so that 
we do not in our zeal to meet the needs of those who are facing 
life-threatening diseases actually cause more trouble than good. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know that sometimes even those involved in research and the 
medical field are not always Snow White.  There can be instances 
of abuse or exaggeration and exaggeration upon exaggeration. 
This is why we as custodians of the public trust must tread very 
carefully and slowly in this area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would suggest this is not just with respect to the area of 
human genetics and cloning but also in all kinds of 
biotechnology.  Today some of the most grievous weapons in the 
world are biological weapons.  When we start to manipulate the 
gene structures of plants and animals and other types of things, 
we have to be careful that the appropriate controls are in place, 
that if an accident or a mistake happens there are ways to shut 
it down quickly.  We have seen what various viruses can do and 
what a tragedy it would be if it was a man-made problem that 
caused the deaths of millions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the same time, I am not saying that we should not explore 
this, but do it carefully.  There may be developments that would 
solve the bone marrow transplant issue and many of the other 
tragic life-threatening things we see today. We do need to move 
into this arena I would say, but very cautiously and very 
carefully so that we can maximize the long term benefits to the 
people we are here to serve.  We must make sure that we are not 
putting any of them at risk. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I commend the member for the bill.  I commend all the members of 
the House who have spoken on this so eloquently.  I think my 
comments have encapsulated what many of the members have said, 
that we do need to step carefully into this arena and make sure 
that we are taking every precaution.  As we do in 
pharmaceuticals, certainly we need to do the same thing in this 
arena.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Pauline Picard (Drummond, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am obviously 
extremely frustrated with this amendment, which reads as 
follows: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>2. This act comes into force on a day to be fixed by order of 
the governor in council. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>For clarity, for the benefit of the public, this means that, if 
passed, the bill will not be allowed to follow the normal course 
and the government will be able to set the date when it should 
come into force, that is probably never as the government is 
likely to introduce its own bill to take all the credit—because 
we all know how much this government craves visibility—for 
prohibiting human cloning. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The purpose of this amendment is basically to make the coming 
into force of the ban on human cloning subject to a government 
order. On the surface, this amendment may seem totally 
innocuous, while in fact it has a great deal of importance, 
because we cannot afford to wait much longer. Immediate action 
is required. We know how slow and superficial the government has 
been on this issue. This kind of amendment is tantamount to 
blocking the coming into force of the prohibition on human 
cloning. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Ten years ago, already, the Baird commission was established. 
The commission clearly indicated that it was urgent that we act 
and legislate on reproductive technologies, one of which is 
human cloning. Four years of studies, 40,000 witnesses and $28 
million later, the Baird Commission tabled its report in 
November 1993. We are now in 1999. 
Ten years after the Baird commission was set up, no clear rules 
have yet been established to regulate medically assisted 
reproductive technologies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then, we had a voluntary moratorium which was ridiculed by all 
the opposition parties and by all the relevant organizations. 
This is unthinkable: a voluntary moratorium. We are supposed to 
have a monitoring committee, but it never released any report, 
and we have a voluntary moratorium. Who is checking in the labs 
to see what scientists are doing in terms of genetic and cell 
manipulation to perhaps clone human beings? Such research is 
already being conducted in some labs, but does that mean it is 
not going on in Canada? We cannot assume that. Therefore, this 
voluntary moratorium is meaningless. As I said, people were 
totally indifferent to it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then we had the advisory group set up by the government to 
monitor the implementation of the moratorium and the 
developments in NRTs, and to advise the Minister of Health in 
this area. As I said earlier, we never heard from that 
monitoring agency. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On June 14, 1996, the then Minister of Health introduced Bill 
C-47. During the hearings of the Standing Committee on Health, 
witnesses told us they had a number of reservations about the 
bill, because it was inappropriate and did not deal with what 
should have been regulated. These people told us certain things, 
including the fact that human cloning and genetic manipulation 
are two completely different issues and that they should be 
dealt with separately. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill died on the Order Paper. It was fine with the 
government to have it die on the Order Paper, because it did not 
know what to do with it. 
So, we were promised that the government would come back, at 
some point in time, with a bill that would be more acceptable to 
the scientific community and to the population as a whole. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have been trying to ask questions at times, but the answers 
are always vague. We are told to wait, as the minister said 
today when we put the question to him. We are told that 
appropriate legislation will soon be introduced.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have been waiting for 10 years. We have been hearing about 
this issue for 20 years. We have had 10 years of promises but 
nothing has been done yet. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois has introduced Bill C-247, which, at least, 
would be a first step. We are very conscious of the fact that it 
does not solve the whole issue of assisted reproductive 
technologies, but it would at least prohibit human cloning, 
which is just around the corner. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I recommend that the parliamentary secretary to the Minister of 
Health read what is being written on this subject and she will 
see that human cloning is just around the corner. It is not a 
matter of waiting to hear what the scientists have to say. It is 
here; the studies have been done. 
So why does the government not prohibit human cloning under the 
Criminal Code? Incredibly enough, it refuses to do so. It 
continues to wait, but for what? For another scandal like the 
tainted blood scandal? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Nothing has been done in Canada to fill the legal and moral void 
surrounding medically assisted reproduction even though the 
international community has been working for several years to 
set acceptable limits in this field. Again, Canada is not 
keeping pace. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members of the international community seem unanimous in their 
opposition to any form of human cloning. Concerns about possible 
cloning attempts are legitimate. No one has yet been able to 
show that this can be done without creating serious ethical 
problems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The scientific community, even the researchers who succeeded in 
cloning Dolly, have stated that they have no intention of trying 
to clone a human being in future.  It is obvious that, 
regardless of how stringent the legislation is that governs such 
research activities, the issue of human cloning involves the 
international community. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this connection, the President of France, Jacques Chirac, 
recently stated that the main problem with cloning was an 
international one, in that this practice must be banned 
world-wide, right now, not two or three years down the road. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, UNESCO adopted a universal declaration on the human 
genome and human rights which bans the cloning of humans in 
article 11. 
The World Health Organization also asked member states to take 
steps at the legislative and legal levels to ban human cloning. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In March 1997, while I was present, it passed a resolution 
stating that the use of cloning for human reproduction is not 
ethical, because doing so violates certain fundamental 
principles of medically assisted procreation, including respect 
for human dignity and protecting the security of human genetic 
material.  I could also tell you about the European countries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the United States—Canada often looks to the United States 
for guidance—President Clinton spoke out against cloning and 
announced that the government would not fund any project 
involving its use. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Where is our Prime Minister's statement on human cloning?  We 
hear it will be coming soon.  Soon. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A number of countries in Europe and Asia have adopted measures 
to ban human cloning or are in the process of doing so.  We must 
do our part to close the door on these practices, and Bill C-247 
must be passed so it can be applied immediately.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Jocelyne Girard-Bujold (Jonquière, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, on 
December 4, I asked a question in this House but did not get an 
answer— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Pauline Picard:</B> On a point of order, Mr. Speaker. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> I must inform the hon. member that points of 
order are out of order during adjournment proceedings. This is 
where we are. These proceedings have started. The hon. member is 
welcome to raise the matter tomorrow. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Jocelyne Girard-Bujold:</B> Mr. Speaker, my question was as 
follows: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the second time since 1996, the auditor general concludes in 
a report that the federal government still does not have a 
complete picture of the various environmental hazards posed by 
the 5,000 contaminated federal sites. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a very important issue. The environmental liabilities 
related to contaminated sites exceed $2 billion, excluding 
radioactive waste management costs. The government must take 
action now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These pollutants come from government laboratories, military 
bases, harbours and ports, airports, training facilities and 
reserve lands. 
The diversity and number of contaminated federal sites—more 
than 5,000—show the scope and severity of the problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These sites contain PCBs, hydrocarbons, mine tailings, heavy 
metals, other waste materials and chemicals. The presence of 
numerous toxic substances reminds us of the urgent need to take 
action. We must avoid spreading contaminants that could be 
harmful to our health and our environment, which would mean 
additional costs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In his 1996, 1997 and December 1998 reports, the auditor general 
reiterates that it is an important problem to which the 
government seems totally oblivious. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this context, I would like to know what the Minister of the 
Environment has to say on this issue. 
When will she be able to convince her cabinet colleagues that 
this is a priority and that the government must act as soon as 
possible, provide us with a complete list of environmental 
hazards, adopt an environmental policy and announce that it is 
providing the responsible departments with the necessary 
resources to address the problem of contaminated sites?

<P><A NAME="LINK309"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Paddy Torsney (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of the 
Environment, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, let me say I agree with the 
hon. member that federal contaminated sites is an issue which 
must be taken seriously. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Like my colleague in the House, I concur with the auditor 
general's environmental representative, the Commissioner of the 
Environment and Sustainable Development, that there is a need for 
central leadership and a consistent framework to enable the 
federal government to address its contaminated sites. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To this end Environment Canada officials in co-operation with 
Treasury Board are currently working toward future options and 
will be advising the environment minister in the future.  In 
addition I point out that we also agree with the auditor 
general's assessment that although a management framework is 
conspicuously absent progress has been made in dealing with the 
legacy of contaminated sites. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, we introduced a pollution prevention approach to 
environmental management right across the board to prevent 
further contamination.  Over 4,000 federal sites have undergone 
some form of environmental assessment and 300 more are currently 
being assessed.  To date over $130 million have been spent on the 
assessment and remediation of federal sites. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have worked closely with other governments testing new 
technologies and developing management tools such as the Canadian 
Council of Ministers of the Environment national classification 
system.  We have encouraged and supported the work of the 
interdepartmental committee dealing with federal contaminated 
sites and progress has been made by Environment Canada in 
addressing sites in its portfolio. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition to carrying out a comprehensive site inventory 
Environment Canada has completed phase 1 and phase 2 
environmental site assessments at Environment Canada sites across 
the country. 
Clean up at two high priority sites has been concluded and 
remediation is under way at another four.  Such work is 
integrated with Environment Canada's environment management 
system which underpins the department's sustainable development 
strategy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I thank the member for her interest and encourage her to 
maintain a watchful eye on our progress.  Improvements of this 
magnitude will not occur overnight.  We are committed to 
developing a long term solution to what has been a long term 
problem.  The minister will be happy to report back further. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  Order, please.  The motion to adjourn 
the House is now deemed to have been adopted.  Accordingly, this 
House stands adjourned until tomorrow at 10 a.m., pursuant to 
Standing Order 24(1). 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(The House adjourned at 6.35 p.m.)
