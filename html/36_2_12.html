</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rick Limoges (Windsor—St. Clair, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I am pleased to inform the House that one our community's leading 
citizens, Mr. Anthony Toldo Sr., is being invested with the Order 
of Ontario on Monday, November 1, 1999. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Toldo is a philanthropist and industrialist who has made an 
enormous contribution to Windsor and Tecumseh.  Over the years he 
has made many generous donations, the most notable of which was 
$1 million to the Windsor Regional Cancer Centre. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Tony Toldo is an example of the Canadian dream.  He arrived in 
Canada as a poor young boy from Italy in 1934 and through hard 
work and determination built a business empire that employs over 
1,100 people in three countries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Tony Toldo represents the very best of what makes Windsor, 
Tecumseh and Canada such great places to live.  I want to extend 
my heartfelt congratulations to Tony Toldo on being named to the 
Order of Ontario, an honour that is well deserved.

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>WEST CENTRAL PELLETING

<P><A NAME="LINK5"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gerry Ritz (Battlefords—Lloydminster, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, in the great western tradition of private enterprise and 
finding opportunities, the West Central Pelleting company of 
Wilkie, Saskatchewan has built itself into a successful, 
value-added operation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Five hundred shareholders, consisting of retired and active 
farmers, small business people and other citizens, raised $2.2 
million to start this operation.  The company takes in 
screenings.  That is the plant material left over after the grain 
has been cleaned and processed.  Though screenings have long been 
known to have nutritional value as animal feed, they have usually 
been shipped elsewhere, along with the employment opportunities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>West Central Pelleting uses nutritional consultants to provide 
its growing customer base with made-to-order feed products. 
According to Bonnie Stephenson of <I>Grainews</I>, “West Central 
has met its first year goal of 20,000 metric tonnes of production 
and has just completed an expansion that has tripled its storage 
capacity”.  There are 15 employees there now and I predict a lot 
more jobs to come as prairie people apply their know-how and 
determination to succeed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Congratulations, West Central Pelleting.

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>WOMEN'S HISTORY MONTH 
</H3><P align=left>

<P><A NAME="LINK7"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jacques Saada (Brossard—La Prairie, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
October is women's history month.  In this Année de la 
Francophonie, which is particularly exciting in Quebec, I would 
like to pay special tribute to those women who fought for the 
right to vote for women in Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1907, Marie Gérin-Lajoie and Caroline Beïque founded the 
Fédération nationale Saint-Jean-Baptiste to promote women's civil 
and political rights.  They called for a reform of the civil 
code at the time and demanded a commission of inquiry be set up 
to examine women's rights. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1922, still not having obtained the right to vote, Marie 
Gérin-Lajoie went to Quebec City with a group of women in order 
to lobby the premier.  In the following years, Idola St-Jean and 
Thérèse Casgrain took over.  After a number of years of vigorous 
efforts, women in Quebec finally obtained the right to vote on 
April 25, 1940. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since then, because of the profound convictions of these 
activists, a number of Quebec women have been elected to the 
National Assembly of Quebec and to the House of Commons. 
Despite that, however, the men to women ratio is far from 
representative of Canada's total population.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Still not satisfied, he has planned the greatest tax hike in 
Canadian history on January 1 when he brings in the CPP 
increases.  According to the auditor general this insatiable 
Prime Minister is hoarding an incredible $21 billion in EI 
overpayments from workers and businesses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Reform pointed out this overtaxation to the minister last year, 
yet the auditor general now says this overtaxation is at record 
levels. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why will the government not return the EI surplus to the people 
it belongs to, the people he taxed it from: overtaxed Canadian 
businesses and families? 
<P><A NAME="LINK37"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, the current rate is $2.55.  That is a 15 cent reduction 
from the previous year.  That is a 52 cent reduction from the day 
we took office.  That is $4 billion more in Canadian pockets. 
That is what we have done since we have taken office. 
<P><A NAME="LINK38"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it 
is odd the minister thinks that a $21 billion surplus is a good 
thing.  It might be a good thing for him, but it is certainly not 
a good thing for Canadian consumers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The EI taxes hit low income Canadians the hardest.  Premiums 
stop going up once a person makes $39,000 a year.  That means 
people making more than $39,000 a year have a tax advantage over 
the poor. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government already takes $6 billion from people who make 
less than $20,000 a year.  Why does the minister not climb down 
off his wallet and start giving tax policies that will help out 
the poorest in the country? 
<P><A NAME="LINK39"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, the hon. member talks about what the government has done 
for low income Canadians.  Let us take a look at what we have 
done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The amount of income for which taxpayers are now exempt before 
they have to begin paying taxes was increased by $675.  Last year 
Reform voted against it.  The Canada child tax benefit has been 
increased by $2 billion.  Reform voted against it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are now 600,000 low income Canadians who were previously 
paying taxes who are not paying taxes, and Reform wanted them to 
pay taxes. 
<P><A NAME="LINK40"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the 
bottom line is that $6 billion are gouged out of the pockets of 
people that make less than $20,000 a year.  That is the legacy of 
the minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Small businesses struggle to win their share of consumers ever 
shrinking after tax dollars.  They struggle to stay competitive 
in a growing competitive world market.  They struggle to hire 
more people because the government taxes them excessively every 
time they try to employ a new worker. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Inflated EI premiums are a tax on the poor, a tax on families 
and a tax on businesses.  Why will the government not give tax 
relief where it is needed: to the poor, the families, and the 
businesses of the country?

entitled to a decent retirement, which obviously the Reform Party 
does not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member talked about small business and why we brought in and

picking the pockets of Canadian workers and businesses.  At the 
same time those workers and businesses are struggling to making 
ends meet under this Liberal tax regime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why does the finance minister not just do the right thing and 
return the EI surplus, which belongs to the workers and

taxes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Hear, hear. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Paul Martin:</B>  Reform members are applauding.  Does 
the House know what they are applauding?  In their election 
campaign they said that they would not cut personal taxes until 
the year 2000.  That was part of their election campaign. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We cut taxes in 1997.  The Reform Party would not have done it. 
We cut taxes in 1998.  The Reform Party would not have done it. 
We cut taxes in 1999.  The Reform Party would not have done it. 
We cut them three times.  We are ahead of the cart and they are 
down in the hole. 
<P><A NAME="LINK44"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Richard M. Harris (Prince George—Bulkley Valley,

They are at the head of the class for the highest personal income 
taxes of all G-7 countries.  That is where they are ahead. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They say that they are saving the EI fund for a rainy day.  We 
better go home and start building our ark because there is a heck 
of a flood coming.  There is no doubt about that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a question for the finance minister.  With his $21 
billion surplus, what is his problem?  The auditor general says 
that he does not like what he is doing.  The money is not his. 
Why does he not just give it back to the people whom he took it 
from? 
<P><A NAME="LINK45"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B>  Mr.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The travelling public will be gouged.  Workers will lose their 
jobs.  Smaller centres will lose their service unless the 
government ensures proper protection like the 10% ownership rule. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government should set out the rules openly and publicly so 
that the bids can conform to the rules.  Instead it is changing

<P><A NAME="LINK54"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of Transport, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, we launched a very open process under section 47 of 
the Canada Transportation Act which succeeded in bringing forward 
two private sector proposals.  That will be considered by the 
shareholders of these companies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was very important for the government yesterday, when I met

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, in the 
game for control of the Canadian airline industry the transport

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Val Meredith (South Surrey—White Rock—Langley,

</I></B></P><P align=left>The competition commissioner has recommended that the government

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of Transport, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, in the discussions that we have had with various 
stakeholders, including the airlines, at no time was it ever 
suggested that their needs were to have an injection of foreign 
capital over the 25% limit. We have rejected increasing the limit 
over 25% because this government absolutely and fundamentally 
believes that the airline industry in Canada must be effectively 
controlled by Canadians. 
<P><A NAME="LINK65"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Val Meredith (South Surrey—White Rock—Langley,

airlines that compete with each other on domestic routes, even 
though one of them is 50% foreign owned.  Foreign ownership has 
provided Australians with healthy competition in its domestic 
market. The competition commissioner recommends that for Canada. 
Why is the minister refusing to consider it? 
<P><A NAME="LINK66"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of Transport, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, to compare Australia and Canada with respect to air 
policy is indeed wrong.  The population of Australia is smaller. 
It is somewhat isolated in the Pacific Ocean.  Australia does not 
live next door to the largest economy in the world with a 
population 10 times greater than the population of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is essential that we keep control of our own affairs. Keeping

is quoted as saying that his government has promised $900 million

farm aid assistance, not only is the amount of U.S. dollars 
impressive, but it is astonishing that cheques for the full 
amount are being placed in the hands of American farmers within a

itself did not want ad hoc payments being paid to everyone.  They 
wanted the money that was made available to the producers to be 
targeted to producers, to be specific to the producers and to be 
based on the producers' needs according to a set of criteria. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is the approach we take in Canada.  That is the approach of

of the criminal code that is permissive in that it condones the

means that unlike other consumers who must wait two years to 
declare bankruptcy, students must face additional hardship and 
discrimination.  The overwhelming majority of students do 
everything they can to repay student loans, but when bankruptcy 
becomes the only option the bill I am presenting today would 
ensure that students would get a fair deal and would not be

and of the amendment.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Grant McNally (Dewdney—Alouette, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I rise on a point of order.  I would like to ask for unanimous 
consent of the House for the following motion: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That, notwithstanding any standing order or usual practices of 
this House, the House continue to sit beyond the ordinary hour of 
daily adjournment today, but no later than 10 p.m. this day, for 
the sole purpose of continuing consideration of Bill C-9, an act 
to give effect to the Nisga'a final agreement. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  Does the hon. member for 
Dewdney—Alouette have unanimous consent of the House to propose 
the motion? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Agreed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  No. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  When the bill was last considered 
last evening, the hon. member for Nanaimo—Cowichan had the 
floor.  He had three minutes remaining in his remarks. 
<P><A NAME="LINK214"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Reed Elley (Nanaimo—Cowichan, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, in 
carrying over my closing remarks from yesterday's debate I wish 
to say that it is with the deepest regret that I must oppose the 
current Nisga'a agreement. I oppose it for three main reasons. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1530"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT19"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT19"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1530
<A HREF="#LINKT20"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border=0 alt="+"></A>
<A HREF="#LINKT18"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, if this treaty is truly a template for all other treaty 
negotiations, it does nothing to address the climate of mistrust 
and fear that exists at the band level between ordinary 
aboriginals and their band leaders.  Until the serious problem of 
band accountability is addressed, there is no guarantee that the 
proceeds of any treaty will actually get to the people who need 
it most. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, I do not believe that this bill is good for British 
Columbia.  Much has been said that the economy of B.C. will take 
on a new vibrancy after the passing of this bill.  Who can say 
this with any certainty?  Instead, I believe that this bill will 
increase confrontation over other outstanding aboriginal disputes 
in British Columbia.  If a businessman was looking for a place to 
invest his money, would he want to invest it in a B.C. like that? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Third, this bill is not in the best interests of Canada.  Look 
at what is really happening today.  The paternalistic environment 
created by the Indian Act and recent decisions by the courts all 
point to trouble ahead.  Look at what is happening with the 
Musqueam land in Vancouver, the east coast fishing dispute, and 
the controversy around the west coast fishing and logging rights. 
This agreement is a recipe for further disaster. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have three native children who are part of my family.  I love 
them very much, just as I love my other five children who are 
non-native.  We have made this work in our family because we love 
and trust each other. I want them to grow up in a country where 
they will not encounter prejudice because of the colour of their 
skin. However, I am afraid for them and for all of us.  I am 
afraid that this agreement paves the way for more confrontation 
rather than less, afraid that it does nothing to address the 
climate of fear and mistrust and corruption at the band level. I 
must therefore take my stand against this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In closing, I move the following amendment: 
<A NAME="LINK215">&nbsp;</A>
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That the amendment be amended by adding the following words: 
</UL><UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>and that the committee make a report to this House no later than 
June 5, 2000. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  I declare the subamendment to be in 
order. The debate is on the amendment to the amendment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Resuming debate.  I believe the hon. member for 
Nanaimo—Cowichan was the second member for ten minutes.  I will 
therefore recognize the hon. member for Kamloops, Thompson and 
Highland Valleys. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Duncan:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
I understand the member for Nanaimo—Cowichan was not on the 
second part of 20 minutes.  Mr. Speaker, you may want to ask him 
for clarification. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  The Chair has checked with the table 
officers. 
I should advise the hon. member for Vancouver Island North that 
during the debate last evening the last two speakers were the 
hon. member for Okanagan—Coquihalla and the hon. member for 
Nanaimo—Cowichan who just completed his remarks.  They 
apparently had split their time.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even if they had not, I believe, having had four speakers in a 
row from the hon. member's party, that it is time for a change as 
they say, if someone else wishes to speak and someone else does. 
Accordingly I recognize the hon. member for Kamloops, Thompson 
and Highland Valleys. 
<P><A NAME="LINK216"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Nelson Riis (Kamloops, Thompson and Highland Valleys, 
NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is a very real privilege to participate 
in today's debate on Bill C-9, an act implementing the Nisga'a 
agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have before me the Indian Act which this bill will do away 
with.  The Indian Act has a subtitle which states that it is an 
act respecting Indian people.  That is probably the most 
erroneous title one could have for this piece of legislation, 
because it does exactly the opposite.  It does not respect Indian 
people. It is an act filled with disrespect for Indian people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact that the Indian Act will now become redundant at least 
in the Nisga'a territory of British Columbia is probably one of 
the brighter things that has happened in a long time.  We say 
enough of this act that disrespects Indian people.  As we 
approach the 21st century, we look forward to beginning a new era 
in aboriginal and non-aboriginal affairs. Let us face it.  That 
has been long overdue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Way back in 1887 the Nisga'a people paddled their canoes from 
the northern part of British Columbia to what is now known as 
Victoria.  They asked the government for the opportunity to 
negotiate some kind of a settlement and they were rebuffed.  They 
were told to leave, that the officials could not be bothered with 
that. After paddling more than 1,000 kilometres down to Victoria, 
they had to paddle more than 1,000 kilometres back home empty 
handed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here we are 112 years later in the Parliament of Canada wrapping 
up a debate that will eventually see the Nisga'a people become 
self-determining, self-governing and self-reliant.  This has to 
be a major step forward for perseverance.  We have to acknowledge 
that the Nisga'a people have been very patient.  They have 
persevered.  Others would have long since given up, but they knew 
they were doing the right thing. They knew they had right on 
their side, which is a great motivator. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I said, 112 years later, and as we approach the new 
millennium, we are finally at the stage where we want to enact 
legislation that will see this treaty become law of the land. It 
is a treaty that was negotiated in good faith between the Nisga'a 
people, the province of British Columbia, because of the fact 
that it holds the resource rights, and the Government of Canada 
which has the fiduciary responsibility to support aboriginal 
people.  The three groups got together and over a prolonged 
period of time negotiated a treaty which we are in the process of 
ratifying today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To put this in some context, let us go back a few years to 
before the Europeans came to that part of British Columbia on the 
northwest coast.  The Nisga'a people were there.  That well 
established society had been there not for generations but for 
thousands of years. 
For thousands of years the Nisga'a people have lived in the Nass 
Valley and the surrounding area.  They were a very highly 
sophisticated society, self-sustaining and self-reliant. They 
were self-sufficient and self-governing.  They were prosperous 
and entrepreneurial.  It was a dynamic society.

<A HREF="#LINKT20"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Europeans then appeared on the scene. I say with some hesitancy 
and with some reluctance, that a form of ethnic cleansing took 
place.  At that time there were somewhere in the neighbourhood of 
30,000 Nisga'a people.  After a very short period of time that 
number was down to 800 individuals, the result of illness and all 
sorts of inappropriate behaviour on behalf of the European 
population. The Europeans set out to essentially exterminate the 
Nisga'a people. We call it ethnic cleansing today.  They were 
almost successful. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Thankfully we can now say that there are 6,000 Nisga'a people in 
the area and they are making a major comeback.  This legislation 
and this treaty is a major step forward in reversing this very 
negative process which took place over the last number of years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A large number of people should be acknowledged today.  I note 
that some of the speakers before me have done that. We should 
acknowledge some of the leaders in British Columbia and others 
from the Nisga'a people themselves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I personally want to acknowledge Joe Gosnell, the Nisga'a Tribal 
Council chief, who said the other day that this was an example of 
the Nisga'a now making their way into Canada. Let us think of 
this, making their way into Canada. A lot of people have said 
that obviously the Nisga'a have been part of Canada.  In fact, 
they have not been part of Canada like others have been part of 
Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>People say that they just want everybody to be treated equally, 
in other words, treated the same. It is clear when we look at our 
history first nations people were not treated the same as others. 
They were not treated equally. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When my ancestors first came from Norway many years ago, they 
were eligible to homestead on 160 acres of land virtually for 
free.  They did and they built the family farm and it is still in 
our family today.  They had that right. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Did Indian people have the right to do that?  Could they go out 
and buy 160 acres of land?  The answer is no.  They were not even 
able to hire a lawyer to advance their cause for what they called 
their treaty rights.  They were unable to hire a lawyer. It was 
actually against the law for them to do so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Could they, living on a reservation, go to the bank and get some 
money to start up a business and so on?   No.  Could they vote? 
The right to vote in a general election is a fundamental right in 
our society. It is embarrassing to say this but it was 1960 
before aboriginal people had the right to vote in our country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To say that everyone has been treated equally over the years 
could not be further from the truth.  First nations people have 
been treated very shoddily. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I mentioned a form of ethnic cleansing that took place in the 
western part of our country. I suppose the best example of ethnic 
cleansing is in the province of Newfoundland and Labrador where 
first nations were completely eliminated.  Not a single person 
was left from those early cultures. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a lot of catching up to do. One thing this bill and 
this treaty moves us toward in my judgment is that it will bring 
some stability and certainty to the decision making in that part 
of British Columbia.  It is not going to be the answer.  There is 
still a long way to go and much negotiation to complete. However, 
it is the beginning of bringing certainty to the landscape. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If there is one thing that capital does not like, it is 
uncertainty.  Capital will flee uncertainty.  If there is 
anything insecure about a particular place, we can rest assured 
that capital will not stay there very long.  That is one of the 
things happening in our country today.  A lot of good economic 
investment is not being made because of the uncertainty that 
surrounds the whole issue of land and the jurisdiction over land. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I say with some pride that I come from an area of British 
Columbia that is often referred to as the Shuswap nation, 
represented by the Shuswap people.  A number of reservations and 
a large number of people living in the towns and urban areas in 
this area have their tradition from the Shuswap central part of 
British Columbia.  They are very progressive bands on very 
progressive reservations and are doing relatively well.  Even in 
this area a number of issues remain outstanding because there is 
no effort at the moment to negotiate some kind of settlement. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1545"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT22"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT22"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1545

<A HREF="#LINKT21"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yes, there is a treaty process in British Columbia.  As an 
aside, some people have asked why we are concentrating so much on 
British Columbia.  As the European population came in contact 
with aboriginal peoples from the east coast, through the central 
part of Canada and out toward the west, they negotiated treaties 
with the native people.  The understanding was that with these 
treaties certain rights would go to the aboriginal people and 
certain rights to the newcomers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, that did not take place in British Columbia.  There 
were no treaties signed for all intents and purposes.  The 
European population basically came in and told the native people 
they were going to live on a little crummy piece of land while 
they would take all the rest.  Obviously the aboriginal people 
did not like that but the Europeans said that it was too bad 
because that was the way it was. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We had all sorts of forced relocation.  People were taken from 
their traditional territory and their traditional lands and told 
where to live.  Rest assured that although today those lands 
might be well located, in those days they were always the 
crummiest pieces of property, the most remote, swampiest and 
rockiest places that the others did not want.  That is where the 
first nations people ended up.  We forced them onto those lands. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I heard an awful lot about the great treatment the first nations 
people have experienced, of all the things they have received and 
about how we should all be treated equally.  If there is one 
aspect of growing up in recent times as a first nations people it 
was that period of time when, in the best interest of our 
churches primarily, they decided that children should not be part 
of first nations families, that the children should be taken out 
of the families, by force in many cases, and put into residential 
schools to get rid of their aboriginal, traditional and cultural 
ways and to drop their language. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Can anyone listening and watching television today imagine what 
it must have been like in those thousands and thousands of 
aboriginal families to have someone with a European background, 
who looked maybe like me, come in and say “I am taking your 
children away from you for the next 10 months and putting them in 
a residential school where they will not be able to ever speak 
their language?” 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Year after year those children grew up with no parents.  Not 
only did they grow up with no parents, they developed no 
parenting skills.  The parents were devastated and the children 
were devastated.  This went on time and time again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us face it, people who have had that kind of violence 
perpetuated on their families will not just drop it and forget it 
quickly.  It will probably be many generations before that kind 
of evil behaviour will be overcome. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we talk about aboriginal peoples being treated equally and 
fairly, let us remember what we perpetuated on those people. We 
took their children away from their homes, their parents, their 
grandparents and their loved ones and put them into a military 
style residential school.  We cannot understand the incredible 
human, emotional, psychological and spiritual impact that must 
have had on all those people.  However, that is what happened. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today we are trying to do what is right.  We are sitting down 
with aboriginal people and offering to negotiate a fair deal for 
everybody.  That is what Bill C-9 is all about.  Is it a perfect 
piece of legislation?  I have never seen a perfect piece of 
legislation, and since human beings negotiate legislation, I do 
not suppose we ever will. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, the Nisga'a people on balance have said they like the 
deal with 72% of them voting in favour of it.  The duly elected 
Government of British Columbia said it supported it. Today we are 
being asked whether we support it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What I can gather from the speeches being presented in the 
House, four out of the five political parties, representing the 
vast majority of the citizens of Canada, say we support 
implementation of the treaty. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1550"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT23"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT23"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1550

<A HREF="#LINKT22"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us acknowledge right up front that the treaty is not a 
perfect document.  However, I ask those who are naysayers to the 
process, I ask those who will one day vote against the 
legislation, what is it that they propose?  If we tell the native 
peoples of the country that we will not negotiate any treaties 
and will not acknowledge the uncertainty and instability that 
exists from coast to coast in all sorts of matters, then what do 
they propose? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This may not be the perfect process, but if the bill and the 
treaty do not proceed what kind of signal will that send out to 
aboriginal leaders, particularly militant aboriginal leaders, who 
are really frustrated at how slow the process has worked and is 
working across the country today?  This slowness has resulted in 
all sorts of things that we have seen in the last few weeks, in 
particular with the east coast fishery. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What choice do we have?  We have to do something.  This is what 
is before us.  For those who say that they do not want to support 
this, I challenge them to say what they are proposing we do as a 
country to resolve these outstanding issues and, most 
importantly, to bring certainty to aboriginal people and 
non-aboriginal people alike.  I think that is a fair challenge to 
put, particularly to my colleagues who are going to be voting 
against this and who do not like what the process is all about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In spite of what others have said, this is not a template.  This 
is not a border plate piece of negotiation that is going to apply 
elsewhere because first nations groups will not support it.  I 
represent the Shuswap area of my province.  Most of the bands in 
the Shuswap Nation do not support the Nisga'a agreement.  They 
agree that it is what the Nisga'a want and respect their right to 
decide on their own future, but the Shuswap Nation wants a lot 
better deal.  They want things that will be much different for 
them because they have a different culture with different 
expectations, requirements and so on.  This is not a template nor 
a border plate piece of legislation that we can apply willy-nilly 
to any piece of negotiation across the country. I felt this was 
one point that ought to be made. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, have we had adequate input into the process?  I know the 
debate today is on second reading, which is the way legislation 
proceeds.  From there it will go to a committee where experts, 
from a variety of backgrounds, will comment on the pros and cons 
of the treaty.  They will point out some of its strong points, 
presumably some of its weak points and some of the concerns 
people have.  The bill will then come back to the House for 
debate at report stage and then a final debate at the third 
reading stage before it goes on to the Senate where it will go 
through the same process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a fairly thorough process.  It has already gone through a 
pretty thorough process.  In my own area, we had a lot of 
meetings on the Nisga'a agreement.  There were over 500 
consultations on the Nisga'a agreement throughout British 
Columbia.  Yes, people have strong feelings.  Yes, many people 
have deep concerns based on, in my judgment, a lot of 
misconception because they have not studied the document 
carefully.  They have also been sort of conjuring up a mythology 
attached to the treaty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Nisga'a treaty was achieved within Canada's existing 
constitutional framework.  The Nisga'a government will be a 
democratic government for the Nisga'a community.  It will protect 
Nisga'a language, culture and property, promote the future 
prosperity and well-being of the Nisga'a people, and give the 
Nisga'a the control over their lands and destinies that most of 
us have had for a long time and have always taken for granted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It will not create an order of government apart from Canadian 
law and society.  As many people have indicated, the charter of 
rights and freedoms will continue to apply to the Nisga'a people. 
Federal and provincial laws, such as the criminal code or B.C.'s 
family relations act, will apply. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The treaty lays out those areas where the Nisga'a government 
will have the right to enact laws.  These laws will only prevail 
in matters internal to the Nisga'a people, important to their 
culture and essential to the operation of their government. In 
general, federal and provincial laws will continue to prevail. 
If there is a conflict between Nisga'a law and the laws of Canada 
or the laws of British Columbia, there is a dispute settlement 
mechanism that will be invoked.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the areas I want to emphasize in this agreement that 
non-aboriginal people in particular want to hear about is the 
issue of taxation and the extent to which certain aboriginal 
peoples do or do not pay taxes.  There is a lot of mythology 
around this area, but the reality is that in most cases people 
who work and make their livelihood from enterprises on the 
reservation do not pay income tax. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Nisga'a agreement will eventually end this.  After a 12 year 
phase-out period, Nisga'a people will pay taxes the same way 
other Canadians do.  If nothing else, this has to be an 
incredible breakthrough in terms of breaking the kind of mindset 
that exists between non-aboriginal people and aboriginal people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reliance of the Nisga'a people on transfers will be reduced 
over a time.  I suppose we can say that if there is a final goal 
it will be that the Nisga'a people will be as economically 
self-reliant as any other Canadian as a result of economic 
development and wealth growth in their territory. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am particularly proud to be part of a group of people who, 
after the process is completed, will vote in favour of the 
enabling legislation.  It is a good day for Canada, a good day 
for the Nisga'a people and a good day for the province of British 
Columbia.  The treaty will move us toward an element of 
certainty, predictability and stability in areas which are, at 
the moment, woefully wanting.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. David Iftody (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Indian Affairs and Northern Development, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I thank the member for his interventions today.  I think those 
people watching his dissertation would agree with me that he has 
spoken very well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For those Canadians who are watching the debate, I welcome the 
member's participation.  I have talked to him about this on 
several occasions.  I was quite delighted to see him speaking in 
the House today.  He is a veteran member of parliament from 
British Columbia and a member of the New Democratic Party.  He 
provides some insights and a different angle with respect to 
British Columbia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many members from rural British Columbia have repeatedly spoken 
against the deal in the House.  I want to ask the member why he 
thinks, feels, or believes that the Reform members, even those 
next door to him in his riding in British Columbia, have so 
strongly opposed what he and I both agree is a great deal for the 
people of British Columbia?  Could he elaborate on that 
complexity and misunderstanding with the Canadian people? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Nelson Riis:</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is not appropriate for 
me to speak on why representatives of other political parties do 
what they do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will say something that has made me rather curious in times 
past.  My Reform Party colleagues from British Columbia, who work 
hard in their constituencies, know the uncertainty surrounding 
the land issue in British Columbia when it comes treaty rights. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I kind of look ahead to the next provincial election which will 
be coming soon.  If there is a provincial election and a change 
of government, which is possible, and that new government throws 
out any concept of negotiating treaty rights or land claims with 
first nations peoples, that province will see complete chaos 
because it will appeal to the militant extremes on both sides of 
this question.

</I></B></P><P align=left>What has confounded me, and I say this with all due respect 
to my Reform friends, is that as a party that espouses a 
businesslike approach to issues, to do anything that would not 
advance the cause of certainty, security and predictability 
economically I think is folly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I suspect that I will have a question from my Reform friend 
next, so I will ask, for a political party that does not like 
these kinds of negotiations, that does not support this 
negotiation process, what is it that Reform members would suggest 
we do as a province and as a country to bring certainty and 
stability to these areas? 
<P><A NAME="LINK218"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Duncan (Vancouver Island North, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I listened attentively to the speech of the hon. member 
for Kamloops, Thompson and Highland Valleys.  There are obviously 
many areas where we disagree.  I am presumably the next one to 
speak and I think I will have trouble delivering everything in 
the time allotted, so I will ask the hon. member some questions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member is correct in stating that the Indian Act is 
gone, but one part remains, and that is the part that deals with 
who is an Indian, which is the very worst part of the Indian Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are many other concerns I would like to get to, one of 
which is the fact that we are here to represent a very educated 
public in British Columbia, a public which is more educated on 
this issue than those in any other part of Canada.  Has the 
member done any polling in his riding?  We have. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Nelson Riis:</B>  Mr. Speaker, let me make it clear to my 
friend that I am not a courier service.  I am not someone who 
exclusively takes the views of my constituents here, but that is 
part of it.  I have not taken a survey, but I suspect that the 
situation in my riding is relatively balanced.  Quite frankly, I 
am not a courier service.  We have Fed-Ex and we have EPS and 
others to take care of that.  Otherwise there would be no point 
in our being here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask my hon. friend, whom I respect greatly, when he stands to 
give his speech, condemning the process and the treaty, will he 
please offer what he is proposing as an alternative?  If what he 
is proposing as a clear alternative will not bring stability, an 
element of peace to the landscape and certainty to British 
Columbia, I say he is not doing this process a real service. 
Yes, he can criticize it.  Yes, there are problems with this 
treaty. It is not a perfect document.  However, what is it that 
he would propose in lieu of this? 
<P><A NAME="LINK219"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Hart (Okanagan—Coquihalla, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I listened with interest to the member for Kamloops, Thompson and 
Highland Valleys.  I presume the member owns a piece of property. 
I presume he lives in a community, on a street with other 
residential properties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am wondering if the member could explain to me why he would 
not want to see the Nisga'a people have the same rights to 
individual property as he enjoys and the people in his 
neighbourhood enjoy. Maybe then he could explain to me and to the 
House how he would feel if one day he was told that he did not 
have those individual property rights any more, but in fact there 
were communal rights to the property that he now enjoys.  Why 
would the member not want the Nisga'a people to have individual 
property rights just as other Canadians enjoy? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Nelson Riis:</B>  Mr. Speaker, let me use this as an 
opportunity, in case there is some misunderstanding, to say that 
when it comes to treaty settlement in British Columbia, private 
property itself is not on the table.  For the people who own 
private property in Kamloops or anywhere else, that property is 
not on the table in terms of being up for negotiation.  I want to 
make that clear, and I realize what my friend was asking. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We all enjoy collective rights.  Much of the municipality of 
Kamloops is a collective right that we enjoy. 
When it comes to individual territory, I look at the Kamloops 
Indian reserve, which is part of our city.  The same situation 
exists there.  Indian people on the Kamloops Indian reserve 
cannot own their property.  They can obtain rights to their 
property, which they do, whether it is a home, a business, a 
ranch or whatever.  That is what exists today.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not know where my friend wants to take this, but I 
challenge him and others, because people so far have not raised 
this and I am going to be here this afternoon to listen to them, 
that if members do not like this process, if they do not accept 
that first nations people should have their land and treaty 
rights negotiated—and I do not think the member suggests that 
they should be litigated—what is it that they would propose we 
do immediately to bring peace, stability and certainty to the 
British Columbian landscape? 
<P><A NAME="LINK220"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Stoffer (Sackville—Musquodoboit Valley—Eastern 
Shore, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the member from British Columbia, 
who is one of the most honoured colleagues in the House of 
Commons, with over 20 years of service to the Canadian public, 
knows very well that the Conservative and Liberal governments of 
before and today have constantly told the aboriginal people to 
pound sand and take their case to court. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a long time veteran of the House, could he advise the House 
as to why governments have constantly done that and why the 
Nisga'a treaty is so valuable in today's process? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Nelson Riis:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am glad my colleague has 
raised that issue.  What has frustrated so many over the years is 
the inability of governments to deal with these issues, in 
particular in British Columbia where we do not have any treaties 
in place to bring stability to the situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>People have been patient.  Aboriginal leaders have been patient 
in anticipation that there would be a process under way.  The 
government has set up some processes for treaty negotiation which 
I think are completely inadequate.  There is growing frustration 
from coast to coast to coast that these issues are not being 
addressed seriously and adequately.  There is increased tension 
on both the aboriginal and non-aboriginal sides and the situation 
is getting out of control. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I pose again, not so much rhetorically but as a very serious 
question to my Reform friends, that if this is not the approach 
to bringing certainty economically, in terms of the business 
climate in British Columbia, what else is there?  If negotiations 
will not resolve this, the only other alternative is litigation. 
We have seen what that does, in particular most recently on the 
east coast of Canada.  Litigation is not the answer to solving 
these issues.  There have to be people sitting down at the table, 
negotiating something that is fair and equitable for everyone. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  Before I call for resumption of 
debate on the motion, I should advise the House that the time for 
20 minute speeches with 10 minutes of questions and comments has 
expired.  We will now start 10 minute speeches with no questions 
or comments. 
<P><A NAME="LINK221"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Duncan (Vancouver Island North, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I have a point of clarification.  The time before which 
I would have to speak and still get 20 minutes was 3.53 p.m.   We 
are past that time.  I have had a challenge posed to me by the 
member from Kamloops.  I fully would like to respond to his 
questions.  Could I ask the House if I could speak for more than 
10 minutes and no longer than 20 minutes? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  Is there unanimous consent to allow 
the hon. member to speak for 20 minutes instead of 10 minutes? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Agreed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  No. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Duncan:</B>  Mr. Speaker, this is very frustrating 
indeed.  For those people who are watching, I am going to give 
them my website, which is www.duncanmp.com.  I do offer proposals 
as to how to do this differently.  I have been doing that since 
1996 with regard to the Nisga'a agreement, prior to it becoming 
an agreement in principle.  I also have been making suggestions 
in aboriginal policy areas since 1994. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I cannot help but respond to the previous speaker.  We obviously 
have a different vision, but we both want to fix what is wrong in 
the area of aboriginal issues. 
We both agree that the native population has received shoddy 
treatment.  I would be the last one to say that has not been the 
case.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Reform believes that equality is created by treating everyone 
equally, unlike the NDP and the Liberals.  They consider it a 
criticism of us that we want to treat everyone equally.  I 
believe that is a fundamental philosophical difference that will 
forever separate us and is what separates us on this agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member from Kamloops talked about residential schools.  My 
wife went to a residential school.  I do not need any lessons on 
that issue from anyone. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A bit of time was spent talking about the taxation issue.  I 
will simply say that, yes, individual taxation exemptions for the 
Nisga'a under the agreement will be phased out over 12 years, but 
there was a whole new tax exemption brought into the agreement 
and that is for the Nisga'a central government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We did not need a treaty to get out from under the tax exemption 
differential that exists in this country.  We could have done it 
legislatively.  It all flows from section 87 of the Indian Act. 
It is a very simple thing to fix. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I could talk about the Nisga'a agreement for hours, but I am 
going to focus on only one aspect because my time is limited.  I 
want to talk about public consultation.  If I have time I will 
offer some proposals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was the aboriginal affairs critic in the last parliament.  I 
did the first publicly available comprehensive analysis of the 
Nisga'a agreement in principle.  I did that in early 1996, after 
the agreement in principle came out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals would have the public believe that Reform has not 
dealt with or had discussions with the public, stakeholders or 
the Nisga'a.  The Liberals are revising history and I can prove 
it.  I have a track record of having dealt with the agreement 
before it was ever unveiled and of having discussions with the 
public and stakeholders, including the Nisga'a, which is contrary 
to the revisionist history and statements being made in the 
current debate coming from Liberals with their public relations 
spin. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals are trying to revise history.  I am revisiting 
history.  There is a big difference. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Reform MPs in British Columbia, including our current critic, 
have been talking about the Nisga'a agreement since 1994.  We are 
on the public record, especially in British Columbia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The only body given official standing as adviser for the Nisga'a 
treaty was the provincial treaty negotiation advisory committee. 
The public was excluded other than through this formal committee. 
I can demonstrate that that committee was also excluded from the 
process by both the federal and provincial governments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have not erected barriers, but the two senior governments, 
provincially and federally, certainly have.  The manipulation of 
their so-called public consultation has been ongoing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the Nisga'a agreement in principle was unveiled in February 
1996, a member of TNAC, the committee I just talked about, said 
publicly: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can't say we worked on this document, because we never saw it 
until February 15, just hours before it was initialled.  Not one 
page, not one paragraph of this 150-page document was shared with 
TNAC, the government's Treaty Negotiation Advisory Committee, or 
any of the local advisory committees, or any of the people with 
legal interests in the Crown Land that this agreement would give 
to the Nisga'a. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is what the forestry representative said.  If the very 
people who were paid to know the contents of the negotiations 
were kept in the dark, we know where the average British 
Columbian was.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Long before the agreement was initialled we knew it consisted of 
some leaks and from these leaks we prepared an analysis.  We took 
that analysis and other speculations on the road.  We visited 10 
towns across British Columbia and conducted townhall meetings. We 
talked about self-government, tax exemptions and other matters 
that we thought were the direction of the government.  It was 
sponsored by the current aboriginal affairs critic and me. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Nisga'a and other aboriginal groups attended some of these 
meetings.  Representatives from the Department of Indian Affairs 
and Northern Development, its bureaucrats, were also in 
attendance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Later in the same year, in November 1995, I held another series 
of townhall meetings to follow up on the earlier meetings.  I 
remember driving through a blizzard 2,000 kilometres in 36 hours 
to hold two meetings.  We met in Nanaimo, Prince George, Terrace, 
Penticton, South Surrey and Maple Ridge.  Once again there were 
aboriginal representatives and Nisga'a representatives 
particularly in Terrace, which is in the front yard of the 
Nisga'a. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My office prepared a 37 page analysis which was published as a 
tabloid and sent to half a million households in British Columbia 
in the middle of 1996.  After the Nisga'a final agreement came 
out that analysis was revised.  It can be found on my website 
today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The province talks about consultation.  The province got into 
the act with the so-called consultation in 1996.  Everyone in the 
public thought that they were going to something which would 
allow them to say what parts of the Nisga'a agreement were okay 
in their minds and what parts were not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What did the government do?  It changed the terms of reference. 
The public was to tell it what parts of the agreement could be 
negotiated in other treaties and what could not be.  This was 
done by a very biased chair of the committee.  I will quote from 
something he said to give clarity to my charge that it was 
biased.  He said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am just in awe, really.  I've been around, federally; I've been 
in constitutional negotiations and so on.  I don't know what 
the...I keep thinking about the Fathers of Confederation as they 
call them, or whatever the words, putting together the BNA Act 
and so on.  The amount of work you people have done in this is 
really quite unbelievable. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>He was talking to the Nisga'a negotiators.  He continued: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>You're to be really commended...We are coming at it kind of as 
amateurs seeing your work.  I guess that's a long way of saying 
I'm very impressed. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is it any wonder that the B.C. Liberals walked away from the 
process?  Obviously no substantive criticism ever came from that 
committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Essentially the public has been excluded by both senior 
governments.  The rationale behind separating the Nisga'a treaty 
process from the B.C. treaty process was that the Nisga'a treaty 
predated the creation of the B.C. Treaty Commission.  That is how 
we ended up with the only sanctioned body being this treaty 
negotiation advisory committee.  I have already mentioned how it 
was excluded. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is fair for me to say that our current critic has had ongoing 
dialogue with the Nisga'a and other interests throughout.  We 
have been participants in public consultation.  I know, for 
example, that he had a televised debate with Chief Gosnell from 
the Nisga'a nation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If one is to be critical of an agreement, I agree with the hon. 
member from Kamloops that there is an obligation to provide 
constructive criticism.  I will not deal with that part of my 
speech, suffice it to say that members should visit my website.

Since the member who just spoke is clearly one of the most 
knowledgeable people in parliament on this issue, I would ask 
again for unanimous consent to give him another 10 minutes. I 
think it is important to do that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  Is there unanimous consent to extend

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Greg Thompson (New Brunswick Southwest, PC):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, it is a pleasure today to speak to Bill C-9, an act to 
give effect to the Nisga'a final agreement.  My colleagues from 
South Shore and Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough have already 
spoken on this ratifying legislation and I am pleased to have an 
opportunity to speak on it today.  I will pretty well stick to my 
script.  I do not want to be sidetracked because I want to make 
sure my remarks are on record. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Nisga'a final agreement offers new opportunities to the 
approximately 3,000 Nisga'a people living in the upper Nass 
Valley region of British Columbia, opportunities they will be 
able to realize because of the agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform Party has been vocal on its position on the Nisga'a 
final agreement, a position which contradicts that of every other 
opposition party.  The arguments it has put forth have been 
misleading and serve only to confuse the issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Nisga'a people have worked hard to reach a negotiated 
settlement with the provincial and federal governments.  Some 61% 
of them approved the agreement in the referendum last year. The 
provincial government in British Columbia did the same in April 
of this year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are three ways that parties often use to try to reach 
agreements, some better than others.  For instance, we all 
witnessed what can happen when violent confrontation is used as a 
negotiating ploy and how destructive it can be to any peaceful 
and reasoned process that may already be in place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Oka a few years ago we all saw how quickly such tactics could 
get out of hand.  No one wants to participate in that kind of 
demonstration.  It ultimately delays any agreement and does 
nothing to develop peaceful, effective and harmonious relations. 
It does not matter whom we are talking about.  Violent 
confrontation seldom accomplishes the intended objective and does 
not effectively lead us to peaceful negotiations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The same type of confrontation was seen recently involving the 
Burnt Church first nation of New Brunswick.  We all know the 
Marshall decision recognizes treaty fishing rights for Mi'kmaq, 
Maliseet and Passamaquoddy people.  Since that September 17 
ruling there has been confusion and unrest in some communities in 
the Atlantic region. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Confrontations between aboriginal and non-aboriginal fishermen 
and community members only emphasize the problems that exist in 
finding a long term solution to the matter.  The violence that we 
witnessed at Burnt Church resulted from a lack of leadership and 
a lack of involvement of stakeholders in any kind of a process to 
outline how the fishery would operate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are only three ways to reach agreement.  The second one is 
through the court system where judges determine how parties will 
interact.  As we have seen in the Marshall case, this does not 
necessarily provide the most effective agreement but instead 
provides guidelines for future negotiations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would argue that the court system has a place in society in 
establishing common ground among parties or overcoming bias and 
discrimination that may otherwise exist.  It does not establish a 
solid basis of mutual respect for future negotiations.  Instead, 
the parties involved know the limitations imposed and must work 
within such a framework to establish an agreement that satisfies 
not only the court's requirements but the objectives of each 
party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Marshall decision opened the door for more aboriginal 
involvement in the fishery in Atlantic Canada.  What has been 
lacking, and I emphasize it, is direction from the federal 
government on how to implement such a decision.  That 
responsibility has fallen to the people involved: aboriginal 
fishermen, non-aboriginal fishermen, community groups and other 
stakeholders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have already seen in Atlantic Canada some agreement on how 
the fishery will operate and when and where aboriginal fishers 
will take part in the fishery in the short term. 
This was not the result of the federally appointed negotiator's 
involvement, but the desire on the part of stakeholders to have a 
peaceful, clear and concise agreement on what will happen in the 
fishery.

<A HREF="#LINKT29"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This leads me to the third point that negotiations are the best 
means of reaching agreements like the one we are debating today. 
Negotiation is the most effective means because all the parties 
involved are there for one reason, and that is to formulate the 
best settlement they can, recognizing the limits, objectives and 
aspirations that each party brings to the table. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Nisga'a final agreement provides the Nisga'a people with 
almost 2,000 kilometres of land and $190 million to be paid over 
a 15 year time period.  It provides a commercial fishery and a 
resource ownership including forestry and mining opportunities. 
The Nisga'a people will establish a Nisga'a Lisms government and 
will begin paying taxes, an important word in the House, on a 
phased-in approach over 12 years.  The Nisga'a will also have a 
constitution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to take a moment to discuss the fisheries aspect of 
the final agreement.  Under the agreement the Nisga'a people will 
receive a percentage of the Nass River salmon stocks and money 
toward buying into the commercial fishery.  Conservation remains 
paramount, however, for all aboriginal fishing rights.  As with 
the lobster fishery on the east coast, if stocks do not meet 
minimum levels established by the Minister of Fisheries and 
Oceans, no one including aboriginal fishers may fish. 
Conservation must remain paramount. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The provisions of the treaty are the result of years of 
negotiation which have finally culminated in the treaty or 
agreement we have today.  The ratifying legislation we are 
debating is the final step before the Nisga'a people assume the 
obligations and, another key word, responsibilities entailed 
within the agreement.  The agreement was negotiated on a nation 
to nation basis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform Party suggests that the agreement will be a template 
for other agreements, particularly in B.C. where there are 50 
outstanding land claim agreements.  While a number of the basic 
concepts contained within the treaty may provide a foundation for 
future agreements, the nation to nation concept precludes this 
from being an actual template for other agreements. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Each first nation will arrive at the negotiating table with 
different objectives and will negotiate from a different 
perspective.  Social conditions, geographic location and 
financial circumstances will all play a role in what future 
agreements will look like and how they will be reached. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important to note that the agreement was reached 
peacefully.  I am sure the Nisga'a people and other negotiators 
would like to have seen the process concluded a long time ago. 
They have been working a long time to bring certainty and closure 
to the issue.  However, they can be very proud of the fact that 
they did it effectively and peacefully and that harmonious 
relations among the three parties will prevail. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform Party has tried to minimalize and degrade the efforts 
of the Nisga'a people in reaching and ratifying the agreement. 
They have made assertions that the charter of rights and freedoms 
does not apply, that it is a race based government and that 
non-Nisga'a people will be taxed without representation.  All 
these statements are wrong, false and very misleading.  The 
Nisga'a final agreement clearly states that the charter of rights 
and freedoms continues to apply to the Nisga'a people.  The 
agreement states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms applies to Nisga'a 
Government in respect of all matters within its authority, 
bearing in mind the free and democratic nature of Nisga'a 
Government as set out in this Agreement. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Nisga'a people will not tax non-Nisga'a people living on 
Nisga'a lands and non-Nisga'a people will continue to vote in 
municipal, provincials and federal elections.  As well, 
non-Nisga'a people will have voting privileges where their 
interests are affected by Nisga'a law.  More important, they will 
have more rights than currently exist under the Indian Act where 
non-aboriginal people have no opportunity to vote. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Nisga'a final agreement will be the first modern day treaty 
in B.C.  I commend the Nisga'a people for their perseverance in 
seeing the agreement to its conclusion.

the role of each party involved and that are negotiated with the

negotiation can be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  It is my duty pursuant to Standing 
Order 38 to inform the House that the question to be raised 
tonight at the time of adjournment is as follows:  the hon. 
member for Surrey Central, Aboriginal affairs. 
<P><A NAME="LINK223"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt—Juan de Fuca, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, of all the issues we will be dealing with in this 
parliament this issue will have the most profound impact on the 
state of our nation now and for the next 20 years.  With a 
combination of our collective guilt and a recognition of the 
appalling conditions that exist on aboriginal lands and for 
aboriginal people both on and off reserve, we are pursuing a 
course with the Nisga'a deal that will carve up this country.  It 
will balkanize our nation and do little to improve the health and 
welfare of aboriginal people in this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This deal is an extension of the racist Indian Act which has 
acted like a lodestone around the necks of aboriginal people and 
which has ensured that they cannot develop as non-aboriginals 
have.  It is nothing other than the continuation of separate 
development. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the past decade I worked in South Africa during the dark days 
of apartheid.  I saw the appalling conditions under separate 
development.  I have been privileged to work with aboriginal 
people both on and off reserve.  I have seen them raped. I have 
seen them assaulted. I have seen them overdose, some successfully 
and some unsuccessfully. I have seen their children abused. I 
have seen their bodies broken and their spirits destroyed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is the direct result of the separate development we have 
pursued for more than 120 years.  Whether we are speaking about 
South Africa under apartheid or Canada under the Indian Act, both 
engaged in separate development and were equal failures. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Nisga'a deal is nothing but an extension and an entrenchment 
of the same type of separate development.  It will do very little 
to improve the health and welfare of these people.  In fact, 
Canada is engaging in apartheid today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Nisga'a deal represents more than 16 different powers that 
supersede the federal and provincial powers.  As my colleague 
from the Progressive Conservatives mentioned, this is a deal 
nation to nation.  It cannot be looked at in isolation for there 
are 50 other so-called deals that will be made in British 
Columbia.  So far those claims represent 110% of the land mass of 
B.C.  The rest of Canada cannot be complacent in believing this 
will not affect them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Delgamuukw decision said very clearly that aboriginal title 
was not extinguished. The implicit nature of the decision was 
that oral tradition would be equal to written tradition and there 
has been an opening up of treaties from coast to coast.  This 
will have the profound impact of balkanizing our nation.  It will 
divide it up into mini states where rights are not given to the 
individual but are given to the collective. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Part of the problem we have had is that individual rights have 
never been given to aboriginal people.  As a result, powers have 
been given to the collective.  This cannot be underestimated.  We 
have been doing this for years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some $6.5 billion per year and $3.5 billion goes directly to 
more than 600 bands representing over a quarter of a million 
aboriginal people who are suffering from the same or worse 
conditions today than they were 10, 20 or 30 years ago.  They 
have the highest rates of suicide, substance abuse, unemployment, 
diabetes and tuberculosis.  By many other parameters they have 
the worst conditions in this country, conditions that approach 
those of the third world. That is what separate development has 
done for aboriginal people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are going beyond that.  The courts are now developing 
separate rules.  Under the courts, an aboriginal person would be 
treated differently from a non-aboriginal person for committing 
the same offence. Is it right for an aboriginal person who has 
committed a murder or another serious offence to go back into the 
community because it is the right thing to do from the court's 
perspective?

<A HREF="#LINKT31"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is exactly what happened recently on a reserve that I 
worked on.  Somebody who had committed murder, not once but on 
two separate occasions, was being released into the very 
community where the murder had been committed.  Where is the 
justice for the aboriginal people, for the victims who live in 
that environment?  The family members of the murdered woman were 
mortally afraid that the person who murdered one of their own was 
going to come back again.  That is what happened in the judicial 
system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We all care about this issue very much.  There is not a person 
in this House who wants to see the aboriginal people continue 
living under the conditions that they have been living.  We all 
want to see an improvement.  We all want to work with them.  But 
the difference between the Reform Party and the rest of the House 
is that we do not want to participate in the same separate 
development that has compromised the ability of aboriginal people 
to live lives of freedom, to live lives of security and to live 
lives of hope. We want that for them as they want that for 
themselves but some things have to happen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One, we have to scrap the racist Indian Act.  It has acted like 
a lodestone around the necks of aboriginal people for so long. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Two, there has to be one law for all people.  If we have 
different laws for different people, we have no law at all.  How 
can aboriginal people on and off reserve have any faith in a 
judicial system that is going to treat them differently from 
other people? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Three, we have to invest in education and health care for these 
people so that they will be able to stand on their own feet. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>No matter what our racial group is, we cannot get pride and 
self-respect unless we take it and we cannot take it without 
being self-sufficient.  People must be able to provide for 
themselves, their families and their communities.  No one is 
going to give that to them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The aboriginal leadership has to start behaving like leaders. 
Some leaders have done an excellent job and many have not.  More 
than 150 aboriginal bands out of some 600 have been investigated 
for gross mismanagement of funds.  The reason is rooted in the 
fact that funds are going directly to the leadership and not to 
the people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Pacheenaht band is in my riding.  The hereditary chief and 
people on the reserve are trying to find out about what is going 
on in their band, about decisions that are made by the 
leadership. They were told that they could not have that 
information.  I stood right beside them when they were promised 
that information but it was not given to them. I asked the Indian 
affairs minister to please help this group. The department said 
it could not intervene, that it was a band issue.  Who is going 
to defend these grassroots aboriginal people when their own 
leadership is not going to bat for them?  That is what is 
happening. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We see these people on the ground, the horror of children 
falling into open sinkholes. The ministry will not give them 
money because the band has the money but the band is not giving 
them the money.  These people have absolutely no recourse and 
nowhere to go for help. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We cannot do it by giving collective rights to a group.  We have 
to give it to the individual.  That is critically important. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We want to ensure that people have independence.  But do we 
really need to have political independence to ensure economic 
emancipation?  That is what this is about.  We have not been able 
to help the aboriginal people to work together with us to engage 
in economic emancipation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Everybody here who speaks with aboriginal people knows they want 
to have what everybody else has, congruent with their customs and 
rights which are protected under the constitution and the 
charter, thankfully.  Thankfully, they can still engage in their 
rights and traditions and enrich and empower us and teach us 
about what they have. Following that line does not absolve us of 
ensuring that an aboriginal person is treated the same as a 
non-aboriginal person, that an aboriginal person will have the 
same opportunity as a non-aboriginal person. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The department of Indian affairs spent $6.5 billion and has very 
little to show for it.  Money is sucked up by the bureaucracy. 
Imagine developing a new layer of government, which is what this 
Nisga'a agreement and others are going to do.

<A HREF="#LINKT32"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>A huge amount of money will go into other bureaucracies at the 
provincial and federal levels to interface, non-aboriginal groups 
with the aboriginal governments.  Would it not be better to use 
that money to ensure the aboriginal people have the improvements 
in health care, education, welfare and housing that they 
desperately need?  Why are we putting money into a bureaucratic 
solution when these people need a solid solution? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In closing, I can only impress upon every member and every 
Canadian that this is the most important decision the House will 
have made in four years. Please do not take it lightly.  Please 
let us work toward a common objective of ensuring that we will 
have the power to work together, aboriginals and non-aboriginals, 
to build a future we can share and work in as equals congruent 
with our customs and traditions.  It is the fair thing to do. 
Pursuing this Nisga'a treaty will only end in the balkanization 
of Canada and apartheid in Canada. 
<P><A NAME="LINK224"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ted White (North Vancouver, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the 
amendment before the House at the moment is to institute a six 
month delay on the bill.  I would like to approach the discussion 
from the angle of representation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When asked about the fact that the polls in B.C. clearly showed 
that a majority of people were opposed to this deal, the member 
for Kamloops, Thompson and Highland Valleys said that he did not 
want to be a courier to this place or what would be the point of 
being here.  There was a time, in a former lifetime perhaps, when 
the NDP prided itself in being representatives of the people or 
what was the point of being here.  That marks a major departure 
in political philosophy between the NDP and the Reform Party.  We 
feel we have an obligation to represent the concerns of the 
people of B.C. in this place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>From a philosophical position I can understand why the NDP would 
support a socialist structure of government, which is certainly 
the structure that is to be set up by the Nisga'a deal.  But the 
evidence from all around the world is that socialism does not 
work.  It depresses the people.  It suppresses initiative and it 
always results in a lower standard of living.  I think we can see 
that in what has happened with existing treaties on reserves 
across Canada.  In fact, I would challenge any member in this 
place to show any treaty passed in the last 200 years that has 
resulted in a higher standard of living for people on reserves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In terms of representation, why has the government side not 
bothered to ask those Nisga'a who voted against the deal why they 
are opposed to it?  If it had taken the time to do so, it would 
have discovered that the opponents are afraid that the treaty 
will entrench a system which will confer benefits on a few at the 
expense of many, particularly at the expense of individual 
rights. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As my colleague from Esquimalt—Juan de Fuca said a few moments 
ago, it smacks of segregation.  I can tell the House that 
literally dozens of immigrants from South Africa who live in my 
riding have phoned and written to me to tell me that they call it 
apartheid.  They pull no punches about it.  They told me on the 
telephone, in person and in letters that they do not understand 
why Canada is pursuing exactly the same course that they were 
criticized for in South Africa.  The whole world reacted against 
South Africa and imposed sanctions. They do not understand why we 
are going down the same road. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Speakers from other parties asked us what Reform would have done 
to solve these problems.  Let me put in a suggestion based on 
representation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the people of B.C. had been asked or allowed to vote and 
indicate to their government whether they agreed to land being 
involved, whether there should be individual or collective 
rights, whether there should be money transferred, and the basics 
of treaty making had been passed in some sort of referendum in 
the province of B.C., the politicians would have had the mandate 
to go ahead and negotiate a treaty. It would have been endorsed 
and supported by all of the people of B.C.  That did not happen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today we have a situation where poll after poll in B.C. is 
showing strong opposition to the agreement. 
In fact in the ridings of Liberal MPs in this House, Vancouver 
Centre and Vancouver South—Burnaby, up to 70% and 80% of the 
people are opposed to the Nisga'a deal.

<A HREF="#LINKT33"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is just not good enough to say that they do not want to be 
couriers to this place.  They should be coming here, standing in 
the House and saying why the people in their ridings are opposed 
to it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Instead, we have a situation where all of the other parties are 
attacking Reform, and completely unfairly.  We saw today in 
question period a member of the PC party standing to ask a 
question about the Mi'kmaq and the lobster fishers on the east 
coast.  There was not a single word of criticism or an attack 
against the PCs for expressing tremendous concern about what is 
happening in their ridings. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Look at what has happened in the House over the last six years. 
The member for Delta—South Richmond, five and six years ago, 
talked about the illegal fishing that was going on in the Fraser 
River and all of the fish that were being sold illegally in B.C. 
by native fishers.  He was attacked.  We were labelled as bigots 
and that other <I>r</I> word that I am not allowed to use in this 
House.  We were attacked for representing our constituents.  Now 
it is happening on the east coast. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps it is a little wake up call for the government and for 
everyone who does not understand what is going on in B.C.  They 
will share in the strife if they continue with the process of 
setting up governments based on race. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Over 90% of all Indian bands in the country are in B.C.  People 
who live anywhere else in the country, who have not experienced 
the difficulties, do not have even the slightest concept of what 
is happening in B.C. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberal Party of B.C. fought this bill tooth and nail as it 
went through the legislature in British Columbia.  It even filed 
a court case, claiming that this bill was unconstitutional.  The 
fact that it was rammed through by the NDP government has put an 
aura of mistrust in place.  The people of B.C. do not trust the 
NDP government.  Just the fact that it was rammed through by the 
NDP is a bad mark for the deal.  It would have been much better 
had the people of B.C. been allowed some say in it.  The member 
for Vancouver Island North went into great detail about the 
process and how flawed it was. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have on my desk many newspaper articles written by people who 
could not be labelled with the <I>r</I> word or called bigots or 
extremists.  Barbara Yaffe, Rafe Mair, Gordon Gibson and many 
commentators in British Columbia have written about this treaty. 
A headline in one of Barbara Yaffe's columns read “Reality check 
for the Liberals:  alienation is real and justified”.  She went 
on to criticize the Prime Minister's task force and to explain 
why segregation based on race is not the way to go with Indian 
land claims. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another column by Barbara Yaffe was entitled “Special rights 
for natives threaten our otherwise civil society”, and she 
related the Mi'kmaq situation to what is happening now in British 
Columbia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Rafe Mair wrote: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>A pall of madness has settled over the province of British 
Columbia and will soon spread across the country.  Our 
representatives, both provincial and federal, have utterly 
betrayed our interests.  We have, with the Nisga'a agreement now 
before Parliament, ensured there will be at least 50 
semi-autonomous “nations” in B.C. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Despite what you may be told, these will not just be native 
“municipalities”.  Nisga'a sets up a separate style of 
government to which powers, reserved for the federal and 
provincial governments, will be permanently ceded.  Does all this 
really mean anything?  You bet it does.  It means that in British 
Columbia there will be between 50 and 75 “nations” that will 
govern themselves with constitutions, not on the level of 
municipalities but as part of the power-sharing process envisaged 
by the Constitution of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>And B.C.'s voters have also specifically rejected the Nisga'a 
treaty when given the chance.  Since the B.C. government refused 
to hold a province-wide referendum, some B.C. citizens' groups 
held their own instead.  Earlier this year, 7,200 Prince George 
residents...voted on the Nisga'a treaty and more than 97% cast 
their vote against it.  Residents of the northern region of 
Vancouver Island...said no to the tune of 97%.  A poll in 
Ladner-Tswassen found 93% of 3,400 voters against the treaty. The 
turnout itself was damming:  Two weeks later a school board 
election was held in a nearby area with twice as many voters as 
were eligible for the Nisga'a vote.  There, only 2,600 people 
showed up to cast ballots.

It illustrates and demonstrates beautifully what is happening in 
B.C. at the moment, why the Reform Party is so vigorously 
opposing it and why the member for Kamloops should be doing the 
same thing.  He is not just a courier.  He owes it to his 
constituents to bring their concerns to this place. 
<P><A NAME="LINK225"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Philip Mayfield (Cariboo—Chilcotin, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I am pleased to join my colleagues of the House in this 
debate, and particularly the members of my party who are standing 
to oppose the treaty which is before the House for ratification. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It has been interesting to listen to opposition and government 
members talk about the treaty.  I hear them say that they have 
been there, they have seen this.  I remember one of the Bloc 
members even describing the colour of the Nass River and I 
wondered what insight he had obtained on this treaty from the 
colour of the river. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have spent some time on a reserve.  After my university, 
seminary work and ordination I was the minister, or the 
missionary to use the traditional term, at an Indian village on 
the west coast.  During the orientation, before I took that 
posting, I was told that I may think I would go there with my 
university work behind me, with my study of sociology, 
anthropology and the course work on native Indians, particularly 
in British Columbia, and I may have lived next door to reserves 
as a boy on ranches for virtually all my life; however, I was 
told that I did not know anything about what I would be doing and 
would not know until I had been there for two or three years, and 
that I would then begin to know. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I had a position to fill on that reserve, a place in the 
community, but understanding the people and their traditions only 
began to come when there was some way of hearing their stories 
and experiencing the familiarity between people that comes with 
sharing at that deeper level. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>People who have been close to native Indian people, who 
understand the hardship and the effects of their powerlessness, 
understand also that they live in a power structure and most of 
the people in that power structure have not had the opportunity 
to exercise that power.  There is power, but most people do not 
have an opportunity to put their hands on it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Something else I have heard in the debate is that under this 
treaty people can own property.  That is true, they can.  The 
difficulty is that individual property rights come with power and 
those property rights come as that power is given to them. 
However, there is no guarantee that there will be individual 
property rights.  Without those property rights and power, native 
Indian people will never have the resources they need to insist 
upon their rights. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How important are property rights?  I will tell a story or two 
from my own personal experience.  The first story begins probably 
before I was born. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remember a friend of my father's who was a resident on one of 
the reserves near our home.  His mother had a piece of property. 
Traditionally she had owned it.  She had tried unsuccessfully to 
get title to it.  His mother died. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will not use names because these people are still living and 
still do not have the power to protect themselves.

<A HREF="#LINKT35"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This man wanted to own his mother's property.  I remember, as a 
friend of my father's, they would discuss how this might be 
accomplished.  I lost track of this story, but interestingly 
enough this man was one of the first constituents to come to see 
me in my office after I was elected as a member of parliament. 
It was a great reunion.  I had not seen him for a long time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said “I am here for a reason.  Do you know that property of 
my mother's?”  He showed me all the papers of all the 
applications, rejections and the difficulty he had in getting the 
money. Finally it all came together and he got title to that 
property. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>After that he included it in the reserve lands.  The reason he 
came to see me was to see if there was some way he could get 
control of his property again because now the band owned it and 
the band would not let him use his own property for which he had 
worked so many years to get title to. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my mind this relates pointedly to the need for property 
rights for individuals.  Band members should be able to own their 
property, use it as they wish, buy it, sell it, mortgage it and 
take full advantage of it for themselves.  Unfortunately this 
piece of property is still beyond the grasp of my father's old 
friend, but he is still working at it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also want to talk about property rights in a way that 
currently affects many native people.  Native people know the 
value of the vote.  They know that without being able to vote 
they do not have any power at all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A man came to my constituency office and said “When I left my 
village I lost my house.  Somebody else began to live in it.  Now 
I want to go back.  I went back to vote, but I was told that I 
did not have a house, that I did not live there, so I could not 
vote.  So I said that I would like to have my house back and they 
said that was not possible”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a man who was caught in the catch-22 of not being able 
to vote unless he had his property, but he could not get his 
property so that he could vote.  He is a very unhappy person.  I 
see this man regularly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to talk about another instance where property rights are 
important.  A man on a reserve in my constituency has 
agricultural land.  He liked to cut and sell the hay.  He had an 
agreement with one of the local ranchers who needed that hay. 
For a long time this agreement worked.  The hay was cut, it was 
hauled to the ranch, the money went to the man who cut the hay 
and did the work.  One day the chief of the reserve said to the 
rancher “The hay is coming from reserve land.  The money that 
you pay belongs to the band, not to the individual, so I will be 
taking the cheque”.  The rancher checked it out and that is what 
he had to do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Needless to say, the man who did the work, who put the sweat 
into the effort, did not get the money and he does not cut hay 
any more.  He has lost a big part of his livelihood simply 
because he did not have the right to the property and the right 
to take payment for the work that he had done on land that he 
considered his own. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a minister on the reserve on the west coast one of the things 
that I discovered was that, according to the west coast reserves, 
there are a whole variety of little reserves up and down the 
coast, usually at the mouths of rivers or at points of land, 
places where it is reasonably easy to beach a boat.  These 
traditionally belong to individuals and to families.  They are 
passed down through families. 
I would not want to suggest that they go from father to son 
because that is not always the way it is done in native Indian 
culture.  However, to say that the Indian people have no concept 
of private property and no concept of the right to private 
property is not correct.  I know of native Indian people who own 
land on reserves in their name and it is held within the reserve 
system in trust for them.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I cannot overemphasize the importance of the right to personally 
own land, the right to personal property, if we are going to 
empower native Indian people to take responsibility for 
themselves by having the power they need to defend themselves. 
They cannot defend themselves according to their rights under the 
constitution if they have no means of grasping those rights, of 
defending those rights and of prosecuting those who would 
jeopardize those rights. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a bad treaty.  It is going to leave people in the old 
system rather than bringing them into the new Canada of the new 
millennium with the same rights, privileges and freedoms that all 
Canadians expect and enjoy. 
<P><A NAME="LINK226"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Darrel Stinson (Okanagan—Shuswap, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, it is a pleasure to speak today to Bill C-9 and to the 
amendment to hold it up for six months, which I think is an 
extremely good idea.  One of the reasons I say this is that most 
of us from B.C. know that the issue of the Nisga'a treaty will 
come before the courts.  A number of court cases are already 
pending. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are here today in the House trying to debate a bill that our 
democratically elected government has put time allocation on. We 
do not have enough time to speak on it and to bring all the 
issues forward to properly inform the people of Canada with 
regard to what is going on here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The treaty was jammed through in British Columbia without the 
consent of the people of British Columbia.  It was not brought to 
the people of British Columbia.  The hon. members of the NDP 
should remember that the instigator, the premier of the province 
at that time, has now resigned in disgrace over this issue and a 
number of other issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a a lot of difficulty with this because of four reasons. 
First, since B.C. fulfilled all of its obligations to our Indians 
before it entered confederation, Ottawa alone should bear all the 
costs of the Nisga'a treaty, including reimbursing the province 
for fair market value of the additional land and natural 
resources involved.  This is very critical.  The treaty will not 
cost just the people in British Columbia, it will cost everyone 
in Canada.  When British Columbia entered into confederation, the 
federal government at that time said that it would take over 
Indian affairs.  This is just one of the arguments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, all the people in British Columbia, not just the Nisga'a 
people, should have the right to vote on this.  I shall clarify 
that.  Not all of the Nisga'a people voted on this.  Some were 
not allowed to vote on it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Third, due to the sweeping changes the treaty proposes, it 
should be subject to periodic review, perhaps every five or ten 
years, rather than being entrenched as it stands now in Canada's 
constitution.  I say that because we have lived for a number of 
years under basically two governments in the country, the 
Liberals and the Conservatives.  We have seen what they have done 
to the country.  We have seen what they have done with regard to 
the Indian Act.  They still believe that this is a workable 
document.  They have gone on for years and years holding up our 
native people, holding up the reserves and holding up the process 
of the Indian Act as a great workable document for the people of 
the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, we know it is a failure.  We have heard time after time 
from speakers from all parties in the House about just how 
detrimental it has been to our Indian population in Canada. That 
is one of the reasons why, before we sign off on all these 
agreements, that we should have reviews every five to ten years.

<A HREF="#LINKT37"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>My fourth and final point is that the B.C. legislature and 
parliament are legally required to pass, amend or defeat this and 
other modern day treaties yet to come because it is our 
responsibility to ensure the legislation is as good as we can 
make it rather than merely rubber-stamping it, which is exactly 
what we are doing here.  We are just rubber-stamping the 
document. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government is not open.  It has already said that it will 
not accept amendments.  I have no doubt that it will bring 
in closure when it goes committee. It will try to ram this 
through.  It has said in the paper that it will try to get this 
through before Christmas.  They stand over there and say that 
this is not so, but it has been stated in the papers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If that is not rubber-stamping, if that is not forcing an issue, 
if that is not showing total disregard for the people of British 
Columbia, I do not know what is.  It is not only total disregard 
for the people of British Columbia but, in my humble opinion, 
also for the Nisga'a people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I had the honour and privilege of visiting the Nisga'a country 
and meeting with the chiefs.  I had lunch with them and talked 
with them.  We decided to disagree very politely in regard to a 
number of these issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>After having travelled through the Nisga'a country and visiting 
New Aiyansh, I visited the bordering reserves and met with many 
of their chiefs.  They had great concerns about the treaty 
because it infringed on their traditional territory.  Here we 
have other bands saying that the agreement infringes on their 
territory and the government just sits over there and goes ahead 
with it anyway. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the agreement hits the court, the government will say “We 
didn't know that.  Nobody told us that or put that out”.  Well, 
we have and I want the government to remember that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also want hon. members on the other side to realize that 
British Columbia is a part of Canada.  When it comes to an issue 
of this importance, where we are basically reshaping and 
redefining how Canada will look on maps and how the laws will apply 
in different parts of Canada, I would really think that a 
government that says it is so concerned about the well-being of 
Canada, of its people and of the native population in the country 
would at least have the common decency to sit in the House. 
However, government members do not.  They just leave.  Hardly any 
of them stay around with regard to this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can go back years and years, long before your time, Mr. 
Speaker, to when British Columbia first came into confederation. 
In my home province it has been proven by order in council that 
British Columbia has fulfilled its obligations with respect to 
its Indians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have strong objections to the Nisga'a treaty and to the 
remaining hundreds of treaties which B.C. Indians still have to 
come forward with.  The government says that this will not be a 
template of what is to happen but it will be.  The ex-premier of 
British Columbia has also stated very strongly that it will be. 
It is strange that the government says that this will not become 
a template to what will go on in our province because it is a 
template.  There is absolutely no doubt about it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I understand the NDP with regard to the issue of private 
property rights.  Private property rights are nowhere to be found 
in the agreement. I understand that from the NDP members, with 
their socialistic attitude regarding private property rights, and 
that governments should own everything and that they should be 
the government that will tell us what we can do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also do not have any trouble understanding it coming from the 
Conservatives down on the other side of us because the red Tories 
are almost exactly the same thing as what we have sitting here as 
the NDP. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I did have a little trouble though trying to understand where 
the Liberals are coming from on this. 
They profess time after time that everybody in the country should 
have the opportunity to own something, to have security of that 
ownership and to be able to better themselves in regard to that 
ownership.  However, here they are ready to rubber-stamp this 
without giving that right to the natives themselves.  It is 
almost like they want to keep that entrenchment upon the reserves 
so that they cannot better themselves.  I have great difficulty 
with that after listening to how they profess they care and what 
they say to the public outside.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I sincerely hope that the government will at least open this up 
to proper debate and allow us to speak on this instead of keeping 
us to 10 minutes and shutting off debate with no questions and 
answers in the House.  This is supposed to be the most democratic 
House in Canada.  I would think the rest of the world would have 
to shake its head at that. 
<P><A NAME="LINK227"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Stoffer (Sackville—Musquodoboit Valley—Eastern 
Shore, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, when my hon. colleague from British 
Columbia speaks, it is always very interesting to hear what he 
has to say. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For his attention, for the Reform Party's attention and for the 
attention of the listening audience, of which I am sure there are 
hundreds of thousands of people watching this now, I want them to 
know that I also grew up in British Columbia from 1956 to 1979. I 
travelled the province extensively during the time that I lived 
there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also lived in Watson Lake in the Yukon Territory for nine 
years.  I toured the Kitwanga area, the Nass area and the 
Stikine.  I visited the whole area very extensively and met with 
tremendous numbers of wonderful people, aboriginal and 
non-aboriginal.  That is why I have always had high admiration 
for people from British Columbia.  However, when I say that, 
there is a certain political party from there with which, in many 
ways, I agree with some of its concerns and I am sure it agrees 
with some of our concerns. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Individually, its members are great people, but politically they 
have made some mistakes.  First, the previous speaker talked 
about private property rights.  They keep talking about private 
property rights.  The fact is they are the only ones talking 
about private property rights.  In negotiations, and not 
litigation, there are people on both sides who negotiate what 
they would like to have.  It was the Nisga'a people who wanted to 
have the communal rights to the property on the land.  That is 
what they wanted.  Over 70% of the people voted for the Nisga'a 
treaty in favour of it.  That is a clear majority right there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, as everyone knows, I now live in Nova Scotia.  We have a 
huge crisis in the fishing industry because this government and 
past Conservative governments refused to negotiate. The 
aboriginal people were told to get lost, to go pound sand and to 
take their case to court.  Three straight decisions have ruled in 
favour of the aboriginal people:  Delgamuukw, Sparrow and now the 
Marshall decision.  It has caused chaos in my part of the country 
and is now causing uncertainty right across the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is one aspect of the Nisga'a agreement that I would like 
to read aloud for the benefit of my Reform colleagues.  I do not 
believe the treaty will be a template, but I do believe that some 
aspects of it could and may be used for other treaties across the 
country.  If we had the descriptions on page 107, sections 31, 32 and 
33, which I will read for Reform's benefit, prior to the Marshall 
decision, we would not have the chaos that we have now.  It is 
titled “Disposition of Salmon Harvests”, but it could equally 
have said “any harvest on the Atlantic coast.  It reads: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Subject to paragraph 33, the Nisga'a Nation, and its agents, 
contractors and licensees authorized by Nisga'a Lisims 
Government, have the right to sell Nass salmon harvested under 
this Agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For greater certainty, in accordance with paragraph 13 of the 
General Provisions Chapter, federal and provincials laws of 
general application pertaining to the sale of fish, in respect of 
commercial transactions, health and safety, transport, 
inspection, processing, packaging, storage, export, quality 
control, and labelling of fish, apply to the sale of all Nass 
salmon harvested in Nisga'a fisheries. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here is the key to this.  If we had the next key in Nova Scotia, 
we would not have a problem today. 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>If, in any year, there are no directed harvests in Canadian 
commercial or recreational fisheries of a species of Nass salmon, 
sale of that species of Nass salmon harvested in directed 
harvests of that species in that year's Nisga'a fisheries will 
not be permitted. 
</UL>

<A HREF="#LINKT39"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That means if the non-aboriginal recreational and commercial 
fisheries are not operating due to conservation measures or other 
reasons, there will be no Nisga'a fishery.  That is a tremendous 
opportunity for co-operation from both sides. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It clearly states that the non-aboriginal and aboriginal people 
have in mind conservation first, long before any commercial or 
sport recreational activity.  If we had had that kind of 
agreement in Nova Scotia prior to the Marshall decision, we would 
not have the problems or the millions of dollars that are being 
wasted as a result of the confusion the Marshall decision caused. 
This is what happens when we negotiate, not litigate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It really upsets me that governments in Canada have continually 
told aboriginal people to go away.  They are told to take their 
case to court because the government refuses to talk to them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yesterday in the Standing Committee on Fisheries and Oceans, Mr. 
Wayne Wouters, one of the deputy ministers at DFO, said quite 
clearly in his presentation that it would have been unrealistic 
to have expected DFO to have put in any kind of a game plan for 
the Marshall decision because they did not know what the ruling 
would be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In March, April and May, the Mi'kmaq from Nova Scotia came to 
Ottawa to start a dialogue process with DFO and the Indian 
affairs department.  If the Marshall decision went in favour of 
the Mi'kmaq, they wanted to set up a plan of action to avoid the 
kind of turmoil which we see now.  The government told them to go 
away. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Wouters also said in his presentation to the committee 
yesterday that they had a legal obligation to talk to the 
aboriginal people of Nova Scotia.  But they did not talk to them. 
One minute he said that they could not be expected to talk to 
them.  The next minute he said that they had a legal obligation 
to talk to aboriginal people.  He was talking out of both sides 
of his mouth. No wonder we are frustrated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On behalf of the Nisga'a people, my colleagues in British 
Columbia and my party, I say that the B.C. New Democratic Party, 
headed at the time by the great Glen Clark, in negotiations with 
the previous Indian affairs minister who is now the Minister of 
Human Resources Development, and all the parties that negotiated 
this treaty have done a good thing.  They have now brought the 
aboriginal people into Canada.  They are now going to be 
full-fledged partners in Canada.  It is the way it should be 
done.  Negotiation, not litigation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This will not be a template across the country because every 
region will be different.  There is no question.  The Mi'kmaq of 
Nova Scotia may have different aspirations or rules, but the fact 
is that we must negotiate.  That is what has to happen.  When we 
bring all the stakeholders together and discuss their concerns in 
an open and friendly manner, there are compromises on both sides. 
The fact is that they will become full citizens of the country, 
which they so rightly and richly deserve. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is no secret that when we go to the Canadian Museum of 
Civilization in Hull, Quebec the first thing we see in the great 
hall is totem poles, aboriginal artifacts.  Why is that?  Because 
we as Canadians are very proud of our rich cultural history with 
the aboriginal and first nations people. This is something we 
have to respect and encourage for further dialogue down the road. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Nisga'a treaty is a good agreement.  I recommend that all 
parties support the agreement. I thank all members of the House 
who do.

that as the goalie for the official opposition hockey team, I 
wish he could block shots nearly as well as he can block out the 
facts about this treaty.  If he did, maybe we would beat the 
Liberals for a change. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I rise today to speak not only on behalf of the people of Prince 
George—Peace River, but on behalf of the majority of British 
Columbians whose concerns and rights have been ignored by the 
government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the limited time allocated to me today, it is my intention to 
focus my remarks on the merits of this legislation by asking two 
fundamental questions. Will the Nisga'a people be better off as a 
result of this legislation?  Will Canadian society as a whole be 
better off as a result of this treaty?

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>My riding is located in the northeastern corner of British 
Columbia adjacent to the east of the Nisga'a treaty lands.  My 
constituents are concerned about this issue because the 
ramifications of the Nisga'a treaty will impact on the yet 
unsettled land claims throughout Peace country in northern B.C. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a Reform MP I am motivated to vote against this bill based on 
philosophy alone.  This philosophy was articulated eloquently by 
the Leader of the Opposition in his remarks yesterday. The 
remarks of the Leader of the Opposition illustrate a better way 
of serving our aboriginal people.  His arguments clearly outlined 
Reform's guiding principles of equality and fairness. These 
principles will lead not only to prosperity for our aboriginal 
peoples but to a more harmonious relationship with other 
Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a Reform member of parliament I do not vote based solely upon 
my philosophy or that of my party.  I balance these interests 
with the interests of my constituents who I am pleased and 
honoured to represent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last March I hired a research company to survey my constituents 
on the Nisga'a treaty and on other issues.  The following 
questions were asked.  First, should the people of British 
Columbia have a voice on the principles of the Nisga'a treaty 
through a province wide referendum?  Seventy-five per cent of the 
people in my riding voted yes.  They felt B.C. resident citizens 
should have that. Second, with the information you now have about 
the treaty, how should your federal member of parliament vote 
when it comes before parliament in Ottawa?  Only 17% of my 
constituents said that I should vote for this treaty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In January 1999, I along with the members for Skeena, Prince 
George—Bulkley Valley and Okanagan—Shuswap sent out a Nisga'a 
treaty householder to 30 ridings held not only by Reform but by 
Liberal and NDP MPs.  The following are the questions and answers 
from that householder survey. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, do you believe the public has had adequate opportunity to 
provide input into the Nisga'a treaty?  Eighty-nine per cent said 
no and only nine per cent said yes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, do you believe that the people of British Columbia 
should have the right to vote on the principles of the Nisga'a 
treaty in a provincial referendum?  Ninety-two per cent said yes 
and only seven per cent said no to a referendum. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Third, how do you want your federal MP to vote on this treaty in 
the House of Commons?  Of all the returns that came in, 91% were 
against it and only 8% said that their MP should vote for it. In 
Prince George—Peace River, 96% were against and 3% were for. In 
Vancouver Quadra, currently a Liberal held riding, 91% were 
against and 7% were for it.  In the riding of the Secretary of 
State for the Status of Women, 81% were against the treaty and 
17% were for it.  In Victoria, the riding of the former minister 
of fisheries, 92% were against and 8% were for it.  In Port 
Moody—Coquitlam—Port Coquitlam, the riding of the current yes 
man, 94% were against and 6% were for it.  In Kamloops, 95% were 
against and 4% were for it.  We just heard from the hon. member 
from Kamloops yet he did not even poll his riding to see how his 
constituents felt about this issue.  In Burnaby-Kingsway 87% were 
against it and only 11% were in favour of it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those numbers say a lot about the intentions of British 
Columbians on this issue.  Unlike the minister of Indian affairs 
I believe that the people of British Columbia are more than 
capable of comprehending and deciding this issue.  Based on that 
and on the overwhelming will of my constituents, I will be voting 
against this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What reason do the rest of these members have for not opposing 
this bill?  Even if they did not want to go with the wishes of 
their constituents, what reason would they have for not opposing 
it?  They are in opposition after all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Hart:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order.

includes the galleries.  For instance, it is possible to deny

suggestion is that is for the electorate to decide and it will 
decide at the next election. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would now like to discuss the two questions I posed at the 
outset of my remarks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Will the average Nisga'a person be better off as a result of 
this legislation?  Absolutely not.  Aboriginal Canadians have 
been treated as second class citizens for hundreds of years. 
This legislation does nothing to remedy that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to go out on a limb here.  I hope it does not cost me my 
re-election, but I have to agree with the words of the current 
Prime Minister and his mentor Pierre Elliott Trudeau.  Just listen to 
these quotes: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we want, and the Indians are in agreement, is that they 
should become equal citizens of Canada. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That was the current Prime Minister when he was Indian affairs 
minister in 1968.  Another quote: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a long term intention on the part of the government...to 
arrive eventually at a situation where the Indians will be 
treated like other Canadian citizens of the particular province 
in which they happen to be. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That was Prime Minister Trudeau in 1968. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Equality was the long term intention of the Liberal government's 
Indian policy.  Why has it abandoned this policy?  Do Liberals no 
longer believe in equality?  It has been over 30 years since 
these statements were made.  How long are their long term 
intentions?  They have an opportunity to put the words of Pierre 
Trudeau into action.  Carpe diem, seize the day.  Withdraw the 
Nisga'a legislation so that the aboriginal people can take a step 
forward into the next century instead of passing into law the 
mistakes of the last 200 years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This agreement does not grant the Nisga'a people the property 
rights that the rest of us enjoy.  Nisga'a women are left 
unprotected by this legislation.  The charter of rights takes a 
back seat to Nisga'a law.  These are just a few examples of the 
shortcomings of this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, you just signalled two minutes.  I am sure that two 
minutes did not go by in that period of time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  Time flies when you 
are on your feet.  Just wind it up, please. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jay Hill:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am watching the clock too. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second question is will Canadian society be better off as a 
result?  Ask the people of New Brunswick if they are better off 
today than before special rights were granted to members of their 
community by the Marshall decision. 
We should ask them if they are better off now that their access 
to fish is not based on conservation rather than ethnicity.

<P><A NAME="LINK230"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gordon Earle (Halifax West, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am 
very pleased to have the opportunity to rise today to speak to 
this issue.  Indeed we are dealing with a very historic occasion. 
We are in fact creating history as we discuss this very important 
topic. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member for Kamloops, Thompson and Highland Valleys 
spoke quite eloquently with respect to the situation concerning 
the Indian Act and how that has crippled a people for many years. 
We are at a point where we can now start to rectify some of the 
wrongs that have been done over the historic period of time when 
we have been living side by side with the aboriginal people in 
Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have heard a lot of objections being raised as to why the 
treaty should not be supported.  Many of them have come from the 
Reform Party.  In many instances the objections have been centred 
on things that are not accurate in terms of what the treaty 
actually says. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1735"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT44"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT44"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1735

<A HREF="#LINKT43"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Concerns about individual property rights were raised.  Yet, if 
we look at and understand the treaty, there is provision whereby 
the Nisga'a can organize and arrange for people to have 
individual property rights.  It is a question of 
self-determination and self-governance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why should someone outside the Nisga'a community be overly 
concerned about the property rights of individual members of that 
community?  We have to ask ourselves what attitude is prevalent 
that is raising that concern.  The Nisga'a people have approved 
the treaty.  They understand the principles involved with respect 
to property rights and they have made decisions in their 
interest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We talk about self-government for a people.  Yet, when it comes 
right down to it, a lot of people do not really want to adhere to 
that principle.  Self-government is okay as long as they can 
dictate what that means to a people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are looking at very important principles with respect to the 
support of the treaty.  When we support the treaty we support the 
right of the aboriginal people to determine their destiny, to 
make laws and to deal with issues of importance to them as a 
people.  Some people may ask right off the bat why that should 
be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All we have to do is look at the history of what has taken 
place.  Under the other system, as my hon. colleague from 
Kamloops indicated, the Indian Act treated people with disrespect 
rather than with respect.  It is the only piece of legislation 
that determines who people are and spells out that they are or 
are not Indian, no matter what their blood lines may be. 
Certainly the rest of the people living in Canada have not been 
subjected to such legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now we have a situation where we can rectify some of the wrongs. 
Yet we hear people crying out and saying how terrible it is and 
how it ought not be supported. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He heard statistical information from surveys that were 
conducted.  We all know that we can make surveys say what we 
want.  I would be quite interested in seeing the householder that 
was sent out and the information that was put forth to inflame 
the attitudes that might come back through those surveys. 
Certainly we can make any kind of statistical analysis, but the 
proof of the pudding is what resides within our hearts when we 
are dealing with these issues, not what is written down on a 
piece of paper in terms of a statistical answer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We ran into that problem on another issue concerning national 
sovereignty and how a question should be worded, what it should 
say.  In reality we know what people want. We know that the 
Nisga'a people want self-government.  We know that we want to 
support self-government.  We know that we want to support the 
treaty because it is good for the Nisga'a people.  It is good for 
Canada.  It creates a sense of certainty.  It rectifies many of 
the wrongs that have been done.  We have to be cautious when we 
hear people putting forth strong objections based upon their 
culture, their background and their perception of equality. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>People say that we should all be equal.  When we think of 
equality we should realize that being equal does not mean 
everybody being the same.  I must point out to hon. members who 
put forth the concept of equality that two people can be standing 
side by side, toe to toe on a line, about to run a race.  Some 
would say they are equal because they are both standing at the 
starting point and will go to the same finishing point.  However, 
if we look at the history of the two competitors we see that one 
has been in chains for years and years— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  Like him. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gordon Earle:</B>—and has not had the opportunity to 
train.  I heard that racist remark but I will ignore it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other person has had the opportunity to train and all the 
advantages that come with that.  Suddenly the chains are taken 
off the person who has been bound and inhibited and the person is 
declared equal and ready to run a race with the person who has 
had all the opportunities over the years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For people to be considered equal and have equal opportunity 
there quite often has to be differential treatment which makes 
the ground rules fair and gives a level playing field for all. 
Anyone who is familiar with sports will see how on a circular 
track runners are staggered so that there is equality.  People 
have opportunity to train.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we are really getting at in the treaty is how as Canadians 
we can fulfil our obligations to our fellow human beings in a way 
that will be fair, equal and just.  This whole issue is very 
important because as people say it has ramifications right across 
the country and not just for the people in British Columbia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It also has lessons for those of us in other parts of the 
country.  It has lesson for those of us in the fishery as 
mentioned by my hon. colleague from Sackville—Musquodoboit 
Valley—Eastern Shore.  If the government had been seriously 
negotiating and dealing with the aboriginal people, as indicated 
in the Delgamuukw decision and in other decisions, we would not 
be in the situation we are in now with respect to the fisheries. 
It waited for a decision to come down that caused people to have 
a knee-jerk reaction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I must compliment the aboriginal people and many non-aboriginal 
people in my area for the calmness they have shown with regard to 
this decision and the respect they have to shown to one another. 
The media portrayed the few hotheads on both sides who are taking 
advantage of the situation, not the majority of people who want 
to peacefully negotiate a settlement.  I give praise to the 
people who looked at the decision as a way to move forward 
together with respect for each other and to learn to share the 
resources in a way that would benefit all of us collectively. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is an honour to have had the opportunity to speak to this 
matter.  When all members of the House consider the issue, I 
sincerely urge them to vote with their hearts, not with some 
statistical information, not with some fear they have flamed up 
about how some things will be disadvantageous to them and to 
people in British Columbia.  British Columbians will benefit from 
the treaty as will Canadians and all of us who want to see 
justice and equality for our citizens. 
<P><A NAME="LINK231"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Reynolds (West Vancouver—Sunshine Coast, Ref.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, it is a pleasure to speak to this debate.  I 
listened to the member who spoke prior to me call people who 
oppose this matter hotheads.  I found it a little disconcerting 
that a party debating a bill that represents a majority viewpoint 
of the people in British Columbia can be called hotheads because 
they disagree with the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I read with interest today a little brochure the national 
Liberal caucus put out called “Dancing with dinosaurs”.  I was 
really proud when I opened it up because I was the first one they 
quoted.  I want to read it because I think it is a very 
interesting quote.  I hear the Liberals over there yelling and 
screaming.  They get a little excited and I think it is quite 
funny. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I look at the government over there and the things it has done 
over the years.  The Liberal Party misled Canadians on the GST. 
It promised to do something and did not do it for their two terms 
of office.  That is the same party that said it would eliminate 
free trade.  It did not do a darn thing.  How can we believe the 
Liberals on anything?  How can Canadian people, especially 
westerners, believe the Liberal government on anything? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My Liberal friends say “Dancing with dinosaurs”. I would 
rather dance with a dinosaur than be in the water with a Liberal 
shark.  Sharks eat people for no reason at all, do things for no 
reason at all, and are vicious animals.  I would rather be 
dancing with a Reform dinosaur than be in the water with a 
Liberal shark.  That is what these people are.  They are sharks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. David Iftody:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of 
order.  I know we want to keep the debate in line and civilized. 
I know the member, as a former member of parliament under the Tory 
government, does not want to get into an unhelpful debate.  I ask 
him to continue a proper and civil debate for Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  Respectfully, in my 
opinion, the hon. member for West Vancouver—Sunshine Coast was 
not saying anything inappropriate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Reynolds:</B>  Mr. Speaker, neither would I say 
anything inappropriate.  I am quoting from a Liberal document. 
If he wants to keep this debate at a certain level they should 
stop printing documents which do not contain the truth.  That is 
what the Liberal Party should do.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Stoffer:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of 
order.  Just for clarification for my hon. colleague from British 
Columbia, my hon. colleague from Halifax West did not refer to 
him or the Reform Party as hotheads.  He was referring to other 
people who resort to violence on the east coast. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Reynolds:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the truth really hurts in 
this place when we start speaking the truth or reading some of 
their own documents back to them.  I think I have been up for 
five minutes but time-wise I have only had about a minute and a 
half. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me talk about what the Liberals say in their document.  They 
refer to myth No. 1, a third order of government.  The member for 
West Vancouver—Sunshine Coast, as reported in <I>Hansard</I> of 
June 3, 1999, said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are some frightening and constitutionally questionable 
aspects to this treaty...The Nisga'a creates a new level of 
government, the Nisga'a national government. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is the Liberal myth document.  Let us see if what they say 
is the reality.  They indicated that the treaty recognized the 
right to self-government and returned stewardship over the land 
to the Nisga'a, that the Nisga'a government would not have any 
exclusive jurisdiction, and that concurrent jurisdiction in this 
case between Nisga'a laws and all existing federal and provincial 
laws was a common feature of Canadian communities.  That is what 
the Liberals say in their document <I>Dancing with the 
Dinosaurs</I>. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me quote from a Liberal friend in British Columbia, a friend 
of mine too over the years, Rafe Mair.  Rafe and I have had some 
disagreements on politics.  He said publicly that he would vote 
Liberal in the next election, so he is a Liberal.  This is what 
he says in this Liberal myth document: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the end of it all, the Nisga'a deal does three things: it 
denies rights, i.e. voting, to resident non-natives; it creates a 
fishery— 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  That is wrong. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Reynolds:</B>  The hon. member says that is wrong but 
Rafe Mair says that is right and I say it is right also.  He 
continues: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—it creates a fishery every bit as racist as if “a whites 
only” fishery were enacted; and it constitutionalizes a special, 
entrenched style of government to which, irretrievably, are 
granted powers hitherto reserved to the federal government or the 
provinces. 
</UL></UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will have 50 to 75 of these constitutionaled, unamendable, 
self-governing jurisdictions in B.C. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>And you think the Nisga'a agreement is just a British Columbia 
problem?  Dream on, fellow Canadians, dream on. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This man is well respected in that province.  He served in the 
provincial legislature.  He said he would vote Liberal in the 
next election.  He totally disagrees with the Liberals on this 
matter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us get off the issue of who is calling whom a hothead.  We 
are debating an issue that is very important to all the people of 
British Columbia and Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. David Iftody:</B>  Stick to the facts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Reynolds:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I just gave him the facts 
on the myth versus his myth.  They are wrong and they get very 
upset when they hear the truth.  The majority of the people of 
British Columbia and the NDP Government of British Columbia, 
which our friends down here support federally, do not like the 
agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They talk in this document about fair treatment of British 
Columbia.  I was Speaker of the British Columbia legislature for 
nine years.  It was the worst sham I have ever seen when this 
bill went through the British Columbia legislature.  The 
Government of British Columbia did not let it get halfway through 
the legislature before it brought in closure.  The government 
opposite just denied us the right to sit tonight to debate the 
bill until 10 p.m., but in the next few days it will bring in 
closure on it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is not debating legislation the proper way.  We can go back 
to the pipeline debate a number of years ago that went on for 
days and weeks and months because it was a right of Canadians, no 
matter how small their group in the House, to debate a bill until 
it was fully debated and fully discussed, so the people of 
eastern Canada can understand what is the problem with the 
legislation in British Columbia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I suggest to people out there, as my friend said earlier the 
hundreds of thousands that are watching, that they should look at 
the treaties we have had in eastern Canada for the last 100 
years.  Are natives in eastern Canada living any better because 
of the treaties they signed?  I do not think they are. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. David Iftody:</B>  We have not fulfilled the treaty.  That 
is what we are trying to do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Reynolds:</B>  The Liberals say that they have not 
fulfilled the treaty.  What makes them change?  The Liberals and 
the Tories have been in government for the last 100 years.  They 
have had treaties with these people and not a darned thing has 
been done for them.  Are the Liberals telling us now that they 
will change?  No Canadians believe that.  This is a phony 
document.  It needs some changes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to ensure native people get treated just like other 
Canadians get treated.  Some people may not think it is all that 
good, the way the rest of Canadians get treated by governments 
because of our taxes and all other situations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will go back and quote what some well known Liberals have 
said. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Jim Peterson:</B>  Will the hon. member tell us what the 
Nisga'a people say about the Nisga'a treaty? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Reynolds:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the gentleman across the 
hall asks me to quote what the Nisga'a people say about the 
treaty.   I will tell him something.  I heard in the House today 
from the minister of Indian affairs that our member for Skeena 
had never talked to Nisga'a.  That is absolutely untrue. 
He has met with them many times.  He has asked to meet with them 
over the last while and they do not show up for the meetings.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Those are the facts and the member does not want to know them. 
He knows that area better than anybody sitting on that side of 
the House.  He gets elected by a very big majority of people who 
live in that constituency.  The people in his constituency do not 
want this treaty and that is why he is here debating it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us look at what the Prime Minister said.  He said: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—what we want, and the Indians are in agreement, is that they 
should become equal citizens of Canada. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Prime Minister of Canada said that they wanted to become 
equal citizens of Canada.  That is not in the bill.  It creates a 
fishery that is racist.  That has been quoted not only by the 
Reform Party but many other prominent people in western Canada. 
It is a racist treaty.  It does not make everybody equal in 
Canada.  Yet the Prime Minister said that we all should be equal 
in the country, and I believe that too.  I have another quote 
from a well-known Liberal: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a long term intention on the part of the government, and 
this to be debated, I suppose, as part of our Indian policy, to 
arrive eventually at a situation where Indians will be treated 
like other Canadian citizens of the particular province in which 
they happen to be. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This was said by Pierre Trudeau in the House of Commons on 
November 5, 1968.  If members read the legislation it does not 
match that paragraph.  Yet this man was a great Canadian, well 
respected by his party and won a number of elections.  The 
legislation does not allow that to happen.  I have another quote 
from a well-known person across the hall: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>For many Indian people, the road does exist, the only road that 
has existed since Confederation and before.  The road of 
different status, a road which has led to a blind alley of 
deprivation and frustration.  This road...cannot lead to full 
participation, to equality in practice as well as in theory...the 
government will offer another road that would gradually lead away 
from different status to full social, economic and political 
participation in Canadian life.  This is the choice. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This was said by the present Prime Minister in June 1969.  That 
was their position then.  They have a different one now.  They 
say we should vote for the bill, let it happen and we will all do 
fine.  As I said earlier, this is the government that said it 
would ban the GST when it defeated the Tories who had really 
messed up the country, got elected and became the Government of 
Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is the same government that said it would get rid of free 
trade.  It did nothing about that.  This is a government which 
does not know how to keep a major promise.  How could anybody in 
British Columbia believe the government when it says that we 
should trust it? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I said, I would trust the Reform dinosaurs before the Liberal 
sharks on the other side.  They act like sharks when it comes to 
legislation.  They have acted like sharks when running the 
country.  They are not doing what is good for Canada.  They are 
trying to make the issue look like it is good for the native 
people.  It is not good for native people.  It is not good for 
Canadians.  It certainly is not good for British Columbians. 
<P><A NAME="LINK232"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it 
is a pleasure to debate the Nisga'a final agreement.  The people 
watching need to remember that once the agreement comes to this 
place it cannot be changed, not a jot or a tittle. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I find amazing, when dealing with this kind of agreement and 
other agreements that we develop internationally, that we in the 
House of Commons never get to see it.  When it comes to us it 
comes as a done deal.  It is not to be changed.  It is not to be 
trifled with.  We cannot propose an amendment.  It is a done 
deal.  It is very unfortunate that we are talking about the act 
to implement the Nisga'a agreement and not the actual terms of 
the agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to dwell for a few minutes on the manner of 
development of the Nisga'a agreement.  The treaty negotiators 
portrayed a grassroots treaty development process in British 
Columbia. Both native and non-native members of my riding were on 
the treaty development process.  They went through the process of 
how it could be developed, what kind of consultations should take 
place, and so on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the first draft of the Nisga'a agreement, which is 
basically unchanged today, came back members of my riding quit 
the treaty negotiating team.  Not a single sentence resembled 
anything like what they had talked about in their meetings to 
develop the treaty. 
There was no resemblance in any way, shape or form to the topics 
or the depth of discussion they had.  Even though they had 
travelled the province and had hundreds of hours of discussion, 
nothing resembling those discussions ended up in the final 
document.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It reminds me of something.  In my own riding there is currently 
another treaty development process.  It may be the next one 
coming in a rearview mirror near us.  It deals with the Sto:lo 
nation.  The Sto:lo nation in my riding consists of 17 or 18 
bands.  They have been negotiating under the same treaty 
development process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Four or five years ago I contacted the minister's office to say 
that there was an ongoing treaty development process.  I asked if 
he could send some maps to show what areas were involved.  The 
answer was that I could not know what maps were involved in my 
riding as a member of parliament.  I asked for some idea of the 
economic implications of what was being negotiated.  No economic 
implications were allowed to be discussed until it was a done 
deal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What about how much territory was involved or what was the 
claim?  I was not allowed to know that.  What about the rights of 
the Sto:lo and non-Sto:lo in my area?  I asked what kind of 
parameters or guidelines there were.  I was not allowed to know 
anything. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the deal is completed it is dropped down upon us like an 
epiphany from heaven.  When it comes on to our plate we have to 
approve it, every jot and tittle.  We can express concern in the 
meantime, but we are not allowed to enter into the negotiations 
in the meantime.  That is unfair. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many areas are still to be negotiated with the Nisga'a people. 
All the side agreements will have to be negotiated.  I wonder if 
any of them will end up like the agreement in my hometown of 
Chilliwack dealing with aboriginal fisheries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is the situation in my riding.  There is, by the way, no 
commercial fishery on the Fraser River this year because there 
just are not enough fish.  Coincidentally after four or five 
years of the aboriginal fisheries strategy there are no fish this 
year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Regardless of where the blame should be pinned, this is how DFO 
must deal with it now.  This is the negotiated settlement in the 
DFO arrangement.  For the most part DFO has given no permission 
outside of food fisheries to the aboriginal people to fish for 
commercial purposes on the Fraser River.  There are no 
agreements.  There is no regulated commercial fishery. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, because there are armed militia on the river, complete 
with balaclavas and working openly with the native people, there 
is an agreement now.  DFO has been asked to sign an agreement 
that as long as a native is attending a net, no DFO officer will 
remove that net from the river.  That is the agreement.  We must 
remember that there is no regulated fishery right now.  It is not 
a legal fishery. There is no permission to do it, but the DFO is 
not allowed to remove the net. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The DFO is drifting down the river at night with the lights off, 
hoping to bump into an illegal native net with no natives 
attending it so it can be withdrawn from the river.  DFO is so 
afraid of the policies the government has put in place and the 
restrictions on its officers that we are reduced to the farce of 
having DFO officers agreeing that illegal activity is okay as 
long as the natives are right there.  That is the situation in my 
riding.  At any given time in my riding alone a dozen nets can be 
found illegally strung across the Fraser River. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A month ago one native person was caught with 100,000 cans of 
salmon.  What will be his penalty?  DFO says it is very concerned 
and quite worried.  It was kind of like last summer when in that 
same stretch of river the same group of people dredged 100,000 
tonnes of gravel out of the middle of a spawning bed without 
permission.  All other dredging operations had been shut down, 
but it was okay because they did it the previous summer too. 
Their argument was that they could do it because they knew the 
river better than anybody else.  They had been there for 
thousands of years so that when they dredge gravel it does not 
hurt the salmon.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Do government members not see what is happening?  If they would 
come to my riding they would see thousands of sports fishermen 
with their gear in a box on the shore because they are not 
allowed to fish.  There are so few damned fish left in that river 
that people cannot even fish with a rod and reel, and yet there 
are a dozen nets stretched across that river and we all know it 
because the floats are right there every single day.  One hundred 
thousand fish for one guy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is the solution?  To close their eyes to the problem and 
pretend it does not exist. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have said this time and again about the Nisga'a agreement.  I 
have a lot of respect for the current Nisga'a leadership and the 
way some of its people have conducted themselves.  As the Leader 
of the Opposition said previously, they had no choice.  They had 
to negotiate the best deal they could, given the parameters of 
the discussions.  However, we have to develop a system for 
getting along in the country that is not for this year, not for 
this leadership, not for this government, and not for the current 
leadership of the Nisga'a people.  It has to stand the test of 
time.  It has to be something that when we look at it a hundred 
years from now it will have been a solution that was good for all 
people.  We are not going to have some people move in there, 
strong arm their way into a position of unreasonable power or not 
treat the people right. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are no guarantees in a system where people are divided up 
and where, like it is in my riding, there is a set of rules for 
one group of people and the rest can pound sand.  In my riding 
there are literally thousands of people who sit on the shore in 
frustration.  They cannot even catch one fish for supper, while 
illegal fishing takes place every single day under the watchful 
eyes of DFO officials who know this is going on and are not 
allowed to intervene because of the orders of the justice 
department of this government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Nobody is denying that hundreds of native people absolutely have 
the right to a food fishery, but that has somehow been 
transformed into an abusive commercial fishery that is dredging 
that river dry.  How can we possibly say it is a good thing over 
the long run?  It is unsustainable.  My worry, as we negotiate 
the 50 or more side agreements to come, is that if there is a 
conflict the federal government will fold its cards, will throw 
up its hands, and whatever happens happens.  A country cannot be 
governed in the long run like that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can speak from experience.  I brought this to the attention of 
Brian Tobin when he was the minister of fisheries.  I met him 
outside the doors and told him what was happening in my riding. 
He named the people involved, including the chiefs.  He knew the 
amount of fish going out of there.  I told him that he had a 
fiduciary responsibility to fix the mess and he said that they 
were going to do nothing.  That is what happened. 
<P><A NAME="LINK233"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I wish I 
could say that I am delighted to enter this debate, but I cannot 
because I am so concerned about what is happening to our country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to tell the House why I became a member of the Reform 
Party.  There were a number of reasons.  One reason was the basic 
bedrock principle of all decent democracies in the world, the 
equality of all citizens.  When I see what is happening here and 
the mishandling of this issue, not only by this government but by 
successive governments over the last 130 years, I am deeply 
concerned. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am quoting directly from the Reform Party when I say that we 
believe in true equality for Canadian citizens, with equal rights 
and responsibilities for all.  That is one of the things that 
attracted me to the Reform Party.  When I first joined the Reform 
Party I realized that the Conservatives of the day and the 
Liberals before them had totally violated that basic principle in 
many different areas. 
I think it is absolutely shameful that the present government, 
the present leadership in our country, is totally unwilling to 
face this issue head on and do something right about it.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I need to take a few minutes to talk about process.  People who 
have been watching on television have observed that in the last 
few minutes there have been several occasions when members of the 
Reform Party have tried to extend the debate for today.  We have 
asked to continue the debate because we anticipate that the 
government, like the NDP government in B.C., wants to jam this 
bill through before too many people find out about it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is a violation, again, of a very basic principle of 
democracy.  In a democracy the governed must accept the 
governance of the country.  In other words, we have to have 
consensus among the people for the laws that are being passed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There have been other occasions when a government has, within 
the rules of the House, which I say are dysfunctional, passed 
different laws and used the rules of the House, the ones that 
make it dysfunctional, to jam things through which it knows do 
not have the majority support of the people, and our democracy is 
crumbling.  The best example I can think of is the GST.  Former 
Prime Minister Mulroney not only jammed the thing through this 
House, he even evicted from his party several members who had the 
nerve to respect the wishes of their constituents and vote 
against it.  He had the gall, in my opinion, to appoint extra 
senators to the other place whose only qualification for office 
was that they could stand on command and vote in favour of what 
has now become the most hated tax in the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The principle that we are missing is that the majority of 
Canadians who opposed that tax had it right. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think it is arrogant in the extreme for a government to say 
“Here we are, a small group of people, and we know best”.  We 
heard it from the NDP member from Kamloops earlier who said “I 
am not here to represent my constituents”.  I am paraphrasing 
him of course. “I am here to make wise decisions on their behalf 
because they just don't understand”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to the Nisga'a agreement, we have found that 
particularly in the province of British Columbia where the people 
will be most profoundly affected by this agreement immediately, 
as well as across Canada where the effects will be felt later as 
they accumulates, the people do not support the agreement in 
large numbers.  We are talking of a disagreement level which 
exceeds the number of people who were opposed to the GST.  We are 
finding that support for this agreement is not there among the 
people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us face it, there cannot be an agreement without two 
parties. There cannot be an agreement just because the leaders of 
the Nisga'a have agreed to it.  Forty per cent of the Nisga'a 
people, when they voted on it, seriously questioned it.  About 
90% of the other side of the agreement, namely the other citizens 
of British Columbia, the non-natives, are saying “We do not 
agree with this treaty”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore it bears slowing down.  It means that it is incumbent 
on the government not to shut down debate, as it did a few 
minutes ago when we asked if the debate could be extended tonight 
before it invokes closure and all of those silly things. 
Government members stood and said no.  There were not enough 
Liberals in the House to stop it.  They needed 15.  That is 
shameful.  We are dealing with an issue that has long term 
implications into the next millennium for the country. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1810"></A>

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are not 15 Liberals in the House to stand to say they do 
not want the Reform Party or other members of parliament to 
debate this matter tonight.  That is a shame.  However, they have 
their allies.  The Bloc members, the NDP and the Conservatives 
stood.  They said “Let's not debate it.  Let's just jam it down 
the minds of people.  Lets forget about whether or not the people 
agree.  It does not matter”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I care profoundly about the country.  I care profoundly about 
the equality of Canadians.  For us to give approval by the 
actions of a whip telling his people how to vote and jamming the 
thing through, with all its implications, will have profound 
effects for many years to come.  We will see our children and our 
grandchildren living with the consequences of this dastardly 
deed.  This will go down in history as one of the dark points of 
the 36th parliament because of the fact that they will have put 
into the constitution rules that divide us based on race. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to read another blue book policy which attracts me. 
The Reform Party's ultimate goal in aboriginal matters is that 
all aboriginal people be full and equal participants in Canadian 
citizenship, indistinguishable in law and treatment from other 
Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe that is a high goal based on a valid human principle. 
It is excessively superior to the lack of principles demonstrated 
in the Nisga'a agreement in which we have the country divided up 
based on bloodlines, based on race. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also believe that we have been sitting on our butts far too 
long with respect to native affairs.  I am saying this now 
collectively.  I am blaming the governments of the last 130 
years.  There has been inaction and any action that has been 
taken has been wrong action. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Indian Act is a bleak part of Canadian history.  When the 
agreement says that we will move this group of native people out 
of the Indian Act, I have to say that I agree with that part of 
it, because the Indian Act has been used in order to keep native 
people in their place.  That is very wrong. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have only been in Canada for a scant 60 years.  I was not here 
132 years ago when some of this was done.  I was not here 250 
years ago when some of these fishing agreements were made.  Yet I 
look back and say those who were here made an error. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As any person will say, it is the height of folly not to admit 
when one has made a mistake.  It is a greater folly to say that 
what we have done in the last 130 years has not worked and if we 
do more of it now it will work.  That does not make sense. We 
need to deal with this matter in a way which is rational, 
addresses the problem and does not continue to sweep under the 
rug the real issues.  My closing statement is that the 
fundamental issue is the equality of all Canadians. 
<P><A NAME="LINK234"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Don Boudria (Leader of the Government in the House of 
Commons, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I just heard the member's 
speech.  I wish I could compliment him on it but I cannot.  I do 
not agree with much of what he said.  I do not at all share the 
views I have just heard or a lot of what I have heard over the 
last couple of days. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member said one thing with which I agree, though.  He 
said that we were living in a bleak part of Canadian history.  In 
a way we are, but I think the bleakness in what we are hearing 
now comes from across the floor.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the Yukon bills, one party in the House voted against them. 
On the Nunavut territory and on the Manitoba land claims, one 
party in the House voted against virtually all of the bills.  All 
of these bills were for aboriginal people, and one party and only 
one party has the bleak distinction of having voted against all 
of them. That is the bleakness in which we are living. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yes of course hon. members across the way will want to raise 
other topics to try and erase that bleakness, but I am afraid it 
is in indelible ink.  It will stay for a long time. It will be 
bleak, but I do not believe ultimately that that bleakness will 
reflect on this parliament nor this institution.  Rather, it will 
reflect on those who have perpetrated this on the people of 
Canada as a whole, on the House and I would say, on the people 
affected adversely by what we hear today in the claims of some 
hon. members. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In any case, there is the possibility for us to listen to the 
speeches of the hon. members.  I am not saying that I will like 
them.  As a matter of fact, I suspect I will disagree with most 
of them because they will probably be similar to what I have 
heard over the last couple of days and they have not been good. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The exercise probably will be bleak.  Members want to be 
permitted to speak on this issue and they think that a hopelessly 
long time is required not to debate the bill, not to debate an 
amendment which said that we should not debate the bill, but to 
debate an amendment to the amendment as to whether or not we 
should debate the bill.  They are trying to tell us this is 
serious debate on legislation to make the life of aboriginal 
Canadians better. I do not believe it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, I am willing at least to take a chance to see what they 
have to say.  We will listen to the speeches of the hon. members 
if they want to make them.  We will listen to those speeches 
later this evening if they are willing to extend the debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Randy White:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
I would like the House, the table and the Speaker to take note 
of what is about to be asked here.  The fact is that this party 
has asked not once but twice today to extend the sitting hours 
into the evening.  If the government House leader is going to 
insult us with a request after we have sent our people home, he 
has another think coming. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Don Boudria:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I do not want to engage in 
this alleged point of order that is not one.  Just moments before 
I heard the hon. member for Elk Island speak.  He unfortunately 
let the cat out of bag, but perhaps it was fortunate for all the 
House to know.  He said that he wanted to do everything he could 
to debate this bill as long as possible so that it would not 
pass. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The objective is not constructive debate, it is to stall the 
process.  That is out of the bag now.  We now know the truth.  We 
suspected it all along of course.  Nevertheless, let us hear more 
of that proof from across the way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
What the member is saying about my statement is not factually 
correct. I want to debate this with the Canadian people so we can 
get consensus among the governed on something of great 
importance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  That certainly is a 
point of debate.  Very often there are differing points of view 
on the same issue, depending upon the side of the House.

the hon. government House leader can present that particular 
motion.  I must say, not having had the courtesy to be informed 
of the content of the motion, and having presented the House with 
a request twice today and having been refused twice by the 
government, the Progressive Conservatives and the separatists, I 
find it totally irresponsible at this time of the night that the

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Randy White:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe there must be such a thing in the House of Commons as 
dignity in debate and a respect for all members of the House.  It 
is a terrible thing what has happened here at this point in time. 
The government has come in to give itself a better image after 
we made a request twice today and the government refused to 
extend the hours.  It has basically lied. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  I am going to deal 
with one issue at a time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, I am not going to ask the member for Langley—Abbotsford 
to withdraw “lied” because it was not directed at any member or 
any ministry.  It was a generalization.  However without question 
the use of the word, in my estimation at this time in the way it 
was used I am not going to deem unparliamentary but it was 
certainly not gentlemanly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay:</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
I do not want to further aggravate the House with respect to 
this issue.  It was very obvious and should have been obvious to 
everyone, including the House leader for the official opposition. 
When matters such as this debate were discussed, a blind man on 
a galloping horse could have seen that this issue was going to 
arise today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For there to be any suggestion by members of the Reform Party 
that they did not realize that this debate was going to be 
extended, it was discussed openly at the House leaders meeting 
yesterday and this is just misleading the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Chuck Strahl:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I will ask the man 
galloping blindly off into the distance who just spoke to 
remember that on the Thursday question last week which details 
the business for this week, not only was it not discussed at the 
House leaders meeting, but the government House leader said that 
we were not even going to debate Nisga'a today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member cannot say that this was openly discussed at the 
House leaders meeting.  The government House leader unilaterally 
changed the schedule a couple of times.  We have asked twice to 
extend the hours so we could plan an evening debate and have been 
denied twice by the government and the galloping horseman down 
there. They would not do it.

<P><A NAME="LINK236"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gary Lunn (Saanich—Gulf Islands, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
what we are seeing here is absolutely unacceptable. I will focus 
on what has happened here in the last few minutes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A number of people in our caucus have been asking to debate this 
issue, including myself.  I came here because I happened to be 
working late in my office.  I had no intention of being here.  I 
have been asking to speak on the Nisga'a agreement and I am 
slated about 20 speakers down the list.  Most of our people have 
gone home.  In order that we can have an opportunity to debate 
this later, we asked that we debate this late into the evening. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To focus on the Nisga'a agreement itself, I have spent 
considerable time reading it from cover to cover.  I have spoken 
to some of the top legal authorities in this area.  I talked with 
Mel Smith at length.  He is a very respected man in the legal 
community and I would suggest he is probably one of the 
authorities on this matter, if not in Canada then in North 
America. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This agreement at the end of the day will polarize the native 
and non-native communities.  We as a society and the previous 
governments over the last 30 to 40 years should be absolutely 
embarrassed by how the first nations people have been treated. 
Very few non-natives would trade places with native persons on 
any of the reserves in Canada.  We have driven in wedges.  We 
have not made life any better for them.  We have taken away their 
dignity and self-worth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All of a sudden we have come up with the famous Nisga'a treaty. 
We have created another fork in the road.  We will only drive 
wedges between the native and non-native communities.  We will 
polarize those people.  We will only make matters worse.  By no 
stretch of the imagination are we helping those people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have created another level of government.  Where I live in 
British Columbia, in my own backyard, there are five levels of 
government.  We are now creating another whole bureaucracy and 
system of government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I suppose the most troubling aspect for me is that there is 
absolutely no provision in the Nisga'a agreement where a Nisga'a 
person living on the Nisga'a lands has the absolute right to 
title to the property they hold.  Some people would suggest it is 
within the power of the band or the minister to decide if they 
want to have title to the property but they do not have the right 
to have title to the property. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many Canadians have used the title to their property as 
collateral for bank loans, to launch business ventures, fund 
prospects, a whole host of things, as have I. One takes a lot of 
pride in one's property and in building up self-worth in what one 
does.  People in the native community cannot do that.  They live 
in horrific conditions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I met with two chiefs last Saturday in my riding.  We went over 
some of the problems on their reserves with respect to housing 
and other things on which they have to deal with government. They 
do not have much faith in the process. They say they are promised 
one thing by the government and then the door is shut on them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The problems in the aboriginal community have been culminating 
over the last 30 to 40 years.  They are massive and cannot be 
solved overnight. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are some very good parts to the Nisga'a treaty which I 
fully support, but there are some fatal flaws which will make 
matters even worse and which will drive wedges between 
communities. I ask all members to really look at the treaty and 
the government propaganda and make a decision for themselves 
because it will not help matters on the reserves.

<P><A NAME="LINK239"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gurmant Grewal (Surrey Central, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
during question period last Friday, I asked why the government 
was promoting the Nisga'a treaty that abolishes equal 
opportunity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals have fixed it so that success in our country is now 
based on race.  Hard work is no longer the factor that determines 
how successful one can be making a living in forestry, fishing or 
mining. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has quashed the principle of equality with the 
Nisga'a treaty.  It is assigning democratic rights according to 
race not based on needs.  Canadians find that offensive and an 
attack on the very foundation of our country.  Equality is at the 
core of what it is to be Canadian. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Imagine my surprise when the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans 
jumped gleefully to his feet to address my question. 
<I>Hansard</I> shows that his carrying on required the Speaker to 
ask for calm.  In his blathering, the fisheries minister 
attacked, with rhetoric and misinformation, the Sikhs willing to 
join the RCMP.  What a peculiar notion.  Where does he get this 
stuff from?  As a Sikh, I find his remarks offensive.  As a Sikh 
himself, the minister should apologize. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the Reform Party convention in 1996, the Reform Party passed 
a resolution supporting a change in the dress code of our RCMP. 
The fisheries minister, like his government, is living in the 
past.  He should be kept up to date.  If he was up to date, he 
would know that he was wrong about the Reform Party policy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Later the same day during question period, I rose again and 
asked point blank why the fisheries minister supported a treaty 
that segregates Canadians and creates inequality.  I informed him 
that the Reform Party believed in the equality of all Canadians, 
and that was why, as a Sikh member of the party, I was living 
proof.  The Reform Party of Canada has more members representing 
ethnic minorities than any other party in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, I challenged the minister to a debate on the Nisga'a 
treaty in Vancouver, B.C.  If the Nisga'a agreement is so 
representative of the Liberals' position on equality, why does 
the minister not debate the issue with me?  By the minister's 
refusal, it is obvious to me that he is uncomfortable with the 
government's bill on the Nisga'a agreement.  The Liberal 
government's bill on the Nisga'a agreement creates inequality for 
aboriginal women and maintains band control over individual 
property rights, among other important issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>After my second question, the Speaker of the House gave the 
minister an out by saying that the minister did not have to 
respond, and the minister chickened out again.  He refused to 
answer my challenge.  Instead, he attacked me personally based on 
my religion.  He should apologize. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is he refusing to debate me?  I do not know.  What is he afraid 
of?  I have no clue.  I again ask:  Why is the government 
promoting the Nisga'a treaty that abolishes equal opportunity for 
all Canadians? 
<P><A NAME="LINK240"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. David Iftody (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Indian Affairs and Northern Development, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I am very pleased to be here tonight in the final closing hours 
of an exciting day to respond to the questions and concerns 
raised by the member from British Columbia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will just repeat a number of things that I think are important 
with respect to clarification on this matter and some of the 
concerns that he has raised in the House today and on other 
occasions. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1835"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT56"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT56"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1835

<A HREF="#LINKT55"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, it is very important to recognize that section 15 of the 
charter, the equality sections of the charter of rights and 
freedoms, apply here to all people.  There is no distinction 
based on race or gender.  Those sections are very clear. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, with respect to the Nisga'a legislation, section 28 of 
the charter provides even further clarification on those 
equalities.  If that were not enough, in the 1983 amending 
conference on the charter of rights and freedoms, section 35(4) 
was put in the constitution to guarantee that wherever we have 
aboriginal rights in Canada they would not detract from men or 
women in any unequal way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I commend my colleagues, the Liberal members from British 
Columbia, who have been working on the bill.  We debated Bill C-9 
in the House this afternoon and we will continue to debate it in 
the days to come.  The opening section of the legislation states 
quite emphatically that the Nisga'a agreement is subject to the 
charter of rights and freedoms.  This is not a distinction 
between people based on race and creating inequalities.  This is 
an opportunity for Canadians and all of us to do the right thing, 
to embrace the Nisga'a people and to welcome them into Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would remind the hon. member of those first nations people in 
northern Quebec in 1995 when we had a referendum.  They filed 
into the polls at 40-below to support Canada and Canadians 
because they wanted to be part of the country.  I can tell the 
House with certainty that the Nisga'a people want to be part of 
the country as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  The motion to 
adjourn the House is now deemed to be adopted.  Accordingly, the 
House stands adjourned until tomorrow at 10 a.m., pursuant to 
Standing Order 24(1). 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(The House adjourned at 6.37 p.m.)
