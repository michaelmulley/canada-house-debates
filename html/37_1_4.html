</I></B></P><P align=left>He said:  Mr. Speaker, the purpose of the bill is to protect the

good faith for wrongdoing in the public service, such as reports 
of waste, fraud, corruption, abuse of authority, violation of law 
or threats to public health or safety.  The public interest is

that the Government of Canada can deal more effectively with the 
more than 18,000 Canadians who suffer from end stage kidney 
disease. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The petitioners point out that those on kidney dialysis and 
those successfully transplanted recognize the importance of the

transplantations in those suffering from kidney disease.

medical facilities and educational institutes.

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>RESUMPTION OF DEBATE ON ADDRESS IN REPLY 
</H4><P align=left>

</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed from January 31 consideration of the motion 
for an address to Her Excellency the Governor General in reply to 
her speech at the opening of the session, of the amendment and of 
the amendment to the amendment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Reynolds:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of 
order.  I wish to advise you that all members of the Canadian 
Alliance will be sharing time during the remainder of this

<P><A NAME="LINK25"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Brian Tobin (Minister of Industry, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, let me take this opportunity to join with many of my 
colleagues in congratulating you, Sir, on your election as 
Speaker.  Let me assure you that I will always abide by the 
wisdom of your rulings and seek in speedy fashion to comply with 
your direction to me. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My next words are words of thanks to the voters of 
Bonavista—Trinity—Conception who have allowed me the privilege, 
and it is a real privilege for all of us to be here, of coming 
back to parliament having been absent from this very special 
place for the last five years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no question that having the right and, more important, 
having the responsibility to speak and to participate in the 
debates in this place is one that few Canadians are given the 
opportunity to do.  As the member of parliament for 
Bonavista—Trinity—Conception the second time around, I have a 
special awareness of what a great honour this is. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My duty today is to speak in support of the Speech from the 
Throne.  I do so as Minister of Industry and as somebody who is 
tremendously excited to be in that role.  The Prime Minister has 
asked me to take on these duties, and I am doing so with great 
enthusiasm.  I say that because I reflect back on where Canada 
has come since the first time I sat in this place in 1980, nearly 
21 years ago this month.

<A HREF="#LINKT2"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our country has changed enormously in those 21 years.  I 
remember the debates of the early 1980s in which we talked about 
the protection, enhancement and promotion of Canada primarily but 
not exclusively as a resource based economy.  We talked about our 
capacity in the manufacturing area, primarily about our 
industrial might and muscle in southern Ontario.  We talked about 
the structured arrangements under the auto pact which gave 
possibility or potential to that manufacturing might. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We talked about our position vis-à-vis our neighbour to the 
south as being that of a much smaller player, one-tenth the size. 
Indeed, the cliché was coined, shaped and nurtured back then that 
when the U.S. got the sniffles we got pneumonia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How much has changed since 1980?  We no longer think of our 
southern neighbour as a colossus that might inadvertently in the 
middle of the night roll over and lay waste to Canada and all of 
our aspirations.  Rather, we see our neighbour to the south as a 
tremendous market of opportunity, as a place that we can 
penetrate successfully and compete with and win in on a fair 
playing field with the quality of our products. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let those who come from the so-called old economy, such as our 
farmers, compete on a fair playing field.  The farmers of Canada 
can compete and win in any marketplace in the world today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A fair opportunity to compete is what is being asked for, 
whether it be our fishermen, our mining industry or our 
foresters.  Soon we will be talking about softwood lumber and 
fair access for that product in the marketplace to the south. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What has changed in the last 20 or 21 years is the way in which 
Canada has become an innovative society.  In that regard it is 
important to recognize the leadership that this country and the 
government has had from two individuals who I want to single out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In particular, I pay tribute to the tremendous leadership of my 
predecessor as Minister of Industry, the current Minister of 
Foreign Affairs, who has been very forward looking in the kind of 
stewardship he brought to the Department of Industry. I intend to 
continue with the road map that he has very much drafted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also recognize the vision and the leadership that the Prime 
Minister has brought to this agenda as well, because at the end 
of the day big change can only come with strong and visionary 
leadership. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What have we done?  We have shifted our capability for wealth 
creation beyond our considerable natural resource sectors.  Those 
remain important and will always be important.  We have learned 
to create wealth from the power of our ideas, from the scope of 
our imagination, and purely from our will to win, by being better 
than most others in areas of the knowledge and information based 
economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How have we done that?  We have done it by making substantial 
new investments in our people, a very important resource in the 
new economy.  We have created a tax environment that makes Canada 
an attractive location for smart and skilled people to come to 
and stay in to give of their skills in creating wealth that can 
be exported all over the world.  I refer to the tremendous work 
of the Minister of Finance in bringing forward a budget a few 
months ago that read and anticipated very well the state of play 
in the economy in North America. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have today a debate about whether or not the downturn in the 
U.S. economy will be soft, hard, long lasting or short term, but 
whatever the circumstances at the end of the day, and we believe 
it will be managed and measured south of the border, whatever the 
state of play, Canada is tremendously well positioned to absorb, 
ride out and recover quickly from whatever adjustment we see 
south of the border. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is not by accident, but by smart and good planning.  In 
that regard the House owes as well a special recognition and a 
vote of thanks to the Minister of Finance for his stewardship of 
Canada's economy.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Exactly a month ago on January 1 Canadians received the first 
$17 billion down payment on a five year $100 billion tax cut. 
This is not some kind of theological tax cut, one that is driven 
out of some misplaced ideology.  This is not money that is 
borrowed from our children. This is money that is surplus to our 
accounts because of solid stewardship of Canada's finances.  It 
leaves dollars and cents in the pockets of Canadians who are able 
to use those dollars and cents to contribute to the health of the 
Canadian economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Beyond that tax cut for our citizens, 52% of which goes to 
Canadians making $60,000 a year or less, we have also positioned 
ourselves very well with cuts to the capital gains and with new 
treatment of the rollover of stock and stock options, which 
encourage investment in the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are other areas of solid investment that the Government of 
Canada announced in the throne speech.  We have announced that 
Canada is not satisfied with being competitive in the area of 
research and development.  Canada wants to leap ahead. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has committed to a doubling of R and D over the 
next 10 years.  We want to move Canada to among the top five of 
the OECD in research and development.  We understand that when we 
nurture and support our best minds, our scientists and centres of 
excellence all across the country, we nurture and support the 
kinds of ideas that ultimately are commercialized and bring ideas 
and services to the marketplace of the world.  That has been a 
great success for the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It has been said before but it bears repeating:  the Government 
of Canada is committed to 2,000 research chairs at Canadian 
institutions.  Someone might ask what that means and how it 
compares with the status quo.  Canada had 169 research chairs in 
all of our universities prior to the Prime Minister committing to 
2,000 new chairs over five years, 400 more chairs a year for five 
years, built on a base of 169 to this point, all across Canada. 
We are reaching out to and supporting those who can build the new 
economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have invested $160 million in Genome Canada.  We have 
established the most generous R and D tax regime in the world 
today.  I am speaking not just to our own citizens and 
corporations but to citizens around the world who are looking for 
stable, smart environments in which to invest in R and D in the 
country.  For those who qualify for the full range of measures 
for R and D, it may cost no more than 35 cents on a dollar. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians have heard repeatedly that the Internet means the 
death of distance.  That is a well used and well worn phrase.  It 
is one that entices and invites those who live in far flung 
locations in this broad and vast country to believe that they can 
participate on the Internet, that they can have access from a 
leisure, pleasure and business point of view to all of the 
opportunities of the Internet.  However, it is not true. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Internet of and by itself is not the death of distance. 
There is a new phrase to which we should pay attention.  It is 
called the digital divide:  the division between those who have 
access to high speed, affordable, reliable broadband service and 
those who do not.  For those living in rural, remote, western, 
northern or Atlantic communities, merely getting online is not 
good enough. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The vision of the Government of Canada is this:  getting online 
with a service that is fast, efficient, affordable and reliable, 
one that can handle the content available today on the web and 
that allows us to improve the quality of our lives or to market 
our goods, services and products over the Internet.  The 
government has announced that Canada will seek to ensure that by 
2004 every community will be online with high speed broadband 
service.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Not since a government committed to using bands of steel to pull 
the country together in some measure of equality of opportunity 
has a government been so committed to a public infrastructure 
project which ensures that when it comes to the new economy, no 
Canadian, no matter where she or he may live, is left behind. 
This too is part of our vision of participating in the new 
economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In short, Canada is an innovative country.  Canada is a country 
of individuals whose commitment is second to none in regard to 
improving the quality of life of their fellow citizens and 
innovating in a way that improves the quality of life of citizens 
all over the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Part of our mission and our challenge in the months and years 
ahead is to tell the Canadian story, to re-brand the country. 
Part of it is to help those beyond our borders recognize that 
while we are proud to be associated with the vistas found on 
Prince Edward Island, on the prairies, in the Rockies, on the 
coastline of British Columbia or indeed on the magnificent 
coastline of Bonavista—Trinity—Conception, or with the 
pleasures of enjoying the ice sculptures in Ottawa at this time 
of year, or as my friend has just reminded me, with the wonderful 
new development of Toronto's Harbourfront, we also have to ensure 
that Canada is recognized for its tremendous technical ability as 
well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why in March or April, with a special source of pride, 
Canadians will be watching with some fascination the hand off 
that occurs when the Canadarm aboard the shuttle spacecraft lifts 
out of the cargo bay.  It is what we will call for the moment 
Canadarm 2.  That instrument will move, shift and facilitate the 
construction of the space lab project. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Fifteen nations from all over the world will be collaborating to 
put men, equipment and technology in space to open new frontiers, 
but the hand off that occurs to make all of that possible is a 
Canadarm out of the shuttle storage container passing off to a 
Canadarm 2, which will be permanently based on that space lab and 
which will facilitate the construction, development, maintenance 
and operation of this incredible international project. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is the measure and symbol of Canadian technology:  one hand 
passing off to the next hand a new generation of expertise.  That 
is the message we want to bring to the world.  In short, the 
country has much of which we can be proud, and we intend to grow 
our capacity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me close by saying that it is not by accident Canada became 
the first country in the world where every school is connected to 
the Internet.  I remember the great debate between Bill Clinton 
and Bob Dole in which Bob Dole said that his vision for the 
future was to try to recreate an America of his youth, of the 
fifties.  That vision had some attractive concepts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>President Clinton said that his vision of the future, his bridge 
to the future, was to see that every school in America got online 
by 2000.  I thought that was a fine declaration since Canada got 
there first.  Forgive me if I point out that Newfoundland got 
there in 1995. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can, we will and we must tap the power, the capacity and the 
imagination of all the young minds and of all the experienced 
researchers of this country to build a new economy, to compete, 
to improve our own quality of life, and to make our contribution 
to the quality of life of citizens all over the world.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Brian Pallister (Portage—Lisgar, Canadian Alliance):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, it is an extreme honour for me to have the chance to 
respond to the hon. member's comments and to elaborate on a 
couple of aspects which are of concern, particularly to the 
people in my riding and to people nationally. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member spoke in glowing terms about his own riding.  It was 
obvious the love he feels for it and his province.  I feel the 
same way about my own riding and my country.  He spoke of 
generations of expertise and of the concerns that he and his 
government have for the future and for the expertise we all want 
to see rise up inside our children in order for them to capture 
their potential. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those are wonderful words and quite true.  He also spoke of fair 
treatment, and that is of concern right now to many of my 
constituents and many farm families who have for generations done 
their best to adapt and to succeed.  Right now they are facing a 
set of circumstances, largely not of their own making, that pose 
tremendous challenges to them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the minister knows, the level playing field we subscribe to 
and would like to see for all industries in all sectors of our 
economy does not exist for agriculture.  That level playing field 
is something we desire to see.  Until we see it, the unlevel 
playing field is largely in an uphill direction for our 
agricultural producers.  The slope becomes ever steeper and 
causes many to fall and tumble downhill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As farmers leave the industry, depopulation follows.  Fewer and 
fewer people reside on the farmlands of our country.  We are 
allowing other countries, which value their agricultural 
industries very highly through policies of subsidization, to 
shape the policies of this country.  This government has adopted 
a policy of rural depopulation, which severely impacts on all of 
us who are thinking about the future as much, as the minister has 
alluded to, as his government apparently is thinking about the 
future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Recently the minister made the decision to subsidize the 
aerospace industry through the tax dollars of Canadians.  Knowing 
that was a difficult decision for him, has the minister 
considered that Brazil, through its own policies of reprisal 
against Canada for this decision, will very likely reduce its 
purchases of grain from Canada?  Has he considered that the very 
people who have not been favoured by such subsidies by our 
government, the agricultural producers of our land, will be the 
most disaffected now and the most penalized by the decisions the 
Brazilian government will make? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Brian Tobin:</B>  Mr. Speaker, let me assure the member 
for Portage—Lisgar that I and members on this side of the House 
share his very great concern for the plight and the position of 
Canadian farmers today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know we are not supposed to talk outside of our privileged 
dialogue in caucus, but I think I would be forgiven if I revealed 
that this has been a major preoccupation of members on this side 
of the House.  Whether it is in caucus, in cabinet or in cabinet 
committees, we too are concerned with the plight of farmers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The blunt reality is that the state and health of our farmers 
and farm community is not something that is isolated just to the 
farm community.  The farm community is a very important one.  It 
is felt right across the country.  Indeed my colleague just 
reminded me that as many as one in six jobs in urban settings are 
directly affected by the health and the success of our farm 
community. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no question that Canada must do everything it can to 
effectively assist our farmers to make the case for a fair and 
level playing field.  The member just asked me if I was aware of 
the consequence of taking measures to assist Bombardier in 
response to four WTO rulings, that Brazil might respond in a way 
that would cause further harm to some members of the Canadian 
agricultural community. 
That is a fair question to ask and something that we will 
obviously watch and pay very close attention to as we attempt to 
get Brazil to comply with WTO rulings.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need to remind Canadians that in the case of Brazil and 
Embraer, the competitor for the regional jet market, there has 
not been one compliance.  I do not come from a part of the 
country where Bombardier has a presence.  I do not come from a 
part of the country where I expect any time soon that Bombardier 
will have a presence.  There is no substantial play for the 
moment in my part of the country associated with these contracts. 
I am speaking purely as a Canadian and as the Minister of 
Industry looking at the following facts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I make the case to my fellow Canadians on the farms that we have 
had not one but four WTO rulings which indicate that Brazil has 
been acting in an unfair manner and offering unfair subsidies. We 
have also lost a very substantial market share as a result of 
these unfair trade practices.  Against that backdrop, Canada can 
do nothing for fear of criticism that we are helping one sector. 
It may cause problems for others.  There may be a bite.  We can 
let the industry go, 95,000 jobs, or we can respond. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My question to the member would be, is it his position that the 
government ought not to have acted on the position of his party 
with respect to Bombardier?  Is it his position now that we 
should withdraw because there may be a dispute and, if there is a 
dispute, there may be others that will be put at risk?  If that 
is his position, as the spokesperson for the opposition he is 
certainly entitled to say it.  I would be very interested in 
hearing from him. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  I had hoped that we could make the questions 
and comments a little shorter when there are so many members who 
wish to ask questions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Brian Tobin:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of 
order.  I would ask if colleagues opposite would consider 
allowing a brief response because I think it is important that we 
know whether or not parliament is of like mind on such a 
fundamental issue as this one. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  It is reasonable to share the questions and 
comments but I am sure the hon. member for Portage—Lisgar will 
have an opportunity to make a speech later in the debate. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK27"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Antoine Dubé (Lévis-et-Chutes-de-la-Chaudière, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
I want to put a question to the new Minister of Industry, whom I 
congratulate on his appointment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He alluded to the history of the Canadian model and, as he was a 
member of parliament back in 1993, I would remind him that 
during the 1993 election campaign the Liberals had promised a 
shipbuilding policy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a former provincial premier, the minister surely remembers 
that, on two occasions, he and his counterparts, had asked the 
federal government to develop a shipbuilding policy. 
On October 20, he even organized, as a former premier of 
Newfoundland, a meeting with the other premiers of the Atlantic 
provinces to deal with shipbuilding. He attended that meeting as 
the Minister of Industry and, at the time, set up a committee 
that was to table a report by the end of January, in order to 
take quick action. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now that he has been re-elected and is the Minister of Industry, 
does he remember the commitments that he made in October and 
will he act quickly to adopt a new policy very soon? This is 
extremely urgent. The minister is very familiar with the issue, 
since there are several shipyards in his riding, even though one 
of them has shut down, if I am not mistaken. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When will the minister announce the true shipbuilding policy 
that he promised? 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Brian Tobin:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank the member for his 
representation with respect to the issue of shipbuilding.  I also 
thank him for recognizing that I was the premier of the province 
that organized a forum.  It was the first forum organized in some 
time that allowed provincial government representatives, four 
premiers, six or seven different provinces, the private sector 
and the unions to come together in one place to talk about 
shipbuilding.

<A HREF="#LINKT7"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the great ironies was that I sent out the invitations as 
premier and I attended the shipbuilding conferences as Minister 
of Industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A couple of points that came out of that conference. I think the 
member knows very well that it was a very positive and 
constructive meeting. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, we recognized Canada as the largest maritime nation in 
the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, it was inconceivable to all of those who attended that 
meeting that Canada should lose its ship repair and shipbuilding 
capabilities.  It simply makes no sense that we would not remain 
in the sector. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Third, there was no solution around the notion of arbitrarily 
reaching out and subsidizing a yard here or a project here or a 
ship there.  That was a consensus.  I know the member is on 
record as saying that he agrees with that consensus. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Fourth, we had to find innovative ways.  The member put 
forward a bill in the last parliament that had a menu of items 
which were considered innovative ways of making the sector more 
competitive and smarter.  That does not mean doing things the old 
way.  It does not even necessarily mean doing the old work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A case in point is the yard in Newfoundland which is no longer 
building ships or employing shipyard workers.  They are building 
topside modules for offshore oil and gas.  They have brought in 
new skills, new technology and new training. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When will we respond?  The committee will report in the middle 
of February.  I need to study that report.  The member would not 
want me to act in advance of hearing the advice of those who are 
so committed to the sector.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary—Nose Hill, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to be splitting my time 
this morning with my colleague from Yellowhead.  He is the deputy 
critic in the Canadian Alliance health portfolio.  He has an 
extensive background of sitting on hospital boards and of 
chairing a regional health authority. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the critic team is the member for Nanaimo—Alberni who has 
extensive experience in complementary medicine.  We are proud to 
have a very strong health component to Canadian Alliance policy 
making.  I am the chief critic for the health portfolio. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think we have all had experience with the Canadian health care 
system.  My own experience has been more extensive than I would 
like.  One example is very much on my mind now because it is a 
bit of an anniversary.  Several years ago I had a call from my 
mother to tell me that she had been diagnosed with colon cancer. 
She passed away around this time some years ago after two years 
of struggling with her cancer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the things that stands out for me during that time was 
the visits I paid to her on the weekend.  We lived several hours 
away and so I would go with my little daughter to see mom on the 
weekends.  I remember the care that she received in the hospital 
in northern Alberta. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The nurses were beyond kind.  They always had her hair fixed.  I 
remember how they would put a little flower on her nightgown when 
we would come to visit so that she would be ready for her family. 
It was care far beyond technology.  It meant a lot to my mom and 
to her family. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we talk about health care sometimes we talk too much about 
dollars and cents, clinics, technology, numbers, pay levels, and 
maybe not enough about the spirit that should animate the health 
care system: the caring and the compassion that contribute so 
much to peace of mind, as much I would say as medicine, 
technology, and keeping good charts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians value their health care system.  It goes beyond the 
mechanics of it.

<A HREF="#LINKT8"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is something that Canadians believe needs to be there for 
people to sustain them, to support them, and to meet their needs 
in a compassionate way when medical tragedy strikes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians want the peace of mind of knowing they have a strong, 
top notch health care system.  Canadians want prompt, quality 
care, from a fair system that depends not on a person's financial 
status but on his or her medical needs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians take pride in a health system that has reflected our 
values of neighbourliness and sharing risk and being there for 
each other. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians want leaders who are committed enough to deliver the 
fair, prompt, quality health care they need for peace of mind and 
to meet the requirements of care when health problems arise. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><I>Maclean's</I> magazine does an annual year end poll.  At the 
end of December <I>Maclean's</I> surveyed Canadians about their 
attitudes toward our health system.  The latest survey showed 
that health care had lost ground in the past quarter century. 
This concern has topped the <I>Maclean's</I> year end survey for 
two years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians increasingly believe that many of our country's key 
social institutions, including hospitals, are broke and need 
fixing.  Restoring health care clearly tops the list for 
Canadians, with a full 35% of Canadians surveyed saying this is 
Canada's biggest problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A national health care survey last June disclosed that 82% of 
Canadians believe there are too few doctors and nurses in our 
system, the most fundamental health care providers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Seventy-seven per cent of respondents believe the system will 
face increasing demands from an aging population.  Seventy-six 
per cent believe there is inadequate government funding.  Seventy 
per cent say the health system lacks accountability to the public 
on how money is spent.  Seventy per cent say there is not enough 
modern diagnostic equipment like MRIs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A headline in yesterday's newspaper said that in Ontario alone 
there is a backlog of up to 12,000 people a year in one province 
awaiting MRIs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Fifty-eight per cent believe that there are not enough 
hospitals.  Nearly half those polled believe there is not enough 
use of modern information technology such as electronic patient 
records. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is clear that Canadians are looking for some leadership in 
addressing these issues.  In the short time my deputies and I 
have worked on this portfolio we have identified five key issues 
that we believe must be addressed.  There may be more, but this 
is a start. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First is the issue of how to ensure that prompt, quality health 
care as defined by measurable standards is available to Canadians 
when they need essential medical services both in the immediate 
and the long term future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second issue is how to ensure adequate resources for health 
care, including infrastructure technology and trained medical 
service providers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Third, is there any role for provision and/or funding of 
essential medical services other than by the state, and if so, 
what role? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fourth is how to ensure responsible use of health care 
resources, both by health care users and health care providers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Fifth, what is the most effective balance of responsibilities 
among the federal and the provincial governments in overseeing 
our health care system?

<A HREF="#LINKT9"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we worked together in a non-partisan way to address these key 
issues, Canadians would go along away toward being satisfied that 
the leadership from their elected officials was moving in the 
right direction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has not had a reassuring record on health care. 
It slashed huge amounts of funding several years ago and agreed 
to put the money back only under pressure of a looming election. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That means that in a year or two health care funding will be 
back to where it was in 1994-95.  It is a back to the future 
approach to health care funding by the federal government.  It 
will clearly not meet the needs and anxieties of Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The throne speech earlier this week spent about two of its 
forty-five minutes on health care.  This is an issue that 35% of 
Canadians put at the top of their list of concerns.  There seems 
to be a disconnect between the government and the needs of 
Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian Alliance has decided to step back and re-examine 
the health care issue.  We have set up a task force which will 
consult with health care users, providers and experts.  I will 
visit a couple of European countries that I think have something 
to teach us.  I will talk with experts there to see what they 
feel works and does not work, lessons we may be able to apply 
here.  We will also invite input and advice from Canadians across 
the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We believe if we work together we can make real strides in 
addressing the health care concerns of Canadians.  The Canadian 
Alliance wants and intends to be part of the solution and we look 
forward very much to that work. 
<P><A NAME="LINK29"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rob Merrifield (Yellowhead, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, it is a great honour to stand here today to speak on 
behalf of the people of my riding of Yellowhead. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I begin by thanking everyone who helped in my campaign and by 
thanking as well the voters of Yellowhead for placing me in such 
great confidence.  I speak on their behalf and that is a great 
privilege. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Most important, though, I thank my wife Brenda, my two sons Chad 
and Scott, my daughter-in-law Joanne and the rest of my loving 
family for their support. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not without some sadness that I stand to reply to the 
throne speech with regard to health care.  I was disappointed 
that the government did not have any real vision or solutions for 
Canada. Instead, this caretaker government recycled the same old 
ideas that have robbed Canada of its status as a country of 
influence for many years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I had hoped that the Liberal legacy of broken promises, 
arrogance, waste, patronage and secrecy would have finally been 
replaced by tax relief, justice reform and stable health care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need a government that understands Canadians and responds to 
their concerns, and I am disappointed.  Canadians want a 
government with practical solutions, ready to tackle big issues 
like health care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The root problems in health care were ignored in the Speech from 
the Throne.  It maintained the status quo.  Provincial and 
federal relationships over the past years have deteriorated to an 
all time low, so much so that they cannot be repaired under the 
present government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Sir John A. Macdonald, the visionary of Canada and 
Confederation, foresaw the conflicts that would happen between 
competing governments in our diverse and vast land.  In the 
Confederation debate of 1864 he called for a constitution that 
would avoid all conflicts of jurisdiction and authority.  Clear 
lines were established on issues such as health care.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The adversarial approach of the Liberal government in dealing 
with the provinces has become a very large part of the problem. 
The Canadian Alliance is committed to working with the 
stakeholders under the provisions of the Canada Health Act to 
come up with practical, long term solutions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately the government has more interest in provoking a 
fight with the provinces than in building constructive solutions 
based on consensus.  The adversarial approach taken by the 
federal government must come to an end.  We must start working 
together collaboratively. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals claim to be the protectors of health care.  That is 
interesting because history paints a different story for me. They 
began their reign in 1993 by ripping the guts out of the health 
care system and trying to balance the books on the back of that 
system.  Their across the board cuts went against the original 
50:50 funding arrangements with the provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They not only removed the dollars but insisted on influencing 
things outside the Canada Health Act.  The actions in 1993 have 
had long lasting effects on the health care system, none of which 
are positive.  Long term planning has been neglected.  Our aging 
population will challenge our system beyond anything we have seen 
at present.  The status quo means certain collapse of a strained 
health care system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The neglect since 1993 has left Canada behind in infrastructure 
technology and the training of medical service providers.  An 
example was the threat of a shutdown of a seniors facility this 
month because of a nursing shortage in rural communities. 
Forty-two seniors were about to be displaced.  Forty-two may not 
sound like a lot, but when one's whole life is shrunk down to 
four walls and a photo album that kind of change is devastating. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is only the tip of the iceberg in terms of the stories 
about the pending problems in health care that we will be told 
across the country.  We need a government that will recognize the 
impact of the aging baby boomer generation on the system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The throne speech boasts of a fall agreement with the provinces 
to put back $21 billion over a five year period.  This is not new 
money for health care.  Even though the program was introduced in 
last fall's parliament, the reality is that the funding which 
sustained the system in 1994 will not be reached until March 
2002. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government could have shown real leadership by putting this 
money to work today.  However, not one nickel of that $21 billion 
will hit the system until April 1 of this year, and then it will 
be spread over a five year period. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is not only about dollars and cents.  The survival of the 
health care system requires a comprehensive shift in 
accountability.  Users and providers need to be more aware of and 
accountable for how health care dollars are spent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I speak from personal experience.  I have dealt with the health 
care system in Alberta as a member of the health board and 
regional authorities for the past 15 years.  I have dealt with 
the administration of the health system on a daily basis.  I 
understand the fears Canadians are feeling.  The government must 
look at the real issues facing the health care system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Health care is not the only issue affecting Yellowhead.  My 
constituents are also very concerned about what is happening in 
agriculture.  The government must fight to protect the 
agricultural system which is the backbone of the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I feel the pain and the frustration of those who drove their 
tractors to Parliament Hill this week.  I also fear that my son, 
who is the fourth generation to farm our land north of 
Whitecourt, may be the last because it makes little economic 
sense to stay on the family farm today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why should farmers believe the government has their best 
interest in mind?  Real leadership would have come if the 
government had fought against unfair foreign subsidies when it 
came to power in 1993 and not today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Skyrocketing input costs and low commodity prices will mean an 
end to the family farm as we know it.  Canadian farmers are the 
most efficient in the world and a vital part of our economy.  The 
government must make a firm commitment to protect them and do so 
now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yellowhead is a diverse riding, relying on agriculture, tourism, 
and resources like timber and coal which are going through 
difficult times as well.  Current economic policies have driven 
the dollar to the point where we are selling our raw resources at 
fire sale prices.  Energy costs are also destroying small 
businesses across the riding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government must take the lead in ensuring the crisis 
does not lead to economic disaster.  We need a government that 
sets an optimistic tone for the future, not one that is looking 
for a legacy.  True legacies are built, not bought.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I have another concern that I must address immediately.  It is 
the issue of self-governance in the town of Jasper, which is 
a community of 4,000 plus individuals nestled into the national 
park.  All Canadians should look at this issue and question the 
value a government places on democracy and accountability. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Jasper has asked for the ability to govern its own municipal 
affairs.  There are numerous examples of bureaucratic nightmares 
which I can cite.  An example that comes to mind is the new fire 
truck that Jasper received.  It was ordered by bureaucrats 3,000 
miles away.  The fire truck is too big to fit in the fire hall. 
This has left the town's emergency services in some doubt because 
the truck sits outside in the cold. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Jasper also continues to discharge raw sewage into the pristine 
headwaters of the Rocky Mountains, resulting in a cumbersome 
bureaucracy unable to make reasonable decisions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are municipal matters.  Democracy and accountability must 
be granted to the community of Jasper. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am disappointed in the lack of vision that the government has 
set out for Canada.  I believe this country has absolutely 
unbelievable potential.  I am sorry to say that after hearing the 
government's plans in the Speech from the Throne, I will have to 
tell the people of Yellowhead that the ship remains adrift and it 
is going to be a very long three and a half years.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary—Nose Hill, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague for his 
excellent overview of health issues in the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Because of his background in the regional health authority in 
his home province, I would like to ask the member what he 
believes the federal government could or should do and what its 
highest priorities should be to strengthen and address the 
concerns of Canadians in our health care system? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rob Merrifield:</B>  Mr. Speaker, health care is 
absolutely the number one priority for the people who walk the 
streets of our country.  We are identified as Canadians by our 
health care and it is absolutely the most precious thing for us. 
Accountability must be there by the users and the providers of 
the system if we are going to sustain that system.  It is 
absolutely important that we see that as priority one. 
<P><A NAME="LINK31"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Grant Hill (Macleod, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I congratulate my colleague on his maiden speech. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1993 we were told that there was a huge deficit in the 
country.  The Liberals chose to cut funding for health care as 
one of their priorities.  I felt that was a mistake in priority 
and thought that possibly areas such as HRDC grants and 
contributions could have gone down so health care could have been 
preserved. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>From the member's perspective would he share the belief 
that there were other areas that could have been cut to reduce 
the deficit rather than in our health care system? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rob Merrifield:</B>  Mr. Speaker, health care is priority 
number one for Canadians.  That is absolutely essential.  To have 
the government reduce the funding so radically and take such an 
adversarial approach in doing it is unconstitutional.  I do not 
understand how it can do that and live with itself. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I understand that with the constraints in the budget the 
government had to reduce.  However, there was no collaboration. 
That destroyed the relationship between the provinces and the 
federal government and stepped over bounds.  The repercussions of 
that decision have yet to come home to roost.

congratulations to you.  To my colleagues around the floor of the 
House, I pledge my respect for their opinions and pledge that I 
will work with them toward the goal that I believe will create a 
better Canada for all of our constituents.  I believe we come 
here with the same goals in our heads and in our hearts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is my third time in the House and I want to take the time 
to thank my husband John and my children Amanda, Devon and John 
Anthony. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By necessity all of us share our energy and our time.  We know 
we always give our love to our families, but they share in our 
geographical separations that are occasioned by our work in the 
House and across this land.

</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a great pleasure and honour to be here among you.  I am 
greatly honoured.  Like all the other members of this House, I 
am learning my second official language.  I am studying with a 
good teacher. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, I am sharing time with the member for Scarborough 
East. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am well aware that the historical significance of having two 
founding nations sharing this land with our aboriginal peoples is 
the prime significance in the development, the history and the 
future of this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The inclusiveness I heard spoken in the Speech from the Throne 
and the response by our Prime Minister is at the heart of 
everything we should be looking toward when our setting our goals 
and plans.  Social and economic ideas have to be integrated 
taking into account the real life of our constituents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would be remiss if I did not thank the constituents in London 
West who voted for me, as well as those who did not.  I work on 
their behalf everyday and will continue to do so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We all come here with special interests.  My special interest 
since 1993 has been research and the economic development that 
has resulted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we formed the government in 1993, Canada's record was not 
good nationally or internationally.  There were valid reasons. 
The state of our economy, the debt and the deficit were very real 
inhibitors.  I am grateful that we have now set a very realistic 
goal of being among the top five in the developed world for 
allocating research dollars.  I realize that not only will 
government have to invest research dollars into its own 
operations, but it will have to invest in our universities and 
industries so they can share in this very important endeavour. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Not only shall we be doing the basic science research, research 
which will translate into jobs and products, we will also need a 
trained workforce.  With a department like Human Resources 
Development, we will be there for those people who are striving 
to learn.  Over the past number of years we also put in place a 
number of plans.  We now have the registered education plan which 
will allow people to take time out from their working life to 
retrain and update skills so they can more fully participate in 
their communities and take care of their families. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am especially pleased that we have targeted special programs 
that have tested well already in certain jurisdictions.  There is 
a need to help single parents.  Sharing wealth and opportunity is 
very worthwhile, which is the theme of the throne speech.  It is 
necessary for us to share this with our communities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last term I spent some time in the aboriginal affairs committee. 
I am very pleased that we are further looking at governance and 
inclusion.  We will be putting hope and dollars back on the table 
so people can advance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have been in regions where young children have to separate 
from their families at the high school level to finish their 
early years of education.  I am not talking about university or 
college, or a separation for a week or a day.  I am talking about 
separation for a term.  The infrastructure is not on site. Family 
nurturing cannot be done in the home. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am aware that in the aboriginal community money is not always 
available to every person who is ready for post-secondary 
education.  It comes parcelled from our federal government.  We 
are looking for leaders in all of our communities but these 
leaders need tools.  One of the basic tools, and I think all 
members in the House would agree, is an education.

</I></B></P><P align=left>People need housing.  In the aboriginal communities there is a 
vast need to share housing dollars.  They also need clean 
water.  There are communities in Canada that do not have clean, 
accessible water.  A lot of those are aboriginal communities. 
This is not right. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think we understand the problems.  In the document “Gathering 
Strength”, the government mapped out a long term solution.  I am 
very happy and would be very willing, as I hope all members of 
the House and the broader Canadian public would be, to see an 
expansion of this very necessary work.  This would enable us to 
hold ourselves proud together with our brothers and sisters in 
Canada and say that one community can strive for the same 
amenities that other communities have like public health and 
public access to the educational needs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will speak about our children.  It is a cliché to say that our 
children are our future, but we help shape that future.  The 
provinces have the primary responsibility for education. 
However, through an agreement with them, we are partners in those 
programs.  We have assisted in many ways and will continue to 
assist. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Most employment statistics show that over half of the employees 
in Canada will need in excess of a secondary level of 
education.  We need a very trained workforce.  All communities 
need access to it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am very grateful that we are continuing to put money into our 
Internet access in urban communities.  I understand the Minister 
of Industry will be handing out more.  Seniors will have access 
to the Internet.  I am also very pleased that our children will 
now have access and the capability to obtain knowledge in the new 
economy which many of us are striving for that in middle life. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Speech from the Throne and our response signalled that our 
banking community will get the tools it needs with the 
legislation that hopefully will be placed before us again.  That 
resolution will help Canada's economy modernize and be 
competitive in a global environment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I knocked on the doors of my constituents during my 
campaign for re-election, I was surprised that many people had 
put the environment at the front burner of their thoughts.  They 
said it was worth spending money on.  In the past environment was 
not my top issue.  Today I am concerned about my health.  I am 
concerned about clean water, clean air and the pollution 
from our industries and across our borders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The value of forests and the value of sustainable development is 
also important.  People have been talking intensely about this 
for many years but it did not gather public support.  People had 
not related to the fact that an endangered species perhaps needs 
the same things we need to live and survive.  We know now 
because we are a species sharing this environment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I applaud the government for going ahead on the environment, on 
the health needs of our population, on research and on the new 
economy.  I would be remiss to say that I did not applaud or fully 
support the economic development increase going to the global 
community.  We share the world and we have a responsibility to 
share its resources and, where necessary, extend a helping hand. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will have many opportunities over the next few years to 
debate these issues in the House.  I wish all of my colleagues 
well in their work.  I pledge to you, Mr. Speaker and the other 
members sitting in your chair, my co-operation and respect. 
<P><A NAME="LINK33"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John McKay (Scarborough East, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
want to take this opportunity to congratulate you on your 
election.  I am absolutely confident that you will make a fair 
minded and wonderful Speaker. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also want to thank the electors of Scarborough East for 
returning me to this Chamber to offer their views on these 
important issues.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>A throne speech is really only a document that gives direction. 
It is necessarily less specific than some would wish.  However, 
Canadians should really only see the throne speech as a book with 
a number of chapters to follow.  I will comment on one of those 
chapters which deals with strong and safe communities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Until now Canada has enjoyed a relatively buoyant economy. 
Interest rates are relatively low.  People's real incomes are 
rising.  We have reduced the national debt and interest rates are 
down. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The level of prosperity may or may not continue.  Some say that 
it will not.  However, with the prudent assumptions of the 
government we are hopeful that our buoyant economy will return. 
We are much better positioned to weather a downturn in the 
economy if and when it comes.  For the time being, we can still 
dream dreams and address some of the pressing needs of our 
people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yesterday I listened to the Leader of the Opposition in his 
reply to the Speech from the Throne.  He was talking tough on 
crime.  He went on to talk about how criminals seem to have all 
the rights and that victims do not have any. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to take the opportunity to correct the mistaken 
impression that the Leader of the Opposition may have 
unintentionally left, namely that criminals have all the rights. 
All Canadians enjoy exactly the same rights when faced with a 
criminal offence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is simple minded rhetoric to say that criminals have all the 
rights and victims have none.  All Canadians are presumed 
innocent.  All Canadians have the right not to self-incriminate. 
All Canadians have the right to present a full defence.  All 
Canadians have the right to have the crown prove its case beyond 
a reasonable doubt.  Those rights, among many others, are enjoyed 
by all Canadians charged with any crime and therefore, in my 
view, it does a disservice to victims to speak of victims' rights 
and criminal rights in a cheap rhetorical flourish. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a pity that the hon. Leader of the Opposition has not 
reviewed the work of the Standing Committee on Justice and Human 
Rights from the last parliament.  Had he reviewed the work of the 
committee he would have come across Bill C-79, commonly called 
the victims' rights bill.  The genesis of that bill was in the 
committee's report called, “Victims: A Voice not a Veto”.  The 
report was unanimously put forward to the House by all members, 
of which one of his members, particularly the member for Surrey 
North, made a significant contribution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill arose out of that report and was introduced into the 
House.  It came back before the committee and was quickly 
returned to the House because it incorporated many of the 
suggestions contained in the report.  I have yet to hear any 
person who represents victims that advocates that the bill is 
substantively flawed in any way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. Leader of the Opposition would also have been 
interested in the work of the committee on drunk driving.  Again 
an all-party committee produced the bill, which, among other 
things, substantially increased the penalties for drunk driving. 
His own members contributed to the drafting of the bill.  The 
Minister of Justice was gracious enough to introduce the bill 
into the House because she was persuaded of its merits.  Included 
in the bill was a potential life sentence for those convicted of 
drunk driving a third time; three strikes and they would be gone. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not think it can be tougher without getting into issues of 
disproportionality.  On this side of the House we are plenty 
tough on crime.  We are not so foolish, however, as to skewer the 
entire system of justice and the criminal code just to show how 
tough we really are.  If he still wishes to be tough he should 
look at the committee report on organized crime.  Our report was 
very detailed on how we as a committee felt that organized crime 
should be dealt with.  I was pleased to see that the Speech from 
the Throne picked up on that issue.  It said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Government will focus on safeguarding Canadians from new and 
emerging forms of crime.  It will take aggressive steps to combat 
organized crime, including the creation of stronger anti-gang 
laws and measures to protect members of the justice system from 
intimidation. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I, for one, look forward to the opportunity to review our 
initial work on organized crime and spend time making suggestions 
to the government with respect to specific amendments to the 
criminal code and enhancements to the authority of police 
officers and people in the justice system.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Justice is more than just getting tough.  Any fool can be tough, 
and we may even have some examples in the House.  Justice is far 
more subtle than just merely being tough.  A society that 
incarcerates aboriginals at rates vastly disproportionate to the 
rest of the population is a society that must look itself in the 
mirror. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remember questioning a judge from the Northwest Territories, a 
former professor of mine at Queen's University, who was gracious 
enough to come before the committee on Bill C-3. I asked him 
about the disproportionate incarceration rates of aboriginal 
youth.  His answer was ultimately quite sad. Tragically many 
justices incarcerate aboriginal youth because they have no real 
alternatives.  Youth homes are either dysfunctional or do not 
exist at all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The thinking is that throwing the kid in jail is actually doing 
him a favour.  I submit that this is the brutal indictment of our 
own society.  The throne speech read: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a tragic reality that too many Aboriginal people are 
finding themselves in conflict with the law.  Canada must take 
the measures needed to significantly reduce the percentage of 
Aboriginal people entering the criminal justice system. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I agree with the throne speech and the Prime Minister.  The 
Prime Minister has set a generation bar of 20 years to reduce the 
number of aboriginals in conflict with our criminal justice 
system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have said that justice is more than just getting tough. 
Justice means that there will be a sentence after a conviction, 
not before as some would like.  When that sentence is served the 
convicted person will return to the street, with the exception of 
those serving life sentences. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Everyone returns to the street some day.  One way or another 
they will return to us, to society, to their communities and to 
their families.  Getting tough by throwing someone in jail, 
walking away and throwing away the proverbial key creates a 
lifetime criminal.  Since everyone returns to society some time, 
we either manage the reintegration and rehabilitation or just 
walk away and leave the criminal to make out as best he or she 
can.  I prefer a system which stands beside the person on the way 
to completing his or her sentence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Getting tough with rehabilitation and reintegration is just 
plain stupid.  It is in society's best interest to try to assist 
individuals so that recidivism rates will be reduced.  If an 
offender is let back on the streets a bit at a time, it only 
makes sense that the chances of him or her returning to a 
lifetime of crime are reduced, rather than simply pitching the 
criminal over the proverbial walls of the jail and hoping that he 
or she makes out and saying in effect “You are on your own, 
buddy”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I look forward to the Minister of Justice following up on the 
commitment in the Speech from the Throne to reintroduce the youth 
justice bill, which will: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—encourage alternatives to custody for non-violent offenders, 
emphasizing rehabilitation and reintegration into society, while 
toughening consequences for more violent youth. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In closing, any fool can be tough.  Being tough on crime is 
merely a rhetorical flourish, but it is far more difficult to be 
just.  The record of the 36th parliament showed us getting tough 
on drunk driving, getting tough by taking DNA samples from 
certain convicted criminals, getting tough on organized crime, 
and getting tough on child prostitution and sex tourism.  In some 
respects that is the easy part. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The greater challenge is to be just.  I believe we have taken 
some steps in that direction with the victims rights bill and the 
youth justice bill.  It remains to be seen whether parliament 
will be serious about aboriginal crime, organized crime and youth 
justice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am hoping that over the course of the next number of years the 
House will have the opportunity to be serious about being just.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Grant Hill (Macleod, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I have always found the member opposite to be reasonable 
and balanced in his approach.  I congratulate him on his 
re-election. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is quite a debate on justice issues.  One that I thought 
gave the member opposite an opportunity to show his colours was 
the issue of child pornography.  As the member will remember, 
that law was struck down in B.C. Many of my colleagues opposite 
asked the Prime Minister and the government to take all necessary 
steps to have that law reinstated, even if it meant something as 
drastic as the notwithstanding clause. 
If my memory serves me well, the hon. member opposite signed a 
petition to the Prime Minister asking for that step to be taken.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>When that very motion was put before the House, I do not recall 
the member voting for it.  The wording was similar.  Maybe he 
could explain to me why the rights of children did not take 
precedence over the rights of the pedophile and the rights of the 
true criminal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have not had a chance to go over it privately, so I will give 
him the opportunity in the House to explain why he would not vote 
for the motion when it came before the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John McKay:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the hon. member is correct. 
I did not sign the petition.  The reason was that it was the cart 
before the horse: first the sentence and then the conviction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The justice in the B.C. court said that subsection (4) of the 
child pornography laws was unconstitutional.  That was upheld in 
the 2:1 decision in the court of appeal.  I think that was the 
time at which the petition was circulated.  The Government of 
Canada had intervened and it was to be a constitutional issue 
before the supreme court. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The invocation of the notwithstanding clause would have been 
premature until the supreme court ruled.  The supreme court 
ultimately ruled in a 9:0 decision, which is an enormous decision 
on the part of the supreme court that this was a constitutional 
law.  Therefore we as parliamentarians and the government would 
have looked like classic fools to have said that we would invoke 
the notwithstanding clause at any stage prior to the ruling of 
the supreme court. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The supreme court has deferred to parliament.  It has recognized 
that when parliament speaks on a significant issue such as child 
pornography it will defer as long as there is some causal link 
between the harm that parliament is trying to remedy and the 
infringement on the freedoms contained in the charter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I found the decision of the supreme court to be measured, 
realistic and something of which all Canadians could be proud. It 
restored something of the dialogue between the court and 
parliament.  Until now I could make the argument that it was 
something of a monologue, that the court spoke and parliament 
listened.  In this instance parliament spoke, the court listened 
and Canadian society is much better off. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My reasoning for not signing the petition was that it was 
entirely premature. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Grant Hill:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I wish to ask a 
supplementary question.  The two years that have transpired 
between the law being struck down in the court in B.C. allowed 
pedophiles to escape justice.  Many of them carried on with these 
activities.  Their cases were not brought before the court.  That 
gave them an opportunity to practise a craft that I will never 
understand. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would the hon. member comment on the two years the law was not 
being enforced in Canada, thereby allowing pedophiles to conduct 
their craft? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John McKay:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the striking down of that 
law was applicable only to British Columbia.  The rest of the 
provinces were still proceeding with charges.  In Ontario 41 
cases were held up pending the disposition of the Supreme Court of 
Canada.  I have received assurances from justice officials that 
all those cases will proceed in the normal fashion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The comfort that we take and the surety we gain by a 9:0 
decision was worth the minor delay.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Richard Marceau (Charlesbourg, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, thank you 
for giving me the floor.  I will be sharing my time with the 
hon. member for Terrebonne—Blainville. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to begin by expressing my thanks to the people of 
Charlesbourg—Jacques-Cartier for entrusting me for the second time 
in a row to represent them in the House, despite a tough 
campaign in which issues having nothing to do with federal 
politics were constantly being brought up. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Despite the smokescreens, they were able to see that what was 
principally at stake in this election was a repudiation of the 
Liberal government. 
This they have done, having resisted the demagoguery of certain 
individuals aimed at transforming this federal election into a 
referendum on an issue with no impact whatsoever on the federal 
scene. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The speech we heard a few days ago is very clear.  Its 
underlying premise is very clear: denial of the reality that is 
Quebec in every statement it contains.  Behind every word, every 
sentence, every paragraph, every chapter, lies the desire of the 
Liberal federal government to deny the existence of the Quebec 
nation and, worse yet, to deny the existence of certain 
consensuses in Quebec, be they federalist or sovereignist. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would even venture to say that there has never been any 
consensus in Quebec this government has not wanted to go against. 
Every time a consensus is reached in Quebec above party lines, 
be they federalist or sovereignist, Péquiste, Liberal, Action 
démocratique, socialist or whatever, this government tries to 
oppose it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is very apparent in the latest speech from the throne.  I 
will give you only three examples, because, unfortunately, my 
time is limited.  However, if the House were to give me more 
time, I would be pleased to give more examples. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, let us look at parental leave.  There is broad consensus 
in Quebec in support of an effective parental leave plan. 
In its Speech from the Throne, the Liberal government announced 
with great pomp that it wanted to make children a priority. 
Unfortunately, it is refusing to transfer the necessary funds to 
the Government of Quebec, which wants to establish a more 
complete, solid and effective policy on parental leave. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Among other things, the Liberal government is ignoring 
self-employed workers entirely.  Heaven knows, in this new 
economy, many people, especially young people, work for 
themselves.  They work at home, in the new Internet economy, in 
communications and so on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With the proposed government plan, these people, especially the 
young, will not be covered by the parental leave plan.  It is 
generally the young who have children and who need parental 
leave.  So this entire segment of the population is denied the 
possibility of taking parental leave. 
This is an example of a consensus in Quebec, which the federal 
government has decided to oppose. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second example is young offenders.  Once again, the Bloc has 
done exceptional work representing the Quebec consensus on the 
federal scene.  The member for Berthier—Montcalm, who is here 
today, has done a particularly fine job in this area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All the Quebec stakeholders—judges, crown attorneys, defence 
lawyers, social workers and the police—everyone involved in 
juvenile delinquency in Quebec are saying “Do not touch the 
existing Young Offenders Act, it works”.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Not only does it work, but when the Standing Committee on 
Justice travelled across Canada to hear witnesses on the 
government's intention to change the existing act, all the 
stakeholders said that the act worked well in Quebec, and was 
indeed an example that ought to be emulated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But what did the federal government do? It seems to have taken 
the stand that, regardless of how well the act is 
working—provided it is properly implemented, of course—it shall be 
shelved and replaced with a harsher, more repressive measure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I discussed this issue with friends, including Europeans, and 
commented that only in Canada could such a situation occur, 
whereby an act that is working well if it is properly 
implemented could be shelved and replaced with an unproven 
legislative measure. This is totally surreal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is why I am telling the government that, instead of 
imposing this new, harsher vision and running the risk of 
throwing out legislation that works very well in Quebec, it 
should include a clause allowing Quebec, if it so wishes, to 
implement the existing legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the other provinces want a harsher, more repressive law, they 
will have that option. 
But let Quebec manage the program the way it wants because, I 
repeat, it is working. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This was the second consensus the federal government decided to 
ignore. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The third example is education.  To my astonishment, the throne 
speech went on and on about the federal government's desire to 
interfere in the area of education although, as everyone would 
agree, this is a provincial jurisdiction and the one most 
staunchly defended since the British North America Act, 1867. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Certain passages took my breath away, and I will cite one of 
them from page 6: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Youth at risk are among the most likely to drop out of school or 
to have difficulty in making the transition from school to work. 
The Government will work...to ensure support for youth who 
particularly need help staying in school or getting their first 
job. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is this if not a clear sign that the federal government 
wants to interfere in a jurisdiction that does not concern it? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here is another example: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—many Canadian adults lack the higher literacy skills needed in 
the new economy. The Government of Canada will invite the 
provinces... to launch a national initiative with the goal of 
significantly increasing the proportion of adults with these 
higher-level skills. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The goals are great, but this is none of its business.  Why is 
it getting involved at all? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is the third example of a consensus against which the 
federal government has decided to pit itself.  Those are three 
examples. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>And that is not all.  The federal government has announced its 
desire to invade the fields of manpower, immigration, health, 
the municipalities and family policy.  In short, a massive 
invasion into areas of provincial jurisdiction has been 
announced by the federal government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately I do not have much time left, but I did want to 
say a word about the aboriginal people.  We support the 
government's avowed intent to make some progress in this area, 
but I would caution it to take care and to avoid reinventing the 
wheel. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some years ago, after thousands of hours of testimony and after 
thousands of pages had been written on the subject and millions 
of dollars spent, the Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples, 
the Erasmus-Dussault Commission, came out with some suggestions 
and conclusions that were, on the whole, very well received by 
all stakeholders.  I am therefore asking the government to use 
the Erasmus-Dussault report as its basis, instead of trying to 
reinvent the wheel. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, the historical framework does not change. 
After the 1982 repatriation in which Quebec was betrayed, after 
the sinister agreement on the social union, which sanctions the 
federal government's invasion into areas of provincial 
jurisdiction, after the federal government's avowed desire in 
the throne speech to invade areas of provincial jurisdiction 
and, in a way, to trample over its own Constitution, Quebecers 
are faced with this choice: an increasingly unitarian state to 
be called Canada, or a new country they will construct for 
themselves, to be called Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am willing to bet that this choice will be made sooner than 
expected and that Quebecers will choose to give themselves a 
country.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier—Montcalm, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
would first like to congratulate my colleague on his accurate 
interpretation of the throne speech. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He looked at the speech from a Quebec perspective, naturally, 
and I think all Quebecers are analyzing much the same way the 
government opposite's views of provincial jurisdictions and the 
powers Canada has or is giving itself, since, as we know, Canada 
now has very considerable financial manoeuvring room. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It has accumulated billions of dollars on the backs of the 
provinces.  With the throne speech, we can see just how the 
government is going to use this money to overlap provincial 
jurisdictions and oppose often vital consensus, such as on the 
Young Offenders Act, parental leave and other matters we will be 
seeing during the course of the government's term in office. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My question, however, is much more specific, in order to enable 
the member to answer it and also further enlighten our audience, 
especially the members here, the government members opposite, so 
they may make the appropriate representations to the Prime 
Minister and the leaders of this government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I recall very clearly, when we arrived here in 1993, the 
government opposite, in an effort to stymie the sovereignist 
movement a bit, passed the famous motion—you will no doubt recall 
it—in which it said it recognized the distinct nature of Quebec 
society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My question is very simple and it is for the member who examined 
the throne speech from Quebec's perspective, from the 
perspective of everyone in Quebec.  Did the government opposite 
mention or hint at a follow-up to its motion on Quebec's distinct 
society in this speech?  Where in the throne speech do we see 
that this motion has any value? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Richard Marceau:</B> Mr. Speaker, members opposite are wondering 
why the percentage of voters has gone down significantly. To 
answer the hon. member's question I would say that perhaps it is 
because of a certain government and certain politicians who are 
not following up on their commitments and fulfilling their own 
promises. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Take, for example, the vote on the notion of distinct society. 
At the time, that motion was a pledge, a contract of sorts 
passed with Quebecers by the Liberals, whereby, in any bill or 
motion, the government would take into account the fact that 
Quebec is a distinct society. That was the promise made by the 
Liberals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately—and this did not surprise me—that promise was broken 
once again. 
Nowhere in the throne speech is there any mention of Quebec's 
specificity. Worse still, the government has decided to go 
against the consensus that exists in Quebec. And then it wonders 
why people do not bother to vote. People do not bother to vote 
because of such actions. The federal government promised to 
treat Quebec as a distinct society but then reneged on its word, 
on the motion that it passed in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore, it should come as no surprise that the voter turnout 
is dropping when promise after promise after promise has been 
broken by this government.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Diane Bourgeois (Terrebonne—Blainville, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
am pleased to rise today in the House as the new member for the 
riding of Terrebonne—Blainville. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I owe this first term of office to my constituents and I would 
be remiss if I did not take this opportunity to thank them most 
sincerely for their vote of confidence.  Ever consistent, they 
elected a sovereignist member, for whom Quebec is not a 
francophone minority in the rest of the country. Quebec is my 
country, my homeland. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My constituents are well aware that I am here to defend their 
interests and I assure them that I and my colleagues in the Bloc 
Quebecois will be following the federal government closely, 
knowing as we do how it delights in bringing in legislation that 
almost always ignores the jurisdiction of Quebec and leads to 
waste through constant duplication. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois, for whom I am the status of women critic, 
will be on the lookout and will firmly condemn any failure to 
respect the interests and values of the Quebec people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Tuesday, in the Speech from the Throne, Her Excellency the 
Governor General, the Honourable Adrienne Clarkson, mentioned 
that the government's goal, and I quote, is to “secure a higher 
quality of life for all Canadians”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a woman and as the Bloc Quebecois's status of women critic, I 
wish to draw the attention of the House to the concerns 
expressed by the thousands of women who took part in the World 
March of Women, absolutely none of which are addressed in the 
throne speech.  These women came to speak to us about poverty. 
They even suggested solutions, none of which have been acted on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my opinion, and it is one shared by national, provincial and 
community organizations, the government has not taken any real 
initiative to combat poverty.  In my opinion, much more needs to 
be done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Ten years or so ago, when one in seven children was living in 
poverty, a resolution was passed unanimously in the House to 
“seek to achieve the goal of eliminating poverty among Canadian 
children by the year 2000.” Yet in the year 2001, one child in 
five is still living in poverty in Canada, or approximately 
400,000 more than in 1989. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The researchers and specialists who have studied this agree that 
poverty is the outcome of a number of unresolved problems 
relating to living conditions, and that poverty remains an 
essentially female phenomenon.  Did the Minister of Finance, 
himself not tells us last September 27 that: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today we have come to realize that poverty is not merely a 
matter of lack of income or even of knowledge. 
It is much more fundamentally the outcome of exclusion, 
insecurity and social and human inequality. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yet, unfortunately, in his minibudget of last November he 
neglected to deal with this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This prompts me to draw to the attention of the hon. members 
certain programs which, in my opinion, ought to take the 
following facts into account.  More than 70% of part time jobs 
are held by women, and this blocks them from full access to 
employment insurance.  What is more, the legitimate desire of 
women to combine child-rearing with the equally legitimate desire 
to create their own jobs through self-employment also denies them 
access to employment insurance, at least as it now stands.  Let 
us keep in mind that those who do not contribute to employment 
insurance are not entitled to it. 
This means they are also not entitled to other compensations 
available to full time workers. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1150"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT22"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT22"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1150

<A HREF="#LINKT21"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore, women must have access to full time jobs, quality 
jobs, that are better paid and based on equity.  In Canada, 
women are entitled to economic equality. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, elements of other programs must also be 
significantly improved, including parental leave. 
Notwithstanding the extension of this leave, the program 
provides only 55% of the employee's salary over a maximum of 50 
weeks.  And so it has the opposite of the effect intended, that 
is, the parent receives only about half of his or her usual 
annual salary and this is a form of impoverishment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the context of its family policy, the Government of Quebec is 
calling for the transfer of the amounts Quebecers pay so it can 
set up its own parental leave program, which would be both a lot 
more generous and universal.  Workers without any exception 
would be entitled to it, even those who are self employed, and 
without any waiting period. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Third, proper social housing has been completely ignored.  Do we 
need to point out that the Liberal government has not invested a 
single cent since 1994 in new social housing starts.  In a 
pinch, some of the money in the employment insurance fund 
surplus could have been transferred to the provinces so they 
could attend to regional needs for renovations to existing 
housing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Poverty is also about single women and senior women, around 42% 
of whom live in poverty.  The Bloc Quebecois has long been 
calling for an increase in old age security payments for these 
women.  It is about immigrant women, native women and disabled 
women who are isolated and excluded.  In short, all these women, 
through their contribution to their community, have contributed 
or are still contributing to the economic, political and social 
life of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Poverty is also about all the men and women who care for others, 
either at home or in community organizations and who have been 
hard hit by the cuts to social programs.  It is about all these 
people who feel forgotten and abandoned by the Liberal 
government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I could give many other arguments for improving the living 
conditions of Quebecers and Canadians, all of which require that 
we first improve the living conditions of women.  I would merely 
be echoing the demands of the thousands of women who took part 
in the World March of Women. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, I wish to emphasize that, although women have 
made common cause around legitimate and shared concerns, they 
realize that those concerns do not impact on all of them 
equally.  In their respective provinces and regions, they warned 
that justice, mutual assistance and social solidarity must take 
precedence over any partisanship. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The women of Quebec, like the women in Canada's other provinces 
and territories, are entitled to expect a genuine plan of action 
to address the ever-increasing poverty afflicting families, women 
and their children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want these families, these women and their children, to know 
that I will proudly carry the flame representing their hopes and 
that I will defend, with every fibre of my being, the 
fundamental right of the full citizens of Quebec and of Canada.

<P><A NAME="LINK38"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier—Montcalm, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
first, I want to congratulate the hon. member for 
Terrebonne—Blainville on her election. The Bloc Quebecois is very 
pleased to have such an energetic woman in its ranks. My 
colleague will undoubtedly know how to protect Quebec's 
interests, as the Bloc Quebecois has been doing since 1993. Her 
constituents have made an excellent choice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to raise a more specific issue that relates to the throne 
speech. We just had an election campaign and the hon. member 
probably heard the same things I did. Women are currently the 
victims of several injustices in the federal system and this is 
what I want to discuss. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member talked about parental leave. In Quebec, such 
benefits are much more generous and universal. 
We should get the money from the federal government and have a 
single program that would be even more beneficial. But there is 
the whole issue of employment insurance, an area where women are 
often penalized. Currently, even pregnant women are adversely 
affected. If a woman is covered by the CSST's preventative 
withdrawal from work, her weeks are not calculated to determine 
her benefits. The system is not geared to deal with the 
situation of these women. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is also the fact that the family allowance program is 
obsolete. Shared custody is increasingly common and women must 
often fight to get the cheques. The system has not been 
adjusted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then there is the POWA program for those who lose their job when 
they are close to retirement. 
The federal government gives these people access to POWA, but 
when they reach age 65 and are entitled to old age benefits, the 
moneys paid during the previous year are taken into account. 
This means that these people are penalized for at least two 
years because of the income supplement. It is often women who 
are affected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am sure that the hon. member has heard about these problems. 
So has the Prime Minister. Upon reading the Speech from the 
Throne and from what she has heard, did the hon. member for 
Terrebonne—Blainville come to the conclusion that the government 
has understood the demands that have been made, including 
through the World March of Women? Has the government understood 
the demands made by women during the election campaign and in 
recent years? Has the government opposite understood the needs 
of these women? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is there hope, with the throne speech, that women's urgent needs 
will be met once and for all? Poverty affects everyone, 
particularly women. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Diane Bourgeois:</B> Mr. Speaker, as I have said, the throne 
speech really has nothing to say in this regard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I acknowledge that certain actions were taken after the March of 
Women.  In Quebec, however, women are not satisfied.  They have 
this in common with the women in the rest of Canada.  There was 
a Canadian chapter at the World March of Women, with demands by 
the women of Canada and by the women of Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Each of these two groups reached agreement on certain general 
demands that were not heeded.  Even when emissaries from the 
March met with Mr. Chrétien, they reported that they were 
offended. They were shunted aside after barely more than an hour 
with him.  They knew they had not been listened to.  The throne 
speech speaks clearly with its silence on this issue: there is 
no mention of what women want. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The women of Quebec are greatly offended by this, in part 
because they are very much aware that we in Quebec need all of 
our money to be able to function.  They are very much aware of 
the fact that Ottawa is holding back sums of money, supposedly 
for redistribution, but that redistribution is not happening. 
The money is not going to Quebec and so they do not have access 
to it.  Yet they are entitled to it and I hope that they will 
finally be listened to.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bryon Wilfert (Oak Ridges, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I will 
be splitting my time with the hon. member for 
Ancaster—Dundas—Flamborough—Aldershot.  This is an opportunity 
for me to address issues of concern to the residents of Oak 
Ridges, to my colleagues in the House and indeed to all 
Canadians.  First and foremost, I welcome back my colleagues from 
the previous parliament and welcome the new members. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Elections by their very nature can be extremely partisan 
experiences, but when we enter the Chamber we come here for a 
common purpose:  to work on behalf of all Canadians for the 
public good.  I hope that in this session of parliament we will 
become better listeners and that we will try to strive together 
to deal with issues that are of concern to Canadians at large. It 
takes time to learn the procedures, practices and protocols of 
the House.  Indeed every day is a learning experience.  I wish 
all new members a very speedy learning curve. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The responsibility placed on all of us, by our constituents in 
our individual ridings and as a whole across Canada, is very 
awesome.  Over the course of this parliament we will shape the 
very future of the country.  I certainly would not be here today 
if it were not for the confidence again placed in me by the 
residents of the riding of Oak Ridges.  I thank each and every 
one of them for their support and reassure them that I will 
dedicate my efforts to working on their behalf every day in the 
House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, I congratulate you on your appointment as Deputy 
Speaker.  There is no question about your vast experience and I 
look forward to fair rulings and orderly procedures.  I must say 
that you have already started off very well today.  I 
congratulate you. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will focus on two key areas that I believe are important not 
only to me personally but to the residents of my riding.  Today I 
will be dealing with the issues of urban centres and the 
conservation of Canada's natural spaces.  My comments will focus 
on the issue of partnerships, which again I believe the Speech 
from the Throne addresses very well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The roles that cities and towns and our local governments play 
in contributing to the quality of life of Canadians has been 
recognized in the Speech from the Throne.  They are vital roles, 
impacting on everyday life, from water and waste water services, 
garbage collection and parks and recreation services to local 
roads, bridges and public transit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our cities are tasked with providing services that are essential 
to everyday life and they do so under great jurisdictional 
regulations.  Every day our cities search for practical ways and 
means to meet the increasing demands on their financial 
resources. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, in Ontario the scope of provincial control over 
municipal governments remains largely unfettered. Municipal 
responsibilities can be altered by votes of the provincial 
legislature, although it was heartening to read that the premier 
of Ontario just indicated that he would like to see a more 
activist role by the Government of Canada in assisting with a 
number of key issues facing people who live in the cities, towns 
and villages of the province of Ontario. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my own riding the municipal governments are faced with 
particular challenges, including homelessness, affordable 
housing, public transit, air pollution, and potential development 
of large tracts of land of the Oak Ridges Moraine. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The greater Toronto area federal caucus of the Liberal Party has 
been very active in articulating these issues over the past few 
years.  I am very pleased that the Speech from the Throne 
addresses issues such as housing and the need to work with all 
orders of government in improving public transit and in dealing 
with environmental concerns, both in the greater Toronto area and 
across the country.

<A HREF="#LINKT24"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Speech from the Throne also deals with the issue of 
improving municipal water and waste water systems through the 
federal-provincial-municipal infrastructure Canada program.  I am 
very proud to say that in 1994 the government launched the first 
Canada works infrastructure program and renewed it in 1997.  The 
fact that we are going forward again indicates that there is a 
very constructive and very positive role for the federal 
government to play, not only with the provinces and territories 
but with cities across the country.  That is extremely important. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is also important to note that the federal government in 
launching the national infrastructure program has recognized 
issues such as the need to improve public transit, water systems 
and waste management systems across Canada.  It is providing 
dollars for that in conjunction with not only our provincial, 
territorial and municipal partners but also by encouraging and 
involving the private sector. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Close to home, one of the issues dealing with the environment 
which is very important to residents in my community is the issue 
of development on the Oak Ridges Moraine.  Nothing would please 
me more than to see development on that moraine curtailed to 
conserve this unique part of the Canadian landscape, the rain 
barrel of southern Ontario.  In the past I certainly have 
favoured, and I continue to favour, a commission similar to the 
Niagara Escarpment Commission to ensure that the moraine is well 
looked after. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The moraine is a 160 kilometre ridge of sand and gravel that 
runs from the Niagara escarpment to Cobourg.  It contains the 
headwaters of at least three major rivers:  the Humber, the Don 
and the Rouge. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Conserving the natural spaces of the moraine and developing a 
greenbelt around the greater Toronto area would enhance the 
quality of life for people who live in an area with a population 
of about 4.5 million.  With increasing urban pressures and 
mounting pollution problems, it could play a number of roles. It 
could be a place to go hiking or to ride a bike or a horse. It 
could be a protected area in which to preserve species at risk. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Speech from the Throne addresses the point that we will be 
reintroducing the very important species at risk legislation.  On 
the moraine there are 17 identified species at risk.  Whether 
they be plants or animals, this is very important legislation 
which I hope will be embraced by all members of the House to 
protect those habitats and to safeguard the quality of water for 
the people of southern Ontario and the many others who draw their 
drinking water from the wells. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many groups and individuals made a large and sincere effort to 
preserve this important physical feature.  I commend the nine 
conservation authorities which have united as the Conservation 
Authorities Moraine Coalition to advocate for and protect the Oak 
Ridges Moraine along its entire length. Together the authorities 
own about 5% of the moraine and will work to preserve the 
integrity of the moraine. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a role for the federal government to play and I will 
continue to urge it to do so.  Although the best approach is to 
permit local solutions to local problems and challenges, each 
order of government can and should be playing a very constructive 
role in this effort. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Issues also addressed in the Speech from the Throne that are of 
concern to my constituents include, interestingly enough, the 
issue of the agricultural sector.  Although I have a very urban 
riding I do have some farmland and very active farms.  The 
comment that we will move beyond crisis management in the farming 
sector is an important one because we are at a disadvantage when 
dealing with our American counterparts and the Europeans, 
particularly in the oilseed and grain areas.  Others have applied 
subsidies that obviously have affected the farming sector very 
negatively. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The greater Toronto area federal caucus was involved in 
promoting the family farm last March.  I was very pleased that my 
colleagues were involved in that promotion, recognizing that 
although we come from a predominantly urban area we cannot 
survive without the support of strong farms.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Antoine Dubé (Lévis-et-Chutes-de-la-Chaudière, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
I listened carefully to my colleague, who is from a riding in 
Ontario and with whom I have worked on a number of occasions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, as a Quebecer and a member of the Bloc Quebecois, I 
noted, as did other colleagues, that in the Speech from the 
Throne there is no reference or consideration given to the 
motion on a distinct society, something he in fact voted for, I 
believe. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How does he interpret this neglect of a great promise, since it 
followed the 1997 election and was considered very important at 
the time?  I would like to know what he himself thinks about a 
distinct society, because he concluded his remarks with the 
words “a strong, united Canada”.  It is all very well to have a 
united Canada, but when the party in government forgets its own 
resolution on a distinct society for Quebec, which it introduced 
into the House, I would like an explanation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know he will agree to that, and will answer my question 
directly drawing on his personal opinions. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bryon Wilfert:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague for 
his question.  I have enjoyed the opportunity of working with the 
member on a number of occasions and have always found him to be a 
very forthright and honest individual, particularly when it comes 
to his convictions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As far as the issue of distinct society is concerned, the 
government certainly has indicated that wherever they are in 
Canada residents are part of a greater good.  The government has 
worked extremely well in embracing that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The country was created in spite of geography and in spite of 
history.  We have managed to create one of the best societies in 
history.  The fact that we have been recognized continually by 
the United Nations as the best place to live, along with the fact 
that people continually want to immigrate here, would indicate 
that this is a country of opportunity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I support the view of distinct society.  Quebec is a distinct 
society, although one might argue that British Columbia or 
Newfoundland are distinct societies.  Within the cultural and 
linguistic roles that we see in Quebec, I would definitely 
concur. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has taken very constructive steps over the years. 
There is the fact that we have official bilingualism in Canada. 
Anyone in the country can obtain services in either French or English 
from the federal government. I think that is an important recognition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is the fact that Quebec participates in international 
conferences with federal representatives.  There is the fact that 
there have been more federal-provincial conferences.  As a 
student of history, Mr. Speaker, you may know that the first 
federal-provincial conference was developed by Sir Wilfrid 
Laurier.  He listened to our provincial counterparts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I intend to rededicate myself this term to working with my 
colleagues, particularly those from Quebec.  As a former 
president of the Federation of Canadian Municipalities I have had 
the great pleasure of working with many mayors and councillors in 
Quebec.  I have learned a lot about their concerns and their 
issues, which are often not much different from ours. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact is that people want a strong economy.  People want to 
be recognized for their individual worth and they want respect, 
and we are working to ensure all of those things.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Bev Desjarlais (Churchill, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, my 
colleague commented on the situation of the United States 
subsidizing its farming industry and as a result making it tough 
on farmers in Canada.  From my perspective, it leaves the 
government open to blaming the guys down south. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Will the member acknowledge that the Government of Canada can 
address that issue?   Under the trade agreement the government is 
allowed to improve the conditions and support farmers in Canada 
but it is failing to do so.  Is the government willing to allow 
family farms in Canada to just go by the wayside because it does 
not want to support them?  Is it willing to allow the U.S. to do 
it but not willing to support farms in Canada? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bryon Wilfert:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the Speech from the 
Throne talks about moving beyond crisis management.  We talked 
about partnerships.  Quebec is an excellent example of having a 
very important farm support income program.  The federal minister 
has written his counterpart in the province of Ontario but has 
yet to receive a response in terms of specific proposals because 
in the 60:40 cost sharing that we talked about, it is important 
that the province has a role to play and that it comes to the 
plate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has certainly taken appropriate steps but there 
is more that needs to be done.  It is not a question of blaming 
the Americans or the Europeans.  It is a fact of life that it is 
an unequal playing field and we should not have a situation where 
that occurs.  We will have to address it and may have to be more 
aggressive in the future.  I have and will continue to raise 
those issues with the hon. minister of agriculture.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Bryden (Ancaster—Dundas—Flamborough—Aldershot, 
Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, what an opportunity was lost yesterday. 
I came into the House and sat through the entire speech by the 
Leader of the Opposition.  I did so because I was anxious to hear 
whether there were really any new ideas that the opposition might 
be considering approaching in this new parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I say new ideas, I am talking about the kind of things that 
we hear from our constituents that we know are major problems, 
that the government perhaps has been slow or reluctant to act 
upon and that we as backbench MPs might like to press the 
government to act upon, and certainly that we might like the 
opposition to put the government's feet to the fire on important 
issues affecting the nation.  I was disappointed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I heard 54 uses of the word empowerment as a noun, an adjective 
or a participle.  It takes about a minute to say empowerment 54 
times, but other than that there was very little of substance 
that I, as someone who likes to think of myself as someone who is 
always trying to find new approaches to the issues of the day, 
could not find very much.  In fact, it was the opposite. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Leader of the Opposition stated in his speech that charities 
needed more financial support from the federal government and not 
federal invasiveness. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Leader of the Opposition is going entirely in the wrong 
direction in that statement.  He obviously little realizes that 
the charitable sector, the not for profit sector, is one of the 
most important economic sectors in the land.  It is a sector, Mr. 
Speaker, I should tell you, that runs almost completely without 
regulation, without legislation, without transparency and without 
accountability. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will give some figures.  There are 178,000 non-profit 
organizations in the country of which 78,000 are charities.  Of 
those 78,000 charities, they receive more than $90 billion in 
revenue a year.  They employ 1.3 million Canadians. 
That is 9% of the entire workforce in the country.  Yet there is 
not a regime that demands of those organizations the same kinds 
of standards of corporate governance or standards of transparency 
and accountability that we expect of the private sector. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1220"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT28"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT28"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1220

<A HREF="#LINKT27"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Leader of the Opposition really should reconsider what he 
said because what is wrong with the charitable sector is that for 
too long it has operated without government involvement.  The 
consequence, as every Canadian knows, is that we have everything 
in the charitable sector, from scam charities using telemarketers 
to charities involved in financing ethnic conflicts abroad, but 
most of all, we have very expensive charities using the taxpayer 
dollars but not using them effectively. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, half of the $90 billion is used by charities that 
are either hospitals or teaching institutions.  That is $45 
billion.  Yet we do not see the kind of transparency that we need 
to know that the money has been spent on our health care system 
in effective and efficient ways. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One might ask how I would know that.  I can give an excellent 
example of the Hamilton Health Sciences Corporation in my riding, 
which is a very large teaching hospital.  In 1996 it fired its 
chief executive officer and gave her a golden handshake of 
$818,000.  This year the Hamilton Health Sciences Corporation has 
fired another chief executive officer and the institution has 
given that chief executive officer a $500,000 golden handshake. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What the institution has now done is it has hired a new chief 
executive officer from the Vancouver Hospital & Health Services 
Centre.  That person was fired in October with a $540,000 golden 
handshake and was hired by the Hamilton Health Sciences 
Corporation for $346,000.  That is $1.8 million in golden 
handshakes alone between these two institutions.  How many beds 
will that buy?  How many nurses can be paid out of $1.8 million? 
How many research scientists would like to have that kind of 
money?  If those are only two hospitals, what is occurring across 
the country? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, I think you would find that politicians in this 
room can cite examples of where there is a lack of transparency 
and lack of proper management standards in the hospital and 
medical institutions within their own ridings. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is very typical that the boards of directors have no 
guarantee that their chief executive officers will even report 
properly to them.  The reason is that charities and non-profit 
organizations are not governed by the Canada Corporations Act. 
The only thing the Canada Corporations Act states is that 
charities and non-profit organizations will subscribe to 
guidelines of transparency and corporate governance but not to 
actual requirements, as are required of for profit corporations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This goes on.  If we extend the envelope and look at all the 
other charities and non-profit organizations out there, the 
100,000 non-profit organizations, there is no public 
accountability whatsoever.  We cannot obtain their financial 
statements or be guaranteed that their financial statements have 
the signature of government to say that they are indeed honest 
and complete.  These organizations do not have shareholders, so 
they can report what they want. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The unfortunate thing about this is that I have been on this 
problem since 1996.  I prepared a report in which I examined the 
financial information returns of some 500 charities.  I found all 
kinds of problems.  In my report I recommended the government 
bring down legislation to actually define what a charity is, to 
set standards of corporate governance and so on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I paid the price for that report.  In the 1997 election I was 
the most attacked backbench MP by third party advertising. 
The charitable institutions took out full page ads during the 
election against me.  The headlines read “Do you have no sense 
of decency, Mr. Bryden?”  They had radio jingles depicting me as 
someone who obviously wanted to destroy the charitable sector: I 
wanted to destroy the charitable sector because I wanted to see 
transparency and accountability.  Does that figure?  That is why 
I say what an opportunity was lost.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>When a backbench MP gets an initiative, he would like to think 
that he can get the support from his opposition colleagues; but, 
no, what I hear from the Leader of the Opposition is that he 
takes the side of these charitable institutions that are 
pressuring government to reform in some ways but not have 
mandatory reporting requirements. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Leader of the Opposition alluded to the Prime Minister's 
task force on the voluntary sector.  That report was released 
just last year.  It is true that as a result of the reports that 
I did there was a response both in the voluntary sector and here 
in government.  That response was to do a study of the problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not doubt that some legislative changes or some changes 
will be coming in this mandate.  I am terrified that the enormous 
lobby that is represented by the not for profit sector will 
persuade the government to set voluntary standards for 
transparency and voluntary standards for corporate governance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am hoping against hope that I can put pressure as a backbench 
MP on the government to really force this important sector of the 
economy, the $90 billion sector of the economy, to be properly 
accountable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would hope that I would have the support of the opposition 
when we move forward in that direction.  However, I do realize 
that often the initiatives of the backbench are really the 
initiatives of the backbench on one side of the House.  They can 
be guaranteed of no support from the other side.  I will press 
forward and I am sure that one way or another we will get the 
reforms that we need. 
<P><A NAME="LINK43"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Werner Schmidt (Kelowna, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I will be sharing my time with the hon. member for 
Nanaimo—Cowichan.  I congratulate you on occupying the chair.  I 
saw you operate there several years ago and you did a good job 
then.  I welcome you back to the House.  It is a pleasure to be 
back with you. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will divide my speech into three parts: first, the 
<I>Maclean's</I> annual poll about what Canadians value; second, 
leadership for Canada; and third, the foundation upon which 
leadership of the country should be based. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><I>Maclean's</I> poll is conducted annually by Allan Gregg.  This 
has been done for 25 years.  This year's poll indicates a shift. 
It used to be that economic issues like a balanced budget, paying 
down the debt and lower taxes were the primary issues bothering 
Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However that has now shifted.  Social issues have become 
primary: health care, reorienting our educational system, 
grappling with homelessness and caring for our elderly in terms 
of health, home care, pensions, and the ability to provide food, 
shelter and clothing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians say that the role of government is central to our 
ability to develop a fair society which will deal with these 
issues.  However there is no consensus on what are the solutions 
or what the specific role of government ought to be in dealing 
with these issues. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1230"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT30"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT30"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1230

<A HREF="#LINKT29"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That draws us to the inevitable conclusion that to develop 
consensus in these areas requires that government take a 
leadership role.  That leadership falls squarely on the shoulders 
of the Prime Minister and upon each member of the House, simply 
because people believe government should have a central role in 
this issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is the context in which these things have been brought 
forward?  Allan Gregg, who has conducted these polls over the 
past 25 years, concluded that there was a pattern of change in values 
over time.  He said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our minds are better, but our institutions and our hearts perhaps 
aren't.  We don't have the same kind of ethical and moral 
standards or health care system—these sorts of things are on the 
decline. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is pretty significant.  That same poll, conducted for the 
year 2000-01, found that 50% of Canadians want Canada to be 
governed according to Christian principles.  I was drawn to that 
finding by the last sentence in the Speech from the Throne which 
reads: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>May Divine Providence guide you in your deliberations. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Divine Providence, according to the Concise Oxford Dictionary, 
is God.  That sentence reminded me of the findings of the poll 
conducted by Mr. Gregg for <I>Maclean's</I> magazine. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What do Christian principles actually mean?  I suggest among 
other things that it means there is a natural law, a single 
objective universal order.  All laws, physical and moral, are 
subject to it.  Physical and moral laws are seen as different 
because moral laws are obeyed by choice while physical laws 
operate independent of choice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, stones fall and planets move in their orbits 
without choice, but men and women engage in moral behaviour by 
choice.  While a stone cannot defy the law of gravity, man has a 
choice and may rebel against moral and ethical laws.  That 
choice, however, does not do away with the reality of a single 
objective universal order covering both physical and moral laws. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To defy the law of gravity is to invite the consequences of such 
defiance.  To defy the moral law of treating others as we would 
have them treat us is to invite the consequences of that 
defiance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The inevitable consequence for people who defy the law of 
treating our neighbours as we would ourselves by engaging in such 
activities as racism, tyranny, bullying and fighting, is to 
destroy harmonious relationships between people as surely as 
walking off the roof results in physical injury to the body. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Despite the inevitable consequences of breaking moral laws, some 
people believe they are based on values that are subjective and 
relative only to the individual and therefore do not have to be 
obeyed in the same way as physical laws. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why are moral laws so important?  They are important because 
they form the basis of creating just laws, which in turn are the 
basis of a fair and just society.  They require the pursuit of 
virtue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Virtue is defined as moral excellence, uprightness and goodness. 
It consists of a clear understanding of right and wrong.  It is 
personal.  It comprises the full range of habits and dispositions 
that constitute good character among persons who are just, 
courageous, patient, kind, loyal, loving, persistent and devoted 
to duty.  A virtuous society can be created only by virtuous 
people whose individual consciences guard their behaviour and 
hold them accountable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We do not produce a virtuous society by allowing everyone to do 
what they want.  People must adhere to a common set of values. If 
they do not, chaos will result, crime will increase, authority 
will be disrespected, and the people will become incapable of 
governing themselves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At such a time conditions are ripe for tyranny.  In a tyrannical 
regime, order is created by coercion and fear.  There is no 
individual freedom in such a society.  Neither is there any 
semblance of personal responsibility for acting appropriately.

<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Virtue is essential for freedom.  People who cannot restrain 
their own baser instincts, who cannot treat one another civilly, 
are not capable of self-government.  Without virtue, a society 
can be ruled only by fear, a truth that tyrants understand all 
too well. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Michael Novak, who won the Templeton Prize for religion, agrees 
and observes that: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our people are losing virtue and that is why we are losing 
self-government.  And if we cannot govern ourselves, then we 
invite others to govern us. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This observation applies to Canada today.  The United Nations 
conventions, for example, have more influence on supreme court 
decisions about moral and ethical issues than do the laws passed 
in the House of Commons because parliament has not indicated the 
intention of those laws. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We parliamentarians should do our duty.  It is our duty to 
legislate responsibly, and in particular: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Questions of morality and social policy should not be the 
exclusive preserve of a constitutional court, but should be 
debated and acted upon by those who represent us in 
Parliament...Our political leaders deserve opprobrium for 
sloughing it off. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That was the <I>National Post</I> editorial of January 29, 2001. 
I would ask the Prime Minister if he agrees.  If so, why would he 
not give some indication of this in his speech, particularly as 
there are several references to law and order? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe he does, or did the Governor General include the last 
sentence of the Speech from the Throne without his knowledge or 
permission?  It states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>May Divine Providence guide you in your deliberations.

tremendous job in the chair as you always have done in the past 
in other venues.  I wish you the very best. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I listened with interest to the member opposite in terms of 
things moral and otherwise.  Could he comment on the morality of 
people saying that they will never be part of a pension plan, 
that they will never be part of dipping into what they consider 
to be a gold plated pension?  It strikes me that members on that

They went on to have pink pigs out on the front lawn of the House

members from the reform alliance, those holier than thou people, 
getting up and saying they want to buy back in. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, the high priestess of principle, the member for 
Edmonton North, and others who said with great principled

that and I wonder if the member could comment on that.

public statements about the wise us of tax dollars, the morality 
of spending tax money wisely, while the leader of Her Majesty's 
loyal opposition bellies up to the trough and asks Alberta 
taxpayers for $800,000 when it could have been settled long 
before that amount of money was spent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to hear from the member opposite about the morality of 
bellying up to the trough for pension money, having stated 
categorically they never would.  I want to hear why his leader 
asks Alberta taxpayers for $800,000 to pay a lawsuit he could 
have settled for about $60,000.  Where is the morality in that? 
I want to hear the hon. member's response to that.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Werner Schmidt:</B>  Madam Speaker, I actually cherish the 
member's question.  It is a very appropriate question and one I 
am honoured to answer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The morality that we have to live by is first of all individual 
and secondly one of society.  The moral law is subject to the 
natural law and does and should apply to all people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With regard to the pensions, I make abundantly clear to all 
members of the House that while I was given the opportunity to 
buy back into that pension I did not do so.  I have signed the 
declaration that says I will not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The allegation that I have done so is simply false.  It is an 
individual matter.  I stand before you, Madam Speaker, before the 
hon. member who just asked the question, and before every member, 
to state that I did not do that.  I have no intention of doing 
so.  I did not do it because of the principle that I stated 
earlier.  That is what I stand for.  That is the issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With regard to the other question which has to do with the 
Leader of the Official Opposition being given money from the 
insurance fund of the Alberta government, that is essentially a 
provincial matter.  Really the issue has to do with whether the 
intent of the fund was realized in this issue.  That becomes the 
question.  I rest my case. 
<P><A NAME="LINK45"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Steve Mahoney (Mississauga West, Lib.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, my congratulations to you.  I am delighted to see you in 
the chair.  I know that you will be fair and patient with some of 
the goings on that may or may not occur in this place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wonder if the member would answer the question.  He said that 
his morals would preclude him from buying back into a pension 
plan that he and many of his colleagues, including the hon. 
member from Edmonton North, have criticized vocally, used as an 
election platform, and told anyone who would listen how awful it 
was that the plan was accepted.  Could the hon. member comment on 
that? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Werner Schmidt:</B>  Madam Speaker, I neglected to 
congratulate you before and I do wish to do so.  You grace the 
chair.  It is very nice to see you there and it is good to have 
you back in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With regard to the question of the hon. member opposite, we do 
need to recognize that if we break ethical and moral laws the 
consequences are as clear and direct as when we break a physical 
law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have stated clearly that my position has been and remains 
that.  I wish that everyone in the House would recognize that it 
is important to be honest and have integrity in everything we do. 
That is where I stand my case. 
<P><A NAME="LINK46"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Reed Elley (Nanaimo—Cowichan, Canadian Alliance):</B> 
Madam Speaker, it is a pleasure to rise today in this new session 
of parliament.  I thank the electors of Nanaimo—Cowichan for 
returning me to the House and congratulate you, Madam Speaker, 
upon your appointment to the chair.  I know that we can look to 
you for fairness and justice in this, the people's place, the 
House of Commons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The beginning of a new legislative session gives one the 
opportunity to look back and to look ahead.  I am sure all 
members of the House are here because they have a deep concern 
for the country and the direction in which it is going.  I think 
it is clear that those in leadership set the tone for the 
country.  That includes moral and ethical directions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us look back for a moment at the election campaign and ask 
ourselves if this was an indication of the moral and ethical 
direction of the country.  I was personally saddened, as were 
many Canadians, by the vicious attack on people of faith by those 
who were opposing our party and our leader. 
I have always believed that Canada was a country that showed 
tolerance and understanding of people of all faiths.

<A HREF="#LINKT32"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, to publicly scorn and ridicule the people of Christian 
faith brought the level of debate in the campaign to a new low in 
Canadian politics.  The false accusations that members of the 
Canadian Alliance were racists and bigots showed a contempt and 
an intolerance for anyone who happened to disagree with their 
position.  If this was leadership exhibiting honesty, truth and 
integrity, then we are in serious trouble. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we think of the campaign of the year 2000 and the way it was 
conducted, may we all adopt as our motto the words of those who 
cannot and will not forget the Holocaust of World War II, “Never 
Again”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is with that concern about the past that I now look to the 
future.  May all of us in the House strive to be truly honourable 
members, admitting our failures, asking forgiveness and working 
together for the common good of this great nation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am the newly appointed chief critic for Indian affairs and 
northern development for the Canadian Alliance caucus.  Some 
would say that moving into this portfolio does little to advance 
one's own political career.  Let me tell members that it is not 
for those reasons that I have offered myself to work on behalf of 
Canadians in this area. I have a vested interest in our native 
peoples because I have three aboriginal sons and daughters. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My wife and I have known and worked with many native mothers and 
families in our role as foster parents over the past 27 years. 
When I talk about third world conditions on reserves, high 
suicide rates, substance abuse, corruption and many other 
concerns, I have witnessed these firsthand. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have talked for so long about these problems but talk is 
cheap unless it is backed up by concrete actions that allow us to 
work with our native brothers and sisters to help them achieve 
equality and opportunity in this land. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With that as a preamble, I would like to turn my attention to 
the throne speech.  Therein we find the themes of innovation and 
inclusion.  While these are good words, I would like to suggest 
that the Canadian people, both native and non-native, would 
rather hear us talk about equality and accountability. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Across Canada there are many stories of aboriginal successes. 
We have many good role models, as aboriginal athletes, actors, 
professionals, businessmen and women have excelled all across the 
country.  For instance, there are success stories in the Canadian 
film making industry where four films on aboriginal themes were 
recently accepted and viewed at the famous Sundance film festival 
in the United States. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Despite these successes, I am convinced that grassroots 
aboriginal Canadians do not feel a sense of equality and 
opportunity in this land.  Why would that be?  May I suggest that 
some of it is because of a lack of transparency and 
accountability in native government systems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my own riding of Nanaimo—Cowichan I hear of government money 
being misused and unaccounted for.  People live in mouldy homes 
and in almost third world conditions while leadership builds new 
homes and goes on trips abroad.  Money that should have been used 
for health and education goes for other purposes that do not 
increase the standard of living for band members. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What happens when ordinary aboriginals question their leadership 
and organize opposition to them?  They are ostracized, denied 
funding, threatened and sometimes physically abused to the point 
of serious injury and worse.  This simply has to stop. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us look at some specifics referred to in the throne speech. 
The government has stated that it will work with aboriginal 
people to help strengthen their entrepreneurial and business 
expertise.  I agree that economic growth and security are 
necessary for aboriginal people to achieve self-sustainability. 
Aboriginal people must be given the full authority, 
responsibility and accountability for economic developments and 
partnerships. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is very important that we come along side of aboriginal 
business in partnerships that will lead to economic stability 
among natives.  Unfortunately the track record is not good.  Just 
ask Wing Construction Limited of Thunder Bay, Ontario about its 
experience with the Sagkeeng Band and the Department of Indian 
Affairs and Northern Development.  It will tell us how difficult 
it is to develop these partnerships in an atmosphere of mutual 
trust.  The consequence for that company was the bankruptcy of a 
50 year old business.

<A HREF="#LINKT33"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This sends a wrong message to the private sector and has led 
many non-native companies simply to refuse to do business with 
native bands. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has stated that it would continue to support the 
community access program and SchoolNet, ensuring that aboriginal 
Canadians, their communities and their schools could have an on 
ramp to the information highway.  It is all well and good, and a 
noble aim, but many natives who live in homes without running 
water or toilet facilities would rather have that problem fixed 
first before they have Internet capabilities.  Let us get our 
priorities straight. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Government spending in the area of Indian affairs is in excess 
of $6 billion a year.  With all that money at their disposal, why 
in the world do most of our aboriginal people still live in third 
world conditions, with a suicide rate four times the national 
average, an unemployment rate of up to 85%, the incidence of 
diseases such as diabetes, tuberculosis, AIDS/HIV and hepatitis C 
running way above the general population, substance abuse that 
affects 80% of natives either as users or as families of users, 
and a disproportionate number of native Canadians in prison. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The policies of the government and governments before it are 
simply not working.  We in the Canadian Alliance want to work 
with aboriginal leaders and their people to find real sustainable 
solutions.  I believe those solutions revolve around the words 
equality and accountability. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I certainly commend the government for strengthening aboriginal 
governance by implementing more effective and transparent 
administrative practices.  The government has known for years 
that there are major problems with the lack of transparency in 
aboriginal governments on many reserves.  Recently the Grand 
Chief of the Assembly of First Nations, Matthew Coon Come 
encouraged his chiefs to open the books and be accountable to 
their people.  This is something that the Alliance fully supports 
and has encouraged for a long time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also support the minister's musings leading up to the throne 
speech about having Elections Canada supervise band votes.  It 
has long been advocated by the Canadian Alliance.  We are happy 
to see that the minister has adopted our policy in this regard. 
If he will commit seriously to the gradual elimination of the 
reserve system and the abolishment of the Indian Act, we will all 
rejoice and even give him a free membership in the Canadian 
Alliance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Early childhood development programs and services are important, 
but we also need to be certain they are effectively dealing with 
the problems that aboriginal people are facing in their 
communities.  For instance, did the head start program assist the 
children of Davis Inlet?  How many other Davis Inlets are there 
across the country just waiting to explode? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have experienced fetal alcohol syndrome with native children 
and know the extra care and burden that it brings.  Again it is 
nothing new.  We have known for years that it is a huge problem. 
The government and governments before it have known it also. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1992 the health committee under the Conservative government 
after serious study presented recommendations which if followed 
would have made an impact on the problem, but nothing has been 
done in seven years under either the Conservatives or the 
Liberals.  We will be keeping the government accountable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Native Canadians want to take full responsibility for their 
lives and throw off the paternalistic trappings of government 
intervention that have kept them second class citizens.  We in 
the Canadian Alliance will work with the government, indeed with 
anyone, to achieve that end. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was encouraged by the words of the minister of Indian affairs 
who said that it is time to start walking the walk.  I pledge 
myself and my party to keeping his feet to the fire. 
<P><A NAME="LINK47"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Bryden (Ancaster—Dundas—Flamborough—Aldershot, 
Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, first I congratulate the member 
opposite for taking on the post of aboriginal affairs critic. It is 
one of the most difficult portfolios on either side of the House. 
I am sure he will do a very fine and sincere job. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have one question.  In his speech the Leader of the Opposition 
mentioned that the Canadian Alliance felt there should be home 
and property ownership on reserves and that individuals should be 
able to buy and sell property. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1255"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT34"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Could the hon. member elaborate on that a little?  Would that 
include only residents on reserves?  Would it allow newcomers to 
reserves to buy property?  Would it enable property owners to 
sell to people off reserve? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Reed Elley:</B>  Madam Speaker, I appreciate the question 
from the hon. member.  I know a little about his riding having 
lived in Hamilton and attended McMaster University for seven 
years.  He has a very nice riding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian Alliance, and before it the Reform Party, has for a 
number of years included in its policies the belief that there 
should be an opportunity for private ownership on reserves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a multi-faceted question in the sense that it has to do 
with what will happen in treaty negotiations and the kind of 
self-governance models that are finally put in place at the end 
of treaty negotiations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In particular, British Columbia has 100 treaties to be 
negotiated, approximately 50 of which are now underway.  We need 
to take a good look at that whole area, especially in terms of 
urban treaties.  We are having problems in British Columbia in 
terms of the settlement of urban treaties.  I will probably have 
the first urban settlement of a treaty in my riding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the problems we see in terms of private property, whether 
it be something that comes out at the end of the day in the 
governance model, is that many municipalities do not feel they 
are being included in the treaty process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The city of Nanaimo has been asking the minister to include that 
level of government at the table, for it to have the opportunity 
to vote at all levels.  Quite frankly rage and frustration are 
building in the non-native population because they are not at the 
table. They will not be able to make decisions on it or any other 
issue because they are not present with voting privileges. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many native people have talked to me personally.  They want the 
right to own personal property.  We also have to respect native 
culture and the communal aspect of native culture. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Across the country there are differences in native culture which 
must be respected.  However as a basic principle we are in favour 
of private ownership of property.  There is some appetite for 
that in the native community.  We are quite willing to sit down 
with that community and to talk about that issue. 
<P><A NAME="LINK48"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lynn Myers (Waterloo—Wellington, Lib.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, I congratulate the hon. member opposite on his new role 
as critic.  While he was bemoaning a number of things during the 
election I was thinking of a number of things that happened, 
including the Betty Granger incident in Winnipeg, the Asian 
invasion, the fundraiser in Vancouver with the racist comments, 
Doug Christie and the rally with the white supremacists, and Jim 
Keegstra saying how proud he was to vote Canadian Alliance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That aside, would the member in his position now— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Bakopanos):</B>  The hon. member for 
Nanaimo—Cowichan on a very short answer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Reed Elley:</B>  Madam Speaker, I am very sorry that I did 
not get the last part of the hon. member's question.  Perhaps he 
would like to talk to me privately. 
<P><A NAME="LINK49"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Steve Mahoney (Mississauga West, Lib.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, as I said earlier, congratulations to you.  You said you 
are learning in the job.  Many people around here will be doing 
that over the next months and years to come.  However I am sure 
you are a quick study, having worked with you in our caucus 
structure, and will pick it up very quickly.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I thank the voters of Mississauga West for once again showing 
confidence in my leader and my party and in my representative 
ability to be here in Ottawa and represent the three communities 
of Erin Mills, Meadowvale and Streetsville.  I have had the 
privilege of representing much of the area of Mississauga West 
for about 21 out of the last 23 years, as a city councillor, an 
MPP in Ontario and, since 1997, as a member of this wonderful 
House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My wife, of course, is also a municipal councillor in the same 
community , re-elected for her fourth term on city council with 
over 92% of the vote.  My only hope is that she does not run 
against me one day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our family really has been tremendously active and involved in 
the community over the past number of years, and we really deem 
it an honour to represent those communities here in Ottawa, at 
the municipal level, or indeed at the provincial level. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am interested, though, in what seems to be the debate du jour 
or the issue of the week or the focus of the opposition when it 
comes to this place.  Opposition members talk about reform of 
parliament.  They seem to want to hang their hats on the issue 
that somehow the role of backbench members of parliament has been 
denigrated, that we have had the thumb pressed down upon us and 
that our ability to represent our constituents has been somehow 
mysteriously negated by the PMO or by the system.  I take great 
exception to that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to share with members and with anyone listening the 
success stories of some of those so-called backbenchers that I 
have experienced by being in this place since 1997. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My good friend from Mississauga South was referenced in the 
Prime Minister's speech yesterday for the books he has written 
and for the work he has done on fetal alcohol syndrome and the 
effects on children.  He and other members of the social policy 
caucus have had a tremendous impact on driving the government 
agenda toward investing in children and toward recognizing that 
children are our most important assets.  The government intends 
to support children, to eliminate poverty for children and to 
provide educational opportunities for children and for adults, as 
was said in the throne speech. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That member would tell us that he did not do it alone.  He may 
have led the issue from the point of view of the fetal alcohol 
syndrome aspect, but there were many other issues that were dealt 
with by the group.  That was really true, constructive, positive 
work, done on behalf of the entire caucus, the government and 
their constituents, in order to drive an issue that they believed 
in. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are others.  I recall that in the last parliament the 
member for Trinity—Spadina led a task force dealing with the 
banking issue and the mergers.  Many members of caucus were 
involved in countless meetings.  The caucus committee travelled 
and met with pro bank advocates and anti bank merger advocates. 
The committee put together a very thoughtful report, which in my 
view drove the agenda of the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is that ineffective?  Is that a member of parliament or a group 
of backbenchers having their rights and their powers stripped 
from them?  If some think it is, I beg to differ. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think of the member for York North and her almost heroic 
dedication to the environment.  I think of the conferences she 
has held, inviting experts from all over the world to meet in 
Room 200 in West Block.  Many of my colleagues have attended and 
have seen the tremendous effort, hard work and dedication that 
this backbench member put into fighting on environmental issues, 
not only for her constituents, not only for the people of Canada, 
but for the planet. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1305"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT36"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>On cultural issues, I think of my good friend from 
Parkdale—High Park.  In my view, her sole effort has driven the 
caucus and the government, with support from backbench members, 
to re-invest in CBC, to say that we believe CBC is the electronic 
highway that goes from sea to sea to sea.  There are communities 
that would be isolated without the good work of the CBC.  That 
backbench member, along with many of her colleagues, was indeed 
successful in doing the job of a member of parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member from Scarborough East has spent countless hours in 
meetings on the housing issue.  He managed to drive the agenda so 
that $750 million was made available for the homeless.  His 
efforts as the chair of that committee drove the government to do 
it.  Further, there is an additional investment of $850 million 
for affordable housing as we work with our partners in the 
municipal and private sectors to address the issue.  Did that 
item just appear or somehow fall from the sky?  Members know that 
is not the case. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members know that every one of the issues to which I have 
referred have been driven hard by backbench members of the 
government.  I categorically reject any of the nonsense that 
members of parliament and their relevance have been devalued in 
this place, in the broader precinct of Ottawa and in the country. 
The talent in this room, on all sides, is abundant.  Someone said 
the other day that here there are 301 A-type personalities in one 
room, so we should be so surprised that from time to time there 
are a little heckling, a little fire and a little controversy. 
What a shock.  Could we imagine this place without that? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In true fashion we all know that the distance between the Prime 
Minister and the Leader of the Opposition is the distance there 
is when a man is standing with a sword in each hand and the tips 
are barely touching.  The symbolism is that we do not kill each 
other.  We do not, although we might like to at times, run across 
the floor and start punching each other out like members do in some 
parliaments of the world.  This is the greatest example of 
parliamentary democracy— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  What about Darrel? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Steve Mahoney:</B>  There are exceptions.  I forgot about 
him, but even he was reined in, grabbed and pulled back, and he 
realized how silly and nonsensical it was to get violent and 
physical over the democratic issues we fight about.  We do not 
kill one another.  Our weapons, I would like to think, and it is 
scary to think it, are our minds.  Words are our ammunition and 
we hurl them at one another with some enthusiasm, both during 
speeches and in question period when the odd bit of heckling 
occurs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I reject the attempts by the opposition to paint government 
backbenchers as ineffective and unimportant and to denigrate 
their role.  To have the confidence of his or her constituents is 
indeed one of the most honoured positions that a man or woman can 
have, and in my case my constituency is one of the largest by 
population in the country.  They say to each and every one of us 
that they want us to fight in Ottawa for a better Canada, for a 
better Mississauga West or a better Ontario. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On CPAC last night there was a debate among three 
representatives, our whip from the Liberals, the House leader 
from the Alliance, and a member from the Bloc.  The member from 
the Bloc made the point that the House is always empty when we 
stand in our place to speak.  It is not completely empty now, but 
where do people think our colleagues are?  They are not sleeping. 
They are not shopping.  They are working.

total waste of their time.  I am sure hon. members would agree. 
It might be entertaining and fun from time to time, but it would 
not be the most productive use of the brain cells that God gave 
them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Where should they be?  They are in committee.  They are in 
meetings.  They are talking to their constituents.  They are 
meeting with staff and the bureaucracy.  They are meeting with 
each other.  They are working on the issues I spoke of, whether 
that be regarding children, the CBC, housing or the agricultural 
community. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we want to talk about the effectiveness of a backbencher, let 
us talk about the member for Toronto—Danforth, who led the 
charge by hosting an event at the Air Canada Centre.  I was there 
and it was packed.  What was it about?  It was not about the city 
of Toronto.  It was not about transfer payments.  It was not 
about tax cuts.  It was about farmers.  We had a well-known 
member from downtown Toronto leading the charge because our 
constituents in the urban communities we represent need farmers. 
They need successful farms. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is what Canada is about.  It is about people helping 
people, realizing that if we help one another we are going to 
create jobs, economic growth and benefits and build a better 
country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is another example of a backbencher who has a tremendous 
contribution to make to this place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dennis Mills:</B>  The member has my vote. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Steve Mahoney:</B>  I thank the member. 
I find it repugnant when I hear opposition members level these 
criticisms that they know are not based on honesty or truth. 
They know this full well because they all work in caucuses where 
their members are busy working at the job of being a member of 
parliament.  In my experience in this place, the job can start as 
early as 6 a.m. and wind up as late as midnight, five or six days 
a week. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not look for sympathy from anyone for the hours that I put 
in.  I have been doing this job in one form or another for 23 
years.  There was a two year period when I was out of office due 
to health and fatigue reasons—the voters were sick and tired of 
me—but I came back because I really and honestly believe that it 
is one of the most honourable professions and important callings 
that anyone in this country can aspire to.  I hope I live long 
enough to see the day when one of my sons will stand in this 
place.  I hope that happens, but if it does not, maybe one of 
their children will stand in this place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At one time I would have had the opportunity to see my own 
father sitting in the Senate.  Unfortunately he had a stroke and 
was unable to take the seat given to him by Pierre Trudeau.  It 
would have been one of the proudest moments of my life, yet we 
also unfairly denigrate the role of Senators. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lorne Nystrom:</B>  Oh, come on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Steve Mahoney:</B>  Yes, we do, especially that member. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It seems that the best way to get a yuk out of the voters is to 
run down the job we hold.  Anyone who does that does themselves a 
disservice and a dishonour and in fact does their constituents a 
disservice and a dishonour because they are not being truthful 
about what we can accomplish. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me just shift gears a little.  In addition to the reform of 
parliament, one of the issues we deal with is respect of 
parliamentarians.  This is addressed in the throne speech.  It 
occurred to me this morning that we have a new game in the House 
of Commons.  It is called “Who wants to be a millionaire?”  In 
the game, an initial question is asked.  In the television show 
it is called the fastest finger question; whoever can answer the 
question the fastest gets to be the candidate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here is the question:  who wants to get back into the pension 
plan?  Guess who won?  The member for Edmonton North had the 
fastest finger and managed to turn an $89,000 reinvestment into 
an asset that has been estimated to be worth more than $1 
million.  She indeed has become the latest millionaire.  It might 
be more. 
I have a problem with that.  If I was one of her constituents my 
question would be “Is that your final answer?”  I would want to 
know why she railed against that as being somehow unfair, as 
being overly rich.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Not only did the member for Edmonton North do it but her entire 
party platform was built once again on the denigration of MPs and 
their role and the fact that they tried to remember the pigs, as 
my hon. friend mentioned, the snorting and the buttons.  It was 
absolutely disgraceful behaviour.  We have grown to become 
accustomed to it.  They wear sombreros and drape old jalopy cars 
in Canadian flags.  They use anything it takes to get a little 
attention.  How to get on the nightly news: bring a pig into the 
House of Commons and snort a little. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the members from that caucus failed to respond to a 
question he was asked by one of my colleagues when he gave a 
speech about morality.  The member stood in his place all high 
and mighty.  This reminds me of the sixties when we had the moral 
rearmament army driving around the country trying to sell its 
vision of Christianity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I heard another member say that he was disgusted that 
Christianity was attacked.  Well I am a Christian and I was not 
attacked.  Why is that?  It is simple:  I do not put my religion 
in my platform.  I do not say to people, as the Leader of the 
Opposition does, “here is what I believe in: I do not believe in 
a woman's right to choose.  I believe in three strikes for young 
offenders then they are out and the key is thrown away.  I also 
believe in capital punishment.  If you vote for me these are the 
things I believe in but I will not implement any of them”.  What 
a remarkable campaign that would be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians are used to people standing up and saying what they 
believe in and what they will do if they vote for them.  This is 
a pretty normal, reasonable position for a politician to take. 
People want to know our beliefs so they can either believe us or 
not or so they can agree with us or not.  To say that one 
believes in all of this and yet not implement it, Canadians 
obviously do not buy that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I said we are judged by the lowest common denominator in this 
place.  Here is another example of why Canadians get upset 
at politicians.  When the Leader of the Opposition was a member 
of the Alberta legislature, he openly and publicly issued a 
slanderous letter criticizing a lawyer in the local community and 
he was sued.  He then settled for over $800,000.  Guess what he 
did?  He jumped on his horse and rode east to Ottawa claiming to 
be the new sheriff in town and left the taxpayers of Alberta 
stuck with a bill of $800,000.  That is the kind of denigration 
that causes people to lose faith in parliamentarians and in the 
system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not an empty House of Commons.  Canadians are smart enough 
to know that MPs are working hard and not just sitting here 
wasting their time.  They are working hard on behalf of taxpayers. 
They know that jumping back into a pension plan, that leaving 
taxpayers with an $800,000 bill, while at the same time claiming 
to be the great protector of the taxpayer dollar, is frankly 
not being honest with taxpayers.  It is my view that gentleman 
and that lady will pay the price.  When asked “is that your 
final answer” people will say our final answer is “you're 
cooked”.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier—Montcalm, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
I am not sure you will agree with me that the remarks just made 
by the member for Mississauga West are disappointing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The job of MP is no doubt a very honourable one.  I also know of 
a number of other very honourable jobs in Quebec and in Canada. 
There is one thing we will agree on for sure and that is that the 
speech just given was not honourable.  It was petty.  The member 
did not attack the opposition or the Bloc Quebecois in 
particular, but there are, I think, limits at some point. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I rise in the defence of all those he attacked, because he knows 
full well that what he said was just about totally false.  It is 
inadmissible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is true that nowadays politicians do not command a great deal 
of respect.  But I can understand that voters who listen to the 
debates in the House of Commons and who hear a speech like the 
one we have just heard no longer trust us.  I can understand that 
they have lost their faith in us.  I would have liked to hear the 
government member talk about the real issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope the hon. member read today's newspapers.  Many 
journalists and editorial writers said that the throne speech 
lacked content, that there was no point to it.  It is as though 
nothing has changed.  There were some major oversights in the 
speech. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would have liked to hear what the member had to say about 
employment insurance, about the people who are starving right 
now.  How does the government plan to help them, rather than 
going after someone who is entitled to a pension? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here, we work very hard for what we earn. I think that everyone, 
even people working in the public and private sectors, is 
entitled to a pension after devoting their working life to a job. 
I would have been more interested to hear what he had to say 
about employment insurance and health. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All the provinces, not just Quebec, are complaining that they do 
not have enough money, because the federal government is too 
tight-fisted.  They are demanding their fair share of transfer 
payments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What does the member have to say about that?  Absolutely 
nothing.  He is only interested in general attacks on the members 
opposite, as though the Liberals were the sole holders of the 
truth.  How very arrogant in the first week of this new 
parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Consideration must also be given to the various demands being 
made by the provinces. There is Quebec, which is unanimous in its 
opposition to the Young Offenders Act.  The throne speech would 
have us think the opposite. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like the member to reflect a little on his honourable 
position, to give an honourable speech this session and use his 
remaining time to talk about actual issues addressed in the 
throne speech, instead of launching pointless attacks on 
opposition members. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Steve Mahoney:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I have to admit I do not 
know if he was listening to the same speech. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I respect his right to disagree with my viewpoints.  I respect 
his right not to like what I am saying.  I do not frankly care 
very much but I respect it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would add that this is Thursday of the first week and we will 
be reintroducing the EI legislation.  I hope the member will 
support the changes. We will be reintroducing the young offenders 
legislation.  I hope the members of his caucus do not do what 
they did last time.  They introduced over 3,000 amendments, most 
of them changing a comma to a semicolon, which was nonsensical, 
all because they were throwing a temper tantrum. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The effect of my speech and my opinion, very strongly held I 
might add, is that when members denigrate members of parliament 
they do a disservice to all people who elect us to come here.  If 
that member does not agree, I am sure he would rather be elected 
to serve only in the national assembly in the province of Quebec. 
I would invite him to retire to his own community and do it in 
that venue if that is where he is more comfortable.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Maurice Vellacott (Saskatoon—Wanuskewin, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I find rather interesting some 
comments made in the middle of the speech by the member for 
Mississauga West.  I will attempt to find points of agreement where 
I can.  He said at a juncture that it was a waste of everybody's 
time to hear him speak in the House. 
I find that I cannot disagree with that.  Giving him the benefit 
of the doubt and concurring that may well be the case, for the 
benefit of the public and the viewing audience, could he expand 
and give examples as to why it is a waste of time to hear his 
speech in the House because many of us find ourselves in 
heartfelt agreement with his comments in that respect.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Steve Mahoney:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I knew that one would 
come back to haunt me as soon as I said it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member knows that what I am referring to is that all of 
our colleagues in all caucuses are not sitting in the House 
listening to all of us speak.  They are working in committees and 
in their offices, where hopefully they have their televisions on 
listening to us as we put forth our positions and either defend 
or attack.  This is the process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Having 301 people sitting in this place would not be the most 
constructive use of their time and would grind business in the 
House to a halt.  The job here involves a tremendous amount of 
committee work on legislative committees, a tremendous amount of 
caucus work on caucus committees, returning phone calls of 
constituents and meeting with groups who have particular issues, 
such as the agricultural group that is going around meeting with 
MPs today.  They have things that must be done.  The hon. member 
knows that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While he is correct in quoting me, he also knows that, in the 
context of my remarks, I said that it was vitally important that 
all members do their job as MPs and be respected for that.  On 
CPAC last night, the Bloc member made a big point about the fact 
that there are not very many members in their seats when speeches 
are going on.  There is a very good and justifiable reason for 
that and I believe if the taxpayers know the truth, they will 
support that reason. 
<P><A NAME="LINK52"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough, PC):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, congratulations to you for your ascent to the noble 
position of Deputy Speaker of the House.  I know you have some 
experience that you can draw upon in your previous vocation as an 
NHL referee that will serve you very well in this Chamber. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to congratulate as well the hon. member for 
Mississauga West for his remarks.  It is good to see that he has 
not lost any steam in the time that he has been out of this 
place.  He has contained much of the usual vitriol, vigour and 
adrenalin, and some healthy amount of horse feathers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member is correct.  I must attach myself to the remarks 
with respect to the work that is done by members in the Chamber. 
I congratulate him and encourage him to continue to point this 
out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, with respect to the content, I find that it is analogous 
to the throne speech itself because it was quite vacuous in terms 
of substantial comment or real substance about what his party and 
his government's vision is for the country.  There are great 
platitudes found in both documents and the speech that we have 
just borne witness to. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The difficulty that Canadians are having is seeing any sort of 
concrete plan laid out before them.  Even after an unnecessary 
election, which did result admittedly in the endorsement of the 
government, there is still no point on the horizon on which 
Canadians could focus as to where the government is going in the 
face of potentially difficult times, and there are already 
difficult times facing many Canadians.  That is where the 
disappointment lies when one examines in detail the throne 
speech. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member pointed to specific references to members of the 
House who have made a difference and that is admirable.  That is 
in fact something that again we should all be proud of 
collectively in the Chamber.  Regardless of what side of the 
House, individual members do make a difference in their 
constituencies and communities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, it appears undeniable that individual members, 
particularly those who take legislative initiatives, are bound into 
submission by the PMO and by personnel in the Prime Minister's 
Office who are very restrictive in their support of individual 
initiatives.  We do not have to look any further than a colleague 
of the hon. member, the member for Mississauga East. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  I see the clock running down on 
questions and comments and wanting to leave a little bit of time 
for the member for Mississauga West, I wonder if the member could 
please complete his remarks and then we will get on with the 
answer.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay:</B>  Mr. Speaker, would the hon. member not 
agree that there is a great deal more that can be done to enhance 
private members' business and their ability to participate more 
fully in the Chamber, more fully on legislative initiatives and 
more fully on committees?  Does the hon. member really believe 
that his government, his House leader and his Prime Minister are 
sincere when they indicate an openness and willingness to do 
this? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Steve Mahoney:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I want to be the first to 
congratulate, well in advance, the member opposite on his 
eventual ascendancy to the position of leader of what is left of 
the Progressive Conservative Party.  In all seriousness, I do 
appreciate the remarks and the question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yes, I do think there are things we can do to improve our 
opportunities at legislative committees.  It was referenced in 
the throne speech, and I think there are things we can do to 
improve the House.   However, if we approach it from the negative 
side and say that the role of backbench MPs has been denigrated 
and that we have been stripped of power and all those kinds of 
thing, I do not think that is at all helpful. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are many ways that we can improve the legislative system, 
particularly at committee, while at the same time recognizing, as 
I have tried to do, the tremendous contributions by members from 
all sides of the House in their work, whether in their caucuses 
or in committee. 
<P><A NAME="LINK53"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg—Transcona, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I am pleased to have an opportunity to comment on a few elements 
of the Speech from the Throne.  I will not be able to cover 
everything but there are a few things that are of interest to me 
and to my party that I will speak to this afternoon. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first thing of interest had to do with the mention in the 
throne speech of the government's initiative with respect to the 
free trade area of the Americas and the upcoming summit of the 
Americas in Quebec City in April 2001. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The thing we found distressing, apart from our fundamental 
disagreement with the economic theory and paradigm represented by 
not just the free trade area of the Americas but by other free 
trade agreements, like the North American Free Trade Agreement 
and the WTO, was the total lack of understanding in the throne 
speech with respect to the concerns that so many Canadians have 
about the threat that these agreements pose to democracy.  This 
was reinforced yesterday when my leader asked a question of the 
Prime Minister with respect to Quebec City and his answer was 
that he did not know there were any problems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Surely there is a problem.  The Prime Minister does not have to 
agree necessarily with all the people who are unhappy with the 
free trade area of the Americas and free trade agreements.  He 
does not have to agree with everything that people who are 
intending to go to Quebec City to protest have to say, but he 
could at least acknowledge that they exist and that they have 
some legitimate concerns. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I recall, at the time of the meetings in Seattle, President 
Clinton, even though he was obviously unhappy about the protests, 
at least tipping his hat to the fact that he thought that people 
who were concerned about trying to integrate labour and 
environmental standards and a number of other things into these 
trade agreements had a point and a legitimate concern. However, 
we never get that kind of response from the Liberal government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yesterday we could see the potential for a replay of the APEC 
thing in Vancouver shaping up already.  The Prime Minister making 
little of or showing no consideration for the situation that many 
people find themselves in when they are trying to make known 
their opposition to these agreements. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We remember the peppergate scandal and the comments the Prime 
Minister made in a very flippant way about what happened to some 
of the protesters in Vancouver.  I do not recall him having 
anything to say about Seattle, but we know that as we speak they 
are building a wall around Quebec City.  It might even be 
completed. 
They are also creating special jail cells in anticipation of 
multiple arrests of protesters who will be trying to make their 
voices heard.

<A HREF="#LINKT42"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I stand here today not in defence of violent protest but in 
defence of peaceful protest.  What happened in Seattle and a 
number of other places is that peaceful protesters have been 
arrested and incarcerated for various lengths of time.  It seems 
that this is the path that our own government is now on, and the 
Prime Minister is not even willing to acknowledge that there is a 
problem.  I think that is very unfortunate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It would have been much better for the Prime Minister to have 
said that he understood the many concerns about these free trade 
agreements.  He could have then put his own position forward and 
given his reasons for thinking the concerns were unfounded or how 
the government intends to meet those concerns, but there has been 
no acknowledgement whatsoever.  find that to be a real absence of 
leadership on the part of the Prime Minister.  One of the roles 
of leadership in the country is to acknowledge the different 
opinions.  One can take a side but one must also acknowledge the 
concerns of other people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are talking about a lot of young people who are very 
idealistic.  They have been taught since they were knee high to a 
grasshopper that they live in a democracy, that the people who 
make decisions are the people who are elected by the people of 
the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They see more and more trade agreements being signed and 
planned, as is the case with the FTA, agreements which remove 
power from various elected national and subnational legislatures, 
whether they be parliaments, the national assembly in Quebec or 
the provincial legislatures.  They see that more and more policy 
choices and options, which used to be available to elected 
persons, are no longer available.  There are certain things we 
could do with respect to magazines, to drug patent legislation, 
to water exports and to environmental regulations that we cannot 
do any more.  The list goes on and on of things that legislators 
once could do but which have now been struck down, not by some 
democratically elected world body but by a trade agreement and 
its enforcers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is it so wrong, is it something to be ridiculed that young 
people from one end of the country to the other are saying that 
they are worried.  Should we mock them for being concerned about 
democracy?  Should we not even acknowledge their concerns in a 
major political statement such as the throne speech?  That is 
what the government did when it mentioned the FTAA twice, I 
believe.  In neither paragraph did it even acknowledge that there 
were legitimate concerns that Canadians had about these 
agreements.  This is from a party that made a political career 
prior to 1993 about expressing those very same concerns when it 
was in opposition and opposed to the FTA and sort of opposed to 
NAFTA. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By that time, we were starting to get the drift of where the 
Liberals really were at.  Some of us, of course, knew even in 
1988 that the majority of them, with the exception of their 
leader, Mr. Turner, were really on side with the ideology of the 
FTA. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are very concerned about what we see here in the government. 
We see a wilful ignorance, I believe, with respect to the 
concerns that so many Canadians have about these agreements.  An 
even more worrisome thing is the growing incidence of what I 
would call and what some others have called, the criminalization 
of dissent, particularly when that dissent is expressed on the 
streets in the form of peaceful protests. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is something we ought to be very worried about if we want 
to continue to call ourselves a full and healthy democracy:  that 
we are preparing to treat these international gatherings as some 
sort of gated political communities, political compounds in which 
things happen and happen only among those who have credentials. 
People who do not have the credentials and are not part of the 
special community are kept out.  They cannot even be on the 
street outside the building.  They have to be 10 miles away. They 
cannot even be seen.  This is a very disturbing trend indeed.

</I></B></P><P align=left>It relates to other things that are being said these days about 
parliamentary reform.  I find it odd that we can spend so much 
time talking about parliamentary reform.  This is not to say that 
we will get parliamentary reform, but we have spent a lot of time 
talking about it, without addressing the fact that one of the 
things that has happened to parliament over the last several 
years, particularly since 1988, is that more and more of the 
power that parliament used to have has been abdicated and 
diverted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I say to my friends on my right in the Canadian Alliance, as I 
have said at a conference that was sponsored in Edmonton last 
year or perhaps in the fall of 1999 with respect to the 
empowering of MPs, that often we hear about the problem of the 
courts deciding things that should be properly decided in 
parliament.  I think that is a legitimate concern.  It is a 
concern that I share to some degree, not entirely, but in some 
instances. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>People who are concerned about parliamentary power being 
diverted to the courts should also be concerned about 
parliamentary power being diverted to the WTO or to the free 
trade agreements, which are reaching far deeper into the domestic 
policy making process than ever reached by the previous GATT or 
previously contemplated free trade agreements. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Free trade agreements of old had to do with the elimination of 
tariffs.  These agreements have to do with investment policy, 
regulation of investment, energy, culture and natural resources. 
They have to do with all kinds of things that previous more 
traditional free trade agreements did not touch on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will learn to our great discomfort in the next few years, 
when some people find out as some of us knew all along, that we 
will not be able to have the kind of energy policy in Canada that 
we would like to have because we have signed away our power to 
have an energy policy in Canada to the free trade agreements. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the prices of natural gas, oil and home heating fuel and 
everything else go up, people will ask why certain things cannot 
be done.  The answer is consistently that we cannot do that 
because that would be against the free trade agreement and we 
cannot do this because that would be against the free trade 
agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1988 some of us said that it might look all right at the 
moment with respect to energy, but there will come a day when we 
will want to have a certain amount of power over our own 
resources with respect to pricing, export and even distribution, 
and we will not have that power because of the things that were 
written into the agreement.  It is interesting that we should be 
in this position now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will touch on another matter of great concern to the 
constituents of all members of parliament, that is the price of 
home heating fuel and gasoline.  The phone is ringing off the 
hook in my constituency office with respect to the whole question 
of how the government's one time home heating fuel rebate is 
being administered. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I suppose we could say in some respects it was a good idea.  It 
was a recognition of the problem that people would have come the 
winter, given the high cost of home heating fuel. However, 
linking it to the GST tax credit or linking its distribution or 
its eligibility to those who receive the GST tax credit in my 
judgment is now creating a great deal of confusion and 
resentment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is something wrong when one family looks at another and 
says that it is struggling but did not get the rebate the other 
family did, or when people who do not even pay heating bills are 
getting the rebate by virtue of the fact that they qualify for 
the GST tax credit.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is something quite disturbing going on out there.  Looking 
at it from an administrative point of view it is not just in 
terms of bad policy.  My real concern is that it is actually 
turning Canadians against each other.  I do not like it when 
people phone my office saying that a person is getting something 
and they are not getting it.  It is a policy that is actually 
causing Canadians to be angry, resentful or covetous.  It is 
divisive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I urge the government to reconsider the policy and look at ways 
of either broadening the base by making it universal, or at least 
finding ways to broaden or administer it in a way that does not 
create the kinds of problems that are obvious to anyone who has 
talked to their constituency assistant lately.  I think all 
members would find themselves in that category. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It may differ in intensity from constituency to constituency and 
perhaps even from region to region, but I think it is a problem 
that all of us are experiencing.  In the next little while all of 
us will have to deal with the high cost of energy and how the 
government deals with it.  We were spared that dilemma or policy 
problem in the 1990s.  It is not something that we will be spared 
in the early part of the decade. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Going back to the free trade agreement of the Americas, we have 
indicated our intention to be in solidarity with those people who 
will be expressing their concerns about that agreement.  In the 
past we have been the only party in the House of Commons to 
oppose the multilateral agreement on investment, which 
fortunately never happened, and to other free trade agreements 
which unfortunately did happen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I heard my colleague from the Bloc saying that I was not quite 
right when I talked about the MAI, but at the risk of provoking a 
debate with members I know one member of the Bloc has been 
concerned about globalization, to the point where he felt 
motivated to depart the Chamber with his chair. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a fact that these free trade agreements are in place in 
Canada because of the support they received in Quebec from 
sovereignists.  Jacques Parizeau said over and over again, as 
recently as a week or so ago, that the free trade agreement was 
an instrument for Quebec sovereignty.  He knew, in a way that 
Conservatives did not and Liberals used to but now willingly 
close their eyes, that the free trade agreement and the policy 
package that came with it in terms of privatization and 
deregulation has so weakened Canada that it makes it more 
vulnerable to the kind of plan that Mr. Parizeau has for Canada. 
That of course is its dismembering. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It may be that the sovereignist threat in Quebec is weak at this 
point for a variety of other reasons, but there is no question 
that the free trade agreements were seen by sovereignists and 
separatists as creating a context in which it would be easier for 
Quebec to separate.  The east-west ties would be broken and more 
things would be north-south, and the argument for having to 
remain in Canada would be weaker. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am glad to see that members of the Bloc are coming along on 
the issue.  If they are concerned about sovereignty there is no 
point in arguing about the sovereignty of Quebec if at the same 
time they are uncritical about trade agreements that are reducing 
the sovereignty of all legislatures, whether they be national or 
subnational or subnational legislatures that would like to be 
national. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I welcome the evolution in the consciousness of members of the 
Bloc Quebecois.  I hope at some point they might be full partners 
with us in opposition to these trade agreements, but they will 
never be full partners with us until they are attached to the 
country the way we are.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Bryden (Ancaster—Dundas—Flamborough—Aldershot, 
Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, there are many of us on this side of the 
House who have great sympathy with the comment of the member for 
Winnipeg—Transcona when he said that the fuel rebate should not 
be tied to the GST. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I too am receiving many calls in my riding and it is a very 
divisive issue.  The finance minister would do well to listen to 
the words of the member opposite and perhaps reconsider how that 
program is administered. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to pose a question to the member opposite.  He was 
referring to the problem of security at the upcoming summit in 
Quebec and how that sends a wrong message to young people who 
want to legitimately protest.  All of us on this side agree that 
young people should protest.  There are things to protest about 
the world trade agreements, and it is good that young people 
should be involved. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I well remember about a year and a half ago that there was a 
rally for the homeless just outside the House on the lawn in 
front of the Centre Block put on by the Coalition Against 
Poverty.  The police were deployed in great numbers and cautioned 
us in the House to leave by a side door.  We went out by a side 
door, but I was interested and I went and looked at the rally. 
There were hundreds of people there, mostly burly guys in boots. 
There were no homeless people there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the leader of the Conservative Party tried to walk into 
that crowd in order to speak to them, they swore at him and 
roughed him up.  There was a similar protest with the Quebec 
Federation of Labour in which a hired protester tried to get 
through the security cordon of the Prime Minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is it not true that this type of protest gangsterism spoils it 
for the young people who do want to legitimately protest?  We 
have to put on security.  Is it not true that the people who 
should really be condemned are groups like the Coalition Against 
Poverty? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Blaikie:</B>   Mr. Speaker, I am not sure whether the 
hon. member is saying he thinks there are no burly homeless 
people or no homeless people with boots.  I was not there that 
day and do not have a great deal of knowledge of the particular 
event.  I was very careful in my remarks to talk about peaceful 
protests. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Seattle, it was not just violent protesters who were locked 
up.  The police decided they would clear whole areas of the city 
and make them uninhabitable for peaceful protesters as well as 
violent protesters.  They locked a lot of people up.  They seem 
to be planning to do the same in Quebec City.  That is my 
concern. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There were 50,000 people marching in Seattle: environmentalists, 
trade unionists and food safety activists. The event was 
supervised by the steelworkers.  There were no police visible. It 
was all done in a very civilized and peaceful way.  That kind of 
thing will not be possible in Quebec City if a wall is built 
around it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Berlin Wall has come down, but walls are going up everywhere 
so that people who want to gather together to plot the weakening 
of democracy through further free trade agreements can meet 
without having to hear the voices of protesters. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It has something to do with distance as well.  Protesters have 
to be seen and heard, not just on the other side of the Ottawa 
River.  These are legitimate concerns and one can voice them 
without being put in the position of somehow defending violence 
or inappropriate responses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of course we must have security.  There is a need for the 
protection of delegates to these meetings and the protection of 
property.  There is also a role for government in acknowledging 
these concerns and dealing with them, which the government has 
not been willing to do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know the government says it had a parliamentary subcommittee 
and it heard testimony.  That is not good enough.  We have to 
open these processes and make some of these negotiating papers 
public.

had to do was look on the Internet.  If we look on the Internet, 
we will not find the Canadian position with respect to the 
general agreement on trade and services which is of great concern 
to many Canadians in terms of what might happen to our health and 
education services. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister stood yesterday and told us to look it up on our 
website.  We did look it up and were concerned about what it says 
on the website, that Canada has no position in this regard.  We 
know Canada has a position.  We know Canadian negotiators are 
probably in rooms negotiating as we speak.  Yet for them to 
pretend they have no position while at the same time telling us 
to look it up is somewhat frustrating.

that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My question for the House leader of the New Democratic Party 
would be in regard to the main issue of his speech.  He talked 
about many things, but I am referring to the ability to debate 
democratically and protest in a peaceful way.  I agree with 
him on that.  He also mentioned free trade agreements, the FTA 
and NAFTA. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would he provide, with his insight, his solution or the NDP 
solution in terms of where to go now, the integration of those 
agreements and the economies that have developed under those 
agreements?  What is his vision or his party's vision to move 
ahead and make changes, if necessary, in that area? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Blaikie:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the answer to that 
question is obviously a lot longer than what we have time for at 
the moment.  I would say for a start that one of the things we 
should not do is move ahead with further free trade agreements 
until we have satisfied ourselves and the critics of these 
agreements that they can deal with such problems as labour 
standards, environment standards, et cetera. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There should be a moratorium on trade and investment 
liberalization until we are satisfied that we can have agreements 
which do not inhibit the power of governments to act in the 
public interest.

Mr. Speaker, if only I could plan for pension reform by

</I></B></P><P align=left>We have already had discussions and we are awaiting this

to the important position of international trade critic. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would assure the member that if there is one industry among 
those covered by the agreement that has experienced significant 
growth, it is the one in Quebec, whose share of the American

<P><A NAME="LINK110"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pierre Paquette (Joliette, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would point 
out to the minister that in the case of New Brunswick, which

</I></B></P><P align=left>But, whatever the outcome of the negotiations now under way with 
the Americans, can the Minister for International Trade 
guarantee that Quebec lumber producers will never again have to

Mr. Speaker, unlike law-abiding Canadian citizens who pay for

<P><A NAME="LINK135"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lawrence MacAulay (Solicitor General of Canada,

Mr. Speaker, he actually has not gotten the answer right because 
that is not quite the way it is.  This is classic liberalism.  It 
is like sending a child to his or her room for doing something 
bad and then paying him or her five bucks to make sure he goes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will quote another prison official, “The $1 million 
expenditure is worth it even if our department is unable to gauge 
its success”.

the one time home heating fuel rebate announced in the

</I></B></P><P align=left>I am sure by now that the minister and many of his colleagues 
are aware of the unhappiness that this is causing in the country 
by virtue of the fact that there are so many people who need this 
rebate but do not qualify because of the particular way it has 
been administered through the GST tax credit.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B>  Mr.

to find the most expeditious way possible, which was the low 
income credit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why we proceeded in that way.  Some 11 million Canadians 
who will be receiving $1.3 billion.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg—Transcona, NDP):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I understand what the minister is saying.  However, the 
fact is that a lot of people who are not paying heating bills are 
receiving it and struggling families who have high heating bills 
are not receiving it.  This is creating a lot of resentment and 
division among Canadians.  The government should consider a way 
of alleviating that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We acknowledge the good the Minister of Finance has already 
done, but we also acknowledge some of the flaws.  I think he 
should as well.  What changes is he considering to this program

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Reynolds (West Vancouver—Sunshine Coast, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, Canadians want their members of 
parliament to have a meaningful role in the Parliament of Canada. 
In the last parliament, apart from renaming ridings, only two 
private members' bills sponsored by members of the House received 
royal assent.  That is the worst track record in the last 20 
years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Will the Prime Minister commit to allowing all private members' 
bills to be votable in the House? 
<P><A NAME="LINK163"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Don Boudria (Leader of the Government in the House of 
Commons, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am not even sure the member's 
party advocates that position. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At present there are rules of the House that deal with which 
private members' bills are votable and which are not.  There is a 
committee of parliament that recommends how to make changes to 
that.  Thus far the committee has not recommended the change he 
is advocating. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since 1993 there have been no less than 97 free votes on private 
members' bills and some government bills.  That is probably 
greater than in the last 50 years combined. 
<P><A NAME="LINK164"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Reynolds (West Vancouver—Sunshine Coast, Canadian

royal assent.  That is the lowest in the last 20 years and that 
record cannot be changed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1991 the Prime Minister, then leader of the opposition, in 
his reply to the Speech from the Throne said that he wanted more 
free votes in the House of Commons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have committees.  All parties on this side of the House want 
reform to parliament.  Will the government House leader commit to 
get this committee meeting right away, sitting down and talking 
about reform of the rules of the House?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Don Boudria (Leader of the Government in the House of

unaware but the motion to constitute the committee was adopted by 
the House two days ago and it can meet anytime it likes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He referred to two private members' bills.  The number is 19.  I 
know he once served under the leadership of the right hon. leader 
of the Conservative Party.  The hon member did not know how to

country.  That program will be in place again this year as will 
the other programs.

promised over two years ago will get out.  Unfortunately there 
will be far fewer farmers by the time this happens.  If we

extent that Canada's natural competitive advantage will be lost. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will ask my question one last time.  Why will the minister not

Toronto—Danforth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will begin by thanking my constituents for the trust they have 
placed in me, in my team in Ottawa and in my team in the riding. 
I consider it a real privilege to be entrusted to bring the 
concerns and ideas of my community to the Chamber. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have referred to this room many times before as the nation's 
boardroom.  If we work constructively together in this room I 
believe we have nothing to worry about in terms of achieving a 
quality of life for Canada that will continue to rank us as the 
best country in the world in which to live. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the last election my constituents brought a couple of issues 
to my attention.  I feel I must bring them to the floor of the 
Chamber and tell my colleagues on both sides of the House that 
they will be an important preoccupation for me. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first is affordable housing.  Not a day passed during the 
last election campaign when my constituents did not urge me to 
spend time and energy to call attention to the fact that in the 
province of Ontario, and more specifically in the city of 
Toronto, there has not been a single affordable housing start in 
the last 10 years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Regrettably in 1985 we devolved housing to the provinces. 
Ontario has had a very hard time meeting the needs of families 
who in many cases do not have access to affordable housing. In a 
city as rich as Toronto over 3,000 people live in motel rooms. It 
is unbelievable in a country as rich as Canada, in a city as 
economically vibrant as Toronto, that so many families live in 
motel rooms. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On November 1, during the election campaign, the Prime Minister 
announced that anywhere between 60,000 and 80,000 affordable 
housing units would be built in Canada over the next five years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On behalf of my constituents I will bring all my energy and 
focus to bear in ensuring that the ministers responsible for that 
government commitment, not only during the election, not only in 
the red book, but in the Speech from the Throne, will implement 
it as soon as possible.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are a number of issues we have to face as a nation over 
the next while.  As members of parliament we have to blend our 
time with the needs and desires of our constituents.  We also 
have a responsibility to work on emerging issues that require 
preplanning.  We should listen in committee to expert witnesses 
from our own country and around the world.  We have to plan, lay 
out a design for the future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One issue has emerged and another is about to emerge in a 
serious way.  The first is food security.  I believe 
parliamentarians have a responsibility to put the issue of food 
security on the front burner of the legislative agenda over the 
next year or two. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The food security issue was tabled in the throne speech and has 
been touched on by the Prime Minister.  He has said quite 
categorically that it will be on the agenda in the next 72 hours 
or so during his meeting with President Bush.  He is the first 
G7 leader to meet with the new president. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important not only for Canadians to recognize this but 
that we as the House of Commons reflect and create an environment 
where food security becomes the central issue of parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not only an issue that concern rural members.  Farmers 
from every region of the country have been visiting members of 
parliament.  My seat mate, the member for Egmont from Prince 
Edward Island, is meeting with a group of potato farmers.  How 
many Canadians realize that potatoes from Prince Edward Island do 
not have access to the United States market?  It is hard to 
imagine such a state could exist today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we speak in the House we are not only speaking to each 
other.  We are also speaking to our constituents.  I would say 
humbly that many urban constituents do not fully appreciate or 
understand the challenges and difficulties that family farmers in 
Canada are going through today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As an urban member of parliament responding to the Speech from 
the Throne, I state clearly and with no hesitation that one of 
the priority issues I will be speaking about in parliament in the 
next year and a half will be a commitment to food security.  I 
hope to work with members on both sides of the House to ensure 
this issue becomes something that we as a parliament moves forward 
in a meaningful, constructive way for the benefit of all 
Canadians, both rural and urban. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is another issue that I will personally be spending a lot 
of time on in parliament.  I spoke about it in my first speech 12 
years ago when I was first elected.  We were debating in a very 
forceful way the free trade agreement which had seized every 
member of the House.

<A HREF="#LINKT62"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>At that time I was in opposition.  I had just completed my 
campaign.  One of the reasons why I believe I was elected in that 
campaign, separate and apart from the fantastic leadership of the 
Right Hon. John Turner who was then leader of the party and did a 
magnificent job on the free trade debate, was that I sent out 
signals of alarm to my constituents that the whole issue of water 
was going to be something that we as Canadians and we as 
legislators must get our heads around. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In that very first speech, I asked the prime minister of the 
day, the Right Hon. Brian Mulroney, if he would consider asking 
President Reagan for a one page protocol letter that we could 
attach to the free trade agreement, wherein President Reagan 
would state that water was in no way, shape or form part of the 
free trade agreement.  Needless to say, I did not get that 
protocol letter.  However, over the last 12 years I have 
continued to be concerned and obsessed with this whole issue of 
water. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is very important for us to realize that the first free trade 
negotiator for the United States of America was a gentleman by 
the name of Clayton Yeutter.  Clayton Yeutter completed his 
doctoral thesis on North American water management at the 
University of Nebraska in 1961.  He also, as a young assistant in 
congress, worked for Congressman Jim Wright, whose sole 
preoccupation was water and in fact wrote the book, <I>The Coming 
Water Famine</I>. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am absolutely convinced that water is going to be a central 
issue in our relationship with the United States of America in 
the near future.  I believe that we, as a parliament, in 
committee, in the House, must begin a very serious, focused 
campaign, a plan and a study of exactly where we as a nation 
stand on control of our fresh water in this country.  We must 
look at the relationship of water in regard to the provinces, the 
municipalities and on an international basis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am happy to see that the Speech from the Throne states on page 
13 that: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is Canada's responsibility, as steward of one of the world's 
largest supplies of fresh water, to protect this critical 
resource.  Safeguarding our water is a shared task among 
governments, industry and individual Canadians.  The Government 
of Canada will fulfil its direct responsibilities for water, 
including the safety of water supplies on reserves and federal 
lands. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was so delighted to see that last portion, wherein the safety 
of water supplies on reserves and federal lands is addressed.  As 
we know, under the Indian Act the minister has a special 
constitutional prerogative to make sure that quality of water and 
standards of water on reserves are ultimately under the authority 
of the Government of Canada, this Chamber. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe that if we act soon on the particular authority that 
the minister and the House have, then we can set a bar for 
quality of fresh water that could affect every province and every 
municipality.  I believe it is the duty of the House to make sure 
that we act on this file immediately.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I realize there are many other issues that have been dealt with 
in the Speech from the Throne, one in terms of the child poverty 
challenge that we as a House of Commons have to face. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are also issues related to safety in our community and 
issues related to making sure that the anti-gang laws are 
reinforced.  As one can imagine, in downtown Toronto this is a 
critical piece of legislation.  It is not an issue just in the 
province of Quebec.  Now that we have a merger of the Hell's 
Angels forces, it is very important that we seize the legislation 
and make sure that there are proper resources with which to 
enforce the legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I highlight the fact that the legislation would give the customs 
and revenue department special authority.  I have sought counsel 
on this matter from Mr. Yves Lavigne, who has spent most of his 
life working with the issue of the Hell's Angels.  He is the 
author of <I>Hell's Angels at War</I> and has given me the direct 
advice that the best way to deal with these gangs is to make sure 
that the customs and revenue department has the proper resources 
with which to do its job. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That pretty well sums up my focus, but I want to repeat to my 
colleagues that I have always considered it a privilege to work 
with everyone in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I say to my constituents that the issues of affordable housing, 
food security and making sure of Canada's trust in dealing with 
the precious resource of water will be my central focuses in the 
next year and a half.

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>RESUMPTION OF DEBATE ON ADDRESS IN REPLY 
</H4><P align=left>

</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed consideration of the motion for an address to 
Her Excellency the Governor General in reply to her speech at 
the opening of the session, and of the amendment and of the 
amendment to the amendment. 
<P><A NAME="LINK202"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Réal Ménard (Hochelaga—Maisonneuve, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
offer you my best wishes for success in your duties in the 
Chair.  We are all, of course, aware of your attachment to this 
House.  My dealings with you have always been excellent, and I 
am sure that you will have the trust of your colleagues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also wish to congratulate the new members, those beginning 
their first term of office.  Obviously, the member who just 
spoke does not fall into this category, this being his fourth or 
fifth term, if I am not mistaken. I congratulate him as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have two questions for him.  I agree with what he said about 
organized crime.  This is a major problem for large cities and 
we both represent large city ridings. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am a member from the east end of Montreal and he is a member 
from Toronto; we both know that a certain number of conditions 
must be in place for organized crime to operate.  Naturally, it 
requires communities with wealth, and communities with 
bureaucracies, especially now that there are charter rights, as 
well as communities with rapid means of communication. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Proceeds from organized crime are estimated at over $200 million. 
Given the state of organized crime, would the hon. member agree 
that we as parliamentarians should consider the possibility of 
using the notwithstanding clause to outlaw members of biker 
gangs? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The RCMP and the Criminal Intelligence Service Canada have 
estimated that there were 38 biker gangs in Canada, and I am not 
sure that we can outlaw them under existing legislation.  So I 
ask him:  Would he agree to join us in giving some thought to 
the possibility of using the notwithstanding clause to outlaw 
such groups? 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dennis Mills:</B>  Madam Speaker, I suggest to the hon. 
member that it is categorically no on the notwithstanding clause. 
However, as I mentioned, I think we need to make sure that the 
customs and revenue unit, which is an instrument of the 
government, is given the proper resources and tools.  That is how 
we will shut these people down in no time flat. 
<P><A NAME="LINK203"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rahim Jaffer (Edmonton—Strathcona, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Madam Speaker, it is always a pleasure to sit in 
the House and listen to the speeches summarizing the views of 
members about the throne speech.  I most enjoy the speeches of my 
hon. colleague from Toronto—Danforth because he usually speaks 
so passionately about issues.  I notice he did so again today, 
especially on the water issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, I remember a time when I worked quite closely with my 
hon. colleague.  He spoke very passionately at that time about 
the importance of this Chamber and the importance of 
parliamentary reform, especially because he had written such 
documents as “A Single Tax”.  Even before the official 
opposition adopted that sort of policy as its own he was the 
author of that document.  As well, he talked about changes to 
immigration along the lines of some things that I have suggested 
in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is my hon. colleague still committed to those issues as 
passionately as he was in those days when he was still a rookie 
in the House?  Is he still committed to parliamentary reform? 
Would he actually push for free votes in the House of Commons, an 
issue that was neglected in the Speech from the Throne? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dennis Mills:</B>  Madam Speaker, I feel like I am being 
presented with a gift when I get such a lob ball question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is there anyone in the House who would doubt my commitment to 
parliamentary reform?  I actually called one of the journalists 
from <I>The Hill Times</I> last night and congratulated him, 
reminding him that six months ago we put forth a pretty forceful 
article on the whole notion that the House of Commons had 
essentially degenerated to a point where we were nothing more 
than voting machines.  I think the House leader was referring to 
my comments today in his question.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we have today is a Prime Minister who has become seized 
with this issue.  It is critical because it involves every member 
of the House.  In the first press conference after the Prime 
Minister was re-elected, he was asked about the issue of 
parliamentary reform.  His answer was, and I call it the Chrétien 
challenge— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Bakopanos):</B>  I am sorry but the 
member's time has expired. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dennis Mills:</B>  Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of 
order.  I think that this issue is so critical that I would like 
the concurrence of the House for one more minute. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Bakopanos):</B>  Is it agreed? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Agreed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dennis Mills:</B>  Madam Speaker, my passion toward this 
issue has not diminished.  At that press conference the Prime 
Minister actually bragged about his experience as a young 
backbencher.  He said that when he was a young MP, if a person 
showed creativity with constructive ideas and could garner 
support in the House, then he would be there.  I am not going to 
let him forget it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the Speech from the Throne yesterday, he actually cited the 
member for Mississauga South on fetal alcohol syndrome.  That is 
something that rarely happens.  We should take his lead and give 
it a whirl. 
<P><A NAME="LINK204"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough, PC):</B> 
Madam Speaker, just briefly I want to confer to you our 
congratulations for assuming the chair.  You bring a great 
dignity to the House.  I have worked with you on committees and I 
know that you will fulfil your role more than adequately. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know that the hon. member for Toronto—Danforth, 
has spoken very passionately on this issue too— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Bakopanos):</B>  I am sorry, but I 
would like to remind the hon. member that time has elapsed for 
questions and comments.  If he would like to continue the debate 
perhaps he could go behind the curtains. 
<P><A NAME="LINK205"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Greg Thompson (New Brunswick Southwest, PC):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, I hope the member from the Toronto area remains in his 
seat so we can continue the debate.  We came into the House 
together in 1988 and share a lot of institutional memory. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before I get into my remarks, Madam Speaker, I want to 
congratulate you on your appointment to the chair.  You are a 
great addition to the House and we welcome your presence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to thank my constituents of New Brunswick Southwest as 
well for allowing me to represent them in the House of Commons. 
It is an honour and a privilege to do so.  Like all of us, our 
commitment is to do our very best on the floor of the House. 
Hopefully I can do that today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I thank my family, particularly my wife.  As all members know, 
this business is tougher on families than it is on the members. 
There is no question that without them we could not be here.  I 
want to thank my wife and my family for the sacrifices they have 
made. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In terms of throne speeches, there is nothing new in this one. 
Regardless of who forms the government, it is usually big on 
platitudes.  The reality is we will have to see how committed the 
government is to carrying out some of what it has mentioned in 
the throne speech. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the things I want to focus on is the lack of consistency 
between red book one and two, and maybe to be determined red book 
three, in terms of what was promised and what was delivered. 
There was a wide gap there.  Hopefully that gap will be closed in 
this next parliament with some co-operation from the government 
and members on this side of the House.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me remind the House that the election was called somewhat 
early.  In fact, in a seven year period we had three elections. 
There was just a little over three and a half years between the 
1997 election and the election last fall.  I do not think there 
is any question that the Prime Minister was very calculating in 
terms of when that election was called.  Giving him credit, he 
was smart enough to realize that the time was right and if he 
called an election when he did, he would most likely win it.  In 
politics that is important.  Winning is what it is all about in 
forming a government.  Obviously, the Prime Minister's call was 
the right one in terms of winning office. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As our leader mentioned last night in his remarks to the Speech 
from the Throne, it is as much our fault as the government's 
fault.  The government, to a degree without being too negative, 
did win the election by default.  In a sense, there was not a 
strong enough alternative on this side of the House on which 
Canadians were comfortable enough to put their votes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Luckily, some of us came over here and were elected to the 
House, hopefully to hold the government's feet to the fire in 
terms of what it said it will do and what we hope it will do. 
Sadly, Canadians could not see enough strength in one particular 
party to allow it to form the government.  I hate to use this 
word because it sounds a little negative, but we are stuck with 
what we have.  It is our job to try to make it a little bit 
better. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us go through some of the important issues that have been 
left simmering on the back burner by the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was just reminded by the member from Nova Scotia, Madam 
Speaker, that I am splitting my time.  I am sure I am going to 
get the big hook from the gentleman behind if I do not mention 
that.  I think he is concerned because I am starting to ramble. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A number of issues were left over from the past election and I 
want to remind us of some of those.  The immigration bill went 
through the process three times.  In three elections an 
immigration bill was promised but nothing happened.  It died on 
the order paper. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The species at risk legislation again died on the order paper 
and nothing happened.  That was introduced three times but was 
never passed by the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The same thing occurred with the youth justice bill.  It was a 
hotly debated issue in the last parliament and in the 1997 
election, but again nothing happened.  We are waiting for that 
legislation to come back.  The financial services act died on the 
order paper.  They are all very important. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is the overhaul of the Employment Insurance Act.  It died 
on the order paper just a few hours or days before the election 
was called.  It was really important for those people who 
represented parts of the country that are not as blessed with a 
strong economy.  We would like to see that introduced.  I am told 
that it is going to be tabled in the House on Friday and we will 
be debating that very quickly.  I hope the government is willing 
to listen and learn from its mistakes in how it handles people 
who are not as fortunate as we are in terms of employment 
opportunities and training.  We are looking forward to that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government also, as was mentioned by the member from 
Winnipeg today, mishandled the rapid cost of home heating fuel 
and the rebate program that it introduced.  It is doing it 
through the GST tax credit system.  Obviously there are problems 
with that, Madam Speaker, because you or I could in fact receive 
the tax credit, but the ones who are actually paying the fuel 
bill cannot.  It has created a real problem.  It is neighbour 
against neighbour, family member against family member as to who 
is getting the credit and who is not.  I do not think it was well 
thought out.  It was well intentioned but it was brought in 
hastily without a lot of thought and without a lot of debate.  It 
is one of those issues that could have come to the floor of the 
House of Commons and maybe some of the hitches and glitches could 
have been sorted out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again, we will be facing the native fishing issue in Atlantic 
Canada, which was a huge issue.  In the last couple of years 
there has been no leadership on the part of the fisheries 
minister. 
Hopefully the minister responsible for the native issues in 
Canada along with the fisheries minister can do something to 
resolve that issue.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The old gun registration issue is an example of the government 
pitting rural Canada against urban Canada.  It is an another 
issue that will rear its ugly head in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This morning I spoke to a member from Prince Edward Island, 
which is going through a crisis in what we call the potato war. 
It is an issue that has been devastating to the potato farmers in 
Prince Edward Island.  It is reminiscent of the potato virus of 
the 1990s that affected New Brunswick.  We are learning that no 
matter when a community gets into trouble or a commodity 
resurrects its ugly head in the country, we are all affected. 
None of us take any joy in that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although I represent a good part of the potato belt in New 
Brunswick, there will be negative affects on us because of that. 
It is simply because of some very strong heavy-handed practices 
by the United States in an attempt to keep our product out.  It 
will come up with any issue at any time if it fits its needs.  It 
does not want to play by rules set down by international trade or 
in trade agreements.  When it is in its best interest to put the 
wood to us it will sometimes do it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That leads me into what might be happening in regard to the 
United States.  There is no question that its economy is in 
difficulty.  That is going to spill over into Canada.  It already 
has.  How bad will it get and how will the government respond? 
Hopefully it will and some of the debates on what we can do to 
cushion the blow or make it better for Canadians will come to the 
floor of the House of Commons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our leader spoke last night of the spirit of co-operation for 
the reform of parliament.  It should not always be adversarial in 
terms of what we can do as individual members of parliament to 
work together to solve problems. 
<P><A NAME="LINK206"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Harvard (Charleswood St. James—Assiniboia, 
Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, congratulations to you on your 
appointment to the chair.  I am absolutely confident that you 
will do a great job. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a comment that arises from the hon. member's remarks 
relating to the federal government's fuel rebate program.  First, 
the government should be applauded for moving quickly to come 
forward with a program that will cost $1.4 billion.  There will 
be rebates going to over eight million Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, there is no doubt that there have been complaints 
coming in.  Perhaps the program is not as perfect as it could be. 
One of the problems we hear has to do with people who were not 
eligible for the GST rebate in the last tax year but certain 
things have happened since.  Some people are telling me that they 
have gone through a separation, or lost their job or have a 
reduced income for some reason.  However, at this point they are 
not eligible for the GST rebate, therefore they do not get the 
fuel rebate.  That is a problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I spoke to the finance minister and he is sensitive to this.  I 
know the government is looking at the issue.  Perhaps there is a 
way to make the program better.  There is pain out there and I 
just hope the government can fine tune the fuel rebate program.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Greg Thompson:</B>  Madam Speaker, I will take the 
member's comments in the generosity in which they were given.  I 
agree that the rebate was good.  What I am saying is that it 
could probably have been fine tuned.  However, we do not hesitate 
to congratulate the government on what it is doing. It is 
unfortunate that those types of difficulties are out there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wanted to make a point with regard to disparity in the country 
and the inability of some Canadians to pay their heating bills 
because of unemployment, the rising cost of fuel or living on 
fixed income.  It is interesting that the member for Fredericton, 
my neighbouring community, is talking about the federal 
government making a promise two years ago to lift the cap on 
equalization payments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said in yesterday's Saint John <I>Telegraph Journal</I> that 
the promise to lift equalization payments came after the ceiling 
on the Canada health and social transfer was removed but argued 
that generally benefits the wealthier provinces with its per 
capita formula for distributing federal funds. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said he had no trouble telling us that Atlantic MPs will be 
working on the interests of Atlantic Canadians.  That means 
acting on a political commitment that was made with the specific 
intention of bringing more equity to the country.  He said there 
were provinces in one part of Canada struggling to maintain 
health services and provinces in other parts of the country that 
were rebating its citizens with their good fortune. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not have to identify those provinces.  We all know them. 
That is the disparity that I am talking about within Canada.  The 
federal government needs to recognize that those provinces need 
help to maintain the services we have come to expect as 
Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What it boils down to is a bigger, broader sense of a generous 
Canada.  We are hoping that the finance minister will act on 
that.  I fully support the member for Fredericton in his comments 
and his commitment to see that promise fulfilled.  We are hoping 
that the finance minister will do that.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gerald Keddy (South Shore, PC):</B>  Madam Speaker, I 
congratulate you on your appointment to the chair.  It is a 
pleasure to rise in the House today to speak to the Address in Reply 
to the Speech from the Throne.  While I am on my feet I would 
like to take a moment to thank the citizens and constituents of 
the riding of South Shore for putting their trust in me to 
represent them in the Parliament of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The throne speech provides an excellent opportunity for the 
government of the day to set out its vision for Canada and the 
steps it will take to achieve its objectives.  We did not hear 
much from the government.  It does not live up to the ideal of a 
government that has a vision for the 21st century.  We heard the 
same story in its last throne speech.  There were no changes, no 
bold new ideas or initiatives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In his reply yesterday, the hon. member for Calgary Centre 
observed that the Speech from the Throne had little information 
or depth, denoting the government's lack of plans for the 
country.  There was little discussion of issues of importance 
such as the need for parliamentary reform or financial direction 
in the form of a budget.  Instead there were no new ideas put 
forth, simply regurgitation of previous issues that were not 
given the priority they deserved, or they would have been passed 
in the previous parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Calgary Centre was clear about the need for a 
reform of parliament and the need for the issue to be discussed 
and debated on the floor of the House.  If there has ever been a 
time when we needed parliamentary reform, it is obviously now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am wearing a copper pin made from the copper roofing that came 
off the roofs of the parliament buildings when they were 
replaced.

<A HREF="#LINKT69"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As every person in the House realizes, the Parliament Buildings 
burnt down in 1916 and were rebuilt in 1922.  The copper was 
actually replaced in the roof because in one instance the library 
was leaking and was contaminating some of the books in the 
basement.  What the government chose to do at that time was to 
replace the roof and keep up the infrastructure of the building. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Sadly, that has been the caretaker attitude of the government. 
It is willing to fix the roof to keep it from leaking, and it is 
willing to keep up the basic maintenance of infrastructure and 
the physical structure but it is not willing to do anything about 
the nuts and bolts of parliament.  It is also not willing to do 
anything about the job that we are elected to do here, which is 
to govern the country and bring about responsible and reasonable 
reform when it is required. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There have been changes and chances to modernize the system. The 
government recognized that by fixing the roof.  However, why is 
the government waiting before it makes similar changes to 
replace, restore and change outdated parliamentary procedures? It 
is not rocket science. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are issues that should have been discussed and debated in 
the throne speech.  I would like to raise an issue that the 
member for Toronto—Danforth raised regarding food security.  He 
spoke as an urban member and I certainly appreciate that. 
However, I would like to return a question to the member as a 
rural member of parliament and as a member of parliament who has 
some knowledge and some understanding of what goes on in rural 
Canada and the need for the government, and hopefully the member 
for Toronto—Danforth, to pursue initiatives that can help rural 
Canadians live on a par with urban Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member spoke specifically about the need for safe food and 
safe water.  I do not think there is any member of parliament who 
would disagree with that.  I wonder if the urban member of 
parliament for Toronto—Danforth really understands what he is 
talking about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we are going to have safe food and safe water then the 
government has to stop downloading the costs on to the people who 
produce safe food and who we quite often depend upon to enforce 
regulations and put safeguards in place to protect our water 
supplies.  I am talking about the farmers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For years this government has continued to download the costs of 
running the Canada Food Inspection Agency on to the people who 
produce the food instead of downloading those costs on to the 
people who consume the food.  If we want safe food and safe water 
then all Canadians have to pay for it, not just the farmers who 
grow the food.  This is a much larger issue than that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member went on to talk about the fiasco and the lack of 
action that the government has taken on the potato wart in 
P.E.I., which my hon. colleague from New Brunswick spoke about 
earlier.  We have neighbours to the south who for years have used 
phytosanitary trade restrictions as a non-tariff trade barrier. 
The government should not be surprised by that.  It has been 
several weeks since the potato wart was discovered in P.E.I. and 
there has been no plan of action from the government of the day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is totally unacceptable that seven or eight weeks after 
potato wart was found in P.E.I. that there is no plan in place. 
There is a vague promise that the government is going to do 
something.  The member for Malpeque was quoted in the paper as 
saying that the government was going to do something.  However, 
that is not good enough.  That is absolutely intolerable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is nothing in the throne speech about fisheries.  The same 
government was willing to give $500 million to integrate first 
nations into the fishery and has done nothing to ensure that 
integration takes place.  The government is willing to spend $500 
million on an issue and not follow it up.  It is never going to 
be looked at again. The book will never be opened.  It will be 
set down on a desk and the page will never be turned again.

need a long term commitment to our fisheries, to fisheries 
training and to stock replenishment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is absolutely nothing on the government's agenda except 
that it gave a bit of money, I believe it was $12 million, to the 
wild salmon in the inner Bay of Fundy.  That is not good enough. 
We have recently realized through new DNA testing that the inner 
Bay of Fundy salmon stocks are one of three distinct salmon 
species in the world.  We have the B.C. stock; the North Atlantic 
stock, which is most of Canada and Europe; and the inner Bay of 
Fundy stock, a separate species of salmon. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Gratitude and platitude from the government are not enough to 
save this endangered species.  It is not enough to save the 
fisheries or to help agriculture or to begin to understand the 
diverse issues affecting ordinary Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will return for a moment to some very important resource 
sector issues.  The Americans continually and at every 
opportunity use the phytosanitary certificate as a non-tariff 
trade barrier.  It is something we are used to.  Those of us in 
the agriculture sector and in the forestry sector are used to 
that.  We expect it, plan for it and lobby against it, but the 
government has turned a deaf ear to our cry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members of the government do not seem to understand the 
importance of our agriculture sector.  They certainly have no 
comprehension whatsoever of the importance of our forestry 
sector. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last week, the premier of Yukon, Pat Duncan, was in Ottawa 
lobbying the federal government on a serious issue that is 
arising in Alaska.  It looks as if the new president in the U.S. 
and his new interior secretary are willing to open up the 
national Arctic wildlife refuge in Alaska to oil drilling. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the U.S. builds a pipeline to that refuge, it will cut off 
the migration of the porcupine caribou herd which migrates from 
Alaska to Canada and from Canada to Alaska.  The hon. member for 
Toronto—Danforth said he was willing to discuss important issues 
of the day with the Prime Minister.  That is an issue he should 
be discussing with the Prime Minister, to get it on the agenda 
when the Prime Minister meets with the American president next 
week.

that it was better at patching up leaks than at repairing 
structures. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to know if he agrees with me that not only does the 
government not repair structures, it tries to break them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One simply has to look at the inaugural speech to see how, 
rather than dealing with issues that come under its own

existing structures and to create trouble by infringing on 
provincial jurisdictions, including those of Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to know if the hon. member agrees with me.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gerald Keddy:</B>  Madam Speaker, I thank the new member 
of parliament for his question and certainly welcome him to the

on all issues that occur between the federal government and the 
provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are many issues for which we have striven as a party and 
have raised in this place.  The government can work in 
conjunction with the provinces, whether it be the province of 
Quebec, Nova Scotia or Alberta. 
The government tends not to do that.  It tends to go off on its 
own tangents, to have its own agenda and to satisfy its own 
agenda of simply getting re-elected.  It is not anything about 
what is good for Canada or the provinces.

all it would have to do is to work in a concentrated effort to 
strike down interprovincial trade barriers which affect business 
and opportunities in Quebec and eastern Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would personally like to see as a member of parliament the

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pat Martin (Winnipeg Centre, NDP):</B>  Madam Speaker, 
the previous speaker outlined a whole host of shortcomings in the 
Speech from the Throne.  Would he agree with me that one of the 
most horrendous oversights in the Speech from the Throne is the 
complete omission or the lack of any comment whatsoever on one of 
the most pressing issues facing Canadians: the spiralling cost of 
home heating fuel, gasoline, diesel fuel and the completely 
unregulated way the free market seems to be gouging Canadian 
consumers in this regard? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have had phone calls from northern Manitoba where people are 
now paying more to heat their homes than they pay for their 
mortgage, at $900 and $1,000 a month.  In the province of Alberta 
where they completely deregulated natural gas supply, the price 
of natural gas is going up 125%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There has been absolutely no comment from the federal government 
on how it might intervene to bring some sense of order to the 
whole distribution and production of this precious natural 
resource.  Would the hon. member like to comment on that glaring 
oversight in the Speech from the Throne? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gerald Keddy:</B>  Madam Speaker, without question the 
increasing cost in energy is spiralling out of control.  Again we 
see a government that is not willing to deal with the issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member mentioned specifically home heating fuel.  I do 
not know of a single issue, beyond a year ago when the federal 
government was somehow thinking it would put money into 
professional hockey, where I received as many phone calls on a 
single government initiative.  We are looking at a government 
initiative that I think was meant to help Canadians but like most 
projects the government supports, it was not thought through. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government said it would give people who receive the GST 
rebate a $125 fuel rebate.  It did not take into consideration 
students in university who do not pay for fuel.  It did not take 
into consideration widows who live alone, have a home to heat 
and get $125 and a couple living next door who gets $250. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is just patently unfair.  It did not take into consideration 
that the cost of natural gas in Manitoba has gone up by slightly 
more than one-third.  It did not take into consideration the 
advice we gave the government prior to the election on the price 
of gas. 
<P><A NAME="LINK210"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Murray Calder (Dufferin—Peel—Wellington—Grey, 
Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I will be sharing my time with the 
member for Winnipeg South Centre.  I congratulate you on your 
appointment to the chair.  It will be a very interesting 
experience for you.  I also congratulate the new Speaker on his 
election. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will focus in on one particular part of the Speech from the 
Throne, the second paragraph on page 5.  I want to take a look at 
one part of the sentence which states that the Government of 
Canada will help Canada's agricultural sector move beyond crisis 
management. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was very happy to hear that, because that is the tool box.  I 
have been watching with interest the Prime Minister.  I heard 
about some of the tools yesterday and the fact that he will be 
aggressively going after the new President of the United States 
to get subsidies reduced.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before I go into the harm of subsidies on the family farm across 
Canada, I would like people to understand and my urban colleagues 
to listen because I believe we are talking about the issue of 
food sovereignty.  We have other sovereignty issues within 
Canada, but the most important one that we have to look at is 
food sovereignty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The average age of a farmer in Canada today is 57.  Members of 
the next generation coming up behind take a look at how hard it 
is to make a living on a farm today and ask why the heck they 
would want to do that.  They are taking a look at other 
occupations and other vocations that they will educate themselves 
for to make a living. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My first question would be who will replace us.  I am a farmer 
and I am 50.  I am just below the average, but who will replace 
us?  Who will grow the food for the next generation? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On February 6, average Canadians will have made enough 
money to pay their grocery bill for the year.  Thirty-seven days 
into the year and average Canadians have made enough money to pay 
their grocery bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is the farmer's component of that when he has paid for 
everything that he has done?  On January 9, nine days into the 
year, and he has been paid for all his work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp:</B>  That is a shame. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Murray Calder:</B>  I hear the comment from the other 
side.  I agree it is a shame.  Farmers today work hard and 
deserve a fair return for their product.  The biggest problem 
that I see right now within the farming sector is that farmers 
have become price takers.  They are told what they will get for 
their product, whether it is fair or not, and that is it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The international subsidy war we are into right now is about as 
bad as what it was in 1984.  It has to be rectified or we will 
lose a base industry called agriculture.  The agri-food industry 
is second only to our automotive industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleagues and I are working hard to make sure that does not 
happen.  There is a clock ticking right now and it is called 
spring planting.  We have 60 to 90 days.  At that point in time a 
challenge will face the government, members of the House and 
those on the Standing Committee on Agriculture and Agri-Food and 
the Standing Committee on Finance because there will have to be 
money for this.  How do we help farmers get the seeds in the 
ground when they have to be planted?  That is the question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am a member of parliament from Ontario and I am still an 
active farmer.  Each year I hold an agriculture round table at 
the OAC in Guelph.  It was held on January 17 of this year, at 
which point in time we discussed a number of initiatives.  We 
discussed research and development in Ontario and Canada. 
Twenty-four commodity groups representing the agricultural 
industry in Ontario and six members of parliament were sitting on 
a panel listening to their problems and discussing the solutions. 
We affectionately call the exercise a brick and a bouquet 
meeting. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We do not have the press there.  It is a kitchen table meeting 
with farmers sitting around the table, talking about agriculture 
and the problems facing it today.  Yes, we come up with solutions 
to different problems.  We discuss biotechnology, which is a 
major issue for our industry right now.  A number of ideas and 
concerns came forward in that regard.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We discussed the Canadian Food Inspection Agency.  We discussed 
the environment and the fact that farmers in Ontario think that 
the environmental farm plan is an excellent program that was put 
forward by CARD and should be continued instead of being 
cancelled on March 31, 2001. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If people have read the paper as to the environment issues 
facing agriculture, Walkerton for instance, the environmental 
farm plan sets a good basis for the agricultural industry to work 
from, to work on issues like nutrient management. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also discussed at great length the farm income safety nets 
and agricultural trade issues.  We looked at the fact that right 
now the federal government, through the Canada farm income 
program, is putting in $3.3 billion over the next three years. 
The provinces are also stepping up to the plate to the tune of 
$2.2 billion, making a total program expenditure over the next 
three years of $5.5 billion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We discussed programs like NISA, crop insurance, fall cash 
advances and province specific companion programs like market 
revenue.  We discussed the issue that Ontario producers will 
receive $3.3 billion in federal support for core safety net 
programs, which is an increase of 30% over the previous 
allotment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also discussed the issue of the WTO negotiations. 
We have a lot of concerns about subsidies 
because that is the biggest problem for the commodity prices 
right now.  It is causing overproduction and downward pressure on 
commodity prices. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the issues that came out loud and clear last year during 
the 11 meetings held across Ontario with the grain and oilseed 
producers was the fact that after the cost of putting their seed 
in the ground, the escalating costs of diesel fuel, the cost of 
their time and the depreciation on equipment, there was nothing 
left over.  They in fact said that they were in the red.  They 
said that they could only keep that up for a certain amount of 
time before the bank would be at the front gate and it would be 
1984 all over again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As soon as the committees are up and running, those are the 
issues that we as a government have to look at immediately.  I 
see it as a two pronged point.  I go back to crisis management. We 
have a crisis that will happen this spring and, quite frankly, we 
need solution within the next 60 days to answer that crisis.  We 
have to go a step past that to make sure that we have 
long term programs in place so we do not keep going from crisis to 
crisis within the agricultural sector. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The general consensus that came from the meeting in Guelph, 
after we had looked at all the programs that are in place, was 
that we do not need new programs.  What we need are the programs, 
which are in place right now, to respond more quickly, to require 
less paperwork and to have more money incorporated in them in 
order to address the problems that the growers are facing right 
now.  If that is done within the next 60 days or within this 
term, I believe we will be able to deal with and move beyond the 
crisis management in agriculture.

Speaker, I too add my congratulations for your ascendancy to the 
big chair.  I know that you will do a great job there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to say to the hon. member who just spoke that it was a 
delight to hear from a member of parliament on the government 
side who actually has firsthand experience on the farm.  I do not 
think that we as members of parliament should be restricted in 
giving our message to the government, depending on which party we 
are from, but it somehow gives added strength when a member from 
the government side can point out that there are some Liberals 
who actually understand the farm crisis.

</I></B></P><P align=left>In both the province and in my riding where I live there are 
many farmers who are in severe, immediate crisis.  This is even 
more so in Saskatchewan and Manitoba than it is in Alberta.  I 
have had quite a few discussions with these people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Their long term solution is that they need to get enough income 
from the sale of their products so that their operating expenses 
can be met.  That is the simple long term solution.  However, 
there are farms that are going to be taken away immediately from 
families who have had them for 100 years in some cases. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the member is probably aware, Alberta and Saskatchewan only 
became provinces in 1905.  Some of those farms in my riding were 
occupied by members of the family even before Alberta became a 
province. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I talked to farmers who imminently are going to lose their farms 
to the banks.  They are going to be out of business and out of 
the homes that they have occupied for many years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to ask the member. Notwithstanding the fact that 
there is a political component to everything we say here, just 
from a straight, practical point of view, what can be done 
immediately in order to save the distress that those families are 
going through at this time? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Murray Calder:</B>  Madam Speaker, the member for Elk 
Island asked a very good question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have been on the standing committee on agriculture since I was 
first elected in 1993.  I am very proud of the committee that I 
sit on because all parties work together.  Partisan politics 
stay at the door when we go into that committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are all farmers on the committee.  We know agriculture inside 
and out.  I believe that as soon as the committee is up and 
running we are going to put our voice to the minister as loudly 
and as immediately as we possibly can.  This is a time clock that 
is ticking. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Whether we use a spring cash advance for instance is one thing. 
However, in my mind $20,000 in an interest 
free loan is not enough.  However, it has to be more than that.  That would be 
the first thing we could do to address this immediate problem of 
getting the seeds into the ground. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Obviously the next problem is going to be in the fall when the 
products are coming off the fields.  We want to make sure there 
is something in place so farmers can break even and make some 
money.  That is what we will be working toward. 
<P><A NAME="LINK212"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pat Martin (Winnipeg Centre, NDP):</B>  Madam Speaker, 
there is sort of a cruel joke going around the area that I live 
in.  It is about the farmer who wins the 649 lottery and his 
friends ask him “What are you going to do with all that money?” 
He says “I am just going to keep farming until it is all gone”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the member pointed out, farmers are farming at a loss of as 
much as $80 per acre.  Our caucus just met with a delegation of 
farmers who were on the Hill.  They pointed out that 22,000 
farmers left the farm last year alone in the three 
prairie provinces.  That is an emergency. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Industry dumbfounded most Canadians the other 
day when he tried to justify giving Bombardier billion dollar 
loans.  He said it was an industry that we could not afford 
to lose. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My question is for the hon. member who represents that side of 
the House.  Is the prairie agricultural industry not an industry 
that we cannot afford to lose, and just as important as the 
aerospace industry in Montreal?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Anita Neville (Winnipeg South Centre, Lib.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, it is indeed with enormous pride, great humility and 
some considerable nervousness that I rise to speak for the first 
time in the Chamber. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me offer you congratulations on assuming the role as a 
Speaker.  It is indeed a pleasure to see you sitting there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also want to offer my congratulations to my colleagues, the 
mover and the seconder of the Speech from the Throne.  They set a 
high standard of eloquence and commitment to the class of 2001. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I most especially want to thank the women and men of Winnipeg 
South Centre for the profound trust they have shown in sending me 
here.  I also want to thank the many hundreds of volunteers who 
in four and a half weeks worked thousands of hour to ensure that 
a Liberal voice would continue to speak for Winnipeg South 
Centre. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would be remiss if I did not say that for me family comes 
first.  I want to publicly acknowledge the unequivocal love and 
support of my three daughters, Jessica, Elissa and Sarah for 
their support and understanding in this election campaign and 
many of the tasks that I have undertaken. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am here today because the Hon. Lloyd Axworthy has chosen to 
leave politics and follow another path.  Many of us wonder what 
political and public life in Manitoba will be like without him. 
Involved in our politics for almost 30 years, Lloyd Axworthy 
served us with great distinction, with a real pride in the 
community that sent him to serve them in the nation's capital. In 
Winnipeg and in Manitoba his landmarks are everywhere.  Those of 
us who have worked with him will be true to his legacy by keeping 
alive his vision of public service. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Winnipeg South Centre is as diverse an urban community as one 
can find in the country.  It is a riding of many faces: great 
wealth and privilege coupled with great poverty, many young 
people and students and many who have long passed three score and 
ten.  There are many communities of recent immigrants and many 
whose families have lived there for several generations.  There 
are large numbers of single parents and many young families 
throughout. There is a large urban aboriginal community in this 
riding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is, indeed, a community I know well having represented a 
large portion of it as a member of the board of trustees of the 
Winnipeg school division for the last 14 years.  Much in the 
Speech from the Throne spoke to the concerns, the issues, the 
activities and the initiatives of the residents of Winnipeg South 
Centre and I would like to focus on just a few. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members may be surprised to know that 25% of the children of 
Winnipeg South Centre live in poverty.  Although child poverty 
exists throughout the community, there is a handful of places 
where it has reached epidemic levels.  Winnipeg's inner city is 
unfortunately one of these places. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Furthermore, there are 50,000 people of aboriginal ancestry 
living in the city of Winnipeg, a large number of whom live in 
Winnipeg South Centre.  In 1971 approximately 57% of Winnipeg's 
aboriginal households lived in poverty.  In 1996 that number was 
65%.  Unfortunately it continues to grow. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Speech from the Throne spoke directly to aboriginal people, 
from reducing the incidents of fetal alcohol syndrome, 
preventable diabetes and tuberculosis to meeting the basic needs 
of health, housing, work and education.  It also spoke to 
strengthening their entrepreneurial spirit and business 
expertise. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My pledge based on my record to the people of Winnipeg South 
Centre was to ensure the safety and well-being of our children, 
to ensure them a solid future and to ensure that all children 
have the opportunity to be the best they can be.  The Speech from 
the Throne has addressed this concern on many fronts.  It refers 
to making sure that no child suffers from the debilitating 
effects of poverty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has begun to tackle this ominous task by 
committing to increase the contribution to the groundbreaking 
national child benefit and by investing $2 billion in the early 
childhood development agreement. 
We heard the Prime Minister commit yesterday to a major focus on 
an investment timetable that will allow us to make real progress 
for children.

<A HREF="#LINKT76"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is also reassuring to know that the government will take 
steps to ensure that laws protect our children from those who 
would prey on their vulnerability through Internet luring. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am proud to be part of a government that recognizes that the 
real engine of growth is the human mind.  Continued learning and 
skills training is a challenge facing all areas of the country. 
The establishment of registered individual learning accounts will 
make it easier for adult learners to finance their learning. 
Workers will be able to learn while they earn. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is also important to the residents of Winnipeg South Centre 
to know that the government is committed to give colleges, 
universities and research hospitals a greater role in feeding the 
networks and clusters that will connect the brightest researchers 
with dynamic entrepreneurship. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Very important, financial responsibility and growth is reflected 
in the Speech from the Throne.  The people of Winnipeg South 
Centre are looking to their government to continue to make Canada 
one of the most attractive places to invest and to do business. 
They look to our government to support innovation and to ensure 
that all Canadians benefit from technology. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also know that many will applaud the increased commitment to 
both the CBC and the arts and heritage community. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Much is currently happening in Winnipeg South Centre.  It is a 
vital, vibrant, dramatically diverse community where initiatives 
abound, be it the Little Red Spirit Head Start Program, the 
community justice program in West Broadway, the innovative health 
initiatives at the Riverview Health Centre, the Asper Jewish 
Community Centre or the Centro Caboto Centre. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the risk of being parochial, I want to pay particular tribute 
to the community of the Winnipeg School Division.  Not only does 
it provide quality education to young people, it has frequently, 
often without support from other jurisdictions of government, 
piloted or facilitated many programs that are finally now gaining 
recognition.  These are primarily childhood interventions and 
assessments, culturally appropriate programs and curricula for 
aboriginal children, housing registries and family resource 
centres and policies and programs of inclusion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is indeed a remarkable institution often not acknowledged for 
the groundbreaking efforts on behalf of children and their 
families.  It gives me great pleasure to do so here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In closing, I want to say how proud I am, on behalf of my 
community, to be part of a government that believes in 
opportunity with a social conscience, inclusion for the strangers 
among us, justice and opportunity for our first nations and 
public generosity for those in need. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a government with an understanding of the importance of a 
strong foundation, a sound economy with incentives and 
opportunities and growth.  It is a government that provides 
opportunity in a country where citizens will honour their 
responsibility to give something back to their communities.  It 
is a government that recognizes that sound financial management 
is indeed a means to an end.  It is a government that 
acknowledges that life is also lived in the spirit in our 
benevolence toward each other, in true respect for our 
differences and in the quality of our public service. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am pleased and proud to be here on behalf of the citizens of 
Winnipeg South Centre.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pat Martin (Winnipeg Centre, NDP):</B>  Madam Speaker, I 
would like to be the first to welcome the member for Winnipeg 
South Centre and to commend her on what was a very fine maiden 
speech.  Many of the remarks I have no problem associating myself 
with.  In fact, she almost sounded like an NDPer for a little bit 
there. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1630"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT77"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We actually share a border in that the riding of Winnipeg South 
Centre borders the riding of Winnipeg Centre.  As such, we share 
a great number of issues and, frankly, a great number of social 
problems.  The hon. member pointed out that an awful large 
percentage of children in her riding live below the poverty line. 
The figure for the riding of Winnipeg Centre is that 52% of all 
children live below the poverty line.  It is a staggering 
statistic and a huge challenge for both of us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I rise, though, to point out that the hon. member was a school 
trustee in the city of Winnipeg for many years.  School division 
no. 1 has 92 buildings and schools within its boundaries.  Surely 
one of the challenges the hon. member faced was how to heat and 
pay the operating costs of those schools. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would she not agree that the government should play some role in 
regulating the skyrocketing costs of heating fuels, not only 
for homes but for institutions, for schools, hospitals, universities 
and all those other public institutions that are being crippled 
by their operating costs and debt loads? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Should the government not have said something in the Speech from 
the Throne about what to do in regard to the heating fuel crisis 
in this harsh northern climate? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Anita Neville:</B>  Madam Speaker, earlier today we heard 
the Minister of Finance speak to the issue of the rebates to low 
income residents for rising fuel costs.  I am pleased that he is 
in a position to do that.  It has come about through sound, wise 
fiscal management and I applaud his efforts. 
<P><A NAME="LINK215"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Inky Mark (Dauphin—Swan River, Canadian Alliance):</B> 
Madam Speaker, I congratulate you on your position as Chair.  I 
am sure you will do a fine job. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As well, I congratulate the member for Winnipeg South Centre for 
her fine maiden speech. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member knows well that farmers in the prairies are 
hurting.  In the last two years the number of farmers in Manitoba 
was reduced by up to 20%.  If things do not change, we can 
probably anticipate another 16% of farmers leaving the land. Even 
the great city of Winnipeg relies on the agricultural economy, 
and I know that Ontario agriculture, which is about a $95 billion 
industry, is second only to the auto industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I notice that in the throne speech the government mentions 
agriculture, whether it is through using the words farm, farmers 
or farming, only three times.  In fact, the speech indicated that 
we need to look past crisis management and go on to value added 
innovation.  I agree with that, but unfortunately we are in a 
time of crisis and we need to manage the crisis before we can 
move on.  If we do not deal with the immediate crisis, there will 
not be many farmers left to save. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This country needs a food policy, as one of the members 
indicated earlier this afternoon.  It also needs a national 
agricultural policy.  What will the member for Winnipeg South 
Centre do now that she is part of government to ensure that the 
farmers of Manitoba stay in business and do not end up in the 
city of Winnipeg looking for work? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Anita Neville:</B>  Madam Speaker, I share the concerns 
the hon. member has about the farming community.  I share the 
concerns for the farmers and I have concerns about the impact, as 
he well knows, on the city of Winnipeg. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was pleased to hear the Prime Minister speak to it yesterday 
and to hear the comments in the throne speech on the issues 
related to the farming community, such as the commitment to work 
to provide a long term sustainable response to farming and not 
simply crisis management.  I will be pleased to work as part of 
government and with the member, being a Manitoban, to ensure that 
the farmers of Manitoba have the opportunities that they and 
their families so deserve.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Canadian Alliance):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I extend congratulations to you on your appointment.  I 
look forward to working with you in this 37th parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will start my speech by thanking the constituents in my riding 
who supported me in the recent election and sent me back for a 
third term.  I do appreciate their endorsement and I look forward 
to serving them in the years ahead. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Having just come through the election, today I would like to 
talk about democratic empowerment in particular and about changes 
that I think are missing from the throne speech and would do much 
to improve the way this place does business and much to improve 
the lot of all members of parliament, both on the government 
backbench and here on the opposition side. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Recently I was on a trip to London, England, where I witnessed 
firsthand some of the reforms that are taking place in the mother 
parliament.  It actually has a modernization committee, that is, 
a committee dedicated to modernizing parliament, the House of 
Lords, the electoral system and the role of 
backbench MPs by giving them more say and so on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was interesting for me to stand in that place where there has 
been democracy of a sort for probably 1,000 years.  There in the 
mother parliament, in the old tradition bound area of a 
Westminster style parliament, active steps are being taken to 
bring parliament and the electoral system into the 21st century. 
That aggressive, positive way of setting about its business is 
what is going to make it succeed, rather the attitude the Liberal 
government seems to employ, which is an ad hoc attitude of hoping 
it works today and maybe we can get away with doing the minimum 
possible.  What a difference. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While I was there I did find a quote of Winston Churchill's 
about Canada.  He said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That long (Canadian) frontier from the Atlantic to the Pacific 
Oceans, guarded only by neighbourly respect and honourable 
obligations, is an example to every country and a pattern for the 
future of the world. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>His speech was given at the Canada Club in London, where he 
honoured R.B. Bennett with those words. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What of that message to the world, not only on our relationships 
with our American neighbours but on democracy in general?  What 
kind of message are we sending to the world?  Although we have 
much to be proud of, there are some things that have gone awry in 
our democratic process, especially here in parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Time and again we hear from both sides of the House, and from 
the public generally, about the fact that too much power is 
concentrated in the Prime Minister's Office, the fact that too 
much discipline is exercised by parties in the House, the fact 
that there is not enough freedom for members of parliament to 
represent their constituencies and the fact that there is too 
much control by the whips of the voting process, such that there 
is not enough freedom for people to represent their constituents 
and the ideals that brought them to this place to begin with. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Prime Minister argue that he allows free votes.  I 
requested the Library of Parliament to do a research paper for me 
to find out how many free votes have been held on government 
legislation since he took office.  It is a very short paper, 
because it says there have been no free votes on government 
legislation during his entire tenure.  However, the Prime 
Minister has allowed free votes on private members' bills.  In 
fact, I believe 19 actually passed.  Unfortunately, 
17 of the 19 just changed the names of riding boundaries.  Those 
are the private members' bills.  In other words, 2 out of all 400 
bills that were debated in this place actually made it through 
the system and became law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is perhaps why we have quotes from Liberal backbenchers 
such as the one from the member from Broadview—Greenwood, who 
said that parliament does not work, that it is broken, that it is 
like a car motor that is working on two cylinders.  Or there is 
the member for Sarnia—Lambton who, when talking about 
committees, said that the party whips come into the room and make 
it a complete sham.  The member for Lac-Saint-Louis said that 
being in the backbench, they are typecast as if they are all 
stupid, that they are just supposed to be voting machines. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Others have noticed that this is happening.  In a June 16 
article in the Ottawa <I>Citizen</I>, David Law, a professor at 
the Royal Military College, when speaking at a conference, warned 
about the decay of our democratic institutions in Canada.  He 
said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>If Canada de-democratizes (then) internationally there is the 
danger that the democratization process will slip and slide, with 
disastrous repercussions for regional and global security. 
</UL>

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>He thinks that our democracy here has an impact around the world 
and I believe it does.  He went on to say that one of the factors 
eroding democracy in Canada is a broken party system with 
demoralized backbenchers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need to see change.  One of the things we did bring forward 
is a 12 point plan that I believe has been described as a 12 
point plan for those addicted to too much political power. It is 
a plan to democratize the House of Commons.  It would allow more 
free votes, again to mirror what goes on in our mother parliament 
over in England.  It would allow the Speaker to intervene if he 
or she thinks closure or time allocation is brought in either too 
frequently or too soon in the debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Part of it is about more committee power, with more power for 
members in their committees.  They would have independence and 
could get a lot of work done.  It would also allow for a true 
ethics commissioner, who would report directly to parliament. 
Again that is something that the Prime Minister promised in the 
first red book and has yet to deliver.  It would allow for a new 
standing committee to review not only privacy but access and the 
new ethics commissioner, who should be reporting to parliament 
itself. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All these things can be done.  In fact, I was a little surprised 
at the response.  I received a very good reaction to these 
proposals.  Even some of our friends in the media liked them, 
which was nice to see.  <I>The Globe and Mail</I> said they were 
sensible proposals and long overdue.  <I>The National Post</I> 
said they are 12 worthy reforms.  The Vancouver <I>Sun</I> said 
they are simple and doable.  Even the Calgary <I>Herald</I> said 
they are progressive points that would do much to bring back 
democracy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have never claimed they were perfect, but they are an 
intentional effort to modernize parliament and make it more 
effective.  It is not ad hoc.  It is not “I hope it works 
better, maybe next week, and if we put in electronic voting”, 
like the government says, “all our problems will be solved”. 
No, it is not that attitude. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need to make a conscious effort to set out to modernize this 
place and give backbench MPs on both sides of the House more 
responsibility and more of a chance to represent their 
constituents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government had a chance in the throne speech.  It promised 
something would happen.  Everybody got their hopes up.  This is 
what we got:  we are going to study electronic voting, and there 
will be more money for committee researchers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Library of Parliament committee researchers in this place do 
a wonderful job.  Everyone I have ever talked to in the House is 
amazed at the amount of work they do and at how much we depend on 
them.  They do a great job.  However, giving more money for 
committee research is not going to democratize the House.  That 
is not going to change the House or set it on its ear or send a 
message to the world that changes are coming in Canada's 
parliamentary system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a disappointment that the throne speech is so shallow and 
that so little is said about the need for democratic reform.  In 
fact, the two little things that are mentioned, the electronic 
voting and the money for committee research, will do nothing to 
address the key concerns of members in this place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will be dividing my time with the whip of the official 
opposition, but in conclusion I would invite the Prime Minister 
to build a legacy for himself.  A lot of people worry about what 
legacy they will leave.  Sometimes budget problems come in or 
worldwide recessions come in and so on.  There are the vagaries 
of the international marketplace.  However, there is an 
opportunity here to build a legacy of a renewed and reinvigorated 
Parliament of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I invite the Prime Minister to let us set out to make the 
House work better.  Let us consciously do it.  Let us do what New 
Zealand did.  It modernized not only parliament but the electoral 
system.  Let us do like Australia did, which not only set out to 
modernize parliament, which it did, but also to modernize its 
senate.  Let us set out like the United Kingdom did and say “Let 
us talk not only about how we can make this place work better but 
also about a new electoral system”.  The United Kingdom has done 
it.  Even though there is a majority government, it has 
commissioned an electoral commission to put together proposals to 
make the electoral system work better for all people in England. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I invite the Prime Minister to build a legacy, and not just on 
the steady as you go stuff.  I invite the Prime Minister to step 
out a little.  It will not hurt.  It is surprising.  I invite the 
Prime Minister to take the first steps and to first of all just 
say to himself that there is a problem.  Let us strike a 
committee. Let us invite all members from all parties to be part 
of it.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dennis Mills (Toronto—Danforth, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I congratulate you on assuming a very important role in making 
sure that the tenor of the House continues to be constructive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I say to the opposition House leader that I have absolutely no 
problem with the member quoting my article from <I>The Hill 
Times</I> of some six months ago that we as members of parliament 
should be seized with the issue of parliamentary reform.  Most 
members on the government side would appreciate the fact that 
opposition members acknowledge that within government, members 
can debate freely, openly and constructively. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I say to the House leader, who has spent a lot of time in 
England with our government House leader discussing things with 
him, that it is not constructive for the member not to 
acknowledge the fact that when the Prime Minister in his first press 
conference after the election was asked about the issue by the 
media, he issued what I term lately the Chrétien challenge.  If 
members really want to show the leadership and the insight to 
reform the House then he would be there in a second. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He cited examples of his own backbench experience when he was an 
MP.  I think he even bragged about how he changed Trans-Canada 
Airlines to Air Canada as a single member initiative. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government dealt with this issue in the Speech from the 
Throne.  The Prime Minister dealt with it in his speech yesterday 
in the House of Commons.  I think if it is to work the tone will 
have to be constructive and not just the pointing of fingers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope the House leader could try to build on the foundation a 
number of us have laid here in the last six months. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Chuck Strahl:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I have been here a little 
while now but not as long as the hon. member.  I do not think 
anything I said was particularly nasty to the government.  I did 
not call it a power hungry nasty name of any kind.  I did not get 
into any of that. I just said that there was a real desire for 
change; that there has not been enough change; and that it is 
time, as the hon. member says, to set out with a constructive 
effort to try to move it forward. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I brought forward my 12 proposals.  They did not have a single 
word that said anything nasty about the government.  The 
government House leader said that it was impossible, that the 
government could not do a single thing.  I just said to the 
government House leader that it was interesting because most of 
the proposals came from the Liberal backbench.  In other words, 
some of them came from the government House leader himself. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All I am saying is that when someone puts forward these ideas a 
signal is sent over there either from the Prime Minister or the 
government House leader.  The signal is that they will not 
entertain very much of this junk. That is what they called it. 
They called it complete nonsense.  They do not want to talk about 
it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All I suggested was that when somebody puts forward proposals to 
make the place work better, a response saying that the proposals 
are interesting is not forthcoming.  Why not refer them to a 
committee and perhaps in some way open up the committees to 
investigate some proposals?  Of course it is not like that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government House leader said that he could not do it because 
it was unconstitutional.  That is nonsense because the signal 
sent from the front bench by the Prime Minister was to show 
initiative but be careful because too much initiative is not 
good.  It is called a career limiting move in the Liberal Party.

Mr. Speaker, I do believe that the government House leader, in 
response to the initiatives brought forward by my colleague, the 
Canadian Alliance House leader, said that it was dangerous to 
talk about parliamentary reform in the open.  He said that it 
would be much better to do it behind closed doors.  I was 
wondering if my colleague might comment on that perspective 
offered by the government House leader. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Chuck Strahl:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I do think there are times 
when people sit down over a cup of coffee and kick around ideas. 
We would call those private meetings.  Sometimes those are very 
productive.  Those meetings go on around here and I do not think 
there is anything wrong with it.  However, neither is there 
anything wrong, nor should there be, in taking what are sometimes 
difficult issues and having a public discussion about them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think we would all be well served, as would the Canadian 
people, if they just knew that the government was going to set 
out in the morning to accomplish the modernization of parliament. 
If they knew that alone, if that signal came from over there, the 
rest of it would follow in line. 
<P><A NAME="LINK219"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Reynolds (West Vancouver—Sunshine Coast, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is a pleasure to participate in 
the Address in Reply to the Throne Speech which opened the 37th 
parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to acknowledge the election of our new Speaker, the 
member for Kingston and the Islands.  Myself and my party 
congratulate the Speaker and look forward to working with him and 
all members to make the 37th parliament a progressive and 
responsive sitting.  I also congratulate the Deputy Speaker and 
the other deputies who were elected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We may come here from different parts of the country, 
representing different parties and possessing distinct points of 
view, but we are all here to pass laws for the benefit of all 
Canadians in this the crucible of democracy.  I am hopeful we 
will make this parliament more responsive to Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Having said that, it behooves me to say how disappointed I was 
with the government's blueprint for this session.  While full of 
prose and poetry, the throne speech offered little in the way of 
rebuilding the trust of Canadians in this institution.  I would 
have expected, given that MPs from all parties have expressed 
interest in reforming the operations of the House, that the 
government would have responded. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Regrettably, the government paid mere lip service and offered to 
look into electronic voting in the House and improving resources 
for the parliamentary library.  As my colleagues have said, we 
all like those things.  They are good ideas to look at.  What I 
and many MPs, not just from the Canadian Alliance, are saying is 
that we expected major initiatives in parliamentary reform. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The status quo suits certain individuals who insist on vesting 
more power in the Prime Minister's office and within certain 
unelected individuals.  It surely entrenches more top down power 
and further abuse of this institution, and diminishes the 
efficacy of elected MPs on how we represent those who sent us 
here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Grassroots citizens and community groups feel that their 
opinions are not respected, nor are they heard.  The throne 
speech further entrenches that feeling and ensures further 
excessive party discipline which stifles open discussion and 
debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even the member for Toronto—Danforth has said that parliament 
does not work.  One Liberal MP who sought your chair, the member 
for Lac-Saint-Louis, said that being on the backbench, members 
are typecast as if they are all stupid.  No member of parliament 
should ever have to say that.  These two observations are not 
glowing endorsements about the way we do business in this place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Liberal backbenchers are not alone in their admonishment. During 
the election campaign the Progressive Conservative Party election 
platform said that we must reassert the power of the individual 
MP to effectively represent the interests of their constituents 
and play a meaningful role in the development of public policy. 
Their plea certainly fell on deaf ears in the Prime Minister's 
office. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The NDP member for Winnipeg—Transcona has championed 
parliamentary reform longer than most.  He said that 
strengthening the independence of the committees of the House can 
do the most to achieve a better balance between party discipline 
and the independence of individual MPs. 
I must inform the member for Winnipeg—Transcona that his voice 
also fell on deaf ears.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Finance may get the Prime Minister's attention 
when it comes to the issue of leadership of the Liberal Party, 
but the minister has very little efficacy with the Prime Minister 
on the issue of parliamentary reform. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Allow me to elaborate by quoting the Minister of Finance.  He 
said that they have been discussing the role of parliament and 
enshrining the values of the nation and its response to change, 
that it is an empty debate unless it recognizes the role of 
parliamentarians themselves, in our case, the 301 members of the 
current House of Commons.  He also said that MPs must have the 
opportunity to truly represent both their conscience and their 
constituents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is little wonder that the Prime Minister bristles at the 
notion of being replaced by the Minister of Finance.  The 
Minister of Finance at least understands those quotes we read 
from the four, five, six, ten, twenty Liberals who are frustrated 
by the way the House of Commons is working today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is tragic that at the outset of the 37th parliament, this 
watershed time, the government has missed a unique opportunity to 
implement key parliamentary reform changes and begin the new 
session in with a constructive spirit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In early January the House Leader of Her Majesty's Official 
Opposition, on behalf of the official opposition, unveiled 12 
proposals that would be a first step in rebuilding Canadians' 
trust in our parliament.  What the opposition House leader was 
attempting to do was to put flesh on the bones on the issue of 
parliamentary reform and offer the government a document to 
consider and ultimately implement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I recall the opposition House leader discussing the proposals 
with the government House leader in the afternoon on a CBC 
broadcast, <I>Politics</I>, following the unveiling of our 
proposals.  The government House leader dismissed our proposals. 
It was not a good start.  There was not a scintilla of 
receptivity by the government's guardian of the status quo in the 
House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even today in question period, we asked questions about change 
in a nice way.  The government House leader came back with a 
smart aleck answer that we must know that committees are formed. 
Of course we know that committees are formed, we are part of 
doing that, but we also know that when we go to that committee, 
unless the Prime Minister and the government House leader advise 
their members that the committee should look at parliamentary 
reform and look at it in a free and open manner, it will never 
happen.  I think the Canadian public is tired of these smart 
aleck answers, the know it all from the other side. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government House leader is the one who made half the 
proposals that are in the proposal and yet he says that they 
cannot not work, that we would have to change the constitution. 
We all know how different it is when in opposition than when in 
government.  Some of us on this side have been in government.  We 
have been part of making change and we know that it works. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know that the mother of parliaments in Great Britain has made 
changes.  The majority of its votes are free votes.  The whips 
only come on when it affects the government's ability to govern. 
That is the way it should be in this House so that members can 
speak freely, not only in the House but in committees. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me identify some of the proposals we are talking about.  Our 
first proposal called for an official commitment by the House to 
conduct free votes.  An official commitment by the House to 
conduct votes freely without jeopardizing our parliamentary 
traditions would strengthen members' resolve to represent the 
wishes of their constituents.  This happens in Great Britain and 
in Australia but does not happening here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada should be one of the most progressive countries.  I agree 
with our House leader when he talks about the Prime Minister's 
legacy.  We would all support him in building that legacy.  We 
know that the opposition is a minority compared to the 
government, which has the majority of seats.  It can kill free 
votes at any time, but why not sit down in a committee? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I heard the member for Vancouver Quadra on a local radio show 
after he was elected. I appreciated what he said about coming 
here and speaking his mind, voting the way he should for his 
constituents in British Columbia.  I have been around politics 
for a long time now and it does not quite happen that way, but it 
should. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope the member for Vancouver Quadra will have some influence 
on the members of his party who are a very frustrated lot.  Not 
all of them because some are in cabinet and they have it pretty 
nice.  The parliamentary secretaries make a little more money, so 
they are happy.  However, there are a lot of people on the back 
bench who would like to participate a little bit more, knowing 
they could go to committee and speak freely, vote freely and 
bring messages back to the House.  That is happening in other 
parliamentary democracies in the world. 
The greatest system in the world is parliamentary democracy but 
we have taken too long.  The McGrath report, a colleague of mine 
back to the seventies, came in long ago and some very positive 
changes were made.

Speaker was a change made in the House which was very positive. 
Needless to say, I think we might have had a different Speaker 
today if it had not been a totally free vote.  It allows members 
to have a little power in the House and we all need a little more 
of that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope in the next few years I have left in parliament we can 
make those changes.  I would love to be able to say to my seven 
children and eight grandchildren, who are coming quicker than I 
can count these days, that I was part of making these modern 
changes in Canada so we could have a better country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We all know democracy is there.  We had a great election and the 
Liberals won.  That is wonderful.  Let us take this year to sit 
down in committee and try to make some positive changes for the 
good of Canada.  If it is for the good of Canada, it will be good 
for the Liberals, the Canadian Alliance, the Bloc, the NDP and 
the Tories.  If it is good for all of us, it is good for 
Canadians.  We are as Canadian as anyone here, although the guys 
behind me are not too good at that.  We are out to do what is 
good for Canada and we think more freedom and more access is good 
for Canadians.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mac Harb (Ottawa Centre, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I too 
want to congratulate you and congratulate the other speakers on 
their elections. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am a bit intrigued by the Alliance's presentation today on 
parliamentary reform.  I have been here since 1988.  When the 
Alliance members came in during the last election, as well as the 
one before, they talked about the whole notion of MPs being able 
to vote independently. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we were to look at the records over the past two terms, we 
would find that the Alliance voted in blocks far more often than 
any of the other political parties in the House.  In fact, the 
whip used to stand up and say that it was the position of the 
Alliance unless otherwise instructed by their constituents.  For 
approximately six years the Alliance has continually voted in 
blocks.  If he wants to talk about reform, he should start 
complaining to his own leader to allow them to vote 
independently. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We do not have a problem on this side of the House for a lot of 
reasons.  First, we have a lot more free votes on this side of 
the House than ever before in the history of parliament.  We have 
a party system.  We have to become accustomed to the fact that 
when we get elected as members of parliament, we do not get 
elected as individuals.  We get elected as members of a specific 
political party with a specific agenda and platform. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To that extent, it is our individual responsibility to vote with 
the party and to vote with the government on all legislation that 
pertains to government and party platforms that were run on 
during an election.  The Prime Minister and the government have 
given us more freedom and more rights to vote independently on 
government bills than any other government in the history of 
Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When is the hon. member going to stand up to his leader and tell 
him and his establishment to allow the Canadian Alliance members 
to vote according to their conscience or to their constituents. 
When is he going to do that? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Reynolds:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the member says he has 
been around since 1988, I have been around since 1972, and that 
members in the House have voted independently many more times 
than any other party.  My colleague from North Vancouver voted 
for the gun bill even though he was opposed to it because that is 
what his constituents wanted him to do.  The whip of this party 
has done that.  That has happened in this party continually.  My 
party believes it when it says it has free votes on this side of 
the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not attacking anybody's integrity.  I am talking about a 
change.  If the hon. member wants to get up and make this 
partisan argument, I will read some quotes from his own members. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member from Lac-Saint-Louis, another veteran of both 
provincial and federal politics like myself, said that the system 
needs to be blown to smithereens.  I agree with him, as do many 
of my colleagues.  I spoke to him privately.  I think there are 
at least 50 potential Guy Fawkeses in the Liberal caucus alone 
who would be glad to light the fuse.  That was said by the member 
for Toronto—Danforth. 
If you want to do this, I will do you one for one anytime in the 
House.  I will also do you one for one on the rules of 
parliament.  I was a Speaker for a number of years and I know 
them well.  I have been to London and Australia and have met most 
other parliamentary democracies.  We are behind the times in this 
area.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Yes, we are elected to and support our party.  The constitution 
of our party allows us to vote with our own conscience and that 
of our constituents.  I respect the fact that in a matter of a 
confidence vote, because it was elected with a majority of members, 
members would vote with the government.  Yes, there should be a 
whip.  If I was a whip the members would be voting with me or 
they would not be there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, on every matter that is not a matter of confidence in 
the government or when we are debating bills in the House, we 
should all be free to say what we want to say.  There are 
different regions in Canada where we may want to have a say on 
something.  We should be allowed to that.  We should be allowed 
to support different ideas and vote that way in the House.  If a 
minister does not have a good bill, let the members send it back 
to be reworked.  Let us get it right.  That is all we are trying 
to say. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can have all the partisan arguments we want but it is time 
for us to get a committee, get a bunch of good people in a room 
and start looking at the rules.  We do not expect to win them all 
but we would certainly like to see some changes.

Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, let me begin my comments by 
congratulating you on your appointment to the chair.  Your 
experience here in the House is going to serve you well, but for 
sure it is going to serve us well.  I am looking forward to 
working under your guidance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since this is the first time I have formally spoken in the 37th 
parliament, I would like to thank the electors of my home riding 
of Brant for having confidence in me and returning me to Ottawa 
as their voice here.  I look forward to continuing to work with 
them in partnership to strengthen the communities back home in 
the riding of Brant and to make sure that their voices are heard 
loudly and clearly here in Ottawa. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is indeed with great pleasure and pride that I speak today in 
response to the Speech from the Throne that was presented by Her 
Excellency the Governor General earlier this week.  One of the 
most important messages for me in the Speech from the Throne was 
a restatement, a recognition that we in the government understand 
that Canada is only as strong as its people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In that context, the Prime Minister yesterday in his speech said 
that our most important investments are the investments we make 
in people.  We have a tradition of investing in Canadians.  We 
believe that there is a role for the Government of Canada to play 
in the lives of our citizens.  We think of important programs 
like our pension system, old age security, guaranteed security 
and the Canada pension plan.  Those programs are extremely 
important and have been inordinately invaluable as we have 
reduced levels of poverty among Canadian seniors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House might be interested to know that between 1980 and 1997 
the share of senior women with low incomes in Canada fell from 
40% to 24%.  The pension system is working.  It is vitally 
important.  We need to continue to support it and ensure it is 
there for the future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The employment insurance system is important.  This is a program 
that is available to support Canadians who, through no fault of 
their own, find themselves between jobs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the last campaign we committed to Canadians to reintroduce 
the amendments that we presented to the House just before the 
election was called.  I am glad to say that yesterday we gave 
notice that it is our intention to reintroduce tomorrow 
amendments to the Employment Insurance Act.  I certainly look 
forward to that act being carried through this place at all 
levels.  I look forward to hearing the debate in the House and 
the witnesses at committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are all proud of our health care and medicare system. It 
ensures that Canadians have access to health services regardless 
of the size of their pocketbook. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the most recent Speech from the Throne we got direction to 
turn our attention to some other important areas.  We have to 
recognize that it is unacceptable for any child in Canada to 
suffer the debilitating impact of poverty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yesterday the Prime Minister said “We must ensure that our 
children are a national priority”.  We will establish an 
investment timetable that will allow us to make real progress in 
ensuring opportunity for all Canadian children.

<A HREF="#LINKT85"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In that context we are not starting from ground zero.  In fact, 
we have some very important developments that have occurred since 
1997, not the least of which is the creation of the national 
child benefit, a very important and effective partnership between 
the Government of Canada and the provincial and territorial 
governments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The national child benefit is part of the Canada child tax 
benefit.  The Government of Canada provides income support to low 
income families with children allowing the provinces to take 
their savings from the social assistance system and use it to 
create and develop new services available to families with 
children.  The whole approach is to take down the welfare roll 
and to make work pay.  In the old system parents who were on 
social assistance and had the benefit of certain services for 
their children would have to give up those services to take a 
minimum wage job.  It was a terrible moral dilemma for them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With the national child benefit we have a new approach which 
increases the income available to those families with children 
and building a platform of services that is available to those 
low income families who are working.  As is in the Speech from 
the Throne, I note that by the year 2004 low income families will 
be receiving $2,500 for their first child and $2,300 for 
subsequent children.  That is tax free money and fully indexed. 
The provinces and territories and the Government of Canada know 
that this important undertaking will have a real impact on 
reducing child poverty in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is another example of our very strong and increasingly 
strengthened relationship with the provinces and territories as 
together we focus on improving the lives of our youngest 
citizens.  I point to an agreement that was struck on September 
11 with the provinces and territories in the area of early 
childhood development. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The research tells us that the early years are tremendously 
important, those early years from prenatal time to age six.  In 
that context ministers of social services across Canada have sat 
together.  We have listened to stakeholders and we understood the 
research.  We hammered out an agreement whereby the Government of 
Canada has identified $2.2 billion new dollars that will be 
conveyed to the provinces beginning in April of this year for 
them to use to make investments in programs and services that 
support children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have agreed that there are really four priority areas in 
which that money should be invested: programs that support 
prenatal nutrition and infancy; programs that will continue to 
allow us to develop child care spaces and services; and programs 
that will allow parents access to the latest information.  Also, 
parents want to do a good job and need to do a good job.  We can 
provide information to them to support them in this regard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other thing we know is that these services are best provided 
at the community level.  If they are really to make a difference, 
communities need to understand the reality of their 
neighbourhoods and the individuals they are supporting.  Money 
can be used by the provinces and territories to help communities 
understand what services are there, what access levels are 
present, how they can fill in the blanks and augment the services 
so that children and their families get the support they need so 
that we have a healthy start in the lives of our children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is an important undertaking.  I look forward in my role as 
Minister of Human Resources Development Canada to continue to 
work with the provincial and territorial ministers as we build 
accountability regimes, outcome measurements so that we know that 
when we are making the investments we are getting the results 
that we anticipate.  It is a very dynamic process, very 
respectful of the jurisdictions of the provinces and territories 
but recognizing that Canadians expect us to work together and 
that when we work together we move ahead much faster. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are some other aspects of programming that we believe can 
help us reduce poverty among Canadian children.  They are 
identified in the Speech from the Throne.  One such program 
builds on a partnership that we have had with New Brunswick and 
British Columbia.  It is a pilot project where we have begun to 
look at other strategies of supporting lone parent families with 
children make the transition from social assistance into the 
workplace.

<A HREF="#LINKT86"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The self-sufficiency program is a pilot program where we offer 
to lone parents who find themselves in receipt of social 
assistance the opportunity, if they can find it, of a full time 
job.  The first job they get is usually a low income one, but the 
Government of Canada tops up their wage so that they have the 
money they need to provide the services to support their 
children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We found after three years that the results are quite 
encouraging.  More social assistance recipients are working. They 
have higher wages.  They are less likely to be living in poverty. 
They have improved their skills and experience.  They are more 
likely to stay in the workforce. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We want to offer other jurisdictions the opportunity to pilot 
with us.  It is not a grand strategy yet, but part of the modern 
approach of governance is to undertake pilots, learn from them 
and together build structures and strategies which meet the needs 
of different communities within provincial and territorial 
jurisdictions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would be remiss if I did not remind the House of a 
tremendously important undertaking to double parental benefits 
that came to fruition at the end of December.  It is a 
fundamentally important approach to allow Canadian parents the 
choice of staying home for up to a year with a new child.  The 
program is up and running.  I expect it to be extraordinarily 
well received.  I am glad to see the majority of provinces have 
changed their labour codes to ensure that parents will have a job 
to go back to.  It will make a tremendous difference in the 
raising of healthy children in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we were talking about that we came to appreciate that there 
was another workplace family issue we would have to deal with in 
a modern Canada.  Sometimes we find that dual income working 
parents find themselves in a circumstance where a family member 
may be gravely ill.  They are in the conundrum of having to work 
to keep bread on the table, to do the responsible thing, but 
someone at home is very sick. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the context of our children's agenda we have committed in the 
Speech from the Throne to look at building an appropriate model 
of compassionate leave, so that the parents do not have to make a 
choice of going to work and supporting and caring for a gravely 
ill child.  That will be a priority of the government.  We will 
explore the appropriate tool in that regard, consult with 
Canadians and be back to the House to talk about those 
developments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have a comprehensive approach to focusing on the reduction of 
child poverty in Canada.  We are building on some important 
developments in partnership with the provinces and territories. I 
am convinced that we will be able to eradicate poverty in Canada 
with the support of all parties in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another important message that we received in the Speech from 
the Throne was the understanding that the countries that will be 
most successful in the modern knowledge based global economy are 
those countries in which all citizens are able to realize their 
full potential. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the context of the Speech from the Throne, we feel that an 
undertaking that is worthy of national focus is the building of a 
skills and learning agenda for the 21st century.  Again, we are 
not starting from ground zero in that regard, but there is much 
we can do.  Much more effort can be put into this undertaking if 
we work together. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the Speech from the Throne we identify a number of approaches 
that we would like to implement as we try and build a tradition 
of life long learning in Canada.  We all know the economy has 
changed tremendously.  We all know it is unlikely for people to 
have a job and keep it for their whole career.  They will go from 
one career to another.  We know how rapidly changing technology 
is, how managerial and administrative practices change, and how 
important it is for all of us to keep current with those changes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have set as a goal to try and build a tradition of life long 
learning, an undertaking of seeing one million adults engaged in 
some form of additional training, education and experience that 
will build on their own personal skills platform in the next five 
years.

<A HREF="#LINKT87"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the strategies we have suggested will work is the 
creation of registered individual learning accounts.  Here we are 
going to build on another important program that was introduced 
by our government, the Canada education savings grant, where 
Canadians can begin to save for their child's education in an 
account and the government provides a top up.  This system has 
been extraordinarily well received by Canadians.  We believe we 
should model that so individuals can begin to save for their own 
lifelong learning. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As that system develops, we recognize that there is something 
more we can do in the area of student loans.  Members might be 
interested to know that each year we issue about 150,000 student 
loans for full time study and only about 3,000 loans for part 
time study.  However, we know Canadians want to learn as they 
earn so we believe we have to take the initiative and develop 
more part time study loans. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again, we want to be very careful to work in tandem with the 
provinces and territories.  There is an opportunity for us to 
continue to work to harmonize the student loan process.  If 
provinces are interested in working with us, we will build a 
strategy of the part time loan initiative in concert and 
understanding of the undertakings of the provinces as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we are looking at ensuring that every citizen can realize 
their full potential, we must turn our attention to those most 
vulnerable in Canada.  We have to look at youth at risk, those 
who have not been able to connect effectively with society or the 
economy.  We have to do what we can to ensure that they get a 
good start as they go out and become self-sufficient and 
contributors to Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to increase the levels of literacy in Canada.  Do 
members know that two out of five Canadians do not have the 
literacy skills to read a bus schedule, to read a map and to 
participate in so many of the jobs now that require technological 
understanding and competencies?  As we said in the Speech from 
the Throne, we want to work with the provinces and territories to 
undertake a national initiative to upgrade the levels of 
literacy.  That has to be a national challenge. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians with disabilities are also very anxious to contribute 
more of themselves to the Canadian economy.  They want to be part 
of the creation and the development of increased prosperity. 
Together with the provinces and territories, we have begun this 
work at the table of labour market ministers.  We want to build a 
labour market strategy focused specifically on the issues facing 
Canadians with disabilities.  This is part of our challenge but I 
know that if we work together we can meet it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>New Canadians come very often with training and experience that 
we find very difficult to take advantage of.  We have to find a 
system of more effective credentialing for new Canadians.  This 
is again a challenge that we have set for ourselves in concert 
with the provinces and territories. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We do not have all the answers in the context of building a 
national skills agenda.  These are some of the undertakings that 
we believe are wise to start now.  They require us to work 
effectively with the provinces and territories but they also 
require us to go out and talk more closely with stakeholders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am looking forward to starting some national consultations 
with groups, such as the Conference Board of Canada, specifically 
focused on finding ways to ensure that we build the strategies 
that will support lifelong learning in Canada, that will allow us 
all, whether we be the Government of Canada, the provinces or 
territorial governments, the private sector, the voluntary 
sector, to rally behind a national skills and learning 
undertaking that will benefit all citizens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are so many other aspects of the Speech from the Throne 
that dovetail and build on our commitment to innovation and 
inclusion.  These that I have talked about in my speech are ones 
with which I will be involved.  I will need the support of 
members in the House, certainly in our caucus, to recognize the 
role our caucus has played in making sure that children are at 
the top of our agenda, and to recognize the importance of 
developing programs that speak to a modern Canada and the needs 
of Canadians to participate in the new economy.

formula.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska—Rivière-du-Loup—Témiscouata—Les Basques, 
BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I listened with great interest to the speech 
of the minister responsible who plays 
a big role in the distribution of wealth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the throne speech, two excerpts seem to reflect a vision of 
the past rather than one of the future. The old age pension plan 
is praised, and it has indeed worked well in the past to fight 
poverty. I would however have liked to find initiatives dealing 
with the current problems experienced by the elderly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, for many women living on their own, with the cost 
of the food basket for their daily needs, the increase in the 
price of drugs, the increase in the cost of living and all other 
expenses, the existing program—and I will show this—no longer 
meets their needs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There was no announcement to this effect, other than the fact 
that a plan that worked in the past had been developed.  There 
is no message of hope. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is another much more aggressive sentence in the throne 
speech.  It reads, and I quote: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There was a time when losing a job also meant immediate loss of 
income for workers and their families. And so Canadians created 
employment insurance. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It takes a lot of gall to say such a thing in the throne speech. 
What was created 50 years ago was an unemployment insurance 
plan to meet this need.  But all employment insurance has done 
since its inception is increase poverty throughout Quebec and 
Canada by tightening the requirements it set, by the fact that 
fewer people are eligible for it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>After the Prime Minister recognized during the election campaign 
that the employment insurance plan was a bad move, that it 
needed corrective action, are we going to find in the bill to be 
tabled shortly things such as an increase in the level of 
benefits from 55% to 60% and the elimination of discrimination 
against women and young people entering the labour market?  Will 
Quebec be entitled to its own parental leave plan? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are a lot of other situations.  I would like the minister 
to tell us whether there will be something to help us reach this 
objective or do we have to be content with what was in Bill 
C-44, which was tabled before the election? 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Jane Stewart:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the hon. member talked 
specifically about Canadian seniors, health care and health 
services.  I remind him of the historic agreement that was struck 
with the provinces and territories that will see $23 billion 
reinvested in the Canada health and social transfer, specifically 
to assist with health care.  That typically will find itself 
supporting Canadian seniors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remind him of the work the government did in the not so 
distant past to ensure that our pension system, our pension 
programs, will be sustainable and will be there for Canadians. We 
know that it has had an impact on reducing poverty.  We are 
committed to ensuring that it is there for the future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With regard specifically to employment insurance, I am glad to 
see the hon. member continues to have an interest in that regard. 
He will be interested to know, as I said in my speech, that we 
intend to introduce legislation regarding employment insurance 
amendments on Friday.  He will be participating fully in the 
discussion in the House of Commons and at committee, and I look 
forward to his interventions there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are some important messages to give there as well.  The 
economy in Canada is working well.  The best social program is a 
job.  We have the lowest levels of unemployment in Canada in a 
quarter of a century, not only for men but for women.  The youth 
unemployment numbers are coming down.  We are finding the 
participation rates in the Canadian economy increasing.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The changes we made to employment insurance in 1995 are being 
reviewed every year.  By and large the dozen or so changes have 
worked extraordinarily well.  However, in reviewing those changes 
year after year we have identified some that are not working so 
well.  Those will be the thrust and the content of the bill that 
will be tabled here, I expect and hope, on Friday. 
<P><A NAME="LINK223"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Grant Hill (Macleod, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I congratulate the minister on her discourse.  I 
listened carefully to her specific words, that she would like to 
eradicate child poverty in Canada.  It is a very noble goal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To help me to celebrate and to monitor the course of that noble 
goal, I wonder if the minister could define child poverty for me. 
This is something that I earnestly would like her to do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I listened to a couple of speeches today that talked about 42% 
and 52% rates of child poverty in Winnipeg.  If the minister 
could give me a definition so that I could monitor with her the 
noble goal, it would help me to cheer for the government as it 
reaches that goal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Jane Stewart:</B>  Mr. Speaker, indeed there are 
different ways of measuring poverty.  We can use LICOs or we can 
use market basket measures.  The last thing I want to engage in 
is a discussion of what exactly the right measure is. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We want to ensure that children have a healthy start and the 
opportunity to participate fully in Canada and its wealth. Having 
seen global poverty levels being reduced in the last year, it is 
our expectation that we can redouble our efforts to make the 
commitments of the House of a decade ago become a reality. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again I would point out that the strategies we have in place 
received a tremendous boost by the effective partnerships we have 
forged with the provinces and territories.  Canadians want us to 
work together on these issues of national priority and together 
we will do so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the most important aspects of the early childhood 
development agreement is working together to establish baseline 
data about where we are today and where we will be as the moneys 
we have identified for families reach the communities and 
families with children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am glad the hon. member is looking for a results based 
strategy.  That is precisely the approach we are taking in our 
work with the provinces and territories.  It is precisely the 
strategy that we will build into additional programs and pilots 
we will introduce in coming years. 
<P><A NAME="LINK224"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Greg Thompson (New Brunswick Southwest, PC):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, congratulations to you on your new position in the 
House.  We came into the House together in 1988.  I am sure we 
will get the same kind of wisdom that we saw from you as a member 
of parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to thank the minister.  She is obviously living up to the 
red book promise of introducing the EI legislation very quickly 
in this new mandate.  That is appreciated certainly by myself and 
my constituents.  I know the bill has not been tabled.  We have 
not seen it.  I doubt that this is in the bill, but I want to at 
least put it on the record. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One problem was that the previous bill did not address the 
boundary issues.  I am referring to the disparity between rural 
Canada and urban Canada, which the Minister of Industry mentioned 
a couple of days ago in a radio interview.  In other words, in 
bigger centres unemployment is much lower and in rural areas it 
is much higher, yet these areas are blended together. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It really hurts our seasonal workers.  We have spoken with the 
minister on this before.  The minister in her wisdom and the 
department were generous enough to change the rules.  They will 
be incrementally changed over the next four or five years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Getting to the point, is there any way we can address these 
boundary issues in terms of the disparity between urban Canada 
and rural Canada and seasonal workers in resource backed 
industries?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Jane Stewart:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I will wait until the 
legislation is tabled and not talk specifically about what is in 
it.  I hope and anticipate that the hon. member will see it in 
its fullest form on Friday. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Specifically with regard to employment insurance boundaries, the 
hon. member knows that every five years the boundaries are 
studied, reviewed, and changes made as necessary to reflect 
changing employment patterns. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By and large the most recent changes have been effectively 
implemented.  In some areas we are implementing transitional 
measures to help with those changes.  We recognize that one of 
the biggest areas of importance is seasonal work and seasonal 
workers.  We are doing all we can to help to diversify rural 
economies in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know the hon. member will continue to work with me in that 
regard. 
<P><A NAME="LINK225"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Duncan (Vancouver Island North, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I congratulate you on your 
appointment.  I do not know how many have done that but I am 
happy to do so.  This is my third parliament, so we have 
obviously spent some time together as I think this is your 
fourth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to respond to the throne speech.  I was here, as hon. 
members were, on the day the throne speech was read.  The first 
thing I did was, as everyone did, go for the area of the speech I 
thought would be most important for my constituents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ran for politics because I believed parliament needed some 
very basic reforms.  I thought I might moderate or somehow change 
my views, but I have not.  The longer I am here, the more I 
recognize that such reforms are needed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those changes are still very important to me and many of my 
constituents.  Even now the lack of progress on basic 
parliamentary and democratic reforms is creating problems in 
Canada from a regional standpoint and is diminishing our stature 
internationally. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How would I know this?  It is partly from being in the job for 
so long.  I have met ambassadors, ministers from other nations, 
senators and congressmen from our neighbour to the south, people 
who have seen and experienced how it works in other places.  One 
of the natural things we do is make comparisons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is overdue.  I would say that if Canada were a more populous 
nation with more than the 30 million people we have, our system 
really would not work.  What we have today only works because of 
our relatively small population. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Too much power resides with the Prime Minister and the Office of 
the Prime Minister.  Members of parliament and other government 
and democratic institutions are neutered to some degree because 
of it.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I must return to the throne speech.  I had to go to the very 
last page of the throne speech to find anything at all on 
democratic reforms.  Guess what it says?  We will look at 
electronic voting maybe and there will be more dollars for the 
library of parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those are both simple, straightforward initiatives that I do not 
think anyone in the House will disagree with but that is not 
democratic reform.  Plain and simple, that is not what anyone who 
is interested in democratic reform was looking for, including an 
awful lot of government backbench members of parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So where are we?  In January, the Canadian Alliance House leader 
proposed a set of democratic reforms.  These democratic reforms 
had a lot of support from the other opposition parties.  They are 
not built out of thin air.  These had been building for some 
time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to quote from the beginning of the document called 
“Building Trust”.  It is a quotation from the Leader of the 
Opposition who said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians are justly proud of our heritage of responsible 
government.  But our parliamentary democracy is not all that it 
should be.  To much power is exercised by the Prime Minister 
instead of being shared by our elected representatives. 
Excessive party discipline stifles open discussion and debate. 
Grassroots citizens and community groups feel that their opinions 
are not respected or heard. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is the Leader of the Opposition in his introduction to the 
document. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There were several things focused on in the document: free votes 
in the House of Commons; some changes to the standing committees; 
a call for a new standing committee on privacy access and ethics; 
and making the ethics counsellor or officer a true officer of 
parliament.  I want to focus just on two of those reforms; free 
votes in the House of Commons and the ethics counsellor. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we talk about free votes, there is an attempt to cloud what 
we are saying, so it is not clearly understood.  That is why I 
want to focus on that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now, to best get at the free vote issue, I have to quote once 
again.  I will quote the previous leader of the opposition during 
a debate on April 21, 1998.  The one thing I have learned after 
three years in this place is the last time that one thinks one 
can say something is often the first time somebody is listening, 
so I am going to say it again. 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a myth in the House that lurking out there somewhere is 
the fiery dragon of the confidence convention, the erroneous 
belief studiously cultivated by the government that if a 
government bill or motion is defeated, or an opposition bill, 
motion or amendment is passed, this obliges the government to 
resign.  This myth is used to coerce government members, 
especially backbenchers, to vote for government bills and motions 
with which they and their constituents disagree and to vote 
against opposition bills, motions and amendments with which they 
substantially agree.  The reality is that the fiery dragon of the 
confidence convention in its traditional form is dead.  The 
sooner the House officially recognizes that fact, the better for 
all. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are calling for an official commitment by the House to 
conduct votes freely without jeopardizing our parliamentary 
positions.  That would be very simple. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second issue I would like to talk about is the ethics 
counsellor becoming a true officer of parliament.  Many of the 
members in the House will remember the Liberal red book from 
1993.  It states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>A Liberal government will appoint an independent Ethics 
Counsellor to advise both public officials and lobbyists in the 
day-to-day application of the Code of Conduct for Public 
Officials.  The Ethics Counsellor will be appointed after 
consultation with the leaders of all parties in the House of 
Commons and will report directly to Parliament.

appointed by the Prime Minister.  It is a conflict, plain and 
simple. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All these reforms are analogous to the little boy with his 
finger in the dike.  There is a flood out there and instead of a 
wall of water we have a wall of opinion saying “we want 
changes”.  It is coming from the public and from members of 
parliament in all parties.  We have a very select few who are 
resisting all of that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I tell my constituents that we have to look at this not from a 
personal history standpoint but from the standpoint of the 
broader history of the political landscape.  These changes will 
happen.  It is just a matter of when. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In summary, the Prime Minister could be known for what he did, 
but he will probably be known for what he did not do. 
<P><A NAME="LINK226"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pat Martin (Winnipeg Centre, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
agree with much of what the previous speaker had to say about the 
shortcomings of the throne speech.  He did not choose to comment 
on what has to be one of the most glaring oversights, which we 
just witnessed when the Minister of Human Resources Development 
spoke about doing her best—I think that was the term she 
used—to help the most vulnerable and that the theme of this 
year's throne speech and this parliament had to be about helping 
the most vulnerable.  Then she went on to contradict herself by 
saying that the EI system is yada, yada, yada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the hon. member agree that the EI system is so completely 
dysfunctional that it has ceased to be an insurance program at 
all and is in fact used as a revenue generator, a cash cow?  In 
fact, it is another tax on people's paycheques, because there is 
no insurance value from a program that denies over 70% of all 
applicants any benefits whatsoever. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the hon. member agree that one of the most galling things 
about this particular parliament is that the government side 
refuses to admit that it is using the revenue from the EI system 
for purposes other than income maintenance and benefits, that in 
fact the revenue from the EI system is being used as a cash cow, 
and that it is fundamentally wrong? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Duncan:</B>  Mr. Speaker, there is a lot of common 
ground between my thoughts and those of the hon. member.  I will 
say that we have people on the CPP disability program that I do 
not think should be funded by CPP.  There are people who fall 
between the cracks, between the CPP disability and EI and the 
provincial social assistance programs.  There is room to do 
something about that rather than play within the current rules of 
the EI system.  We need to think in a different way about people 
who are falling between the cracks.  That has been very clear to 
me for some time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yes, the government is treating the EI system as a cash cow, and 
employers and employees are all being hurt as a consequence.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Miss Deborah Grey (Edmonton North, Canadian Alliance):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, congratulations to you on your appointment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I thank the hon. member for his speech.  In many respects 
parliamentary reform is something that has been talked about here 
for probably at least one generation.  I know that it is easy for 
members on either side of the House to talk about it, probably 
when they are in opposition.  The bullet comes, of course, when 
some party forms a government.  Parliamentary reform becomes just 
terribly inconvenient or messy or really inefficient when a 
government is formed and is trying to blast things through. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the specific issue of the ethics counsellor. I thought it 
was interesting.  There is a huge difference between reporting to 
parliament and just having coffee with the Prime Minister, for 
instance, and tossing off a note saying everything is okay.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would be interested to hear the hon. member give a brief 
comment on what has gone wrong since red book one. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now very specifically, in regard to the symposium that took 
place earlier on Parliament Hill today when we talked about 
trying to do something practical about democracy, we heard from 
an expert source that it is not so much that the rules need to be 
changed, because we have all the rules in the world.  We would be 
able to change them at will if there were unanimous consent, I am 
sure, on both sides of the House.  The expert said that the rules 
are there to allow us to do whatever we want to do in terms of 
making sure that we really do have a working democracy, but he 
said that it was caucus culture, that there is a sickness there. 
I wonder if the hon. member could talk about any caucus culture 
on the government side that seems to be just desperately against 
this whole idea of really freeing things up. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Duncan:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I do not want to give a 10 
minute speech.  Let me put it this way:  we do not have an ethics 
counsellor who reports to parliament, but we have a privacy 
commissioner and an access to information commissioner who do. 
Those relationships have worked well.  We want it to work even 
better and so do they.  They welcome the creation of a new 
parliamentary committee to look after privacy, access and ethics. 
That in a nutshell is what I think should be done. 
<P><A NAME="LINK228"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Kevin Sorenson (Crowfoot, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I rise today with honour and a great sense of pride in 
representing in this magnificent House the people of Crowfoot. It 
is a privilege to stand here today and address the members of 
parliament in my maiden speech. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, before I proceed, I commend you on your service in 
the Chair.   A number of members have told the House about your 
service over the years.  We appreciate it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>May I also make mention of and congratulate our Speaker on his 
victory?  When he was chosen, he spoke about fulfilling a dream 
to serve as Speaker in the House.  It is rare that we can fully 
achieve our dreams.  I have come to realize that I will never 
fulfil all my dreams.  I will never score the winning goal in a 
Stanley Cup playoff game or play in the PGA.  Indeed, I will 
probably never throw a pitch in the World Series.  Standing here 
today, however, I recognize that I have fulfilled one dream. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I therefore begin by sincerely thanking the numerous volunteers 
who selflessly and diligently assisted with my campaign.  It was 
undoubtedly the collective effort of all those involved that 
resulted in my victory and the victory for the Canadian Alliance 
in a very difficult and, in some respects, very emotional 
campaign in Crowfoot. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to thank God for allowing me the privilege of 
serving the people of Crowfoot and Him in parliament.  I would 
also like to pay special tribute today to my family, to my 
parents and my in-laws, and to my wife Darlene and our two 
children, Kristen and Ryan, who are here with me today, in the 
gallery, as they are every day. 
If it were not for my 
family and their love and support, I would not be in this House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, I thank all the people of Crowfoot for bestowing their 
faith in me.  I promise to respectfully and truthfully represent 
their views and concerns here.  I pledge to work hard, with the 
same diligence that the majority of the people of Crowfoot 
demonstrate daily as they go about their occupations and their 
careers in our predominately rural riding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As mentioned earlier, I would not be here if it were not for my 
family.  I think it is safe to say that the majority of my 
colleagues share this with me.  The family truly is the 
foundation of our society.  Therefore, in order to have a 
socially and economically vibrant nation, it is imperative that 
we have strong families. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yesterday's throne speech clearly indicates that this Liberal 
government does not share this view.  I am thankful that this 
view is a view that is prevalent within the Canadian Alliance and 
among our many supporters.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although there was mention in the throne speech of children and 
families and children and poverty, there was no talk of proposals 
for addressing the economic realities facing many Canadian 
families today, particularly those who are threatened with losing 
their jobs or with having less disposable income as we enter into 
these uncharted waters or uncertain economic times. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government's pre-election mini-budget is, as the Leader of 
the Opposition pointed out yesterday, sadly outdated.  It has 
been found sadly wanting.  Clearly we need a 2001 budget that 
includes, among other things, more aggressive and immediate tax 
cuts.  Since the Liberals took power in 1993, Canadians' 
disposable income has dropped by close to $2,200 for every 
taxpayer, and taxes have risen over 37 times.  This is not the 
legacy to leave Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We now pay personal income taxes that are 56% higher than those 
of the average G7 country.  As if cripplingly high taxes were 
not eroding Canadians' disposable income enough, this country's 
citizens are now being unfairly burdened with excessively high 
fuel prices, so prohibitively high that some cannot afford to pay 
their heating bills. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While the Prime Minister may, as he stated yesterday, just be 
getting warmed up to the position of Prime Minister, the fact is 
that many Canadians literally are finding themselves out in the 
cold.  I, as a federal official, can provide little comfort and 
hope to the many distraught constituents who are writing letters, 
making phone calls and dropping in on our Crowfoot office. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I understand from recent newspaper articles that the federal 
government has initiated a program called “Relief for Heating 
Expenses”.  Reports indicate that cheques of $125 to $250 will 
be sent out automatically to every Canadian who received a GST 
tax credit for the 1999 tax year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although I commend the government for recognizing the horrific 
burden placed on many individuals due to high heating costs, I do 
question giving the rebate only to those eligible for the GST tax 
credit in 1999.  This is not 1999.  This is not 2000.  This is 
2001.  Quite obviously incomes have changed in the last two 
years, some for the better but many for the worse.  This rebate 
does not guarantee that the people in need of financial 
assistance today will receive it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I must also question why the federal government has failed to 
address soaring energy costs and other input costs that are 
negatively impacting Canadian farmers.  A forecast of farm 
incomes by Agriculture Canada suggests that Alberta farmers will 
be among the hardest hit in the country as the cost of farming 
continues to rise.  Operating farm machinery has become more 
expensive as natural gas and fuel costs rise.  So has the cost of 
fertilizing our crops.  The price of nitrogen fertilizer, with 
its key ingredient and process being natural gas, has risen from 
approximately $390 per tonne as recently as last spring to a 
projected $700 plus this year.  Farmers are losing hope.  The 
next generation is leaving and there is no one to take over the 
family farms. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Overall in Canada, net cash incomes for farmers are expected to 
drop another 6% this year.  Despite this grim reality and the 
fact that more than two years ago the federal government promised 
to help producers struggling with slumping commodity prices, the 
federal government has failed to deal aggressively with its trade 
partners to lower international agricultural subsidies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although our Prime Minister mentioned yesterday in the House 
that he was going to the United States and would be speaking to 
President Bush, he still does not see the need to place our 
farmers on a level playing field with our competitors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government took decisive action to counteract the 
illegal export subsidies provided by the government of Brazil to 
its aircraft manufacturers.  Pointing out the importance of the 
aerospace industry to the Canadian economy and the need to save 
24,000 jobs, the federal government moved quickly to provide 
subsidies to Bombardier to enable them to better compete with 
major competitors.

<A HREF="#LINKT95"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Over the last year within the agricultural industry we have lost 
almost the equivalent of Bombardier's entire workforce. 
Approximately 22,000 farmers or persons in related farm 
occupations are out of business. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The western grain and oilseeds industry provides tremendous 
value to the Canadian economy.  In 1999 it was valued at over $70 
billion.  That value is steadily and very quickly diminishing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Due to the effects of subsidization around the world, market 
receipts for grain and oilseeds have been dropping for many years 
and are expected to continue to decline.  In Saskatchewan, where 
grain and oilseeds are the dominant industry, total net income is 
predicted to be negative in 2001, 2002 and 2003. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need to immediately develop and implement assistance packages 
for our producers to stem the exodus of farm workers and the 
destruction of the Canadian family farm. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I look forward to working with my colleagues on all sides of the 
House to find meaningful and long term solutions for reducing 
input costs and providing a stable and deliverable assistance to 
our farmers.  Every business in rural Alberta, in Oyen, 
Drumheller, Stettler, Camrose, Wainwright, Provost and Hanna, all 
farming communities within our constituency, is dependent on a 
strong agricultural sector and therefore dependent on us to 
provide viable solutions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As one of the Canadian Alliance deputy justice critics, I also 
welcome the opportunity to help find the means to truly make our 
streets and communities safer for the sake of my children and for 
all Canadian children. 
<P><A NAME="LINK229"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I am truly impressed with the new member who has joined 
us in our party in parliament.  He is clearly very articulate. He 
has well thought ideas and it is quite obvious he is very capable 
of expressing them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I should like to ask him one question with respect to the farm 
crisis and the fact that in the throne speech there was nothing 
about the farm crisis.  He made an allusion to the fact that 
there was lots of money for Bombardier but seemingly none for 
farmers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What does he see as both the short term solution to the farming 
crisis?  What should be done in terms of giving them a long term 
solution so that they can be viable and so that our agricultural 
community can grow, be strong, be reliable and actually form part 
of our national security as we go on in coming years? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Kevin Sorenson:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I would begin to answer 
that question by saying that I am a farmer.  I understand the 
concerns and the frustrations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we campaigned throughout my constituency last year, people in 
the communities I mentioned such as Oyen, Drumheller and Stettler 
told us that if we were to help rural Alberta then we should help 
the agricultural sector.  As we go into the spring it is very 
clear many farms are just not viable and are asking for help from 
the government.  There is a crisis that will eventually go away 
if we leave it, but so will all the farmers who are in crisis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need a government that is willing to act now, to tell us that 
it is committed to helping the farmers now, and to tell western 
Canadian and Canadian agriculture that it believes in that sector 
of society and will help now.  A cash influx before the spring 
crop is put out is needed now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I challenge the government today to say that western Canada and 
agriculture are important and that it will do what is needed. 
That is the short term plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also need a long term plan.  We have to look at ways of 
helping in the Income Tax Act.  Farming is the only industry that 
pays retail for everything it gets and sells wholesale.  For 
everything we purchase we pay taxes and freight charges when it 
comes in.  For everything we sell we pay the freight before it 
leaves.  Transportation is another issue we have to deal with in 
the long term, and of course the Canadian Wheat Board. 
We need changes to make the Canadian Wheat Board more accountable 
and changes that will help Alberta, the west and Canadian 
agriculture before it is too late.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pat Martin (Winnipeg Centre, NDP):</B> Mr. Speaker, I too 
would like to welcome the newly elected member for Crowfoot and 
compliment him on a very good maiden speech. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He raised two things that are of special interest to me as a 
resident of Manitoba.  The first was the agricultural crisis, and 
I thank him for outlining that issue in great detail. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other issue that the member raised and on which I would like 
him to expand somewhat is the crisis in fuel costs, be it home 
heating fuel, gasoline, diesel, natural gas or anything else. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would the member agree that the federal government has some role 
to play in trying to regulate and intervene at this point to put 
some sense of order to the spiralling, out of control, 
skyrocketing fuel costs that affect all of us and especially 
farmers?  Would he agree that we need a regulatory commission to 
act as a regulatory body that would intervene on behalf of 
Canadians to put some order into the fuel cost crisis? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Kevin Sorenson:</B>  Mr. Speaker, as we have just begun a 
new term and as a rookie member of parliament, I have been a 
little overwhelmed by the number of phone calls I, and I am sure 
every member of the House, have received with regard to a number 
of issues, including agriculture and heating costs.  I spoke 
about the issue of heating costs in my maiden speech because it 
was one of the issues that my constituents were very concerned 
about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada has a number of things that we deem to be essential 
services and, with our climate, I think heating costs also need 
to be deemed an essential service.  I applaud the government for 
its initiative in giving a rebate to consumers.  It needs to 
continue to look at ways to put money back into the hands of 
those who especially need it. 
<P><A NAME="LINK231"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
congratulate you on your appointment.  I would also like to thank 
the people of Mississauga South who elected me for the third 
time.  I am very honoured to be here to represent my constituents 
and to work hard on behalf of all Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The throne speech 2001, which has been outlined so eloquently 
today by many members, provides the framework under which we will 
govern the country over this mandate.  Our plan seeks to ensure a 
brighter future for all Canadians and to strike the right 
balance.  It includes provisions for paying down debt, cutting 
taxes fairly, investing in health care, investing in research and 
innovation, investing in families and children and protecting our 
environment, just to name a few. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a parliamentarian since 1993, most of my private member's 
initiatives have been directed at areas relating to family and 
children.  There is a specific section in the throne speech which 
deals with various initiatives that we will be undertaking during 
this parliament.  I want to take the time now to follow the focus 
on families and children, particularly on the issue of fetal 
alcohol syndrome. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The brain drain is a concept with which most members are 
familiar.  It refers to the migration of our so-called best and 
brightest from Canada to the U.S. and abroad.  It is a figurative 
term but it can be looked at literally as well.  In a literal 
sense, brain drain is the physical effect of fetal alcohol 
syndrome, often referred to as FAS.  Fetal alcohol syndrome is 
the real brain drain that we have to address and it is a 100% 
preventable tragedy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On December 7, 1995, I first spoke in the House of Commons about 
fetal alcohol syndrome. It was part of my private member's bill, 
Bill C-237.  That bill sought to provide health warning labels on 
the containers of alcoholic beverages to caution expectant 
mothers and others of the risks associated with alcohol 
consumption. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I became a member of parliament one of the things I wanted 
to do was to become involved on the health committee.  I did some 
research to find out what the health committee had been working 
on during the 34th parliament.

<A HREF="#LINKT97"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the things that I came across was a study called “Fetal 
Alcohol Syndrome, A Preventable Tragedy” produced by a House of 
Commons standing committee.  I quote from the summary phraseology 
contained in the report: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today, there is no question that maternal alcohol consumption can 
have devastating impacts on the fetus.  The basic fact is that 
when the pregnant woman drinks, her unborn child drinks also; 
that is, the alcohol in the mother's bloodstream circulates 
through the placenta and into bloodstream of the fetus.  It is 
possible that the blood-alcohol level in the fetus will remain at 
an elevated level for a longer period than that of the mother 
because the immature fetal liver metabolises the alcohol more 
slowly. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>They said there was a problem and laid out some recommendations, 
which fascinated me.  The reason that I was fascinated by the 
study was that I was an educated person who was active in my 
community.  I was on a hospital board, had three children, and it 
was the first time that I had ever heard the term fetal alcohol 
syndrome.  It had a tremendous impact on me.  How was it possible 
that a preventable tragedy did not come to the attention of an 
ordinary person in the community?  It was something that I wanted 
to get involved in. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have been active in the issue and I wanted to learn more about 
it.  In any one week as many as 10,000 babies are born in Canada. 
Of these, 3 are born with muscular dystrophy, 4 are born 
with HIV infection, 8 are born with spina bifida, 10 are born 
with Down's syndrome, 20 are born with fetal alcohol syndrome 
and over 100 are born with other alcohol related birth defects. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Fetal alcohol syndrome refers to a group of physical and mental 
birth defects.  Its primary symptoms include growth deficiency 
before and after birth, central nervous system dysfunction 
resulting in learning disabilities, and physical malformalities 
in the face and cranial areas.  Other alcohol related birth 
defects involve central nervous damage like FAS without the 
physical abnormalities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>FAS is incurable.  Once someone has it, it will affect that 
person for the rest of his or her life.  Most victims usually 
require special care throughout their lives.  Depending on the 
severity, the estimated lifetime cost for the care of an FAS 
victim ranges from $3 million to $6 million. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are secondary systems.  What happens to people who have 
FAS?  Their lifestyles are characteristic.  Here are a few 
examples:  90% have mental health problems; 60% will be expelled 
or suspended from school or drop out of school; 60% will get into 
trouble with the law; 50% will exhibit inappropriate sexual 
behaviour; 30% will abuse drugs or alcohol; 80% will be incapable 
of living independently; and 80% will have problems in their 
employment situations.  Tragically, these severe problems could 
have been prevented if the mother had abstained from alcohol 
consumption through her pregnancy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last year, I took the opportunity to look at some of the recent 
data from Manitoba and Saskatchewan resulting from work on FAS. 
One of the things I found is that they have surveyed their inmate 
population and found that 50% of the population in the jails in 
Manitoba and Saskatchewan were people who had fetal alcohol 
syndrome or other alcohol related birth defects. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I posed the same question during question period to the Minister 
of Justice.  I asked her, what is the experience of the 
government in the federal institutions?  She confirmed in the 
House that persons with fetal alcohol syndrome account for 50% of 
the inmates in our jails. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The dollars involved here are enormous.  The impact on our 
justice system, health care system, social services system and on 
our education system are enormous and pervasive.  The costs are 
enormous.  It is one of the reasons why I am so delighted that 
the government has decided to take the initiative as part of its 
priorities.  I hope the House will support initiatives related to 
the reduction of FAS. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Bélair):</B>  I would like to inform 
the member that there will be 13 minutes left in his speech if he
