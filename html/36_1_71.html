I am pleased to stand in the House today to join Canadians and 
the world in marking March 8 to 14 as International Women's Week. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The theme for this year's celebration is: The Evolution of 
Women's Rights:  A Lifelong Commitment. This theme highlights the 
importance of women's human rights while emphasizing the long 
term commitment necessary to further women's equality. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my riding of Kitchener Centre we celebrated the contributions 
of women to Canadian society by holding the first annual 
International Women's Day breakfast featuring two women who have 
demonstrated vision in their fields. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we honour International Women's Week, let us reaffirm our 
dedication to the challenge of promoting fairness, equity and 
respect for human rights here in Canada and around the world.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bob Mills (Red Deer, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, like so many 
MPs, I toured around my riding last week to find out what the 
people thought.  The people of the riding of Red Deer gave me 
four messages to bring back to this house. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first one was to demand lower taxes.  They do not accept the 
finance minister's glib comments about tax cuts and how he is 
helping people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, unlike the Liberals they understand that debt and taxes 
kill jobs.  They expect the national debt to be paid off. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Third, the people of central Alberta demand an elected Senate. 
It is obvious the days of patronage are quickly coming to an end 
in the upper chamber. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, the people of the Red Deer constituency are proud 
Canadians.  They are proud of their two Olympic athletes who 
competed in Japan and they are proud of the Canadian flag.  Their 
message echoes across this country that they want to see the flag 
honoured in this place.

Speaker, the 28th annual meeting of the Canada-France 
InterParliamentary Association was held last week in France. 
Nine of our parliamentarians from both Houses attended this 
meeting. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Discussions focused on our health services, the Kyoto agreement, 
women and politics, the proposed multilateral agreement on 
investment, the building of the European Union and the role 
played by the Canadian Armed Forces during the second world war. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our two countries share many concerns and interests: efforts to 
restore fiscal health through deficit reduction of course, but 
also through strategic social investments; the realization that 
some so-called national problems can only be addressed within the 
context of strengthened international co-operation, particularly 
as regards the environment; common values and interests to uphold 
in negotiating the multilateral agreement, with respect to the 
cultural exemption in particular. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, we noted our French counterparts' conviction that the 
future of our societies is dependent on the strengthening—

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Jocelyne Girard-Bujold (Jonquière, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, yesterday 
the Liberals saw the light. The hon. member for 
Notre-Dame-de-Grâce—Lachine recognized that the sovereignists were 
doing a fine job of managing Quebec's finances, since investments 
there will grow by 8.4% in 1998, as compared with 6.2% in Canada 
and 5% in Ontario. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois applauds both these pieces of good news: 
investments for Quebec and the Bouchard government receiving 
acclaim from the Liberals. 
After discovering that there is water on the moon, it is very 
encouraging to see that members across the floor are waking up.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I have also noticed that the Liberals admitted this week that 
sovereignists are doing a good job in Quebec, and they also 
support a Conservative to lead the Quebec Liberal Party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Can you believe, Mr. Speaker, that the members across the way 
have finally realized that behind every problem in Quebec there 
is a Liberal?

government in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In marking it, we must remind ourselves that our role in this 
House, our ability to represent our constituents in this great 
democracy, has its roots in the work in 1848 of those who fought 
for the principles of representative government. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today, it is our duty to salute the efforts of three men: Joseph 
Howe, of Nova Scotia, as well as Robert Baldwin and Louis 
Hippolyte Lafontaine, of the United Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we reflect on the achievements of these men it reminds us 
of our role as members of Parliament. And when we reflect on the 
efforts of Baldwin and Lafontaine, two friends united in their 
fight for democracy, we realize that this country was built 
through the joint, hard work of francophones and anglophones. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I respect their memory and I believe the best way to celebrate 
their democratic victory is to make sure the country they loved 
so much remains strong and united.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Carolyn Bennett (St. Paul's, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the

assistance program is one of the most important mechanisms for 
supporting innovation and helping small business create and adopt 
new technologies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Every year IRAP provides technical advice to more than 10,000

research and development to more than 3,000 companies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The industrial research assistance program supports a national 
technology network that involves 150 public and private sector 
organizations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is for this reason that this government will increase this 
successful program by an additional $34 million to $130 million 
this year, an increase of 35% from 1997. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>IRAP will provide greater support to small businesses in 
adopting new technologies and developing new products for

</I></B></P><P align=left>But what this federal government does not tell us is that the 
very foundation of the alliance between Lafontaine and Baldwin 
was their willingness to recognize as equals and partners the two 
peoples living side by side in a united Canada.  In other words, 
when Louis Hippolyte Lafontaine and Robert Baldwin joined 
forces, what moved them was a recognition of, and respect for, 
the two founding peoples. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since the unilateral patriation of the Constitution in 1982, the 
federal government has denied that reality.  Since then, it has 
ridden roughshod over the principles of 1848.  It seeks to deny 
the very existence of the Quebec people. 
It prefers arrogance and confrontation to the recognition and 
respect that prevailed at the time.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, when the government presented the budget a few weeks 
ago, many Canadians suspected that the finance minister had used 
creative accounting to avoid showing a surplus.  That way the 
government could say there was no money for major debt reduction 
or tax relief. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now the auditor general has confirmed those suspicions.  He is 
threatening not to sign off on the budget because of serious 
breaches in accounting practices. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why is the Prime Minister not following proper public sector 
accounting principles in the preparation of the budget?  What is 
the government trying to hide? 
<P><A NAME="LINK33"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, when we took office in 1993 we discovered to our 
amazement that there were a number of obligations of the 
government that had not been accounted for.  There were 
commitments looking ahead which had not been booked into the 
numbers.  In fact a fair amount of clean-up had to be done.  I 
wish the auditor general at that point had insisted on a far 
greater degree of transparency. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We took the decision at that point that the books of this 
government would be more transparent than anybody else's books 
and that Canadians would understand exactly the financial 
situation of the country, and that we would not hide numbers. 
That is what we have done in this particular case. 
<P><A NAME="LINK34"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, the finance minister is unwise to criticize the auditor 
general.  The auditor general says the Prime Minister is breaking 
the government's own accounting rules.  This is the third time he 
has said it.  If the auditor general cannot trust the budget, how 
can the public or this House trust the budget? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here are the facts.  If the Prime Minister had followed 
acceptable accounting rules, there would have been a $2.5 billion 
surplus.  But the books were cooked to show no surplus, meaning 
less tax relief and debt reduction for Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is not the real reason the books were cooked so that there would 
be no surplus left for real tax relief or real debt reduction? 
<P><A NAME="LINK35"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I am very proud that because of the good management of 
this government and the Minister of Finance, we were able to take 
$2.5 billion and put it aside to make sure that the millennium 
project will mean scholarships for 100,000 Canadians over 10 
years. 
<P><A NAME="LINK36"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, this explanation does not wash with the auditor general. 
When the number one watchdog for the budget starts to bark, this 
House had better listen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The auditor general said he cannot approve the federal budget 
without a major disclaimer.  He says the government is guilty of 
“serious breaches” of accounting rules.  This is a very serious 
charge and it demands an explanation from the Prime Minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Were the books cooked to hide the surplus from tax weary 
Canadians?  Is that not the real reason? 
<P><A NAME="LINK37"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, this is the first time in my public life that I have 
been accused of telling everything ahead of time, and telling too 
much of the truth by telling the people that we are putting $2.5 
billion aside in a special account to give to a special group 
100,000 scholarships a year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will accept the blame that I am too open with the Canadian 
public, but I think it was the right thing to do under the 
circumstances.

Canada's chief accountant, the auditor general, says the finance 
minister is cooking the books.  That is a fact.  This is so 
serious that the auditor general is now saying that he is very 
reluctant to sign off on these books, an action which he says 
“waves a red flag that the government is misrepresenting or 
distorting its financial position”.

own political agenda is more important than the integrity of the

Canadians may have to wait up to two more years.  That is not 
good enough, not for the sick, not for family caregivers and not 
for health care providers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Will the health minister accelerate the introduction of

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
the government has said that it will work with provincial 
partners toward the creation of a national approach to home and 
community care to fill the gaps that are now evident in the 
health care system, to meet unmet needs and to ensure Canadians 
wherever they may live in the country can rely on a standard of 
care at any point in their lives which is equivalent to the 
principles we hold dear. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Four hundred Canadians from across the country met in Halifax 
this week.  The meeting just ended yesterday.  From that meeting 
it became clear that in the months ahead we must work to prepare 
this plan so that we get it right.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, earlier 
this week the minister acknowledged that inadequate home care was 
causing health care crises across the country each and every day. 
He avoided mention of the $3.5 billion that his government hacked 
out of health care and the pain and suffering it is causing 
Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Will the minister sit down with the provinces and health care 
partners to work co-operatively?  Will he accept the conference 
recommendation to begin significant funding and set standards for 
home care no later than 1999, no later than next year's budget? 
<P><A NAME="LINK55"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
the process of collaboration, of forming partnerships with 
provincial governments and others, has already begun.  We have 
already begun to identify specific concrete steps that can be 
taken to move on the principles I have described. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The answer is not as the NDP would have us do, simply to throw 
dollars at the issue.  The answer surely is to come to understand 
where the effort is needed most and to work with partners to 
prepare the proper response.  That is exactly what the government 
is committed to do.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bernard Patry (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of

I rise to address the House on Bill C-8, the Canada-Yukon Oil and 
Gas Accord Implementation Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am pleased to join my colleagues in support of this 
legislation which promotes the historic changes that are 
occurring in Yukon. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Hon. members have heard how Bill C-8 will provide for the 
transfer of the administration and control of onshore oil and gas 
from Canada to the Yukon government.  It will also give the 
territorial government the authority to legislate all aspects of 
oil and gas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Passage of this proposed act is a necessary and logical step in 
the Yukon's political evolution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For too long Ottawa has been making decisions for Whitehorse and 
for Yukoners.  The time has come to turn control over to those 
who live in Yukon so that they may deal with the issues on a 
daily basis.  That is why the devolution of all remaining 
provincial-type powers and programs of the Department of Indian 
Affairs and Northern Development in Yukon to the Yukon government 
continues to be a priority for this government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada and Yukon have worked together for more than a decade to 
respond to northerners' desire for more control over their lives. 
The process of placing responsibility where it belongs, at the 
local level, is well under way.  We are providing the platform 
for northerners to find solutions to northern concerns. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For several years now, Yukon has drawn certain advantages from 
the transfer of responsibilities.  At the present time, it delivers 
provincial-type programs in such areas as education, health and 
economic development. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government, however, still administers Crown 
lands, forestry, water, environmental issues, mines and minerals, 
and of course oil and gas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This current undertaking to transfer oil and gas jurisdiction 
shows the government's constant determination to give 
provincial-type jurisdictions to the territories.  The 
administration and control of oil and gas resources constitute 
significant and obvious provincial-type functions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I cannot overemphasize the importance of transferring this 
role to the people of the Yukon.  Natural resources lie at the very 
heart of the Yukon economy. Natural resource development is 
essential to the territory's prosperity in the 21st century, as 
well as to its residents' survival. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The present government is agreeable to Yukon administration 
and control of oil and gas resources.  Transfer of this program 
represents an important step in the political and economic 
evolution of Yukon. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Subsequently, of course, there will have to be a transfer to 
the Yukon government of other provincial-type powers and programs 
on its territory. 
To that end, in January 1997 the federal government announced a 
proposal for making such transfers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will give a brief explanation of what the transfer of 
responsibilities for oil and gas means to the Yukon and its 
economy. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For too long Yukon has had to watch its oil and gas resources go 
untapped because of uncertainty over land and resource ownership. 
That is changing.  Our ongoing negotiations with Yukon First 
Nations and efforts to finalize the remaining land claims in the 
near future will soon set the stage for a renewal of oil and gas 
activities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The move to transfer onshore oil and gas resources to Yukon will 
strengthen northern independence and provide stable, predictable 
revenue to the territorial government and Yukon First Nations who 
have signed land claims agreements. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Once Canada transfers responsibility, it will no longer be 
directly involved in managing oil and gas resources in Yukon. 
Canada will, however, maintain jurisdiction over offshore areas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With the transfer the federal government will pay Yukon the 
moneys it has collected in onshore petroleum revenues.

<A HREF="#LINKT18"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Once the transfer is complete, Yukon will collect the annual 
revenues from the Kotaneelee project which are valued at 
approximately $1.5 million per year.  These revenues will be 
shared with the six Yukon First Nations that have land claims 
agreements in effect. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Yukon will enact new territorial legislation that will allow 
it to address exploration, development, conservation and 
environmental and safety issues.  This new territorial 
legislation will provide for a management and regulatory regime 
that is generally modelled after existing regimes in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-8 would allow the governor in council to transfer the 
legislative powers to Yukon once the territorial legislation is 
in place. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill before us today and the transfer process have the 
wholehearted support of the Yukon government. Setting the pace of the 
transfer, the territorial government said the time had now come for it 
to take control of its own oil and gas resources. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Yukon First Nations also support the bill. Once passed, it will 
provide them stable and predictable revenues, as well as signed land 
claims agreements, which will help them move toward self-sufficiency and 
financial independence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to congratulate representatives of the Yukon First 
Nations and the Yukon government who have been working together to 
develop a system to jointly manage oil and gas resources in the Yukon. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a historical alliance which bodes well for the development 
of the Yukon and further transfers of powers to the territory. This 
close co-operation has become even closer as a result of consultations 
held by the federal government and the Yukon over the past few years, 
which led to the transfer of responsibilities for oil and gas resources 
as proposed in the bill before us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill has also the support of the industry. Bill C-8 will help 
create a stable and predictable environment, which in turn will attract 
new ventures and open up new opportunities to the area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Passage of the bill will send a clear signal to Yukoners that 
Canada is committed to fostering economic development in their 
territory. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, I would like to mention that all those involved in 
the work of the Standing Committee on Aboriginal Affairs and Northern 
Development support this bill and approved its decision to send it back 
to the House without amendments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In view of the widespread support for this major initiative, I urge 
my distinguished colleagues to join me in supporting this bill.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. David Chatters (Athabasca, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased at long last to rise and speak to Bill C-8, the 
Canada-Yukon oil and gas accord implementation act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill has been around for a long time.  It was allowed to 
die at the end of the last Parliament only to return in this 
Parliament to be bounced on and off the Order Paper again 
and again.  I can only assume that the hesitancy of the 
government to deal with this bill has something to do with the 
dismal progress being made in finalizing the Yukon land claims 
that are before the government and that in fact were passed in 
the last Parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Generally, I and my party support this bill and the principles 
involved simply because all the stakeholders involved in this 
process generally support the bill.  The principles of the bill 
are to be applauded.  However we certainly do have some concerns 
with this bill, as we do with so many other bills that the 
government introduces and deals with in this House.  The bill 
goes part way toward achieving its objectives but unfortunately 
not all the way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill reflects the government's recognition of the important 
role of northern oil and gas exploration in the political 
evolution of the Yukon Territory.  Canada's territories are the 
site of one-quarter of Canada's remaining discovered petroleum 
and half of Canada's estimated potential oil and gas resources. 
Control over oil and gas exploration and development is the key 
to the economic well-being of the territories.

is in fact in accordance with many of Reform's positions on 
issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First of all the bill calls for the devolution of province-like 
powers to the Yukon Territory.  By transferring administrative 
and legislative control over oil and gas to the Yukon Territory, 
the federal government is demonstrating some degree of commitment 
to the Yukon Territory's political evolution. We support any 
effort that increases provincial or territorial control and 
decreases federal control over natural resources, including oil 
and gas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, this bill concurs with Reform's belief in the equality 
of all provinces.  While Reform supports increased power for the 
Yukon government, the powers held by the territory should not 
exceed those held by the provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill does not transfer any powers greater than those held 
by the provinces under sections 92, 92(a) and 95 of the 
Constitution Act, 1867.  As has been reiterated, this equality 
among provinces is absolutely essential to the equal treatment of 
all Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While Reform is supportive of this legislation, certain aspects 
of the legislation raise important questions.  It appears that 
through the devolution of province-like powers, the federal 
government intends to move the Yukon Territory toward provincial 
status.  If this is true, it is important that the federal 
government start treating the territory as a province. This means 
that like other provinces the Yukon government should have some 
negotiating power in the settlement of aboriginal land claims. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Instead of giving the Yukon government the opportunity to 
participate in the negotiating process however, the government is 
retaining the authority to override any territorial government 
objections to the way in which land claims are settled.  The 
federal government is doing this by retaining the right to take 
back control of Yukon lands for the settlement and implementation 
of land claims. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In recognition of the unique situation in the north, I would 
agree it is important that this legislation respect aboriginal 
land claims and settlement rights.  It is also important that the 
legislation not diminish aboriginal treaty rights nor conflict 
with existing wildlife, environmental and land management 
legislation under section 35 of the Constitution Act, 1982. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The issue here is not so much the protection of aboriginal 
rights as it is an issue of heavy-handed control by the federal 
government.  If the government were to settle a land claim in any 
one of the 10 provinces, one can be certain that a provincial 
government would be very active in the negotiating process.  Why 
then would the government withhold that same negotiating power 
from the Yukon government? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While the federal government protects the interests of First 
Nations peoples in the Yukon, the territorial government should 
have the opportunity to protect the interests of all residents of 
the Yukon Territory, native and non-native alike. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This provision also hinders future oil and gas exploration 
development. Oil and gas companies may be slow to invest in 
exploration and development projects that at a later date may be 
affected by the settlement and implementation of land claims. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It had previously been anticipated that negotiations for all of 
the Yukon First Nations would have concluded by February 1997. 
This anticipated date was then extended to July 1997.  As of 
today, only half of the Yukon First Nations have reached 
agreements while the remaining seven agreements are still being 
negotiated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In order to instil confidence in potential investors, the 
government must develop and adhere to a strict time line for land 
claim resolution.  I would therefore urge the government to 
resolve these land claims as expeditiously as possible with the 
full participation of the Yukon government so that potential 
investors can confidently proceed with oil and gas development in 
the Yukon Territory. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are also concerns regarding the government's retention of 
the right to take measures in the event of a sudden oil supply 
shortfall.  This would be in compliance with Canada's 
international obligations as outlined in the International Energy 
Agency oil sharing agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The same international obligations were responsible for the 
introduction and implementation of the national energy program. 
Westerners need not be reminded of the disastrous impact the 
national energy program had on Alberta's economy during the last 
so-called energy crisis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Because of the very nature of the north, the Yukon economy is 
extremely dependent on oil and gas revenues.  It will therefore 
suffer even greater hardship should the federal government deem 
it necessary to implement controls like those espoused during the 
last energy crisis. 
There must be some commitment by the government to consider the 
impact of its actions on the Yukon economy and on the social and 
economic well-being of the Yukon peoples in the event of an oil 
supply shortfall or energy crisis.

<A HREF="#LINKT20"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The legislation affecting the Yukon in this respect should set 
the precedent for other provinces, resulting in amendments to the 
existing legislation that would protect all provinces from 
economic disasters like that brought upon Alberta by the national 
energy program.  If the political evolution of the Yukon 
territory is to proceed, the federal government must commit to 
consultations with the Yukon government to find a co-operative 
solution to any energy shortfall. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The most positive aspect of this legislation is the economic 
power it confers upon the Yukon Territory.  Not only will the 
Yukon government have jurisdiction over exploration, development, 
conservation and management of oil and gas, but over resource 
revenues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This legislation allows the territory to raise revenues by any 
mode or system of taxation in respect of oil and gas in the 
territory.  It also gives the territorial government control over 
the export of oil and gas from that territory.  This bill will 
reduce the Yukon Territory's economic dependence on the federal 
government, allowing it to develop its own economy like the 
Canadian provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, there are concerns regarding the sharing of resource 
revenues with the federal government.  The federal government 
still intends to collect a portion of the annual oil and gas 
revenues beyond an initial amount of $3 million to offset 
transfer payments to the territory which differs from the process 
of equalization in the provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Also, I might add that this same provision does not apply in the 
First Nations land claims settlements in the Yukon.  The First 
Nations collect all of the oil and gas resource revenue from oil 
and gas development within their territory. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government's share of the Yukon Territory's revenues after 
the initial $3 million could go as high as 80% of those revenues. 
I doubt that this level of revenue sharing would ever be 
tolerated by the existing provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Despite its shortcomings, this legislation represents an 
important first step in the political evolution of the north and 
has received support from all the concerned parties.  This 
legislation is part of a greater process that involves the 
devolution of control not only over oil and gas but over 
education, health care and economic development in the Yukon 
Territory. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This legislation has the potential to lead the Yukon government 
down the road of political evolution, but only if the federal 
government is committed to treating the Yukon as a developing 
province and not some second class political entity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For these reasons we support this legislation but with some 
reservations about the method of implementation.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Claude Bachand (Saint-Jean, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I am 
pleased to rise today at third reading of the bill to implement the 
agreement between the Government of Canada and the Government of 
the Yukon on oil and gas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the House will permit me, I want to digress a little to 
begin with.  The other day, I listened to a Reform member tell us 
that the Bloc Quebecois was concerned only about Quebec and that 
anything outside of it was of no interest at all to them.  I 
promised myself that I would respond to that allegation the next 
time I spoke.  Not only is the Bloc speaking today on the bill, but 
I wish to point out that I have in fact visited the Yukon on a 
number of occasions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important the Bloc assume some responsibility toward 
native nations outside Quebec as well.  As the trustee of the 
native peoples, the federal government can make decisions in 
British Columbia that affect Quebec.  I think we are acting 
responsibly by giving serious consideration to the type of 
legislation before us and by focussing on the priorities of the 
native peoples first and foremost. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have before us today a bill providing for decision making 
to be transferred from the central government to a territorial one, 
however within the Yukon Territory, there are 14 native nations. 
I think it important to look carefully at the native issue in bills 
such as this one. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1545"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT21"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today, at third reading, we are looking at a bill to implement 
provisions of the Canada-Yukon accord signed on May 28, 1993.  At 
that time, the government undertook to introduce a bill, which it 
first did in the last Parliament and which we are now going to 
enact in this one. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are, of course, talking about control of oil and gas 
resources.  The Yukon will be able to administer and control 
exploitation of oil and gas resources on its territory.  These are 
new legislative powers that are being given to the Yukon. They are 
similar to those that have been given to other provinces in their 
respective areas of jurisdiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It will therefore be up to the Government of Quebec—my 
colleagues mentioned jurisdictions earlier—and to the Yukon 
government to regulate and manage oil and gas activities.  When we 
talk about the exploitation of resources, we are talking about 
ordinary, concrete concepts, no surprises.  We are talking about 
gas and oil exploration, naturally, about about their marketing, 
production, and preservation as well, because we know that this is 
the kind of enterprise where vigilance is required with respect to 
the environment and the preservation of natural resources. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are the kinds of jurisdiction that have now devolved to 
the Yukon government:  the environment, exports, security and, of 
course, the establishment and collection of revenue. 
Whereas the federal government was the one to do so, now it is up 
to the Yukon government to set the tax base and collect revenue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Yukon government must enact legislation based on the 
legislation existing elsewhere in the country.  And, naturally, 
like the federal, the Yukon must not enact legislation that exceeds 
other provinces' jurisdictions.  In other words, we do not want it 
to have special status that goes beyond the jurisdictions and 
concessions made to other provinces with respect to the 
decentralization of oil and gas resources. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also think it important to tell people, as I do each time, 
where the Yukon is on the map.  Our viewers and those listening 
know that it is in the western part of the country.  In fact, it is 
5,000 kilometres from here. 
But I think it is also important to put it in the context of the native 
issue, which is very important in Western Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To the north of the Yukon is Alaska, which is an American state, as 
everyone knows. However, animals that are important to native hunting 
and fishing, the wildlife and the fish, do not necessarily respect 
borders. There are typical examples of that, with the Porcupine caribou 
herd, among others, whose calving grounds are in Alaska but whose 
migrations take it to the Northwest Territories and the Yukon. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore, it is important to know there is to the north an 
American state that does not belong to Canada. However, the wildlife 
roaming the continent does not necessarily respect borders. 
It must be remembered that natives attach great importance to this. This 
is why there are often agreements between countries on jurisdiction over 
wildlife, the environment and the caribou herd migration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To the east are the Northwest Territories. In fact, there is a bill 
that might be before us this afternoon and that will affect the 
Gwich'in, the Dene, the Metis, the Dogrib nations, and those from the 
Deh Cho regions. These are all Northwest Territories regions located in 
the Mackenzie Valley. It is rather interesting that we are talking this 
afternoon about the far west and that we will be dealing in a few 
minutes with their neighbours, for quite another reason, but let us say 
it is important to indicate where the Yukon is. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To the south lies British Columbia, with an extremely rich native 
culture, where almost 220 native communities live, with all the 
resulting problems and benefits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have been to British Columbia several times. It is nice to see 
how the native culture has influenced the white culture and how the 
different cultures interact.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There were also disadvantages. Federally and provincially, there 
are enormous problems with land claims. Everyone is aware of the debate 
on the Nisga'a issue and the recent Delgamuukw decision. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many decisions have been made by courts in that part of the 
country, and it seemed important to me to put them in perspective. 
Incidentally, representatives of the aboriginal peoples of the Yukon are 
probably listening in this afternoon and I take this opportunity to 
salute them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remember they were here when we passed the bill on 
self-government and claims settlement. These people fought long 
and hard and finally won after having negotiated for 21 years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remember very clearly that they were up there in the public 
gallery and they were very pleased. I think that the security service 
had made an exception and allowed the representatives of the aboriginal 
nations to stand up and applaud with us all this great victory regarding 
their land claims and self-government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to salute them and, for fear of missing one, I will 
name them all: there are 14 nations. The first nations of Little 
Salmon-Carmacks, Selkirk, Tr'on dek Hwech'in, the Ross River Dena 
Council, the Liards, the first nation of Carcross-Tagish, the 
aboriginal people of White River, the first nations of Kluane, 
Kwanlin Dun, Champagne and Aïshihik, the aboriginal people of 
Nacho Nyak Dun, the Tlingits from the Teslin area and the 
Gwitch'in Vuntut first nation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will not be surprised, when I go back to my office later, to 
get a call from <I>Hansard</I> editors asking me about the meaning 
and, particularly, the spelling of the names I just mentioned. I 
felt important to name these nations, and I will get back to them 
later on—perhaps much to the despair of those responsible for 
publishing the <I>Hansard</I>—when I will give you an idea of the 
progress made in the negotiations to achieve self-government for 
each of these nations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is very important in the current debate to know where these 
nations are in terms of their claims to achieve self-government status. 
They are looking at how oil and gas will be developed on their lands. 
They are directly concerned, because they will soon have agreements on 
their lands and their self-government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Yukon is a region of the country that has a rich history. 
Everyone knows about the Klondike gold rush. I went there several times, 
including Dawson City, and it is really sad to see how the landscape was 
almost totally destroyed by mining operations. This shows how important 
it is for aboriginal people to at least have a say in legislation such 
as the bill before us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That part of the country was also severely affected by the 
development of natural resources other than gold, lumber for instance. 
The landscape was destroyed and there was no sharing of wealth. This is 
why now, as we approach a new millennium, aboriginal people are getting 
together and truly want to play an active role in the decision-making 
process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the time, their landscape was totally changed, along with the 
lives of these people. Their hunting and fishing traditions were greatly 
affected. We only left them piles of rocks, we did not share any wealth 
with them. 
Explorers and companies came. They developed the landscape, but they 
also exploited the people, the first inhabitants of this place, the 
aboriginals. Then they left, leaving the landscape in a deplorable 
state, while taking all the resources with them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I met the people of these 14 aboriginal nations in Dawson City. I 
also met them in Whitehorse. These are not rich people. Like all 
Canadian and Quebec aboriginal communities, they have social and 
economic problems. This is why they are paying particular attention to 
the legislation before us today. 
Those who spoke before me said it: land claims and the sharing of 
natural resources are means to achieve full self-government, full 
financial autonomy, which is also very important for these people.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me remind the House of the social contract we had at the time. 
People were told: “We will take your resources, we will sign treaties 
and set up reserves on which we will exercise complete control and take 
our fiduciary responsibilities towards you. We will take care of 
you”. 
This is what happened with the results we all know about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>People often question this social contract. We often hear 
ill-informed people say that natives have everything they need, 
that the government sets aside $5 billion for them in its annual 
budget. These people say that natives get an average of around 
$15,000 to $16,000 per capita and wonder what they are 
complaining about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to realize that this is what the social contract agreed 
upon at the time is all about. We told them: “We will take over the 
land, develop the resources and we will see to your health, education 
and economic development”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Nowadays, it is important to keep on reminding people of that. What 
we handed the natives in the past and what we keep giving them are not 
gifts. It is part of the social contract we negotiated at the time. 
After seeing what natives have gone through, especially after reading 
the royal commission report, I am not sure they ended up on the winning 
side with this social contract. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I said earlier, through self-government, land claims settlement 
and a better sharing of the resources, natives will not only regain 
their pride but also an economy which is crucial to their sense of pride 
and which is lacking today, since they are confined in a state of 
dependency vis-à-vis the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to give you an overview of the progress in negotiations. I 
highlighted the negotiations carried out so far. Several communities 
have signed a deal. Some of them did it in 1994, others have been 
successful since then, but other native communities have yet to sign a 
self-government agreement or to settle their land claims. I think it is 
important to give the House an update. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Little Salmon-Carmacks and Selkirk first nations both signed 
self-government agreements on July 21. 
That is not long ago. These people may have been on the sidelines in 
1994, but they have now signed their own self government agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This agreement came into force on October 1, 1997. Thus, two more 
First Nations have managed to settle their self government and land 
claims problems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Tr'on dek Hwech'in First Nation of Dawson City concluded its 
negotiations on self government on May 24, 1997. The agreement is to be 
ratified early in 1998; it has not yet been done, but apparently, it 
should be done soon. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Negotiations on a final settlement on land claims and self 
government with the White River Nation were concluded just last week. 
This nation is the latest to be involved in self government and land 
claims negotiations. 
It is the last community that got such an agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Negotiations with the Dena council of Ross River are at a 
preliminary stage. Its territory straddles B.C. and the Yukon. Problems 
in negotiations have existed for a long time. The council recently 
tabled a 120% selection of lands. I imagine it is asking that much, but 
would be content with a little less. Apparently, the federal government 
expects that this selection will include numerous areas with a high 
mineral potential. This is in a mineral rich part of southern Yukon. 
That may be the reason why negotiations are taking a little longer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Negotiations with the Liard First Nation are currently under way; 
they deal with the selection of rural lands with a high oil, gas and 
forestry potential. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a case where negotiations on self government and land 
claims are moving ahead swiftly. But the First Nations are also closely 
following devolution of federal powers to the Yukon. This is a typical 
example of the special monitoring by a first nation that is closely 
related to decisions that will flow from the bill before us.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As for the Carcross-Tagish First Nation, meetings took place last 
fall. Negotiations are focusing on rural lands as well. Agreements have 
been signed on a number of claims. The First Nation should soon submit 
claims regarding specific sites. It was anticipated that negotiations 
with respect to self-government would be concluded right about now. The 
final agreement should be signed by March 1998. So we are getting near 
a final agreement in this case as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Kluane First Nation has submitted land claims. The final 
agreement, including land claims, is 62% complete, and the 
agreement with respect to self-government is 85% settled. So, 
once again, agreements are forthcoming. As I said, work is 62% 
complete on land claims and 85% complete on self-government. 
Therefore, we can assume that a final agreement will be reached 
in the coming months. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Negotiations with the Ta'an Kwach'an Council have, to all intents 
and purposes, been concluded. They cannot be finalized, however, until 
the problem of the band's separation from the Kwanlin Dun First Nation 
is resolved. This reserve has decided that it should be divided into two 
communities. Therefore, before going any further and concluding 
agreements with regard to self-government and land claims, we must 
resolve the problem of how this reserve will be divided. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As for the Kwanlin Dun First Nation, there have been no 
negotiations since June 1996, because last June the First Nation 
submitted a proposal that falls outside the frame of reference 
established under the final umbrella agreement. When the federal 
government started to negotiate, it set up a legislative and negotiation 
framework.  This particular community wants out. There are some 
adjustment problems so this could take a little longer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The aboriginal communities which have not yet signed agreements are 
the Champagne and Aishihik First Nations, the Nacho Nyak Dun First 
Nation, the Teslin Tlingit Council and the Gwitch'in Vuntut First 
Nation. We still have not reached final agreements with these groups. 
I felt it was important to give a progress report. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As my colleague pointed out, the Bloc Quebecois supports this bill 
because we are the only sovereignist party in this Chamber and we stand 
behind any decentralization initiative. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are rather opposed to centralization. When the government 
launches a campaign to encroach on a provincial jurisdiction, like 
education through the millennium fund, or when the Minister of Health 
tries to infiltrate home care, our party is against it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why are we not opposed to this bill? Precisely because it is about 
decentralization and we believe in decentralization. We believe in 
devolution to the provinces and territories, to smaller communities, for 
several reasons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The main one, in my opinion, is that devolution of these 
jurisdictions brings government closer to the people, who are then in a 
better position to exercise control and to adjust their demands to the 
real needs in the field. If decisions are made in Ottawa for Yukon, for 
the Gaspé region in Quebec, or for the Matapedia Valley—and I see here 
my colleague who is supporting me this afternoon—it is more difficult 
and we are quite opposed to that. We like to see the devolution of 
powers to the regions and the provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the government insists on encroaching on some areas of 
jurisdiction, it should at least respect the provinces by transferring 
tax points or funds to those not wishing to participate. 
We believe that this money would be better used if jurisdiction was 
transferred together with the corresponding tax points or compensation, 
should a province or region not wish to participate in the program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The political scene in the Yukon has also changed. The last time I 
was there, there was no NDP government in power as is now the 
case. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1605"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT25"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The NDP is not the same political party as the Bloc Quebecois, and 
I know its members are not necessarily sovereignists. However, if I look 
at the political spectrum between the left and the right, I think there 
is a good balance in the House. Like the NDP, we lean toward the left; 
our fundamental values include assistance to communities, immigrants and 
aboriginals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why we consider these issues with special care and 
sensitivity, unlike the present right wing in this House, where the 
Reform Party and the Progressive Conservative Party are often much more 
conservative on such matters and pay much more attention to economic 
interests than to the interests of aboriginal people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So the election of a new NDP government in the Yukon is important 
for aboriginal people, because they will be able to make sure—and they 
have already received assurances from the Yukon NDP government to that 
effect—that the government will not take advantage of the fact that 
self-government and land claims agreements have yet to be reached in 
some territories, for example by issuing development licenses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I felt it was an important issue to raise, and it is reassuring not 
only for us but also for the native communities, since they mentioned it 
to us, and if they took the trouble to mention it, it must be true, 
because they might have experienced a little more difficulty with the 
previous Yukon government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We expressed some reservations at the second reading stage about 
the granting of development licences in lands claimed by the First 
Nations. We were not comfortable with the idea that Yukon might be 
allowed to legislate on the whole issue of oil and gas development, 
including, as I mentioned earlier, conservation, development, export and 
revenues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We were reluctant because we feared the government might take 
advantage of the nations that had not yet reached a settlement by 
issuing development licenses even before negotiations on land claims 
were concluded. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This issue has been partly settled. Department officials appeared 
before the Standing Committee on Aboriginal Affairs and Northern 
Development before second reading, at the report stage. We finally 
reached an agreement on some issues, and department officials made 
certain amendments to the bill which satisfied not only the Bloc but 
also the First Nations. Clause 6 in particular restricts the granting of 
oil and gas interests on certain types of lands, including those under 
negotiation. So the bill contains a provision that deals with our 
concerns. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As for clause 8, it allows the Governor in Council, on the 
recommendation of the Minister of Indian Affairs, to take back the 
administration and control of any oil and gas in public lands so that 
negotiation or implementation of land claims agreements can continue 
with the native people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is one clause. As a fiduciary, the federal government can tell 
the Yukon government that, under section 8, it is issuing development 
licences on lands claimed by the First Nations without their agreement. 
So, as fiduciaries, we included a provision in the bill to take back 
this jurisdiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We in committee fulfilled our mandate. We asked for adjustments and 
these adjustments were made. Public officials came and explained the 
impact of the clauses to our satisfaction. And, when consulted, 
aboriginal people said they too were satisfied. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, as my colleagues mentioned, who supports this bill? 
The territorial government, naturally, most community groups and 
organizations in Yukon, as well as the Council for Yukon First Nations, 
since the 14 nations I mentioned earlier are grouped under a council 
that supports the bill, as long as the aboriginal and land claims remain 
valid. I spoke at length about this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since the First Nations consider that clauses 6 and 8 satisfy their 
concerns, we support decentralization, the importance of which I 
explained earlier. It must be done in a thoughtful and orderly manner in 
the interest of the whole population, including of course native people, 
who form the majority in these territories.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Louise Hardy (Yukon, NDP):</B>  Madam Speaker, I am 
particularly pleased to rise and support Bill C-8, especially 
this year as it is quite symbolic.  It is the 100th anniversary 
of the creation of Yukon, which was in 1898.  Yukon was 
originally designated as a postal region.  After the gold rush we 
were worthy enough to become a territory. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This legislation does what it ought to do.  After a hundred 
years it is the beginning of putting power back in the hands of 
the people who live there.  It puts power where it belongs, with 
the people of Yukon. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This act will implement an accord between the Government of 
Canada and the Yukon Territory relating the administration, 
control and legislative jurisdiction in respect of oil and gas. 
It is an important act for the people of Yukon as it will 
transfer to Yukon additional legislative powers necessary to 
undertake, through Yukon legislation, all aspects of the 
management and administration of onshore oil and gas resources. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This legislation will give the Yukon government province like 
authority to regulate and manage Yukon gas and oil resources in 
the public's interest.  For those who live in provinces that have 
provincial powers, the term might not have the same affect on 
you.  But coming from Yukon where we are always winding our way 
through a maze of asking permission to do this or that, this is 
really significant.  It is a huge difference in how we will 
function as a people and as a legislature. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The devolution of province like powers will not affect any 
settlement of an aboriginal land claim because the federal 
government will retain the capacity of regaining the authority 
transferred to the Yukon government if it is necessary to settle 
an aboriginal land claim.  This is also important because of the 
14 first nations, all of them are not settled.  Although it is 
very close, it is not done yet. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-8 is necessary legislation to transfer authority for oil 
and gas resources to the Yukon government.  It is a significant 
event because it confirms Canada's commitment, as set out in the 
northern oil and gas accord signed in May 1993.  It must be 
viewed as a commitment from Canada to the political evolution of 
Yukon and to the concept of devolution to Yukon and it should be 
linked to an orderly transition of the transfers of other 
remaining resources like forestry and mining.  We await eagerly 
to see how this works out so that we can bring down the power 
over forestry and mining to us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The composition of the government in power in Yukon is six 
people in the cabinet, two ministers are First Nations and our 
Speaker is a First Nation.  The composition of our territory is 
reflected in the government.  As well, first nations people have 
a very strong representation on the council for Yukon first 
nations. 
All of the 14 do not belong but most of them do.  They are a very 
integral part of everyday life.  Never are our first nations an 
afterthought.  They are represented in all our levels of 
government.

<A HREF="#LINKT27"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We expect that the federal government will complete the 
devolution of all remaining provincial-like powers and programs 
to the Yukon government.  That will make the people of Yukon far 
more responsible for their own well-being. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Devolution is a transfer process through which the federal 
government will transfer all the northern affairs programs of the 
Department of Indian and Northern Affairs to the Yukon 
government.  In effect this will end a century of colonialism in 
Yukon. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I said, in 1898 a separate territory was created.  It had a 
commissioner who was all powerful.  In 1948 the territory 
suspended its right to income tax collection in exchange for the 
annual transfer of federal funds.  In 1979 the federal government 
effectively signed over decision making powers to elected 
territorial representatives.  Again, this was a huge change 
because the commissioner was always appointed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1993 the umbrella final agreement for first nations 
self-government was signed.  On May 28, 1993 the federal 
government and the Government of the Yukon Territory entered into 
the Canada-Yukon oil and gas accord.  That is what is in front of 
us to be ratified. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Devolution is an issue of fundamental importance for Yukon 
people.  It will signal the end of a quasi-colonial attitude 
toward the north and the beginning of a process to gain greater 
economic self-reliance.  It will reinforce participatory 
democracy because it will give northerners a meaningful 
democratic say in the development of their own region.  It is an 
essential part of aboriginal self-determination. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With the continuing settlement of Yukon land claims and 
self-government agreements, Yukoners on the basis of a 
relationship based on partnerships can look to the future as 
citizens of Canada and not possessions of the crown. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Devolution is good governance for Yukon, but it will create new 
employment and economic opportunities, which are desperately 
needed in the north, and will increase respect for the 
environment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Federal and territorial legislation dealing with the transfer of 
province-like powers to Yukon and the development of a Yukon oil 
and gas act and regulations is demonstration of a successfully 
working relationship with first nations and the beginning of a 
new era of relationships between the people of Yukon and the 
central government of our confederation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Devolution opens new opportunities of economic development for 
Yukoners.  After the completion of transfers, Yukon through its 
own legislation will manage and regulate oil and gas activities 
including exploration, development, production and conservation, 
environmental and safety regulations, and the determination and 
collection of resource revenues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Yukon Act is being amended to transfer to northerners new 
responsibilities and new legislative powers in relation to the 
exploration of oil and gas; the development, conservative and 
management of oil and gas, including the rate of primary 
production; oil and gas pipelines; the raising of money in 
respect of oil and gas in the territories; and the export of oil 
and gas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The amendments will include provisions to allow the federal 
government to continue to exercise its other responsibilities, 
including taking back administration and control of oil and gas 
on any lands in order to settle or implement aboriginal land 
claims. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is fully consistent with legislation implementing aboriginal 
treaty rights under section 35 of the Constitution Act, 1982, 
including legislation establishing wildlife land management and 
and environmental regimes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, the Yukon government has actively involved the 
Yukon first nations in the process, including the development of 
the Yukon oil and gas legislation and management process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The working relationship and close co-operation of the three 
parties, the federal government, the Yukon government and the 
Yukon first nations government, have been very successful.  The 
three parties are now committed to completing the remaining land 
claims and self-government agreements hopefully by the fall of 
1998. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Devolution is about partnerships and the assumption of new 
responsibilities and obligations.  The Yukon government and the 
first nations government established a working partnership on 
devolution and signed a number of accords. In addition, they have 
made arrangements concerning their working relationship during 
the implementation of specific devolution or transfers, 
particularly an arrangement concerning the transfer of oil and 
gas responsibilities.

<A HREF="#LINKT28"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It will give the Yukon government, a local government with 
locally elected representatives and locally accountable 
officials, effective control over land and resource management. 
The territorial government will be in a better position to 
integrate decisions over resources and will be able to serve more 
effectively the people of Yukon. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With this transfer of federal resources to the territorial 
government, financial capital and human resources must at that 
level guarantee the provision of adequate services and levels of 
funding.  There must be assurances that the resources transferred 
are enough to provide for the delivery of the mandated 
responsibilities of the transferred programs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We expect that the federal government will not withdraw any 
funding from the programs considered for transfer to the 
territorial government.  It is not in effect a hollow shell 
handed over to us with all of the responsibility but not the 
power we need to deal with it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This negotiated agreement is an historical agreement for the 
Yukon territory, the Yukon government, first nations of the Yukon 
and everyone who lives in Yukon.  It fully protects the interests 
of first nations and we are confident it is in compliance with 
land claims and self-government agreements. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This agreement bodes well for the future of Yukon.  In the 
continuing spirit of co-operation among the federal, territorial 
and first nations governments, I urge the House to proceed 
quickly with the bill.  It is long awaited and will be much 
celebrated in this year of our hundredth anniversary. 
<P><A NAME="LINK198"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. David Chatters (Athabasca, Ref.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I 
would like to pose a question to the previous speaker, 
particularly because she is the member for Yukon. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I listened carefully to her speech and did not hear any 
reference to a number of issues I raised in my speech.  Would the 
member indicate her response on behalf of Yukoners to the cap on 
resource revenue?  The Yukon is being capped at $3 million. 
Anything above that, up to 80%, will be going back to the federal 
government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another provision I also raised was that the federal government 
retains the power to unilaterally take back control of oil and 
gas under certain circumstances. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wonder if the member would respond to those two issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Louise Hardy:</B>  Madam Speaker, on it being capped at $3 
million, I would rather that had not happened and there were no 
cap.  However that was the way it was negotiated, I think in part 
because a territory is in a very difficult negotiating position 
and has to make the best of going from a difficult position to a 
better position.  This agreement was arrived at by the parties 
involved. I would prefer that there was no cap but there is and 
we will live with it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On having the power taken away, again that is part of being a 
territory.  I do not think anyone living in a province would 
accept that power can be given and power can be taken away.  That 
is how life has been in the territories.  As I understand it, 
under the circumstances of making sure land claims are settled 
that is important. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All first nations groups should know that they can negotiate 
without pressure their agreements.  After that point I would 
prefer if the federal government had nothing to do with giving or 
taking away power.  Eventually Yukon will be recognized as a 
province and will not have to face this kind of withholding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. David Chatters:</B>  Madam Speaker, I am surprised at the 
member's response when she says that eventually the Yukon 
territory will become a province.  I support that idea 
wholeheartedly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, under the terms and conditions of the bill and the 
direction it is headed, Yukon will forevermore be some kind of 
second class province.  It will not have the jurisdiction or the 
power of other provinces.  I am amazed the member representing 
Yukon who sits in opposition to the government does not seem to 
raise that issue or does not seem to be concerned about it.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I would have expected, both being a member for Yukon and being 
in opposition, that she would have demanded of the government 
that the bill allow Yukon to become a province with the same kind 
of status as Alberta, British Columbia, Saskatchewan and all 
other provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Louise Hardy:</B>  Madam Speaker, when Yukon becomes a 
province all of this would be renegotiated.  It is for the people 
of Yukon to decide when they want to take on provincehood. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It cannot be forced on anybody.  Perhaps at this point we are 
not ready or prepared to do that, but we are to build toward that 
position. 
<P><A NAME="LINK199"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gerald Keddy (South Shore, PC):</B>  Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to speak on Bill C-8, the Canada-Yukon Oil and Gas Accord 
Implementation Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill represents the first bill I have had the opportunity to 
work on both at the parliamentary level and the committee level 
in the Indian affairs and northern development portfolio. I feel 
it represents a step in the right direction.  It is not perfect 
but it is a step in the right direction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill transfers authority to the Yukon territorial government 
regarding exploration, development, conservation and management 
of onshore oil and gas resources, oil and gas pipelines, the 
raising of money in respect of oil and gas in the territory and 
the export of oil and gas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the same time the bill allows the federal government to 
regain control and administration of oil and gas on Yukon lands 
in order to settle or implement land claims for aboriginal 
groups. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill was formerly known as Bill C-50 but died on the order 
paper with the call for the election in April 1997.  It 
incorporates some changes to the original Bill C-50 in order to 
address concerns raised by aboriginal groups, specifically the 
effect of the bill on their land claims agreements and 
self-government.  I will speak in more detail on this matter 
later. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-8 is the implementation process for the Canada-Yukon oil 
and gas accord.  The accord was the product of a process begun in 
1987 under the minister at that time, William Hunter McKnight. It 
was a beginning of a process to devolve responsibility from the 
federal government to the government of Yukon with the intention 
of conferring powers analogous to those held by provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Currently all oil and gas management authority in Yukon is 
controlled by the Department of Indian Affairs and Northern 
Development in its energy policy area for the territories. With 
Bill C-8 control over oil and gas passes to the Yukon government 
with the application for onshore resources and an area adjacent 
to the northern coast, including Shoalwater Bay and Philips Bay. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The area referred to as the north slope was of special concern 
to the aboriginal peoples, and in particular the Inuvialuit 
Regional Council.  The council representing the signatories to 
the Inuvialuit final agreement in the Northwest Territories 
expresses reservations about the extent of protection for this 
area in the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Shoalwater Bay is an area of significant importance to the 
Inuvialuit for the harvesting of beluga whales.  As such it 
wanted reassurance from the federal government that this area 
should be protected from development so the traditional hunt 
would not be jeopardized. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Inuvialuit was assured by the Department of Indian Affairs 
and Northern Development that the area would be protected with 
part of the area being a national park.  This is explicitly 
removed from the development in Bill C-8. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the same time the federal government informed the Inuvialuit 
that Shoalwater Bay would not be developed but did not include 
this area specifically in the legislation.  Instead it is 
protected by implicit understanding outside the bill.  It will be 
imperative for the federal government to honour this commitment 
to the Inuvialuit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of the 14 aboriginal groups in the Yukon area eight have yet to 
settle land claim agreements with the federal government but are 
presently involved in negotiations.  This was another area of 
concern for first nations, specifically how the bill would affect 
land claim negotiations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These concerns were expressed during consultation with Yukon 
first nations, especially the eight bands who are signatories to 
the Inuvialuit final agreement but have not yet settled land 
claims.

<A HREF="#LINKT30"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>To alleviate uncertainty clause 8 was added to the legislation 
allowing for the administration and control of oil and gas to 
revert to the governor in council for the settlement of land 
claims.  With this addition, the rights of aboriginal groups are 
preserved while ensuring that future land claims will be resolved 
and implemented properly.  Nothing in the legislation is to 
abrogate or derogate existing aboriginal and treaty rights.  This 
is to protect aboriginal rights under section 35 of the 
Constitution Act, 1982. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While the transfer of authority is to the Yukon government, the 
federal government will disperse an amount equivalent to revenues 
from all onshore resources since April 1, 1993.  With the oil and 
gas revenues in Yukon currently valued at $2 million, this 
represents a significant amount of money that would be accruing 
to the territorial government. Following the transfer, onshore 
resources will be collected by the Yukon government with offshore 
resource revenues divided according to a formula for revenue 
sharing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under the royalty sharing formula Yukon first nations will 
receive 50% of the first $2 million collected by Yukon. For any 
amounts greater than $2 million the reparation falls to 10%.  The 
average per capita amount received by the first nations cannot 
exceed the average Canadian per capita income. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a bill the Progressive Conservatives started and we 
continue to support it.  The one weakness or complaint that 
should be raised in this House is the inadequate job the 
Department of Indian Affairs and Northern Development did in 
involving public participation in this process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I visited Whitehorse after this bill had received first 
reading in the House and after we had already had a video 
conference with Yukon region representatives, I met with many 
groups who would have appeared before the committee but were not 
given an opportunity by the present government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With that said I will still support this bill because in the end 
it helps Yukon. It recognizes aboriginal rights and moves the 
Yukon government closer to self-sufficiency and hopefully one day 
to provincial status.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Derrek Konrad (Prince Albert, Ref.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I 
am honoured to speak to this bill which is an important piece of 
legislation particularly to the development of the Yukon 
Territory and its people.  It is also a pleasure to have a piece 
of legislation before the House that we can support and not have 
to amend greatly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will explain why the Reform Party is supporting this bill and 
the few flaws we see with it.  Although we support the general 
direction of this bill, it remains far from what really needs to 
be done in the territories. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we know, northern Canada and Yukon are areas of our land 
where there is high unemployment and poverty which is a big 
problem not only there but to Canada as a whole.  For these 
regions control over oil and gas exploration is the key to 
economic well-being.  Therefore Bill C-8 is important for the 
economic future of the Yukon Territory. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-8 gives the Yukon Territory administrative and 
legislative control over oil and gas in the Yukon Territory.  In 
other words, this is a devolution of powers from the federal 
government to the Yukon government, and that is a good thing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform Party believes those powers are best exercised in the 
hands of the government nearest to the people instead of in the 
hands of some bureaucrats in Ottawa who are far removed from the 
consequences of the decisions they make.

<A HREF="#LINKT31"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can generally say that the Reform Party believes that any 
move toward devolution of powers from the federal government to 
the provinces or territories is a positive development. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are opposed to big, heavy bureaucratic central government and 
would eventually like to see the territories as full participants 
in Confederation with province like status. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform Party also believes that the territories should have 
the same powers as the provinces and that all provinces should 
have equal powers with no special status for any. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We all know this is clearly not the case at this time, but we 
are committed to this important and fundamental principle of 
equality. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore on the grounds of devolution of power which brings the 
government closer to the people and moving toward giving Yukon 
the right to achieve full province status, we are supporting this 
bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also support Bill C-8 because it has the support of the 
people of Yukon.  Consultation on the bill was done and Yukoners 
stated they wanted control of their oil and gas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Because of those consultations and the universal support for 
devolution of powers expressed we are in support.  The people of 
the Yukon Territory have made an important step forward in the 
development into a province with this bill.  The Reform Party 
supports them in this effort. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While we are supportive of this legislation, there are a few 
provisions in the bill that we remain concerned with.  First of 
all, in this bill the government has the right to take back 
administrative and legislative powers that it gives to Yukon in 
the event of a national emergency or in the case of an aboriginal 
land claim settlement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This House hardly needs to be reminded of what occurred in the 
west the last time there was a so-called national emergency with 
respect to natural gas and petroleum.  We had the national energy 
program and the petroleum gas and revenue tax. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These types of things should not happen again in this country 
where one part of the country is expected to subsidize the rest 
of the nation over some situation like that.  That seems somewhat 
counterproductive.  Needless to say, it seems really 
counterproductive to have that in there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are still many first nations in Yukon that have not 
settled their land claim agreements yet, even though the 
government has been promising rapid conclusion of these land 
claims for years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>An investor planning to set up shop in Yukon knows that from one 
day to the next they could suffer a loss because this federal 
government might have to settle a land claim or take back 
resources, or that type of thing. How anxious would they be to 
make an investment there?  I doubt whether they would be willing 
to put very much money in, certainly not the millions of dollars 
it takes to begin oil and gas exploration.  They want guarantees 
of stability when they make investments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to take this opportunity to urge the government to 
resolve land claims as quickly as possible and to obtain the full 
and meaningful participation by the Yukon government.  Do not 
exclude it. Get this done with so that there will be stability in 
Yukon. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In recognition of the unique situation in the north, I agree 
that it is important that this legislation respect aboriginal 
land claims and settlement rights.  It is also important that the 
legislation does not diminish aboriginal treaty rights or 
conflict with existing wildlife, environmental and land 
management legislation under the Constitution Act, 1982. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The issue, however, is not so much the protection of aboriginal 
rights as it is an issue of heavy handed control by the federal 
government.  If the government were to settle a land claim in any 
of the 10 provinces, the provincial government would certainly 
take an active role in the negotiating process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the government is committed to giving Yukon province like 
powers, as it seems to be attempting in this bill, it should also 
give the territory the same negotiating powers in the settlement 
of aboriginal land claims as the provinces have. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why would the government withhold the same negotiating power 
from the Yukon government?  It is a question to be considered by 
the government and by all members of this House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While the federal government protects the interests of 
aboriginal people in Yukon, the territorial government would have 
the opportunity to protect the interests of all residents in the 
Yukon Territory, regardless of whether they were native or 
non-native. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On that note I would like to reiterate the Reform Party's 
commitment to equality.  In order for Canada to function as a 
nation, the territories should have similar powers to the 
provinces and the provinces should have access to powers 
available to all others. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This Liberal government should be decreasing federal powers not 
only over Yukon oil and gas but also in other areas to work 
toward empowering territories.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bernard Patry (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of

Speaker, I rise to address the House on third and final reading 
on Bill C-6, the Mackenzie Valley resource management act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to say again how pleased I am to be sponsoring this 
proposed legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-6 will have important ramifications for the people and 
the environment of the Mackenzie Valley and I am delighted to 
have played a role in bringing it before the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am also delighted that we have finally come to this point in 
the legislative process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although Bill C-6 was tabled in the House only a month ago, this 
legislation has been five years in the making.  It previously 
died on the order paper as Bill C-80 when the election was 
called. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It has been the subject of one of the most extensive 
consultation processes I have ever witnessed in government, with 
35 drafts of the bill developed and distributed for comments and 
review. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>An information package on the proposed resource management 
regime was widely distributed across the Mackenzie Valley. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Federal officials have held literally dozens of meetings with 
aboriginal leaders, the territorial government, the resource 
industries and the public. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a result of this exhaustive process we have before us today a 
better bill.  This is a lengthy, complex and technical piece of 
legislation but it is also a solid bill that will withstand the 
test of time.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to take a few minutes to acknowledge the many 
groups and individuals who have contributed to Bill C-6 which, as 
hon. members know, will establish an integrated resource 
co-management regime and environmental assessment process for the 
Mackenzie Valley. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to begin with the leaders of the Gwich'in, and the Sahtu 
Denes and Metis of Northern Mackenzie Valley. Bill C-6 is the logical 
step following the land claim settlements signed by these native groups 
in 1992 and 1994. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Despite a three year delay in the adoption of this legislation, the 
leaders of these communities showed remarkable patience. They understood 
the need to proceed with wide consultations, to accommodate various 
interests and to make sure the legislation is fair. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Northwest Territories administration also deserves special 
recognition for its role in establishing a resource management system 
which allows for a decision-making process involving both regional and 
valley-wide levels. The territorial administration helped make sure that 
the new system reflects today's realities and needs while respecting the 
close relationships the native peoples have with the lands and the 
waters of the Mackenzie Valley as a whole. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Resource industries also made a big contribution to the proposed 
bill. They recognize that it is necessary to evolve with time in the 
Mackenzie Valley, and to adapt to new ways of doing business and 
managing the environment. 
Bill C-6 will provide them with the certainty and coherence they need to 
realize their investments in the valley, investments that will create 
jobs, increase government revenues and make Northerners economically 
more independent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also wish to commend the Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern 
Affairs and her predecessor for having developed a bill which will 
provide a just balance between the numerous different interests in the 
Mackenzie Valley. Thanks to their perseverance, Bill C-6 will reach its 
main goal, which is to protect the fragile environment of the Mackenzie 
Valley, while at the same time allowing the government to fulfil its 
constitutional obligation towards the Gwich'in, the Metis and the Sahtu 
Dene. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, I would be remiss if I did not commend my colleagues of 
the Standing Committee on Aboriginal Affairs and Northern Development 
for the important work they carried out. 
As my distinguished colleagues know, the committee undertook a 
comprehensive study of Bill C-6 before Christmas recess. Several 
witnesses offered convincing testimony and the committee was able to 
benefit from different point of views and discussions between its 
members. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again, we have before us a better bill than the initial version. 
Thanks to the amendments proposed by the government and the standing 
committee, and to the support of the territorial government, the mining 
industry and some native groups, Bill C-6 has been improved and made 
more precise. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These amendments have improved the clauses of the bill dealing with 
consultations, bringing greater openness and transparency. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These amendments will increase the participation of natives, 
including the first nations which have not already signed territorial 
land agreements, in the joint resource management regime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The amendments will facilitate the transition process to the new 
regime by providing an additional protection to the present users of 
lands and water. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The amendments have also allowed us to include in the bill some 
guarantees that its implementation will cause no prejudice to future 
negotiations on land claims and self government. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to quickly recap the key elements of Bill C-6 so 
that hon. members can appreciate the importance of this 
legislation to the people and the environment of the Mackenzie 
Valley. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Hon. members will recall that Bill C-6 will establish six boards 
of public government to administer the new resource management 
and environmental assessment regime. 
Two of these boards, the Mackenzie Valley land and water board 
and the environmental impact review board, will have jurisdiction 
throughout the valley.  The other four will be regional 
institutions responsible for land use planning and land and water 
issues in the two settlement areas.

<A HREF="#LINKT34"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-6 also provides for the establishment of additional 
regional boards by order in council as land claims agreements are 
finalized with other aboriginal groups in the Mackenzie Valley. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The need for a co-ordinated and integrated approach is an 
underlying principle of Bill C-6.  The Mackenzie Valley must be 
viewed as a single ecosystem, not just a collection of political 
or demographic regions.  Activities that take place upstream can 
and do affect communities downstream.  Decision making processes 
must take into account what is right for the entire ecosystem and 
all its communities and residents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even First Nations that stand in opposition to Bill C-6 have not 
disputed the need for a single valley wide system.  There is 
essentially unanimous agreement that we cannot have several 
different resource management systems in place in the valley.  It 
simply will not work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The question is not whether to proceed with an integrated 
approach, but when.  Some First Nations that have not yet signed 
land claims agreements would like us to wait.  The government's 
view is that further delays are not only unwarranted but could 
put Mackenzie Valley's environment at undue risk.  Clearly the 
time to act is now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A single integrated system is also the best way to proceed in 
terms of cost and efficiency.  Bill C-6 will ensure regulatory 
consistency between the settlement areas and adjacent lands. 
Virtually all lands in the Mackenzie Valley will be subject to 
the same environmental review requirements in keeping with this 
government's commitment to streamline environmental processes, 
avoid duplication of effort and reduce costs to industry and 
others. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the main features of the new system is that native peoples 
are assured they will have a role to play. The first nations get to 
designate half the members of the new resource management boards, with 
the federal and provincial governments designating the other half. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore, the various native groups living in the Mackenzie Valley 
area have the assurance that their traditional activities and lifestyles 
will be able to coexist with other forms of economic development. 
At the same time, non-native valley residents will have the opportunity 
to voice their concerns through the management boards and the hearing 
and public consultation process provided for in Bill C-6. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am also glad to point out that the legislation follows up on a 
recommendation made by the Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples, 
promoting the implementation of a co-management system in the Mackenzie 
Valley. Such an approach would be impossible without high levels of 
respect, recognition and mutual responsibility, all principles on which 
is based <I>Gathering Strength</I>, a native action plan the government 
announced recently. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>From a different perspective, Bill C-6 is another step towards the 
transfer of federal responsibilities and programs to the territorial 
government. 
The Northwest Territories Water Board, which is currently administered 
by the Department of Indian and Northern Affairs, will be integrated 
into the new Mackenzie Valley Land and Water Board. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As for the new Mackenzie Valley Environmental Impact Review Board, 
it will take over from the Department of Indian and Northern Affairs in 
co-ordinating and conducting environmental assessments. Once Bill C-6 is 
passed, the department will no longer be involved in issuing land use 
permits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In other words, Bill C-6 will put in the hands of northerners the 
decision making process for issues directly affecting the Mackenzie 
Valley lands and waters. The new system shows a high degree of 
sensitivity and accountability to northerners and reflects both good 
planning and sound public management. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In spite of the major changes that will result from Bill C-6, the 
proposed legislation will not cause any disruption in the valley. It is 
based on existing regulations, with which industry is familiar.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It neither extinguishes nor overrides any right that aboriginal 
people of the Mackenzie Valley have. It will not take precedence over 
constitutionally protected land claims settlements or the Indian Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under the new system, aboriginal people will have a much greater 
say in the decision making process than they do now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, it provides for land and water use applications to be 
processed quickly and fairly. It will also ensure that clearly defined 
procedures are used for the purposes of environmental assessment and 
protection throughout the Mackenzie Valley. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In closing, I would ask hon. members to consider the words of 
Richard Nerysoo, president of the Gwich'in Tribal Council.  When 
he gave evidence before the Standing Committee on Aboriginal 
Affairs and Northern Development, Mr. Nerysoo said “Bill C-6 
sets up a state of the art framework for land and water 
management in the north that is second to none in the Canadian 
north and for that matter in the world”.  A state of the art 
framework that is second to none in the world.  These are not the 
words of a government spokesperson.  They are the words of a 
respected aboriginal leader whose people will live with Bill C-6 
on a day to day basis.  They are words of pride, hope and 
confidence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I urge hon. members on all sides of the House to recognize that 
Bill C-6 is a necessary, practical and responsible approach to 
resource management in the Mackenzie Valley.  It has widespread 
support in the valley because it is a balanced and workable 
regime and because it will achieve its stated goal.  It deserves 
the same level of support from this House. 
<P><A NAME="LINK208"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Derrek Konrad (Prince Albert, Ref.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I 
am pleased to rise today to once again speak on Bill C-6 which is 
of course the Mackenzie Valley land and water management act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to give a little illustration about how things are 
sometimes seen.  A farmer observed two trains coming down one 
track and they ran head on into one another.  It was a mighty 
train wreck.  The investigator came out and asked him what he did 
about it.  The farmer said that he could not do a thing about it 
but that he had thought about it. The investigator asked him what 
he had thought about.  The farmer said he thought that it was a 
heck of a way to run a railroad. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It seems to me we have had this bill here before from the Tories 
and from the Liberals. It died on the Order Paper both times 
because it just did not seem to get the support it needed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To state that the bill is called for everywhere and by everyone 
is to overstate the case.  In committee we heard a lot of 
objections to this bill particularly from aboriginal groups who 
have not yet settled their land claims.  The concern of the 
people I spoke with in the Yellowknife area was not one of water 
management but one of land claims negotiations.  Therefore it 
really is not all that it seems to be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are opposed to the bill and have been since the beginning, 
even going back to its Mulroney Tory roots when it took the form 
of Bill C-16.  We were concerned then about a growing and 
unaccountable bureaucracy which it creates and the set of 
regulations that would have arisen under it. We also planned to 
oppose it as Bill C-80 in the last Parliament.  It was basically 
the same bill but it died on the Order Paper before the election. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today more than any other reason, and there are a lot of 
reasons, there is one thing we disagree with.  More than the big 
bureaucracy, which is making business developers in the north 
wary of investing there; more than the duplication of services 
that this bill would create; more than the possibility for 
interjurisdictional confusion; more than the opposition by the 
aboriginals who are still in the process of negotiating their 
land claims; more than the increase in the cost of compliance; 
more than the referral loop which many businesses are concerned 
they are going to get into, where it will be sent from the left 
side to the right side of the building, to across the street, to 
Ottawa, to everywhere else for referral, there is one thing we 
fundamentally disagree with. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What really gives us grounds to oppose the bill is that the 
simple amendments that were moved in committee to bring democracy 
into the bill were defeated by the government. 
We were not really asking for a great deal.  We wanted to see a 
little democracy and accountability in the bill rather than the 
same old patronage system of which the old line parties are so 
fond.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The amendments we proposed were to provide for an election 
system to be put in place based on current election models to 
determine who would sit on the boards.  In our view this was 
preferable to the board members being determined by the minister 
of Indian affairs based on criteria that are unknown and 
unspecified in the bill.  It is interesting that many believe the 
unspoken criteria are linked to one's contribution, whether 
financial or other, to the government party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-6 creates three new board levels:  a five-member land use 
planning board in the Gwich'in and Sahtu settlement areas; a 
Mackenzie Valley land and water board, subject to the creation of 
additional panels which will have up to 17 members, including a 
five-member permanent regional panel in each of the settlement 
areas; and an eleven-member environmental impact review board for 
the entire Mackenzie Valley.  Could it be any more simple and 
could it be any more bureaucratic? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The problem with these boards is that although the bill clearly 
establishes them, it fails to spell out criteria to be used in 
determining who actually sits on the boards.  The whole process 
is closed to the people of the Mackenzie Valley which creates a 
big problem.  When we tried to solve this problem with the 
democratic amendments put forward to the committee by the Reform 
Party they were defeated.  This is unbelievable.  This is a 
democracy.  How can anybody stand up in this House and speak 
against any form of democracy? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Consider that time and time again we have seen problems that 
come out of such a system.  I am not talking about democracy.  I 
am talking about its antithesis, one person making appointments. 
We do not need to look very far from this Chamber to find a great 
example of how flawed this patronage system is. Everyone here 
knows what I am referring to.  A supreme example of patronage in 
this country is the Senate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last June the people of Canada went to the polls after they 
heard what the candidates for Parliament had to say.  They went 
to the polls and elected members to this House, which constitutes 
half of the Government of Canada, just half.  Millions of 
Canadians exercise their democratic right to elect just half of 
Parliament. In contrast, there is one man, the Prime Minister, 
who appoints the entire other half.  We just saw that happen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Who gets there and what has been the result?  With respect to 
those senators who do serve with good motives and intentions, how 
well have Canadians been represented by our non-elected friends 
such as Andrew Thompson?  These people vote the party line 
because they are appointed by one man, the head of the governing 
party.  How dedicated to the people do you have to be when you 
are not accountable to the electorate but are only accountable to 
the person who appointed you?  It must be quite something.  I do 
not think any of us here could imagine such a thing, since we are 
not accountable to one person, we are accountable to our 
constituents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why do we allow it to go on?  Why do we implement new ways of 
promoting this old and ineffective way of doing things as we are 
doing with Bill C-6?  That is what I would like to know. I am 
sure that is what Canadians would like to know and I am sure that 
is what many people in the Northwest Territories still want to 
know.  The way I see it, the boards being created under Bill C-6 
are nothing but mini senates, except that these boards are 
appointed by the minister of Indian affairs instead of the Prime 
Minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other negative effect that comes out of this system is that 
it may create racial tensions in the Mackenzie Valley.  Will the 
members the minister appoints to the board fit into specific 
categories of people?  It seems they would either have to be 
natives or government officials. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What about the other residents of the Mackenzie Valley?  Will 
they not have a say?  We think this is wrong and that it could 
have been solved through free elections for these boards. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are not opposed to the goals of this legislation.  On the 
contrary, we think the intentions of Bill C-6 are good.  We do 
need to protect the environment.  It is just that this is such an 
awkward way to try to achieve it.  Bill C-6 was originally 
supposed to simplify a land claim settlement agreement.  It was 
not a land and water management act.  That is why there is such a 
concern. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In light of what I have said here today and in light of the 
understanding of myself and the Reform Party of democratic 
accountability, I am opposed to this legislation.

aboriginal question is a very popular one among the Bloc

make it their duty to support me in caucus when an aboriginal 
project, or one with an aboriginal dimension, comes up.  My 
colleagues from Saint-Hyacinthe—Bagot and Lévis are always first 
in line to support aboriginal issues and I congratulate them for 
it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am pleased, therefore, to speak today on Bill C-6. 
It is not often that bills concerning aboriginal people come before 
the House, but today we have had two in succession and dealing with 
adjoining regions.  As I have already pointed out, the previous 
bill, Bill C-8, concerned the Yukon, while this one has to do with 
the Northwest Territories, the region right next to it.  I will be 
pleased to offer a brief geographical overview of the part of the 
territory at issue today, the Mackenzie Valley. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill before us is aimed at creating boards.  We know there 
were agreements prior to this bill.  There was an agreement with 
the Gwich'in, signed April 22, 1992, and another with the Sahtu 
Dene and Metis, signed September 6, 1993. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also recall that one of the first bills in the last 
Parliament concerned the Sahtu Dene and Metis. 
That bill concerned comprehensive land claims.  I recall that at 
that time I was a bit muddled about the Sahtu, the Northwest 
Territories, the Yukon, the Gwich'in and so on.  Now, with four 
years of experience under my belt, I think I could dare claim a 
little more knowledge, even though I know that a person could spend 
years getting to know everything about it, even if he or she had 
studied the aboriginal question thoroughly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today we have a bill that arises out of those agreements. I 
will permit myself a little aside, as I did a bit earlier, 
concerning our Reform Party friends, because I have made a promise 
to myself that I would take every opportunity to point this out. 
The other day, I heard one of them claiming that the Bloc Quebecois 
is concerned only with Quebec, that the Bloc Quebecois has no 
interest whatsoever in what goes on east or west of Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members should remember what I said earlier, when speaking on Bill 
C-8, about the aboriginal issue. We feel very concerned about this 
issue, and Bloc Quebecois members—as seen today, spoke about the Yukon 
less than an hour ago and are now discussing the Northwest Territories. 
The aboriginal issue is important to Quebeckers, and we are aware that 
it could have consequences. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal acts passed in this House and then by the Senate can 
have an impact on aboriginal people in Quebec, and we are looking after 
their interests. This is why we always take part in discussions dealing 
with aboriginal people, even if they are not from Quebec. I say to 
Reformers that we do not only defend Quebec's interests, particularly 
when it comes to aboriginal issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me say a few words about how the boards will operate. There 
are three boards: the land use planning board, the Mackenzie Valley land 
and water board and the environmental impact review board. As members 
know, the bill before us is the result of two agreements for the entire 
District of Mackenzie.  These agreements provided that implementing 
legislation would be passed here, precisely to implement the accords, 
and this is what we are doing today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will briefly describe the board memberships, but first I want to 
tell the House that these boards will essentially function like 
government organizations. 
They will have their own staff and budgets, in accordance with 
government approval and funding procedures. Therefore, discussions will 
take place with the government to determine the funding of these boards. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, as my colleague mentioned earlier, some provisions will no 
longer come under federal jurisdiction. This means that, under Bill C-6, 
some budgets which, until now, were controlled by certain departments 
under certain acts of Parliament, are being transferred to these boards. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As was the case earlier with the bill on the Yukon, we agree with 
this decentralization measure. Indeed, we can only agree with the 
transfer of money or tax points to regions of the country. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1710"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT39"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT39"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1710

<A HREF="#LINKT38"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think that my colleague from Saint-Hyacinthe—Bagot totally 
agrees. Any decentralization exercise must involve federal tax points. 
Decentralization must not be done only on paper. It must involve 
funding, because money is really important. I thought it was worth 
mentioning. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first agency I want to talk about is the land use planning 
boards. 
There will be two of them, one in each region, namely the one where 
there is an agreement with the Gwich'in and the one where there is an 
agreement with the Sahtu Dene and Metis. Both regions are part of the 
District of Mackenzie. These two boards will consist of five members, 
including two members designated by the first nations, one by the 
federal government and one by the provincial or territorial government, 
and these four members will appoint a chairperson. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we look at the bills currently before us and those that will 
come before us, there is always a certain parity between the first 
nations and the government. We can see a decentralization that gives 
more power to the first nations. That is reflected in the membership of 
the various boards. This is reflected here, and it will also be 
reflected in other bills that we will consider later on regarding 
Nunavut or other regions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This parity is important, and I think it is time to start 
sharing, not only powers and jurisdictions, but the related tax 
points and funds.  That is an expression of trust in the first 
nations.  There will be certain problems in the bill.  I will of 
explain it later, but, as a preamble, I thought I should describe 
the composition of the boards and their mandate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are therefore two boards, as I said earlier, one for the 
Gwich'in and one for the Sahtu Dene and the Metis.  They will be 
able to develop, consider and propose changes to the plan for the 
use of all lands in the District of Mackenzie.  So when a land use 
plan is approved by a first nation and by the government, it will 
be used as a reference to develop of the region. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a problem I can describe right away. 
The problem is that a number of nations and several regions of the 
Mackenzie have yet to sign an agreement, as we saw earlier on the 
claims and the establishment of a system to manage lands and water. 
With the two agreements discussed earlier, we are finally applying 
it to the entire Mackenzie region.  That is where the problem lies. 
The first nations that have not yet signed an agreement will have 
their approach to managing the land and water within their 
territory dictated by the bill.  This is a rather odd approach, 
which we oppose. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will describe later the way we tried in committee to correct 
the situation.  Unfortunately, the government majority did not 
support us.  And this is why the Bloc will oppose the bill.  I just 
wanted to describe the dynamics of the problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will now deal with the issue of boards. Earlier, I mentioned the 
Land Use Planning Board. I will now talk about the Land and Water Board. 
It will consist of 17 members. Five members will come from each of the 
Gwitch'in and Sahtu Dene and Metis settlement areas. In addition, seven 
members will be appointed by the government and by the first nations of 
the three areas located outside these settlement areas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here is the problem. Seven persons not covered by a settlement 
agreement are to be appointed in order to include the whole area, all 
the way to the Beaufort Sea, under a single management system, even 
though some First Nations in the Mackenzie Valley have not signed a land 
claim agreement yet. 
This is a problem, and several aboriginals said so to the Standing 
Committee on Aboriginal Affairs and Northern Development. The Land and 
Water Board has the authority to grant land and water use licences, thus 
fostering development in the Mackenzie Valley.

<A HREF="#LINKT39"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It will issue licences involving some aboriginal peoples or some 
areas in the Mackenzie Valley not yet covered by an agreement. As I 
said, it is rather strange. In fact, this is the main reason why the 
Bloc Quebecois will not support this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is another board, the Mackenzie Valley Environmental Impact 
Review Board. When this issue was discussed in committee it was agreed, 
for practical reasons, to reduce its membership from 11 to 7; but its 
composition is similar to that of the other boards I mentioned earlier. 
One will represent the Gwich'in, who have already signed an agreement, 
another will represent the Sahtu Dene and Metis, who signed an 
agreement, two will represent the appropriate department within the 
Government of the Northwest Territories, and two will represent those 
who do not have an agreement yet. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Once again, this board is not, I would say, taking hostages, but 
going over the heads of people who have not yet signed an agreement and 
it is applying to the five Mackenzie regions a decision that affects two 
regions, and this is somewhat deplorable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With the scope of the valley environmental impact review board, all 
development activities on the lands and waters of the valley, including 
proposals affecting Indian reserves or lands governed by a settlement 
with a first nation, will be subject to the environmental impact review 
and assessment process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I mentioned earlier the huge environmental problems experienced by 
the Yukon Territory. The same is true for the Northwest Territories. I 
have been to Yellowknife often and there has been shameless exploitation 
of the environment in these areas. Once again, the wealth created from 
these lands has not benefited the natives. Often, the only legacy 
snatives got was a devastated landscape, a landscape that has been 
exploited and left to natives in a dismal condition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This has harmed natives not only economically, but also culturally. 
I remind the House that their culture is based on hunting, fishing, 
trapping and fruit gathering. These are all things that were disrupted. 
Therefore, it is important to have a board that will properly examine 
any projects submitted, to ensure that the environment will be preserved 
and to avoid repeating past errors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately, there are some regions not covered by 
agreements on which this will now be imposed.  I repeat that this 
is one of the reasons the Bloc will vote against the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The boards will replace land and water settlements by the 
Department of Indian and Northern Affairs.  People often say to us: 
“Why is the Department of Indian and Northern Affairs responsible 
for oil, gas and natural resources in the far north?  That should 
not be its mandate”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remind the House that the name of the department is the 
Department of Indian and Northern Affairs, meaning that anything 
north of 60 falls squarely within its jurisdiction, including 
several aboriginal nations.  So it makes some sense that it comes 
under the department's jurisdiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The legislation provides for a method of overseeing the 
cumulative effect of land and water use on the environment. 
Earlier, I mentioned devastated landscapes.  When companies need 
river water or use land, it will be important to look not just at 
the short-term impact, but also at the cumulative repercussions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Sometimes, on the face of it, this might sound reasonable. 
The activity goes on for one or two years.  But, in the long run, 
it can have a dramatic impact on the environment and these boards 
will allow oversight. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Periodic, independent environmental assessments will be done 
and made public.  Increasingly, the departments involved will have 
to pull out, in accordance with the bill before us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is also another board, the Northwest Territories Water 
Board. 
This board was created under the present legislation.  It will 
gradually be phased out in favour of the boards I have just 
described. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1720"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT40"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Also, the Canadian Environmental Assessment Act will gradually lose 
some of its impact, and let the boards take on a greater role. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>After the short geographic description of the Yukon I have just 
given, I think it would be important for me to do the same for the 
District of Mackenzie. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Mackenzie River originates in the Great Slave Lake and flows 
into the Beaufort Sea. It is a major system in the Northwest 
Territories. Everybody talks about the Mackenzie Valley. 
Everybody knows the great contribution this river makes to the district, 
and that is why it deserves a great deal of attention. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What are the geographical borders of this area? To the west, we 
have the Yukon, where the native peoples have a very rich culture, as I 
said earlier. The Northwest Territories are no different. They also have 
a very rich native culture. Natives were undoubtedly the first 
inhabitants of that area. Exploration, the gold rush, natural resource 
development all came after the Gwich'in, the Metis and the Denes were 
already there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These peoples have been living there since time immemorial. It is 
important not to ignore them in our discussions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To the west, we have the Yukon, with its rich native culture. The 
immediate neighbours are the Gwich'in and all those peoples I have just 
mentioned. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To the north is Inuvialuit, a Canadian territory where a 
self-government agreement has been concluded with the Inuit. 
There are four regions: Inuvialuit is located completely on the 
west coast and is right next to the territory we are talking 
about today; there is also Nunavut, a region located a little 
more to the east where the Inuit from the northern part of 
central Canada will have complete jurisdiction starting in 1999. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Discussions are under way in Quebec as well because there is an 
Inuit part of Quebec called Nunavik. Discussions are going well in 
Nunavik with the Quebec government which, as we all know, is very open 
minded with regard to aboriginal nations. As a matter of fact, 
statistics provide tangible proof of what I just said, whether it be for 
language retention, social and economic advantages, and so on. Quebec is 
in a much better position than the rest of Canada in this regard. 
I can personally vouch for that, having made frequent visits to 
aboriginal communities both in Quebec and in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Quebeckers are very proud of their record with regard to aboriginal 
nations. I must tell you that I will seize every opportunity to say so. 
I am a Quebecker, I am proud of being a Quebecker, I am a sovereignist and 
we are happy with the way we treat aboriginal nations in Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will now get back to my description of the Mackenzie. To the east 
is Nunavut, which I talked about earlier. It is one of the four regions 
that will become self-governing on April 1, 1999. Its population is 90% 
Inuit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To the south is the 60th parallel, south of which are the provinces 
of Saskatchewan and Alberta. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As is the case with all major waterways, we find various 
settlements along the Mackenzie. 
On the shores of the Mackenzie River are the towns of Fort Norman, Fort 
Franklin, Norman Wells, which is extremely rich in oil, Fort Wrigley, 
and Fort Simpson. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All these towns are former trading posts. Back then, oil was not 
what it has become today. During the 18th century, oil was not the 
reason people went up there, because nobody knew what oil was. In order 
to move from place to another, sheer physical effort was more important 
than oil. People used snowshoes and canoes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fur trade was the reason people went up there. All these towns 
developed because of the fur trade. Later on, their development was 
spurred by gas and oil exploration, and also, lately, by diamond 
exploration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a history rich region. The Hudson's Bay Company had a 
trading post at Fort Franklin between 1945 and 1950. That is not so long 
ago.

<A HREF="#LINKT41"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>During the sixties, the Dene settled permanently in Fort Franklin, 
which they called Deline. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Fort Norman was also called Slavey Tulit's by the natives. There 
are many native connotations. Slavey Tulit's means mouth of two rivers. 
We have 50 native languages in Canada, and aboriginal names often refer 
to natural features, as in this case. At the mouth of two rivers, there 
was probably an abundance of fish and game. Explorers and traders set up 
a trading post there in 1810. There is a lot of history there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I have already said, several other bills concern Norman 
Wells oil. In 1919 Imperial Oil made a very big oil strike in this 
oil-rich area.  During the second world war, Norman Wells gained a 
great deal of importance because the allied war machine required 
this essential fuel. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So, unfortunately, the war machine's demand for fuel was 
profitable for those involved with this black gold.  Norman Wells 
thus became a major centre at that time, but unfortunately declined 
in 1947 with the post-war slump in demand. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The demand for oil has continued to grow since then. The city, 
with its economy centred on oil, is gaining in importance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Norman Wells is located on the Canol pipeline. This pipeline 
was built during World War II so that the community could ship its 
top quality light crude to the Alaska highway and to centres a 
little further south for the war industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hardly need point out that Northern Wells is also at the 
northern end of an oil pipeline from the Northwest Territories to 
Zama, Alberta. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a region which is rich in natural resources: oil, gas, 
diamonds, gold.  It is an extremely rich region, and one which has 
made many oil companies rich as well. 
I also remind people every time of the social contract between the 
natives and the white people. The white people said at the time they 
would take over the territories, develop them and confine the natives to 
reserves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not the natives who came out as winners in this economic war. 
It is Canadians who accumulated some fortunes and who left the natives 
faced with devastated landscapes and deplorable social and economic 
conditions. In the end, they did not benefit from this wealth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the sources of conflict between the white people and the 
natives is how they perceive the land. When we, the white people, go 
into business, when we want to build a house, when we want to acquire 
some real estate, we go to our lawyer, we do a lot a measuring and we 
try to stake out our land as accurately as possible. We do some 
surveying. 
In our opinion, the land belongs to us. It must be staked out, and it 
belongs to us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The native philosophy is quite different. For the natives, the land 
belongs to everyone. This was the philosophy that they had and that 
guided them when the white people came. For them, it was quite normal to 
share the territory. But, as we will see, the issue and the approach 
were quite different for the white people. Unfortunately, as I said 
earlier, this was not done quite to the benefit of the natives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also have very little information about their culture. 
Anthropologists have not examined these issues very much. However, we 
got some data from merchants and explorers, who divided the natives into 
three groups. The eastern group, which includes some bands such as the 
Yellow Knives, the Dog Ribs—

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Roger Gallaway (Sarnia—Lambton, Lib.)</B> moved that Bill 
C-288, an act to amend the Broadcasting Act (broadcasting 
policy), be read the second time and referred to a committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said:  Madam Speaker, it is my pleasure to be the first person 
to speak in support of this piece of private member's 
legislation, Bill C-288, an act to amend the Broadcasting Act. In 
my allotted time I would like to speak to three basic points or 
principles. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I should point out this is not a new piece of legislation either 
to this House or to the Senate.  In fact, this is the same piece 
of legislation which in the last Parliament was called Bill C-216 
and which passed this House as amended by the Standing Committee 
on Canadian Heritage and passed the Senate as amended there and 
is now back before us as Bill C-288 in the same words.  But there 
is one slight shift. This has not been deemed votable by the 
committee charged with making such determinations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To those members of other parties and to new members I have to 
point out that this bill has been studied by a House committee, 
it has been studied by a Senate committee and it passed the 
House, passed the Senate and came back here as amended. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill received more press coverage in the last Parliament 
than any other private member's bill by far.  It received 
editorial endorsements and it taught the Senate of Canada that it 
cannot sit idly by and ignore private members' legislation passed 
by this House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some members may recall the call a senator campaign which was 
launched last winter and should know that the Senate of Canada 
was forced to hire extra telephone operators to deal with the 
thousands of calls made into that place telling the senators to 
get on with their business and to pass this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Clearly if thousands of Canadians would pick up the phone to 
call the toll free line at the Senate, one must conclude that 
this bill had and continues to have wide scale public support. 
It is equally important to note that the bill has also been 
endorsed by the Canadian Association of Broadcasters, the 
Consumers Association of Canada, the Public Interest Advocacy 
Centre and was endorsed by the Minister of Canadian Heritage on 
April 9, 1997 in this House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, because there were concerns expressed in the other 
place about the effect of this bill on French language services, 
when it cleared the other place it was noted in debates there 
that even the French language specialty service approved of this 
bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Furthermore, the Toronto <I>Star</I>, the <I> Globe and Mail</I>, 
the Montreal <I>Gazette</I>, the <I>Financial Post</I> and other 
papers carried editorials calling for the passage of this bill. 
The <I>Financial Post</I> in an editorial said that despite the 
cable industry's promise not to employ negative option billing 
again, it was time to drive a stake through the heart of it so 
that marketers within the cable industry did not find a new 
variation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This evening is perhaps the last chance the House will have to 
deal with this issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second point I want to make deals with the substance of this 
bill. What this legislation does for the first time is give 
Canadian consumers a modicum of control over what they will pay 
for services offered by cable, telephone and satellite companies 
on to television screens.  It is not a radical idea.  It is a 
pretty simple concept that Canadian consumers should agree to the 
provision of services and that in agreeing they should know what 
they are receiving and what the cost will be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of course this is the normal practice in most marketplaces save 
and except, and I say this sadly, in matters of Canadian 
telecommunication.  In this realm we have said that Canadians 
should not have the right to select what they receive and how 
much they will pay for it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a pathetic commentary on how specialty television 
services are provided in this country and goes a long way to say 
how we as legislators have allowed the exploitation of the 
Canadian public by large corporate interests all in the name of 
culture.

<A HREF="#LINKT43"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yet this bill affects only specialty channels.  It in no way 
impairs or impedes the ability of the government to declare 
certain channels to be mandatory and therefore to be carried on 
basic cable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill simply deals with specialty channels, those specific 
interest channels that to some are entertaining and to others are 
of no interest.  These channels are simply diversionary 
entertainment.  They are of no consequence to anyone, cultural or 
otherwise. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The present chair of the CRTC, Madam Bertrand, stated before a 
Senate committee last spring that this bill really was not 
necessary because of competition in the marketplace, and 
additionally that cable companies would not employ deceptive 
marketing techniques again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We all remember the declarations of the Canadian Cable 
Television Association which assured us of its new found, 
straight up marketing techniques in dealing with Canadian 
consumers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yet is it not interesting that these born again straight 
shooters of last spring and January 1998 again used manipulative 
marketing practices to try to trap subscribers to taking 
additional channels? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We saw a month and a half ago that the public statements of Mr. 
Richard Stursberg, the spokesperson for that organization, were 
made with a number of qualifiers which he failed to mention 
originally, that is that negative option marketing continues to 
exist across this country.  This was noted by the Toronto 
<I>Star</I> in an editorial on January 30, 1998: “It is time for 
consumers to raise their voices again”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The only way consumers can raise their voices is through us in 
this place who can legislate to give them the protection they 
want and deserve. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have asked members present to think about it, to think back to 
the consumer revolts of 1995 on this subject, to think back to 
the sanctimonious statements by the industry that it had learned 
a lesson and would not use manipulative marketing practice, to 
think about it, to look to the practices of recent weeks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is clear that only one conclusion can be drawn, that no 
lesson was learned by the industry.  Once again the consumer is 
forced to pay.  Again the Canadian consumer is the loser while we 
in this place refuse to do anything.  What a pathetic commentary 
on our ability to help those we allegedly serve here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The third point deals with the role of the CRTC in all this. As 
I noted earlier, the CRTC appeared before the House committee on 
Canadian heritage when this bill was before this House and five 
months later before the committee in the other place when it was 
there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When it was here before the committee Mr. Keith Spicer, the then 
chair of that commission, stated to members present they ought to 
go ahead and pass this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Five months later his successor, the present chairman, Madam 
Bertrand, said it is not necessary.  Eight months later the cable 
industry is back to its old tricks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is one party that is extremely culpable in all of this 
besides the cable industry, the CRTC.  It has turned its back on 
Canadian consumers and has co-operated every step of the way with 
the industry to the gross detriment of our constituents, Canadian 
consumers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How it could, in a period of five months, flip-flop from 
endorsing and calling for the passage of legislation to a point 
where it could conclude that it was not necessary is beyond me. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is evident the CRTC has no policy on this.  It is fine for it 
to tell people to go back to basic cable, but it fails to realize 
that 90 per cent of Canadian consumers have something greater 
than basic cable.  Telling people to go back to basic cable is 
really destroying the specialty channels that it says it is there 
to encourage in growth. What does the CRTC do in this instance? 
What does it do for Canadians?  The answer is still nothing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In a letter I forwarded to the chair of that commission on 
January 22, 1998, I asked what action in the name of consumers 
will the CRTC take to review unacceptable steps taken by Rogers 
Cable. I should point out that subsequently virtually all cable 
companies in this country took the same step. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In a reply I received from the chair one month and five days 
later I was told: “A competitive broadcasting marketplace 
offering Canadians a greater array of program and cost options is 
beginning to appear”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is the justification apparently for Madam Bertrand and her 
commissioners to allow their industry to run over consumers. 
She went on to further note that she is sending a copy of my 
letter to Rogers and asking that it respond to me directly about 
my concerns within three weeks and to send a copy of its response 
to her.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is clearly ridiculous.  The CRTC has become a post office 
box for people with complaints, Canadian consumers, the people it 
allegedly serves.  We have set up this body to protect Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I must say I am very comforted by Madam Bertrand's assurance 
that the commission is now following this issue and that I along 
with many other Canadians have brought this to her attention.  I 
have to wonder somewhat facetiously if one must bring this issue 
to the attention of Madam Bertrand with a ball peen hammer to get 
some action. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While the CRTC hides behind this wall that all is well and the 
marketplace will take care of any problems, she writes letters 
talking about how the CRTC works to establish fair and affordable 
basic monthly rates and programming options for cable 
subscribers.  Clearly she is out of her realm.  Clearly she is 
out of touch.  Even the television reporter for the Toronto 
<I>Star</I>, the person who works full time covering the 
television and communications beat for the largest newspaper in 
Canada, on January 23 of this year, less than two months ago, 
wrote that he hated the monopoly and hated having no choice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If a person who works and is imbued in this industry is unaware 
of the competition then where does the chair of the CRTC get off 
in believing there is competition in the marketplace?  It is no 
wonder or surprise to us here that we continually hear from 
constituents who have no use for that body known as the CRTC, 
that the time has arrived for us to seriously look at its 
continued existence, that the time is now to take action and put 
an end to this silly charade where Canadians, our constituents, 
are always ending up being the people who pay.  They are the 
victims in this case. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The time is now.  It is the last chance for members in this 
place to do something for Canadian consumers in the face of an 
indifferent regulatory body which has no interest in them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would therefore seek the unanimous consent of this House for 
the following motion.  I move: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That Bill C-288, an act to amend the Broadcasting Act, be deemed 
to have been chosen a votable item. 
</UL>
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B> Is there unanimous consent 
in the House to put this bill to a vote?

<P><A NAME="LINK214"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay—Columbia, Ref.):</B>  Madam Speaker, 
this bill, seconded by me, is a learning experience in Parliament 
and parliamentary procedure.  This bill is one that passed this 
House of Commons, went to the Senate and after a rocky ride 
arrived back in the House of Commons.  Indeed it was the Bloc 
Quebecois at the time that also took parliamentary procedure to 
make sure that the prior bill did not ever get through the House 
of Commons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is really regrettable because I have in my hand a news release 
from the Public Interest Advocacy Centre in Ottawa dated 
Wednesday, March 11, today.  I would like to read the news 
release: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>MPs urged to support negative option bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Public Interest Advocacy Centre today urged MPs to support 
Bill C-288, which will outlaw negative option marketing by the 
cable industry.  This bill is, word for word, identical to Bill 
C-216 which was introduced in the last Parliament, but killed 
after being passed by the Senate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>“Contrary to promises by the industry, consumers are not only 
still faced with negative option billing, but, in addition, 
negative reaction marketing”, said Michael Janigan, Executive 
Director of PIAC.  “Now they're using a variation of this same 
old trick for the introduction of new services”, he continued. 
The practice of negative option marketing occurs when a 
subscriber automatically receives a service for which they are 
billed, unless the cable company is notified to the contrary. 
Negative reaction marketing has developed with the introduction 
of new specialty channels.  Consumers who subscribe to existing 
packages (beyond basic cable) face a massive rate hike unless 
they agree to take the new specialty package.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The news release goes on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Public Interest Advocacy Centre is interested in this as an 
advocate for the ordinary consumer.  The position I am taking as 
the Reform Party heritage critic and the reason I seconded this 
bill is that I too have the interest of the Canadian consumer at 
heart.  It is not just the Bloc Quebecois members who for reasons 
best known to themselves, and perhaps they will describe to us 
later, have refused to give unanimous consent that this bill be 
votable. It is the heritage minister in particular and the CRTC 
that have come out against this and have been working against it 
underground in the background behind the scenes.  The Canadian 
public should really understand this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I said that this was a learning experience and it truly was.  In 
the last Parliament when the sponsoring member brought this bill 
forward, it went through the House with only 25 members voting 
against it at second reading.  The heritage minister at that 
point said that she was in favour of this bill and its passage. 
Someone over at the CRTC took the time to read the bill and came 
to the false conclusion that this would limit specialty channels 
in the French language.  It is a totally false conclusion. It has 
been proven to be a false conclusion in the Senate hearings that 
took place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All sorts of things took place between the first and second 
reading stages.  The bill went to committee.  It was examined in 
committee.  It was refined in committee. When it came back to the 
House for third reading, some very interesting things took place. 
By then the heritage minister became aware of the fact that her 
officials at the CRTC had arrived at this false conclusion and 
therefore was bending arms behind the scenes with the Liberal 
backbenchers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know the Prime Minister has said that Liberal backbenchers 
may vote how they wish on a private member's bill.  Therefore the 
heritage minister was faced with a problem.  She started some arm 
twisting.  We have actual documentation still on file of her 
recommendations to the members aggressively recommending that 
they vote against it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On Monday, the day of the vote, the minister chose to absent 
herself from the House of Commons when the vote would be taking 
place.  My office followed the procedure. The minister actually 
chose to go to a public event that was taking place at the 
convention centre in Toronto.  She thereby had an excuse not to 
come to the House.  She previously said that she was going to 
vote in favour of the bill but all of a sudden— 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay:</B> Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of 
order. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe my hon. colleague may not refer to a division in the 
House or to the absence or presence of someone here.  I do not 
think that is proper. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B>  I would ask the hon. 
member for Kootenay—Columbia to try to stay within the framework 
of the debate before us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Abbott:</B>  Madam Speaker, the bottom line to the 
exercise is that this bill has gone through a very convoluted 
process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In spite of the aggressive arm twisting of the heritage 
minister, the heritage ministry and the officials at the CRTC, 
not only with the members in the House of Commons but also with 
the members of the Senate, it did arrive back. 
It was through action by the Bloc Quebecois that the bill ended 
up being rejected.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is my thesis.  At exactly the same time this was taking 
place, there was the copyright bill which the heritage minister 
wanted to get through.  She ended up with the full co-operation 
of the Bloc Quebecois in certain procedures that took place in 
committee.  It is my thesis that the payback the Bloc Quebecois 
gave to the minister for achieving certain objectives for Quebec 
artists in the copyright bill was that it would thwart this very 
necessary piece of legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why is it a necessary piece of legislation? It is necessary 
because there is a monopoly under the existing broadcast rules 
and communications rules. There is a monopoly for cable.  It is 
opening up, but it is opening up very slowly. Right at this 
moment if there was full competition with the cable companies by 
telephone and telecommunications companies, if there was not the 
significant price differential in getting a dish, or not being 
able to put a dish in certain areas of certain cities or on 
apartment buildings, cable companies would not get away with 
either negative option billing or negative marketing, the new 
variation they are presently into. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform Party is noted for saying let us be free of 
government rules and regulations, particularly unnecessary rules 
and regulations.  Therefore one might ask why the Reform Party 
heritage critic would have seconded this bill coming to the House 
of Commons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We do not live in a perfect world.  I have already described 
that the cable companies do not have true competition. Until such 
time as they have true competition, to protect the Canadian 
consumer we must have this kind of legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I therefore find it exceptionally regrettable that the Bloc 
Quebecois would have voiced its rejection of this becoming a 
votable item in the House tonight.  I note that this rejection 
had it not come from the Bloc without a doubt would have come 
from the Liberal side of the House.  I just do not understand 
what is going on here.  Why do we have a government—

Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It has already been drawn to the Chair's attention that the hon. 
member has commented on the voting of a particular member and the 
member's presence or absence in the House which is entirely 
contrary to the rules of Parliament.  He is now choosing to 
speculate on how a member might, would or could have voted or 
several members might, would or could have voted with absolutely 
no basis on which to make such a statement.  I would ask that you 
call him to order, please, Madam Speaker. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B> I would remind the 
hon. member to keep his remarks within the framework being 
debated right now.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Again, the issue was not whether the member was addressing the 
matter before the House. The issue was the member was commenting 
on the voting or potential voting of a member of this House. 
That is contrary to the rules.  Would you please remind him that 
it is contrary to the rules of procedure in this House.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski—Mitis, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to speak to Bill C-288 introduced by my Liberal 
colleague for Sarnia—Lambton and entitled an act to amend the 
Broadcasting Act (broadcasting policy). 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill is motivated by the member's legitimate concerns 
about the controversial business practice of negative option 
billing followed by certain cable companies, primarily in English 
Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleague introduced Bill C-216 in the last Parliament, and 
the Bloc opposed it because it went well beyond the member's 
intentions and could have had a negative impact on the broadcasting 
system, in part by threatening the availability of francophone 
specialty channels in Quebec and in francophone and Acadian 
communities outside Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Furthermore, we cannot support a bill that represents an 
intrusion into areas of billing and consumer protection, both of 
which are under provincial jurisdiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill before us would establish federal regulations on the 
billing for cable services, when business relations between a 
consumer and a vendor are a provincial matter.  I would invite my 
federalist colleague to look at section 92(3) of the Constitution 
in this regard. 
I also point out that, in 1995, the heritage minister recognized this 
areas as an exclusive jurisdiction of Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact, in Quebec we have an organization looking after this: the 
consumer protection bureau. Jurisprudence confirms that the Quebec 
consumer protection legislation applies to all businesses, even those 
under federal jurisdiction, such as broadcasting corporations, as far as 
the consumer, commercial practices and advertising are concerned. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Quebec consumer protection legislation outlaws negative option 
billing. Paragraph 230(<I>a</I>) of this act provides that no merchant can 
demand any money for goods or services provided to a consumer, when the 
consumer has not agreed to receive such goods or services. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The 1995 consumer revolt in English Canada was sparked when Rogers 
Communications took advantage of the introduction of six new specialty 
channels, English speaking channels, on cable television to take out of 
its basic service package channels that subscribers liked, asking them 
to pay extra to get them back. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Quebec, the situation was different. Vidéotron simply added new 
specialty channels to its basic service at no extra cost. COGECO and CF 
Cable, on the other hand, reached with the consumer protection bureau an 
agreement providing for the maintenance of certain practices, as long as 
flexible arrangements were in place to avoid penalizing consumers who 
may not have understood that it was up to them to cancel or opt out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, one of the reasons the Quebec consumers association 
opposed this bill was the fact that the CRTC and the consumer protection 
bureau already had appropriate powers to correct abuse. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1800"></A>

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Association gave four reasons it was opposed to this bill. 
First, it would prevent the broadcasting of new services and would 
reduce francophones' access to a wider range of programming in 
their own language.  Second, it would reduce the number of 
francophone listeners with access to these services because the 
cost would allow only the more affluent to subscribe.  Third, in 
the absence of affordable French language services, francophone 
consumers would have to fall back on English language specialty 
services.  Fourth, in the absence of reasonably priced viable 
services in Quebec, it would be impossible to extend these services 
to francophone and Acadian communities in the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Association des consommateurs du Québec summed up the other 
major reason for which we are opposing this bill very well: it 
would very likely hamper the development of new French language 
services in Quebec and elsewhere in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Fédération des communautés francophones et acadienne du 
Canada spoke out strongly against the bill, because it would 
prevent francophones living in a minority situation from having 
access to specialty services in their own language. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-288 of the 36th Parliament is identical to Bill C-216 
of the 35th Parliament.  If this bill were passed, cable companies 
would have to obtain the agreement of each subscriber before adding 
a specialized service to the basic service and then raising the 
price.  The odds are that, where francophones were in the minority, 
the anglophone majority would not agree to a rate hike in return 
for a French language service, thus preventing broadcasting of this 
service. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, this bill would make it possible to choose which 
specialty services would be optional.  It would not be surprising 
if anglophones did not wish to pay for French language specialty 
services and did not order them.  These services would therefore no 
longer make money for cable companies and would rapidly disappear. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The objections and fears of the Fédération des communautés 
francophones et acadienne with respect to this bill were entirely 
justified, and we share its view that it is up to lawmakers to 
ensure that the statutes of Canada make it possible to preserve a 
space in which francophone and Acadian communities can identify 
themselves and flourish.  Unfortunately, the Liberal government has 
a history of appearing not to be very sensitive to the francophone 
fact. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, I wish to say that, from the point of view of 
consumers, the ideal situation would be to be able to select the 
specific channels they wished and to pay for those alone. 
Unfortunately, current technology does not yet allow cable companies to 
provide that option. Pay per view television allows consumers to pay for 
one program at a time by decoding the signal, but this system is still 
costly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Moreover, in a small market such as Quebec, few specialized French 
language channels would have enough listeners to survive in a pay per 
view system. The current system allows people to have specialty 
services in their own language, and these services reflect what goes on 
in their community, as well as their preferences and interests. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can only conclude that the member who introduced this bill, and 
those who support it, show once again that they care little about the 
cultural reality of Quebec and of French speaking communities outside 
our province. 
By trying to regulate at the national level an area of provincial 
jurisdiction—this in an attempt to solve a problem that is not very 
serious in Quebec—they are showing that there are two different 
realities: the Canadian reality and the Quebec reality. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill would probably be useful to the rest of Canada, but it 
would be harmful to Quebec and to francophones outside Quebec. This bill 
is yet another example of how our two realities, our two ways of living, 
the Canadian way and the Quebec way, would thrive a lot more if we had 
two different countries united in a new partnership. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members will understand that the Bloc Quebecois absolutely cannot 
support such a bill.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>He is of course quite right to point out the source of the 
desire to essentially outlaw negative billing, which came from 
the reaction of what I think might be properly called a consumer 
revolt against cable companies in January 1995 as they responded 
to negative billing by their cable companies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The vast majority of us, certainly those of us living in urban 
areas and even in smaller communities, receive our television 
service through cable companies.  Of course because of the 
monopoly situation those cable companies are in we are faced with 
difficult questions when presented with a practice such as 
negative billing.  It is only to be expected that consumers would 
respond in this way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Were it the case that this practice and this general approach to 
customers by cable companies was over, perhaps we would not need 
to pursue the matter so vigorously.  However, there are consumers 
not only in Quebec but in other provinces who are being faced 
with this particular practice and the problem continues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think, on the whole, Canadian consumers have lined up in 
favour of the legislation.  They are in favour of protecting 
consumers and putting consumers first. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As well, a number of organizations which are generally 
supportive of consumers' interests are in favour of the 
legislation, such as the Consumers Association of Canada, the 
Public Interest Advocacy Centre and the Canadian Association of 
Broadcasters. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also point out that the vast majority of members of this 
House are supportive of this measure.  Indeed, when the House was 
last faced with responding to this question, when the member for 
Sarnia—Lambton moved this piece of legislation in the last 
Parliament, I think that the vote was 84 to 68 in favour of the 
legislation.  Had there not been an election called last year 
this legislation would have been passed into law and Canadian 
consumers would indeed be protected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We heard the Bloc Quebecois speak today against the interests of 
Canadian consumers.  Rather than leave the matter to consumers in 
Quebec and outside Quebec to make decisions as to what services 
might be provided, the Bloc is opposing this legislation which 
would be in the interests of the vast majority of Canadian 
consumers of cable television. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have had what at best could be described as a luke warm 
response from the Liberal government.  We certainly saw the 
Minister for Canadian Heritage dragged screaming and kicking in 
support of this legislation and, as has been indicated, not 
standing up for Canadian consumers on this point. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have the CRTC, as the member for Sarnia—Lambton indicated, 
which is also not performing its role on behalf of Canadian 
consumers.  As well, there are a number of cable companies which 
would like to continue this practice in the face of all the 
opposition which has been voiced. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is rather odd, in that context, with the overwhelming support 
of Canadians for this bill which would essentially outlaw 
negative billing, that the Sub-committee on Private Members' 
Business of the Standing Committee on Procedure and House Affairs 
would not recognize that overwhelming support and deem this bill 
votable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are a number of forces lodged against the interests of 
consumers with regard to banning negative billing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a nefarious practice because, as I mentioned, Canadians 
have no choice, if they are to receive cable services, but to 
respond to the terms of payment offered by their cable companies. 
I think it is only right, in the context of that monopoly 
situation, that this House respond appropriately to resolve the 
question in the interests of Canadian consumers.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Whatever difficulties there may be—and I would not want to 
underestimate them—with the delivery of services in French, we 
should not respond to this legislation in a way which is contrary 
to the interests of millions and millions of other Canadians.  We 
must therefore respond to those concerns in a different way and 
seek other approaches to the problem without undermining the 
interests of all other Canadian consumers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would end on one final point with regard to whether or not 
this House is going to have the opportunity to vote on this piece 
of legislation again at some stage.  As I mentioned, had there 
not been an election called last year this would now be in effect 
and Canadian consumers would be protected.  I think that is 
fairly clear. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we continue to deny members of this House the opportunity to 
have this bill voted on, then it challenges the government's 
commitment to addressing this particular concern.  If indeed the 
members from the Bloc continue to refuse unanimous consent for 
this bill to be votable, then the matter falls fairly squarely on 
the Minister of Canadian Heritage and we can then watch as she 
decides what she will do; whether she will respond on behalf of 
Canadian consumers or whether she will respond on behalf of the 
number of cable companies that are supportive of this practice 
which is contrary to the interests of Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On that note, I would ask that this House grant unanimous 
consent for this bill to be deemed votable.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mark Muise (West Nova, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise today 
to speak in favour of Bill C-288.  Much has been said on this 
very important subject by my other colleagues so I will be brief 
in my remarks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Sarnia—Lambton brought forward a similar bill, 
known then as Bill C-216, in the last Parliament.  I want to take 
this opportunity to thank my colleague from Sarnia—Lambton for 
having brought back this private member's bill.  It is 
unfortunate, however, that his efforts and those of many in this 
House and in the other place will not reach fruition again. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill provides for the necessary changes to the Broadcasting 
Act in order to prevent negative option billing for new specialty 
services. This bill is the only way the House can respond to the 
consumers who are asking for a decision on this issue. Unfortunately, 
this bill is not a votable item. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During second reading of Bill C-216 in the last Parliament, my 
colleagues from the other place defended the French language pay tv and 
specialty services. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My party shared its concerns with the Fédération des communautés 
francophones et acadienne du Canada, the Canadian Cable 
Television Association and the Société des Acadiens et Acadiennes 
du Nouveau-Brunswick among others, and then brought forward 
amendments to the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The proposed change still aims to protect the consumers, which is 
the main purpose of the bill. It also answers the main concerns about 
the delivery of French language services, mainly the availability and 
cost of specialty services in French. The proposed amendment to the bill 
is a compromise which would facilitate the delivery of services to the 
French communities. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have consulted with the Fédération des communautés 
francophones et acadienne du Canada and the Canadian Association 
of Broadcasters and both were in favour of this amendment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill, as amended by the Senate in the last Parliament, 
would have gone a long way in preventing the CRTC from gouging 
its consumers.  When Bill C-216 died on the Order Paper last 
April, when the Liberals called an election after only three and 
half years in office, it looked like the CRTC was about to back 
off, but it has not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we take my own experience in Ottawa, Rogers Cable has been 
pushing the ME-TV package for months.  It offered a free 
subscription for a couple of months and consumers were told that 
billing would start for this package after Christmas if they 
chose to keep the service. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What Rogers was not saying last fall was that if we chose not to 
take the package at $6.95 a month we had to pay $2 more a month. 
That does not sound like a very good deal for the consumer.  On 
the one hand you have to pay $6.95 for 15 channels although you 
may only want one.  On the other hand if you do not want any, you 
get charged $2.00 more per month.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Raymonde Folco (Laval West, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like to 
join in the debate on Bill C-288, an act to amend the Broadcasting Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With regard to this bill, we must think first and foremost about 
Canadian consumers. The hon. member for Sarnia—Lambton deserves our 
praises for bringing their concerns to our attention. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When broadcasting started only radio existed. Even then, the 
Parliament of Canada saw fit to pass legislation in this area to meet 
the needs of consumers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Indeed, for over 60 years, as the network has been expanding, 
successive parliaments have used their powers to ensure that Canadians 
have access to quality programming produced by Canadians, as well as to 
the best programs from abroad. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a fundamental characteristic of Canadian broadcasting, 
which has remained the same in spite of the many technical changes we 
have witnessed regarding radio, and television where programs were 
initially in black and white, then in colour; first programs were 
received using a conventional antenna, then came cable TV and other 
forms of transmission including direct-to-home satellite broadcasting. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There have been changes not only in transmission techniques, but 
also in programming formulas and choice of packages offered. 
Traditional television stations and networks are now competing with 
a broad range of specialized offerings, as well as the pay TV 
channels and pay-for-view TV. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These changes and improvements have not been without their 
problems, as this bill shows. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have, however, always found a way to solve the problems 
caused by changes in broadcasting, and to attune the Canadian 
broadcast network to the needs and interests of Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This will continue to be our main focus and we owe thanks to 
the hon. member for Sarnia—Lambton for having brought to our 
attention the problems associated with the launching of specialized 
television services in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the past 30 years, Parliament has entrusted the CRTC, the 
Canadian Radio-Television and Telecommunications Commission, with 
the mandate under the Broadcasting Act of regulating and monitoring 
the Canadian broadcast network so as to implement the policy 
objectives set out in that act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Generally speaking, this has worked well and I am convinced 
the CRTC will continue to take Canadian public opinion into 
consideration, and to strike a fair balance in its search for the 
means to realize the policy objectives set for it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The hon. member for Sarnia—Lambton has 
the floor. His speech will put an end to the debate on this item.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to thank my colleagues from the Reform Party, the New

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also want to say how surprised I am by the culture critic for 
the Bloc.  The member has laid out a number of the same old 
stories but has failed to recognize the new paradigm which 
occurred. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill was endorsed by the specialty services association in 
the province of Quebec at the Senate when it was amended there. 
It is now amended and is here, yet the member refuses to 
recognize that. This bill was endorsed by the association of 
francophones and Acadians outside Quebec when it left the other 
place and is now here in the same form.  She denies that that 
occurred. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. critic for the Bloc has said that Quebec law prohibits 
negative option billing.  If that is the case, then perhaps the 
hon. critic can tell us why in the province of Quebec Videotron 
is doing it and has been doing it since September 1997. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was called to do several interviews on this topic.  Perhaps 
the Bloc can enlighten us and tell us why consumers were 
complaining in Quebec and why when they complained to the 
provincial consumer office they were told that nothing could be 
done because it was federal legislation.   Is this the new 
realization?  Is this the new life of the Bloc? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also like to point out that it was said in a speech by 
another member from this side of the House that the CRTC has been 
doing a good job for the last 30 years.  I have to disagree with 
that person.  I have to suggest that the speech came directly 
from the Department of Canadian Heritage and was not a speech of 
that member. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact is that Canadians are not protected, whether they be in 
Ontario, Quebec, British Columbia or Prince Edward Island. 
Canadians are tired of this arbitrary treatment. Notwithstanding 
what Bloc members might think, they are simply standing in the 
way of all Canadians, including their constituents and my 
constituents, in this matter for very dogmatic reasons which are 
best known to them and quite frankly not understood by anyone 
else.  This includes the consumers associations in that province. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That being said, as I stated earlier, the time has arrived for 
members in this place to do something for the people they 
represent.  We represent the people who pay the bills.  We do not 
represent the large corporate interests in cable production which 
exist across this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That being noted, I would like to move another motion in 
conclusion.  I seek unanimous consent to move the following 
motion: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That the order for second reading be withdrawn and that the 
subject matter of this bill be referred to the Standing Committee 
on Canadian Heritage. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to make it clear in moving that motion that I am 
not referring the bill to the committee.  I am not asking that 
the bill be declared a votable item.  I am simply asking that the 
subject matter of this bill be referred to the Standing Committee 
on Canadian Heritage.  Mr. Speaker, I ask that you seek unanimous 
consent on that point. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  Does the hon. member have unanimous 
consent to propose this motion to the House? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  No. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  There is no consent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The time provided for the consideration of Private Members'

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Casey (Cumberland—Colchester, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
the parliamentary secretary will be a little familiar with this 
question because I have asked it several times and I never get 
the right answer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I urge the parliamentary secretary to listen to the question, 
think, and answer for himself, not a canned written answer by the 
department.  This is not a highway issue.  It is not a provincial 
issue.  It is an issue of government responsibility on behalf of 
the federal government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In September 1995 the federal government signed an agreement to 
put $16.2 million into a highway on one condition. That condition 
was that the province put $16.2 million into that highway as 
well.  That is $16.2 of taxpayers' hard earned money. They each 
agreed to put $16.2 million into it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, as soon as the federal money was in, the province 
removed its $16.2 million.  All of the government money is 
entirely the federal contribution of $16.2 million. Even though 
the province agreed to split this 50:50 it does not have one red 
cent in this section of highway. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We contend that it is the federal minister's responsibility for 
the $16.2 million. He was entrusted by the taxpayers of Canada to 
look after that $16.2 million and he cannot look the other way 
any longer.  He must and he should and I hope he will act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is worse than that.  It is worse than the fact that the 
province of New Brunswick took its $16.2 million out. The New 
Brunswick minister of transport recently said it was always the 
province's intention to recover the provincial share.  Here 
Sheldon Lee was signing a contract saying the province was going 
to put 50% into this highway but on the side he says it was 
always the province's intention to not honour its word and take 
its 50% back. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is even worse than that.  Even though the province of New 
Brunswick is signing a contract saying it will put in $16.2 
million if the federal government puts in $16.2 million, the 
minister of finance for the province of New Brunswick, Mr. Edmond 
Blanchard, said “We have always intended that the provincial 
money we invested in these sections of road would be recovered”. 
Here they were, signing a contract saying the province was going 
to put 50% in when it had absolutely no intention of doing so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister said yesterday and at other times in this House 
that he will never let it happen again anywhere. He even 
acknowledged yesterday that there is an issue that has to be 
dealt with in future agreements.  However, he is obligated to fix 
this agreement and not future ones, that they will look after 
themselves but this agreement must be fixed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The $16.2 million of federal taxpayers' money must be accounted 
for.  The contract is not completed yet.  It does not expire 
until the end of March.  The highway is not finished.  The 
minister must tell the province of New Brunswick to put the money 
back, just like the province agreed to do in September 1995. It 
is not complicated.  The province agreed to put $16.2 million 
into this highway.  It has not put in one red cent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Will the parliamentary secretary now tell the minister to tell 
the province of New Brunswick to put the money back and carry on 
with enforcing the contract in the same way it always should 
have? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other question is why are the people of New Brunswick being 
subjected to this foolishness when no other Canadians will be 
subjected to it in the future according to the minister?  The 
minister said he would not allow this to happen anymore, anywhere 
else.  Why is New Brunswick being forced to take this treatment?

for the answer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to give the hon. member who is asking the question my 
interpretation of the facts as I see them in an answer that he 
surely will respect. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>New Brunswick has chosen to operate a new Fredericton to Moncton 
highway as a public-private partnership using tolls.  The 
province announced on January 23, 1998 that Maritime Road 
Development Corporation was to construct and operate a 195 
kilometre four lane controlled access highway from Longs Creek, 
west of Fredericton to Magnetic Hill, west of Moncton. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The total capital cost of this project was $887 million.  The 
cost includes new construction at $584 million plus the payment 
to the provinces for work completed or under way on various 
sections of $123 million, which does not include the $32 million 
federal contribution, plus land costs and construction interest 
costs. The overall agreement is for 50 years.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The highway will be open by November 30, 2001, but New Brunswick 
plans to start collecting tolls on the existing four lane 
Trans-Canada Highway between Moncton and River Glade starting 
July 1998. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The current provincial highway financing agreements are silent 
on tolls as they were never contemplated at the time the programs 
were established.  The federal government has no legal basis to 
prevent provinces from imposing tolls on provincial highways, 
including those highways that have received federal 
contributions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government entered into these highway agreements 
because it wished to accelerate the construction of safer and 
more efficient highways.  In this case New Brunswick has advised 
that the federal contributions are being deducted against the 
cost base that would be used to establish the tolls and the 
annual provincial payment for the remaining capital cost. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope the hon. member is absorbing all these important facts 
because he has hit a dead end on this road—

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvon Godin (Acadie—Bathurst, NDP):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to speak, in the four minutes I have, on the important 
issue I raised in this House in December, and that is the natural 
gas pipeline running from Sable Island to the United States by way 
of Moncton. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important to speak on this, because, as a representative 
of northern New Brunswick, I know we have already asked to have the 
pipeline pass through our region. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We would have used it as infrastructure to attract business 
and create jobs in the region.  At the moment, business people back 
home have had studies made demonstrating the importance of it. 
I think the government should be interested in what we have to say, 
which is that the pipeline should pass through northern New 
Brunswick and right on through, even as far as Bernier, Quebec. 
That is what you would call a national line, like the national 
railway, which goes from the west to the east. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is one way to develop our region and create jobs there. 
More than just viability should be considered.  I think it 
important to invest in creating jobs in northern New Brunswick. 
This is the sort of investment we need.  Back home, some 19.6% of 
people are on employment insurance, when what we need is investment 
to create jobs. 
People want to work. That is what they want, and we must take the 
necessary measures to give them jobs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We already have the port of Belledune, which created jobs in our 
region. If we had the natural gas pipeline, it would create further 
opportunities for us. We must see it this way. I am not opposed to the 
natural gas pipeline going through southern New Brunswick only, I am 
even happy about that, but any industry coming to New Brunswick will go 
where the pipeline is. Once again, the northern part of the province 
will not have the opportunity to grow. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we want northern New Brunswick to grow, we must give it the 
necessary tools. And that is one way to invest. We must not only see 
this in terms of viability, but as a way of investing in the northern 
part of New Brunswick. 
The same goes for other areas, like western New Brunswick. We cannot 
just turn our backs on them, without taking some kind of initiative to 
stimulate employment in the region. This is important. It is especially 
important, since fisheries in our part of the country has been all but 
shut down. The cod fishery has been shut down, and the crab quotas and 
everything else have disappeared. That is why it is so important to 
invest in the infrastructure of this region. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why I wholeheartedly recommend that the federal government 
think about setting up this line in northern New Brunswick. The Liberals 
may make jokes but they too are in favour, for they are watching New 
Brunswick—

projects would be studied by the Standing Committee on Natural 
Resources.  I think that was the tone and tenor of the question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the Minister of Natural Resources pointed out at that time, 
the Sable gas projects had already been studied for 10 months by 
an independent federal-provincial review panel. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The joint review panel was created in September 1996 to perform 
a single window review of the offshore and onshore Sable gas 
projects to satisfy the requirements of the National Energy 
Board. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Prior to its formal hearings the joint panel held 20 informal 
sessions in communities throughout the maritimes to provide 
information on the projects and to seek public input on the scope 
of the review to be conducted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Following this the panel held 56 days of formal public hearings

However, probably the time to act as a good member of Parliament 
was at those sessions in his own riding.

the company will be taking.  Of course laterals are being

that is very worth while.  Perhaps the member could spend a

recognition of aboriginal self-government and a true working 
partnership of aboriginal peoples must be more than just words. 
There must be sincere commitment evidenced by concrete positive 
action. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government must not remain silent on important 
issues such as land claims and the sharing of natural resources. 
These two issues are fundamental to the concept of 
self-government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Governments should be taking the lead in resolving these issues 
through negotiation rather than leaving them to costly and 
confrontational court action.  A true partnership is built not 
upon confrontation but upon consultation and mutual respect. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How much consultation was there prior to the government's 
statement of reconciliation on January 7, 1998, at which time 
four out of five aboriginal leaders expressed disappointment with 
the process leading to that statement and with the statement 
itself? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Where was the spirit of partnership and mutual respect when 
Canada's head of state, the Prime Minister, failed to appear at 
what was intended to be a very significant response to the report 
of the Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples argued that the right 
of self-determination was vested in all aboriginal peoples of 
Canada and that this right entitled aboriginal peoples to 
negotiate the terms of their relationship with Canada and to 
establish government structures that they considered appropriate 
for their needs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The commission further proposed section 35(1) of the 
Constitution Act, recognizing and affirming aboriginal inherent 
right to self-government.  That right became constitutionally 
entrenched, thereby providing a basis for aboriginal governments 
to function as one of three distinct orders of government in 
Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The commission spoke in favour of negotiations as a means of 
developing self-government arrangements and clarifying the 
distribution of powers between governments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Recent court decisions such as the court decision in New 
Brunswick concerning the right of aboriginal peoples to harvest 
trees on crown lands points to the need for negotiations around 
self-government, the distribution of powers and sharing of 
natural resources. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The importance of negotiations is also emphasized in one of the 
most significant cases of the Supreme Court of Canada, the 
Delgamuukw case.  This case involved land claims, aboriginal 
rights, aboriginal title and self-government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While reaching many important conclusions around the issue of 
aboriginal rights, aboriginal title and the importance of oral 
history in determining such issues, the court ordered a new trial 
regarding the specific land claims under dispute.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important to note that although ordering a new trial the 
court was not encouraging the parties to settle their dispute 
through the court but rather through negotiations in the spirit 
of the self-government principle recognized in the Constitution 
Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The court stated that the best approach in these types of cases 
is a process of negotiation and reconciliation that properly 
considers the complex and competing interests at stake. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The court concluded that the crown is under a moral if not a 
legal duty to enter into and conduct these negotiations in good 
faith.  Ultimately, through such negotiation with give and take 
on all sides, we will achieve “the reconciliation of the 
pre-existence of aboriginal societies with the sovereignty of the 
crown”.  The chief justice concluded “let us face it, we are 
all here to stay”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the spirit of that statement I call upon the federal 
government to negotiate in good faith with aboriginal peoples to 
resolve issues around land claims, the sharing of natural 
resources and self-government.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Stan Keyes (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Transport, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, permit me to respond to the 
hon. member for Halifax West on behalf of the Minister of Indian 
Affairs and Northern Development. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1995 the federal government demonstrated considerable 
leadership with the announcement of its policy on aboriginal 
self-government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government is acting on the premise that the inherent right 
of self-government is an existing aboriginal right within our 
constitution.  Our approach sets aside the legal and 
constitutional debates that have stymied process toward 
aboriginal self-government.  Instead we are working to negotiate 
practical arrangements that give aboriginal communities the tools 
they need to exercise greater control over their lives and to 
make tangible improvements in their communities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Aboriginal self-government will be exercised within the existing 
Canadian constitutional framework.  This emphasizes that the goal 
of self-government is to enhance the participation of aboriginal 
people within Canadian society, not place them outside it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, the federal government is committed to the 
principle that the Charter of Rights and Freedoms will apply to 
aboriginal governments just as it does to all other governments 
in Canada.  It must also be emphasized that the responsibility of 
governments to be politically and financially accountable to 
their members applies to aboriginal governments no less than to 
others. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The issues surrounding self-government are multifaceted and 
complex.  This was confirmed in the report of the Royal 
Commission on Aboriginal Peoples.  The Government of Canada 
agreed and responded with “Gathering Strength—Canada's 
Aboriginal Action Plan”.  One of the objectives of this plan is 
to strengthen aboriginal governance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development has 
agreed to convene as soon as possible a 
federal-provincial-territorial meeting of ministers responsible 
for aboriginal affairs and national aboriginal leaders that will 
focus partners on concrete results. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Progress is being made.  Self-government initiatives are under 
way in almost every province and territory in Canada, whether in 
the context of treaty discussions in British Columbia, through 
education negotiations in Ontario and Nova Scotia, in 
province-wide initiatives in Saskatchewan or other venues.  As we 
attempt to complete this great unfinished business in our 
history, understanding and generosity will be required of all 
sides.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jean Dubé (Madawaska—Restigouche, PC):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
first part of the question I asked on November 24 called on the 
government to substantially lower EI premiums. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since even the EI fund's actuary says that the fund could be 
sustained with $2 premiums, I still do not understand why the 
government is stubbornly continuing to block job creation with 
overly high premiums. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government is congratulating itself on having lowered EI 
premiums by a paltry 10 cents in December. 
They are perhaps going to say they have lowered them from $3.30 to 
$2.70, but this is 1998.  So we will be listening to what my hon. 
colleague has to say. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Payroll taxes, however, CPP and EI premiums, were $5.50 when 
the Liberals took office.  They now stand at $5.90, or 40 cents 
more.  And that is just the beginning, because with the CPP 
amendments, Canadians will be paying $11 billion more over the next 
five years.

</I></B></P><P align=left>It is hard to believe that the government could be so arrogant as 
to claim that employers and workers who will have to pay these 
additional premiums are happy with the situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second part of my question dealt with the auditor general's 
mandate regarding the CPP investment board. His access to the board's 
books is limited to the information needed to audit the fund's general 
accounts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He is not allowed to conduct value-for-money audits or check if the 
board abides by the law, and report his findings to Parliament. This is 
of great concern. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A few months ago, the auditor general informed Parliament of abuses 
within the Canada Labour Relations Board. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He will not be able to do the same regarding the CPP investment 
board, which manages the money of thousands of Canadians. The stakes are 
much higher. And yet, as elected representatives, we will not have a

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Robert D. Nault (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Human Resources Development, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, first I want 
to say to the House and to the nation I am almost shocked that a 
Conservative member would stand in this place and criticize the 
government about EI and EI premiums. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, you will recall because you were elected in 1988, 
the same as I was, that during that period between 1988 and 1993 
the government under Brian Mulroney, the party that the member 
now serves with, raised those premiums higher than any level in 
our history.  In the middle of a recession no less it raised 
those premiums from $2.60 to $3.30, an insurmountable amount for 
any employer and employee to deal with.  That is why I say to you 
and the people out there I cannot believe this member would even 
bring this subject matter up. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me make it very clear to the member that we are undertaking 
to reduce the premiums for employment insurance as rapidly as we 
can.  In fact, we have reduced premiums in the employment 
insurance system four years running, the largest reduction in the 
history of the EI premium and EI system as a whole.  There has 
never been any government that has reduced premiums every year 
for four years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will give another statistic.  The reduction in the last budget 
for 1998 is the second largest since 1972.  If the member does 
not understand that this government is fiscally prudent and if he 
does not understand what it means to have a surplus in the EI 
account for a rainy day, then he has a long way to go. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before we are done we will continue to reduce premiums at a rate 
we believe is sustainable.  We will make sure there is a 
surplus— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  I am sorry to interrupt the hon. 
parliamentary secretary, but the time has expired.

Accordingly, the House stands adjourned until tomorrow at 10
