</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Adams (Peterborough, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, all 
across Canada there are colleges and universities, government and 
non-government research centres and individuals with great 
expertise in northern and polar studies. There are organizations 
like ACUNS and the Canadian Polar Commission that help 
co-ordinate northern studies and research, but we lack a major 
centre of excellence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The time has come to put in place a single major centre as a 
clearing house for such work, a centre which will co-ordinate and 
focus the extraordinary knowledge and experience which Canadians 
have of the north. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I urge federal departments that have special strengths in these 
matters, such as Indian and northern affairs, natural resources, 
industry, health, and foreign affairs to take a lead in this, 
beginning by better co-ordinating federal activities in northern 
research.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Maurice Vellacott (Wanuskewin, Canadian Alliance):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, yesterday the information commissioner, John Reid, 
appeared before the Standing Committee on Human Resources 
Development and revealed some pretty stunning information about 
the lengths to which the government has gone to cover up its own 
mishandling of taxpayers' money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since it became clear just how bad the problem at HRDC is, even 
completed audits have been withheld from us.  All it takes for 
the government to comply with such requests is to place those 
audits on the photocopy machine, but the government has been 
stalling and has not been answering requests for information 
within the legally required 30 day time period. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is the reason for the delay?  According to the information 
commissioner, Treasury Board and the Privy Council Office have 
taken on a greater role in the release of documents over the past 
month, mainly to prevent further public relations damage. Mr. 
Reid said, “Treasury Board and the Privy Council Office want to 
know what audits have been requested, whether they contain bad 
news, and what the official media line will be”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Who are we to believe?  The minister who says that the 
government is transparent, or the information commissioner who 
says we are witnessing a “government wide—”

special friendship between Canada and Israel.

to add my words of homage to those expressed by many business 
people in my riding earlier this week to Mr. Raymond Brunet. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Raymond Brunet is the head of Ed Brunet et associés, a Hull 
family business dating back nearly a century.  He deserves 
recognition for far more than his qualities as a businessman, 
however, as he is totally devoted to the Outaouais community. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Raymond Brunet's construction company has made a name for itself 
over close to four generations, and the community has benefited 
greatly from the family's store of knowledge. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Outaouais chamber of commerce and industry has named him 
Personality of the Year for 1999.  This recognition by his peers 
is mirrored by that of the community as a whole.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dan McTeague (Pickering—Ajax—Uxbridge, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, Canadians of the Muslim faith are celebrating Eid-Ul 
Adha, one of the major festivals of Islam. The festival is held 
each year to coincide with the pilgrimage to Mecca which itself 
is a major tenet of the Islamic faith. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Eid-Ul Adha is also a time for cultural and social gathering 
with family and friends. In that vein I am pleased once again to 
invite members of the House and the other place to attend the 
fifth annual Eid-Ul Adha ceremony on Parliament Hill.  The event 
will be taking place this evening in Room 200 West Block starting 
at 6 p.m. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope members will be able to join the celebration and 
recognize the important contribution the Muslim community makes 
to Canadian society.  To them we say <I>insh'allah</I> they will 
continue to prosper, <I>as-salaam alaikum</I>.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Gouk (Kootenay—Boundary—Okanagan, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, Highway 97 in the B.C. interior 
should be recognized as part of the national highway system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This highway is critical to the economy of the most densely 
populated region in the B.C. interior.  It is the principal 
non-toll link between the west coast and the rest of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, designation as part of the national highway system 
alone is not enough.  Parts of Highway 97 are badly in need of 
major repairs.  This costs money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last year the federal government extracted from B.C. motorists 
over $1 billion in fuel taxes designed to build and maintain the 
national highway system.  It put back less than $300 million 
nationally.  Pro-rated out, we got back a mere 3% of our own 
money.  That is not good enough. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government acts like it is doing us a big favour 
when it gives us back a tiny portion of our own money.  B.C. has 
the most challenging highway system in Canada and it is in need 
of repair. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I call on the federal government to return a more appropriate 
portion of our highway taxes so that B.C. motorists and visitors 
can drive safely on our highways.

at the time of the 1993 election, the Liberals promised to deal 
with shipbuilding, referring among other things to a summit that 
would be held the following year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Nothing has been done since.  The Liberal government has even 
been so bold as to purchase used ships and submarines from other

association has been making since 1996. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Moreover, 150,000 mail-in cards have been sent to the Prime

support the adoption of new measures to assist shipbuilding.

reported that the PQ government neglected to tell us that it had 
received the sum of $37 million from the federal government for 
farm income stabilization purposes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These situations are beginning to cause some concern.  Two weeks

</I></B></P><P align=left>The Prime Minister seems to be a little confused on how to 
approach the issue of health care.  Two weeks ago he sent the 
health minister to Alberta to chastise the province.  Seven days 
later the Prime Minister himself arrived to smooth things over. 
The next thing we know, the Prime Minister is blasting Ontario 
for bringing to light the federal government's serious lack of 
commitment in funding for health care.

tomorrow to co-operate in an effort to bring viable solutions to 
the table. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am a little uncertain how challenging Ontario will encourage 
the other provinces to approach the table with anything other 
than trepidation. The provinces have been placed in an impossible 
situation. Their pleas have so far fallen on deaf ears.  This

solving the problems.  The Liberals should talk.

</I></B></P><P align=left>A 10 cents per litre increase for 12 months costs consumers $4.5 
billion.  But suppose you live in St. John's, Newfoundland.  A

Newfoundland is now a producer of oil.  My own province of 
Saskatchewan is also an oil producer.  At 75 cents per litre we 
pay more than anyone else on the prairies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The point is, pump prices follow crude prices up very quickly 
but they sure take their time on the way down.  That threatens 
the inflation rate, our whole economy and it gouges consumers. 
Just because we have not yet seen the inflationary impact does 
not mean it is not a problem.  It took almost a year after the 
1973 and 1979 oil price shocks for the full impact to be felt.

benefit from a banking system that is one of the most stable,

soundness and stability of Canada's financial system, underpinned 
by the banking industry's strong financial position.

economy.  As major exporters of financial products and services, 
almost 50% of bank earnings are made outside the country. 
However, banks pay 80% of their taxes and base 90% of their jobs 
here in Canada.  The math clearly works to our benefit.

the HRDC minister tried to hide this one.  The information in it

</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me quote one phrase:  “In many interactions with HRD

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development,

been, but indeed we received the internal audit that we are

of control and that is why we are implementing the six point

the minister is referring to, but I am referring to the 1997-98 
briefing book for senior management. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These audits continue to come forward.  Let me quote again about 
the concerns of ethics:  “Weaknesses found in our special audit 
suggest that the old virtues of prudence, probity, economy, 
efficiency and effectiveness are not as deeply embedded in the

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development,

is to deal with the information in this audit and in all the 
audits that we receive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact that we are doing internal audits suggests that there 
is an increase in control.  The whole point of the undertaking 
before us now is to improve the controls; not to suck the 
information and the control back to Ottawa, but to find modern

</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me quote again:  “Only three in ten employees agree that 
people can voice concerns about ethical breaches without 
repercussion”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is 18 months old and these people are not satisfied with 
what the minister contends to be her solution to the problem.

Mr. Speaker, I think statements by ministers are at 3 o'clock. 
Let us get back to the news. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is actually bizarre is that this minister did nothing about 
this audit since 1998, until an access to information request was 
filed by the official opposition.  The minister says that she 
knew nothing about this problem until November but the audit 
clearly indicates that there were problems as far back as 1998. 
It is a disaster for her anytime one of these internal audits 
happens to slip out of her fingers because Canadians get to look 
at the rot that is going on in her department. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here is a quote from this report “Employees were not convinced 
that they could report suspected contraventions of ethics without 
fear of reprisal”.  What kinds of reprisals did employees in her 
department fear? 
<P><A NAME="LINK96"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development, 
Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the hon. member talks about a report from 
18 months ago.  That is two names ago for that party. 
Not much has changed there as a result of that, but a lot has 
happened in my department.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Grant McNally (Dewdney—Alouette, Canadian Alliance):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, what is unbelievable is that this minister tries to 
downplay the kind of scandal that is going on in her own 
department with these kinds of comments.  It is unbelievable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us go back to this report and look at another quote.  In 
this report it says that the communication on the importance of 
ethics has not taken place at the operational level.  Why not? 
<P><A NAME="LINK98"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development, 
Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the hon. member is talking about ethics. 
If members of that party had any ethics they would stand and 
apologize to the Canadian people for creating the myth that $3 
billion has gone missing as a result of work in my department. 
They would stand and say that it was not $1 billion.  They would 
stand and say to those communities, which they have cast 
aspersions on, and to those individuals in my riding who have 
received benefits from the grants and contributions, that they 
were wrong.

Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Health. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Tomorrow the minister will be meeting with his counterparts to 
discuss the crisis of health care in this country.  Everyone 
knows we need more federal cash in the system.  The Canadian 
Medical Association said that it wants full restoration of 
federal funding, plus an escalator mechanism to address future 
needs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In light of this, will the Minister of Health show some 
leadership tomorrow and guarantee us that there will be an offer 
of cash on the table with a plan to save medicare in this 
country.  Will he show that leadership tomorrow? 
<P><A NAME="LINK101"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I believe Canadians know that if we are going to solve the 
problems in medicare it will take more than just more money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The NDP may believe that the answer is simply to pour billions 
more into a system that is not serving Canadians well.  I can 
tell the member and the House that we believe, and I think 
Canadians agree, that we need a plan, a long term solution to 
make the system sustainable, as well as long term financing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Tomorrow we will begin a process, which may last several months,

<P><A NAME="LINK102"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lorne Nystrom (Regina—Qu'Appelle, NDP):</B>  Well, Mr.

</I></B></P><P align=left>This government is now in its seventh year in office.  Where is 
the plan?  The government has a plan for tax cuts but no plan for 
health care.  I want to know why there is not a plan for health 
care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Will he go to Toronto tomorrow with a plan and an offer of cash

<P><A NAME="LINK103"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
members of the NDP had a plan in their 1997 platform.  They said 
that we should have a floor of at least $15 billion for the 
Canada health and social transfer.  We have made it $15.5 
billion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They had a plan to put in $7 billion more to restore health 
cuts. We have now doubled that and put in $14 billion more. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In November 1998 the leader of that party stood in the House and 
said that what we really needed was $2.5 billion more in health 
care.  Since then we have put $14 billion more into health care.

Mr. Speaker, tonight on the <I>Fifth Estate</I> Canadians will be

12 year old Lynn Harper 40 years ago.  At age 14 he was sentenced 
to death and ultimately spent 10 years in prison for a crime he 
claims he did not commit.  Shocking new evidence suggests that 
there was compelling evidence in the hands of DND officials that 
would have exonerated Truscott. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Based on what could be the most egregious miscarriage of justice 
in Canadian history, will the minister agree that it is incumbent 
upon her department to conduct a full public inquiry into this

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Anne McLellan (Minister of Justice and Attorney General

</I></B></P><P align=left>First, I want to thank the minister on behalf of Canadians all 
across the country for one of the best and most effective budgets 
in Canadian history. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, I do have one concern and that is the focus on debt 
reduction.  I believe it is critical that we aggressively address 
our debt so future generations do not incur the same debt burden 
that we have had to. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Will the minister please expand on whether he supports an 
increased focus on debt reduction? 
<P><A NAME="LINK112"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, we are one of the few industrial countries that is 
actually retiring its debt, $6.5 billion over the last two years, 
over $20 billion of market debt.  Our debt to GDP ratio was at 
71% four years ago and today it is at 61%.  It will be below 50%

</I></B></P><P align=left>I quote from the 1998 audit of HRDC for senior management.  That

“Whether dealing with our special audits or the survey, often 
there appears to be a reluctance to share information about 
unfavourable results”.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Libby Davies (Vancouver East, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, if 
failing medicare is not bad enough, the government has also 
failed on its promise to promote the health of children through a 
national child care program.  This week in B.C. the government 
lived up to its promise for child care to give B.C. kids a 
healthy head start. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask the minister why has her government broken its promises so 
many times to families desperately needing child care?  No more 
vacuous words, where are the federal dollars to back up the 
commitment so that all kids can benefit? 
<P><A NAME="LINK121"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development,

Columbia is able to produce these services is because of the 
national child benefit, the income support provided by this 
government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I point out that in the most recent budget we have increased 
that contribution through the Canada child tax benefit and the 
national child benefit by $2.5 billion.  By 2004 a family of four 
earning under $25,000 will receive tax free and fully indexed 
$4,600.

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>BILL C-206—SPEAKER'S RULING 
</H4><P align=left>

<P><A NAME="LINK129"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>   I am now prepared to rule on a point of 
order raised on Friday, March 24, 2000 by the hon. member for 
Prince George—Peace River, the whip of the official opposition, 
concerning the status of private member's Bill C-206. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to thank the hon. member for drawing this issue to 
the Chair's attention, as well as the hon. member for 
Wentworth—Burlington for his careful outline of events on March 
27.  I also thank the parliamentary secretary to the government 
House leader for his contribution to the discussion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The point in question arises from an earlier ruling delivered by 
the Chair on March 21 in which the list of 100 signatures filed 
in support of Bill C-206 pursuant to Standing Order 87(6) was 
declared invalid. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member for Wentworth—Burlington was informed that it 
would be necessary to submit a new list of signatures if the bill 
is to be proceeded with under the provisions of that standing 
order.  The hon. member for Prince George—Peace River protested 
the fact that rather than submit the list of 100 signatures, Bill 
C-206 had instead been part of an exchange of items of private 
members' business.  He argued that the item was therefore not 
legitimately on the order of precedence and was preventing other 
members from proceeding with their items under that provision of 
the standing orders. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member for Wentworth—Burlington indicated to the House 
that the exchange had been necessary for reasons of ill health 
and that the Speaker's earlier ruling had not precluded an 
exchange of items if such was necessary. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have carefully reviewed all of the elements of this case, 
including the original issue raised with respect to Bill C-206, 
the proceedings in the procedure and House affairs committee that 
dealt with it and the 19th report of the committee tabled in the 
House on March 17. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The issue here, as I see it, is one of fairness both to the hon. 
member for Wentworth—Burlington and to other members who are 
prepared to advance items of private members' business for which 
they have gathered lists of at least 100 signatures. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While my earlier ruling on Bill C-206 did not preclude any 
exchanges, I wish to make it clear that it is an item in 
abeyance in the order of precedence.  At the same time, I feel 
now, as I did then, that given the special circumstances of this 
case, the hon. member should be given a reasonable opportunity 
to file a new list. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is one of those decisions where one tries to be fair to all 
sides.  Consequently, what I am prepared to allow the hon. member 
for Wentworth—Burlington to do is to have a further five sitting 
days beginning tomorrow, March 30, in which to file a new list of 
signatures.  In the meantime, his item will return to and remain 
at the bottom of the list. If after those five sitting days no 
list has been filed pursuant to Standing Order 87(6), I will 
order the bill to be dropped from the order of precedence and 
placed on the list of items outside the order.  It will in that 
case remain eligible for selection in the next draw. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I thank all hon. members for their assistance in this matter.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Question No. 75—<B>Mr. Leon E. Benoit:</B> 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>How much money have Canadian farmers lost due to crop loses 
since the government's ban of the 2% and 5% solutions of 
strychnine left them unable to effectively control the gopher 
populations? 
</UL>
<P><A NAME="LINK172"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lyle Vanclief (Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food, 
Lib.):</B> There has been limited, if any, economic loss to Canadian 
farmers due to restrictions on the use of strychnine based 
rodenticides for the following reasons: strychnine based poisons 
are available to licensed applicators; anti-coagulants are 
readily available; strychnine poison alone is not an effective 
control measure; and an integrated strategy for controlling 
pocket gophers is recommended and is the most effective method. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Each province has regulations for the use of strychnine. In 
Saskatchewan, for example, the sale of strychnine is restricted 
to pest control operators, farmers and persons authorized in 
government approved pest control programs where the vendor 
maintains a record of sales including the name, address and 
signature of the purchaser along with the quantity of product 
purchased. The vendor, who in this case is Saskatchewan 
Association of Rural Municipalities, may have further 
restrictions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The annual losses in yield reductions and equipment breakdown 
from pocket gophers for the province of Alberta has been 
estimated at $14 million to $30 million annually. For the province of 
Manitoba losses are estimated at $15 million annually. No 
published data could be located for economic losses Canada-wide. 
In 1997, 3.5 million to 5 million hectares of forage, primarily 
alfalfa, in western Canada was infested with pocket gophers. The 
reductions in productivity and damage to equipment are 
significant and control is necessary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Control of pocket gophers requires an integrated approach. There 
are various types of control methods to reduce pocket gopher 
populations. Control methods include trapping, gassing, flooding, 
exclusion, encouraging natural enemies, and poisoning. Trapping 
has proven to be an extremely effective control but is labour 
intensive and is limited in the area one can control. Physical 
control can include removing the food source, using pets to 
discourage entrance into a yard, and noises, disturbing noise 
placed in the burrow. Buffer zones are effective in isolating 
certain areas from pocket gophers. An example of a buffer could 
include spraying the surrounding area with a broadleaf herbicide 
which would eliminate the pocket gopher's food source. Natural 
predators such as owls and snakes will assist in control of 
pocket gophers, providing their existence is promoted and 
encouraged. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are three types of rodenticides available on the market to 
control pocket gophers: strychnine based, zinc phosphide based 
and anti-coagulants. Strychnine and zinc phosphide are both 
restricted and generally limited to use by licensed pesticide 
applicators. Anti-coagulants are readily available to everyone. 
Pocket gophers are very sensitive to the taste of poisons and 
readily reject or limit intake of many poisons. They also have an 
ability to metabolize certain amounts of these poisons and there 
have been reports of resistance to poisons if provided in 
sub-lethal doses. Field studies have shown that using strychnine 
or zinc phosphide based poisons controlled 35% or less of treated 
pocket gopher populations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The recommended method of controlling pocket gophers is 
called a border control strategy. This is used on fields which 
were seeded in the last three years. This strategy requires the 
trapping of gophers in the center of the field—new fields are 
recommended as populations of gophers are low—and setting up 
permanent control around the perimeter of the field using traps 
alone or a combination of traps and bait set in existing burrows. 
This strategy prevents pocket gophers from entering a clean 
field.

this House approves in general the budgetary policy of the 
government. 
<P><A NAME="LINK179"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski—Mitis, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am

<A HREF="#LINKT17"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Each year, as February approaches, there is feverish 
anticipation in the population. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For some weeks during the fall, the government, via the Standing 
Committee on Finance, consults the public about its needs and 
expectations in connection with the upcoming budget.  Because it 
is important for the greatest number of individuals and 
organizations to be heard, the committee in question travels and 
holds public hearings in the major cities of Canada.  And I 
thank all those who took part in these consultations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then February rolls around, and the media start getting 
involved. 
Day after day we are exposed to their hypotheses on what good or 
bad news to expect in the budget speech.  The closer we get to 
D-Day, the more the press and broadcast media abound with 
rumours and scoops. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then the Minister of Finance's moment of glory arrives.  The 
cameras are all focussed on him, and while he is releasing his 
budget to the entire deputation together in the House of 
Commons, the journalists are writing their stories for the next 
day's paper, or interviewing analysts who comment on the good 
and the bad news in the budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Year after year, the scenario never changes. 
Some groups are better organized than others and they are more 
successful at getting themselves heard by government members. 
They often retain the services of lobbyists, who are sometimes 
former members of parliament or former ministers of the party in 
office. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These groups manage to get themselves heard and some decisions 
are made in accordance with their representations. For other 
groups that are often have no voice, or that have no way of 
presenting their case to the governments, the situation is more 
critical. Their expectations are never met. These groups are 
often disappointed by the budget, because their expectations are 
not met, even though they were repeated in every city in Canada 
the committee travelled to. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For several days after the budget speech, opposition parties 
usually ask the government, during oral question period, about 
anything that was not included in the budget, or about what has 
been part of the public's expectations for several years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But this year things were different. Three of the four 
opposition parties totally ignored the budget brought down by 
the Liberal majority, because of the administrative scandals 
that currently exist within the government, in several 
departments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Prime Minister, the Minister of Finance and all the Liberal 
members were disappointed by the behaviour of opposition 
members, but we had no choice, given the magnitude of the 
scandals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In spite of this rather exceptional situation, I am taking this 
opportunity to say a few words on the budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would be curious to know what people took from the latest 
budget read in this House barely a month ago.  I think the 
operation held some striking surprises, so disappointing was 
this budget and in so many ways. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The money set aside in it for health care is not enough to 
permit the provinces to rebalance their budgets in this field. 
The federal government ignored the call by the provincial 
premiers and territorial leaders for a return of the transfer 
payments to the levels of 1994, and, worse yet, the cuts 
announced in previous budgets have been maintained.  The 
Minister of Finance decided to put the sum of $2.5 billion, a 
one time grant, in trust. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There was little in the latest budget for the unemployed. 
The eligibility criteria for benefits remain unchanged, and 
seasonal workers will continue to be unjustly penalized by the 
employment insurance reform.  The unemployed have become a real 
cash cow for the Liberal government.  In budget 2000, the 
government confirms it diverted a surplus of $6.5 billion in 
1999-00 and that it expects a surplus of $5.6 billion in 2000-01. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>According to the government's chief actuary, the accumulated 
surplus will reach $31.356 billion by the end of 2000.

<A HREF="#LINKT18"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a scandal that the government is collecting over $31 
billion in contributions, not to provide a temporary income for 
the unemployed, since 60% of them receive no benefits, but first 
to reduce the government's deficit and then to give the 
government some manoeuvring room. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today, we can say that the pot is being used to cut the taxes of 
the wealthiest and to fund the federal government's invasion of 
the jurisdictions of Quebec and the provinces, including their 
jurisdiction over health care, but not to improve the situation 
of workers unfortunate enough to lose their job. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a consolation prize, budget 2000 proposes lower premiums but, 
strictly speaking, the government has given no formal 
undertaking to this effect.  The worst thing in this horrific 
scenario is that the Minister of Finance calls this tax relief. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, the current EI system discriminates against women, 
particularly those wishing to take maternity leave.  It is true 
that the government is preparing to increase EI coverage during 
maternity leave from six months to one year.  However this 
Canada-wide intention is not what families in Quebec have in 
mind.  The Government of Quebec has its own plans, but the 
Liberals do not want to negotiate.  Once again, they have 
thumbed their nose at the consensus in Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In response to questions from the Bloc Quebecois in the House, 
the Minister of Finance is refusing to make any improvements to 
the EI system. 
Like the Coalition sur l'assurance-emploi, the Bloc Quebecois has 
long been demanding that the EI system become a real insurance 
scheme again and that premiums be used only for the purposes set 
out in the Employment Insurance Act.  But no improvements are 
planned. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As for social housing, the budget contains only a few scraps. 
The plan of the minister and the member for Moncton could be 
called “In search of social housing lost”.  Since the early 
1990s, those in inadequate housing have paid the price of 
budgetary restraint. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no way $268 million over five years—or $54 million 
annually—will do the trick.  For Quebec, this comes to less than 
$20 million a year.  One per cent of budgets—between $1.6 and 
$1.7 billion more a year—would have been reasonable. 
While it would not have met all needs, it would have helped to 
bring the number of available units into line with today's 
realities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the budget 2000 speech, the Minister of Finance said the 
following, and I quote: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Secure social programs that recognize that real progress is made 
by reaching for the top, not racing to the bottom. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does this mean that his government places social housing and 
those without adequate housing at the bottom of the heap? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A lot more could be said about the inadequacies of this budget—it 
will certainly not be one for which the Minister of Finance will 
go down in history.  Most observers are agreed that surpluses 
will be between $115 and $150 billion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois' conservative estimate puts it at $137 billion 
over five years.  We therefore think it obvious that the 
Minister of Finance could have done much more with the surpluses 
than he did this year.  For instance, he could have come up with 
$3 billion annually over the next five years for an 
infrastructure program.  Unfortunately, the Minister of Finance 
did just what he needed not to get his name in the history 
books.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
listened with interest to the comments of the member.  Certainly 
the comments about lobbyists and special interest groups 
reflected the reality of a democracy.  That is why, as 
legislators, we have to be open to the input of all Canadians and 
balance the legitimacy of their claims with the needs and 
priorities of all Canadians.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The comments with regard to health care were appropriate because 
health care is the most significant priority for Canadians.  We 
know that health care costs will rise in Canada.  They are rising 
already, due to population growth, due to the aging of our 
society, due to the cost of new technology and certainly the cost 
of pharmacare. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, I want to ask the member about EI.  It is an issue that 
continues to come up in this place.  The member said that we 
should return EI to a true insurance plan.  Those were her words, 
a true insurance plan, and the premiums to be used only for the 
purposes prescribed in the act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a statement of principle I would agree with that.  However, 
there still seems to be this question, which should be addressed 
by all legislators in this place, as to whether EI is meant to be 
an income supplement program as opposed to income replacement 
program.  The member understands the difference between the two, 
certainly with regard to seasonal workers.  I would appreciate 
the member's comments on the true insurance plan for EI and how 
she sees it.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for 
Mississauga South for his question and comments. This is very 
interesting. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The former Minister of Human Resources Development, the hon. 
member for Papineau—Saint-Denis, was quoted in <I>Le Journal de 
Montréal</I>, in February 1999, as saying: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no employment insurance fund. Let us be honest. The 
money was spent. If we no longer have a deficit in Canada, it is 
because these funds were used as indicated in the budget, for 
the health sector and for other investments made by the 
government. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>People are told that if they work and have to contribute, it is 
so that they will have an insurance if they have the misfortune 
of losing their job. It is so that they can collect that 
insurance until they can get another job. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In order to make it easier to contribute and have that 
protection, the government made it a universal insurance. 
Everyone must contribute, even though not everyone can benefit 
from employment insurance, because some people are protected by 
collective agreements and are very unlikely to lose their job, 
or because there will always be work in their field of activity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We should have an independent fund to manage the contributions 
made to the employment insurance program. 
Since these contributions come from employers and workers, a 
joint labour management group could look after the fund, like 
those that manage retirement funds in companies, and that fund 
could be used by those who lose their job. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A reserve could be built up for bad years, but the fund would 
truly be managed independently. In some cases, money could be 
invested to promote employability if an activity sector has no 
future and it is necessary to retrain people so they can find 
new jobs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This would offer much more flexibility than using the employment 
insurance fund like communicating vessels, like the government's 
cash cow. 
Therefore, 60% of the people who work week after week, who put 
money aside, thinking that they will get help if they have a 
problem. But they come to realize that they contributed for 
nothing and that their money was invested in other things. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think it is outrageous to do this. If an insurance company had 
done this in the private sector, it would have been taken to 
court a long time ago for misappropriation of funds.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Serge Cardin (Sherbrooke, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, It is with great 
pleasure that I rise to speak to the budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>After starving the provinces, Quebec, the population, and the 
poorest in society in particular, with its latest budget, the 
federal government is setting the table for a five course 
election-minded meal. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1540"></A>

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately, not everyone will be invited at its table. Once 
again, the less fortunate, the homeless, low income earners and 
those in a precarious situation are not invited. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Moreover, the federal government's menu does not necessarily 
suit all diets, especially not all constitutions. Also, so much 
time will elapse between each course that a number of things 
might go wrong. Naturally, the turn taken by our economy may not 
be as positive as the finance minister seems to expect it to be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Speaking of food and calories, according to CGA-Canada, the 
Minister of Finance has served us a low calorie budget. This 
organization told us the following: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is the opinion of the Certified General Accountants 
Association of Canada (CGA-Canada) that the Minister of Finance 
dissipated his efforts in the federal budget unveiled today. The 
minister's fingerprints are all over this budget, which give a 
little bit to everyone but not enough in each case. It reflects 
the prudent, optimistic and clever tinkering the government has 
become a master at. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is what the chair of the fiscal policy review committee of 
CGA-Canada said. He stated further: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal budget will modestly lower the tax burden on 
individuals, especially middle income taxpayers. This year, the 
tax break for a couple with a total income of $60,000 could 
amount to approximately $108. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>To digress for a moment, the increase alone in the price of oil, 
gasoline or heating oil this year will go well beyond the basic 
tax relief families in Quebec and Canada may enjoy.  This is not 
the case just for the first year, but perhaps for the five years 
provided in the federal government's budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The association also observed: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—although this budget sets Canada firmly on a tax reduction 
course, it could have delivered those cuts faster and deeper if 
the federal government had curtailed its spending. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This document also refers to the owners of small businesses, and 
states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some of Canada's small business people may like this budget. 
for example, their tax rate will drop by 7% for small businesses 
with business incomes between $200,000 and $300,000.  But many 
small businesses do not earn that range of income and won't 
benefit. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>These, in short, were the main remarks of the certified general 
accountants. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois carried out prebudget consultations in all 
regions of Quebec.  We fulfilled our responsibility as members 
and as a political party.  Then, after the budget was presented, 
we consulted people as well to find out what they thought of it. 
When we asked people if they were satisfied with the Minister 
of Finance's budget, it was pretty clear. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will quote the main observations made.  First we were told “It 
was smoke and mirrors”.  We asked “Were you satisfied with the 
budget?”  They said “No, because there was nothing in it 
for health care, education and income security”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They said “No, because the cuts to income tax do not take effect 
until next year, while the government has the manoeuvring room 
to cut taxes this year”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They said “No, because the unemployed and the provinces got 
nothing”. 
They said “No, because it is clear that they are going for 
visibility and votes”.  They said “No, because the priorities of 
Quebecers were ignored; no, because the government is determined 
not to take Quebec into account when it comes to child welfare 
and families, although child welfare clearly comes under 
Quebec's jurisdiction”.

</I></B></P><P align=left>What did the Bloc Quebecois want?  Nothing very complicated.  We 
could have easily put together a budget.  We were asking for an 
increase in transfer payments for health, education and income 
assistance.  Quebec is now out $1.7 billion annually. 
It was therefore important to reinvest in social programs and it 
is clear that that was what all Quebecers wanted to see. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a result of this consultation, the Bloc Quebecois called on 
the federal government to put $3 billion into an infrastructures 
program, including $1.7 billion for social housing.  These 
requests were ignored.  The government is offering a meagre 
$268 million over five years for social housing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also called for an improved EI system, greater accessibility, 
a larger reduction in premiums, higher benefits, and an 
improvement in parental leave.  What we got was a ridiculous ten 
cent decrease. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois also called for tax cuts and indexing 
starting right away, not in 2001, the election year.  Indexing 
is not synonymous with tax cuts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, when we asked people what they thought the federal 
government was doing wrong, it did not take them long to answer 
“It ignores Quebecers' priorities.  It continues to interfere in 
areas of provincial jurisdiction.  It creates a private, 
independent trust with which the provinces must negotiate in 
order to obtain their money.  It wants to impose the social 
union on Quebec when it has refused to sign”.  They were also 
critical of the Minister of Finance for cooking the books: the 
surpluses are always larger than forecast. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was clear from the prebudget consultations that people wanted 
to see four main things in the federal budget.  I will repeat 
them because this is very important. 
I referred to this briefly earlier, I come back to it and I will 
come back, if I have time, to the specific cases in the riding 
of Sherbrooke, to what people, including social and community 
groups, said when we consulted them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We cannot say often enough that the social transfer must be 
significantly increased to enable the provinces to reinvest 
starting this year in health, education and social assistance. 
We will keep calling for a significant cut in taxes, for 
improvements to the employment insurance plan and for a big 
investment in infrastructures. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois listened to the people, while the federal 
government decided to ignore people's needs.  With the federal 
government, Quebec and the provinces do not have a whole lot to 
meet the needs of the people in health care, education and 
social assistance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Instead of fully restoring the transfers to the provinces, which 
have needs to meet, Ottawa is satisfied with a meagre 
refinancing.  The federal government is injecting $2.5 billion 
over four years, when it should be reinvesting $4.2 billion for 
this year alone in transfer payments to the provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With the federal budget, the cuts already planned in the 
transfers to the provinces will be maintained, and half of the 
cuts will be on the back of Quebec.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Quebec's meagre share of the $2.5 billion set aside by Ottawa is 
not going to fix things.  Furthermore, Quebec taxpayers will 
have to wait because, for all intents and purposes, they will 
not see any real tax cut this year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Indexing for inflation, which costs the federal treasury 
$3 billion, means only that people will not pay more taxes this 
year.  But the federal government's refusal to introduce 
indexing sooner, as the Bloc Quebecois requested, means that 
taxpayers have already paid close to $15 billion too much. 
Instead of providing tax relief now, the federal government has 
decided to wait until the 2001-2002 election year to cut taxes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will not be able to buy a lot with my tax cut or tax refund 
this year, certainly not two or three full tanks of gas for my 
car, but I might have just enough for a nice little toilet down 
which I will gently flush the Minister of Finance's budget, just 
so I will feel a bit better.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
enjoyed the member's speech.  Having been on the health committee 
with him, we have shared some experiences and he knows I have a 
particular interest in children and family issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was a little surprised by his comment that the Bloc had pushed 
and asked for improvements in benefits and family leave.  He 
concluded that all we got in the budget was a 10 cent reduction 
in the premium rate.  Actually that is not quite right.  I will 
explain why. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Two years ago I put in a private member's bill, Bill C-204, on 
increasing maternity and parental leave from six months to a full 
year.  He will recall that in the throne speech, in the Prime 
Minister's speech and in the budget that program was adopted by 
the government and included in the budget at a cost of some $900 
million in additional benefits for Canadians.  I wanted to raise 
that for him. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I asked his colleague a question and I do not think I got the 
answer.  Maybe he can answer it.  Does the Bloc have a position 
with regard to the issue of whether EI should be an income 
replacement system and  a real insurance program?  How would he 
feel about the whole question of it being an income supplement as 
it relates to seasonal workers?   How will we address this 
dilemma with regard to EI benefits? 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Serge Cardin:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague for his 
question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we have shared, more specifically, is a round of 
consultations across Canada, from Vancouver to Halifax, where 
the Reform Party had asked whether there were inequities for 
individuals earning the same income, depending on whether this 
amount was divided between two people or was the income of only 
one person. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During these consultations on employment insurance and parental 
leave, a lot of representations were made, which probably 
inspired the Minister of Finance to introduce some tax relief or 
programs.  These measures might be described as steps in the 
right direction, but they do not go far enough. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Looking at the limitations of employment insurance, given the 
number of people who, following the reform, qualify for benefits 
under the program mentioned by my hon. colleague in connection 
with parental leave, the vast majority are basically denied 
employment insurance benefits because they are unable to 
qualify.  Even when they can, these are often poorly paid jobs 
that do not therefore guarantee a reasonable income on which 
they could afford to stay home on parental leave.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the subject of employment insurance, in general, the member 
mentioned that I spoke of 10%, but it seems to me I said 10 
cents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can count ourselves lucky if we have a job these days. 
Ideally, contributions should be as low as possible, while the 
majority of the people needing them can draw employment 
insurance benefits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But, initially, let us set contributions aside.  People who work 
already have the distinct advantage of having a job.  I am 
convinced that, in a spirit of co-operation, people are prepared 
to contribute to enable those who have the misfortune of losing 
their job to collect benefits.  So the plan must be improved in 
terms of its benefits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this regard, I believe that the Minister of Finance has not 
gone far enough.  He has taken the surpluses and put them in 
other programs.  In the past, the employment insurance plan 
managed the POWA program, which must come back.  Increasingly, 
businesses are closing their doors, laying off older workers. 
There are surpluses in employment insurance.  There must be a 
program for older people again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The employment insurance money must be used for those who have 
worked.  Those who have the pleasure of working are prepared to 
contribute so that those who lose their job may benefit.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Jean Augustine (Etobicoke—Lakeshore, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I am pleased to join in today's debate on budget 2000. I 
will be splitting my time with the member for Simcoe—Grey. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me begin by adding my words of congratulations to the hon. 
Minister of Finance for delivering a budget that charts a course 
to greater prosperity for Canada in this 21st century.  Budget 
2000 builds on the government's commitment to better the lives of 
all Canadians.  This is why we are all here. This is why we are 
doing the work that we are doing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am encouraged to see that budget 2000 reflects the concerns of 
my constituents, the people of Etobicoke—Lakeshore, who were 
very much a part of the prebudget consultation process.  During 
meetings held in my riding I heard my constituents, who come from 
the social agency groups, from community organizations, from 
small and medium size business groups, say to me that they want 
government action in three principal areas.  They want us to give 
them some opportunity for tax relief. They want to see some 
reform to the tax system. They want more spending on social 
infrastructure and greater economic productivity for Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was happy to share with them after the budget was delivered 
that budget 2000 responded to their concerns.  The budget is 
based on four key principles:  sound financial management, tax 
relief, building an innovative economy and investing in skills 
and knowledge. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today I will speak briefly to the initiatives in budget 2000 
which echo those concerns of my constituents.  I will begin with 
tax relief.  The first priority in all the discussions that I 
held was a tax relief plan in budget 2000, a measure that 
Canadians have come to expect from the federal government.  After 
many years of sacrifice in order to eliminate Canada's $42 
billion deficit, my constituents are beginning to see more of the 
money they earn returned to them.  I was pleased to see that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My constituents were also pleased to know that budget 2000 
introduced a tax reduction plan that will provide real and 
lasting tax relief for all Canadians to the tune of $58 billion. 
This five year tax plan is based on two key significant measures 
which brought changes to the federal tax system. 
First, the plan will restore full indexation.  My constituents 
were concerned about indexation and bracket creep.  Budget 2000 
addresses these concerns.  My constituents will see the benefits, 
especially those in the low and middle income bracket.  They will 
see an end to automatic tax increases and an end to the erosion 
caused by inflation.  They will see the results of budget 2000 in 
deindexation. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1600"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT24"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, the plan will reduce the middle income tax rate to 23% 
from 26% beginning with a 2% drop to 24% on July 1, 2000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These changes are real and permanent.  They will benefit 
families with children and low and middle income families in 
Etobicoke—Lakeshore.  It is important to note that low and 
middle income Canadians in my riding will see their taxes fall by 
at least 18% and families with children will see their personal 
income taxes reduced by 21%.  This reduction in taxes for 
families with children is symbolic of the direction in which the 
federal government is taking in its long term reinvestment in 
Canada's children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition to the decrease in personal taxes for families and 
children, the government has made its third significant 
investment to the Canada child tax benefit.  Those of us who sat 
on different caucus committees were asked to look at the 
situations of families and at the child tax benefit to see what 
we could do in that respect.  We see an investment of $2.5 
billion annually by the year 2004.  The Canada child tax benefit 
will increase maximum benefits to $2,400 for the first child and 
$2,200 for subsequent children.  This is not as high as we can go 
but it is a move in the right direction.  It provides additional 
funding to support low and middle income families of $9 billion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Other tax measures in budget 2000 that benefit my constituents 
are the registered pension plan and the registered retirement 
savings plan.  We will see the elimination of the 5% surtax for 
middle income Canadians earning up to $85,000.  There are several 
things within the tax relief measures that will benefit my 
constituents and I want them to know this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A second area of priority to my constituents is the issue of 
productivity and the building of a strong and competitive 
economy.  We are living in an urban area with access to the 
business sector and my constituents want to ensure that we are 
competitive and that our young people have an opportunity to 
prosper in the economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As Canadians living in a global economy with global challenges 
and rapid advancements in technology, we are compelled to take 
advantage of opportunities by developing our country's human 
capital. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is the people and countries who excel in innovation, who 
develop and use new ideas and who use their skills and the tools 
they need, who will enjoy the brightest future.  Canada must 
continue to invest in research and innovation and must continue 
to support our small businesses.

people participating in workshops to see what can be done and 
what the federal government is doing to assist small business.  I 
know that budget 2000 will help Canadian businesses to become 
more competitive internationally by making the tax system more 
conducive to investment, growth, job creation and innovation. The 
fair was quite a show and tell in terms of what the federal 
government has to offer in this regard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Social infrastructure is another area that the budget has 
addressed quite strongly because we recognized that it was a high 
priority for the citizens of Etobicoke—Lakeshore and Canada. 
Health care and education are also high priorities for the 
federal government at this point in time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to remind my colleagues also that budget 2000 has 
committed us to the improvement of the quality of life of 
Canadians and will support those things that we cherish and hold 
dear, like our health care system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In summary, budget 2000 represents a balancing of tax relief and 
further investments in the areas of priorities to Canadians, such 
as health, innovation, skills and knowledge.  The budget has 
responded to what we have heard from our constituents.  For those 
of us who are committed to our constituents and committed to 
bringing their views back to the national level for a response, I 
think we were all pleased to be able to tell our citizens that 
their quality of life will continue to be unmatched in the 21st 
century. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I stand in support of budget 2000.  I join with all my 
colleagues and all those who were pleased that this budget did 
respond to their concerns.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dick Proctor (Palliser, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
listened with considerable interest to the member for 
Etobicoke—Lakeshore and I congratulate her on her speech. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the things that she did not mention, but one of the 
things that I believe many of her constituents would be concerned 
about, is the growing concentration of foreign ownership in this 
country in recent years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>From the many studies that have been done, there has been a 
virtual explosion in foreign ownership as a result of the low 
Canadian dollar and the impact from the North American Free Trade 
Agreement and other international agreements to the point where 
many of our leading intellectuals are very concerned about the 
future and viability of this country. Constituents in 
Etobicoke—Lakeshore and certainly in Palliser ought to be 
gravely concerned, especially the young people, whether there 
will be jobs here in this country or whether they will have to go 
to New York, Chicago or Denver in order to get work in the head 
offices that used to be here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I just wanted to ask the member if she too is concerned about 
this trend toward foreign ownership in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Jean Augustine:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank the member for 
Palliser for his question.   I know his concerns are very much 
like my own, which are for our constituents and for employment 
opportunities for our constituents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The whole issue of the free trade agreement is almost a two-way 
street.  We benefit as much from that agreement as do our 
business people who have the opportunity to operate on the other 
side. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the issue of foreign ownership, I will respond by saying that 
we live in a global village.  The world is becoming much smaller 
as a result of new technologies.  Our business people are able to 
move goods and services across borders which has created 
opportunities for us to be innovative.  We cannot really close 
our doors or pull the drapes down, as I often say, and keep the 
lights out because there is just no way we can keep ourselves in 
a situation where we cannot respond to the free movement of goods 
and services and people.

</I></B></P><P align=left>As I have expressed, as a Canadian wanting to see us keep our 
sovereignty and not lose a whole number of things, including 
culture, et cetera, there is, at the same time, a recognition

<P><A NAME="LINK185"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Bonwick (Simcoe—Grey, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
have a quick comment for my good friend in the NDP regarding 
foreign investment.  He might want take a look at my own riding 
of Simcoe—Grey, at the billions of dollars that Honda has 
invested in a plant, and ask those 3,500 or so employees if 
foreign investment is a good thing or not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Aside from that issue from the NDP about countries investing in 
Canada, I will now address a question to my good friend and 
colleague from Etobicoke—Lakeshore.  I must first qualify that 
by saying that the member for Etobicoke—Lakeshore has truly been 
a role model for us in the class of '97 insofar as how vocal she 
has been in caucus and how she has truly demonstrated and carried 
forward a message, not only from her riding and not simply from 
Canada but from all across the world, on what the priorities of 
this country should be, both economically and socially. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Going more specifically to the question at hand, I wonder if the 
hon. member would, for my benefit and certainly for the benefit 
of the members of the Canadian Alliance, extrapolate on the 
benefits of extending the parental benefits from six months to 
one year, and if in fact she thinks this is a good thing for 
newborns and infants. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Jean Augustine:</B>  Mr. Speaker, first, I want to thank 
my colleague for his compliments.  We do work with the Canadian 
Association of Parliamentarians on population and development. We 
also work with a number of the issues as they pertain to the 
foreign affairs agenda. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In terms of the specific question, I think anything that would 
enable a woman to get back into the workplace, anything that 
would facilitate the nurturing of children, anything that the 
government, through its policy and through its policy direction, 
can do that would say that we care about our children in their 
early years, that a woman can have the choice to remain in the 
workplace, to get back into the workplace or to be facilitated 
into the workplace, would be good policy. 
<P><A NAME="LINK186"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Bonwick (Simcoe—Grey, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is 
with great pride that I rise today and address what I believe to 
be the best and the most effective budget speech that has been 
presented in the House in Canadian history. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Comparing it to previous budgets, there is close to unanimous 
approval in the House that the budget effectively raised the 
quality of life for Canadians and, more importantly, for their 
children.  I think that was evident in the fact that the 
opposition party, the Reform—I have to get used to the new name 
but I will not use the acronym—simply did not ask any questions 
about the budget.  Obviously, by virtue of that fact, it was in 
total agreement or almost in total agreement with the budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I had a prepared text today to present to the House that 
identified many incredibly great points for Canadians that were 
contained within the budget.  As I was sitting here listening to 
my colleagues speak to the budget, I decided to break with 
tradition, fire that speech aside and talk straight from the 
heart about process, platform and policies, or lack thereof, from 
some of the opposition parties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What I thought I might do first is give Canadians an opportunity 
to appreciate the process that goes into creating a budget and 
the amount of grassroots involvement that is involved in creating 
a budget, the calibre of which we recently saw on February 28. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I should first take this time to congratulate and acknowledge 
the hard work of my Liberal colleagues from all across this 
country, the one truly national party. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1615"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT27"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>What happens is, as the member of parliament for Simcoe—Grey, I 
host exhaustive, extensive and very informative consultations 
within my riding, from Alliston to the town of Blue Mountain to 
Wasaga Beach to Collingwood, to allow constituents within my 
riding to bring forward their issues, directions and ideas on 
which direction this country should take both economically and 
socially.  Like many of my colleagues in the Liberal Party, we 
spend exorbitant amounts of time to ensure that Canadians, the 
people within our ridings, have an opportunity to have their 
ideas, suggestions and values incorporated in the minister's 
budget each and every year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have had incredibly good and positive ideas come forward from 
the riding of Simcoe—Grey.  However, the process only works if 
we have a minister who will do two things.  The first is to 
listen.  He certainly did that, by virtue of the fact that he 
presented such an incredibly positive budget, which speaks yards 
to the amount of involvement that all of my Liberal colleagues 
have participated in and contributed to. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second, and equally important, is the fact that he 
incorporates these ideas, values and economic suggestions about 
how we might better the lives of Canadians in the budget.  Again, 
the budget exemplifies how he has done that.  My hat goes off to 
him.  He has demonstrated over the past seven years a precedent 
that will be difficult to match.  He has offered a balanced 
approach to governing the finances and the social priorities of 
this nation.  We have truly seen what was at one point a country 
which was near economic ruin turned into one of the countries 
that is put on the mantle of the G-7 or G-8 countries.  Again, my 
hat goes off to him for that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, the process at the end of the day only works if we have 
one person who facilitates caucus and members of parliament going 
to their various regions and ridings and who supports the 
Minister of Finance and involves himself with the minister's 
budgetary process.  We are fortunate enough that the Prime 
Minister offers the Minister of Finance that kind of support on a 
day to day, week to week and month to month basis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We talk about how the process works.  At the end of the day, I 
believe that the people who we truly have to recognize are the 
Canadians who have taken the time to bring forward their ideas 
and suggestions.  The key point that many constituents in my 
riding have brought forward is that they want a balanced 
approach.  They realize that there are those on the extreme left 
who would have us do one thing.  They realize that there are 
those on the absolute extreme right who would have us do another. 
What they are looking for is a balanced approach.  They realize 
the gravity of the situation if there is not a balanced approach. 
The key word from my constituency was balance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We talked about health care and the need for a collaborative 
effort in health care.  There was no finger pointing, as has been 
done by the provincial Tories, that it was their fault or how Mr. 
Klein has said it is their fault.  They talked about a 
collaborative effort.  That is what they want.  They did not want 
simply to increase spending, they wanted the provinces and the 
federal government, along with the municipalities, to work 
collaboratively to make sure that medicare, the thing we are so 
proud of both within our country and abroad, is sustainable, 
accessible and honours the five principles of health care.  That 
is a message that I delivered loud and clear. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also talked about such things as tax reduction and the 
absolute need for it, insofar as creating a competitive 
environment, not just within Canada but as we try to attract 
investment dollars outside Canada and to ensure that the 
brightest and best within our country stay here.  On February 28, 
when I witnessed the largest single tax reduction budget in 
Canadian history, I could not have been more proud and more 
pleased to know that our country now has the foundation for 
incredible growth and incredible opportunity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There were many other issues addressed through my consultation 
process with my constituents, the third I have conducted since 
being elected in June 1997.  We talked about a children's agenda 
and, again, the need for a collaborative approach.  We need to 
work with the provinces, the municipalities and non-profit 
organizations.  Our ministers, including the minister responsible 
for homelessness, the minister for HRDC, the Prime Minister and 
the Minister of Finance, have clearly indicated that that is 
exactly what they are going to and what they want to do.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>When Canadians across the country are examining the budget and 
the processes leading up to and after the budget, they have to 
compare what our policies are as opposed to those of the 
opposition, or lack thereof.  I might cite as an example the new 
party which was introduced in the House a few short days ago. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I might draw an analogy of how I view my role as a 
parliamentarian with the role of everyone else in the House, as 
well as the parties.  Quite frankly, I view myself as an employee 
of the constituents.  I believe that I am here to do good work 
for them.  I view the role of the party as being the same.  My 
analogy would simply be this.  Imagine if an employer had an 
individual who for 10 years brought forward an enormous amount of 
rhetoric, changing from one day to the next, flipping from right 
to left, doing whatever he or she possibly could to try to 
satisfy or appease the electorate.   At the end of those 10 years 
the electorate would finally realize exactly what the capacities 
and capabilities of that individual were.   I speak most 
specifically to incompetence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Imagine if one day that person, whom we will call Mr. <I>X</I>, 
walked in and said “It has all changed.  My name is now Mr. 
<I>Y</I>”.  Would that provide some incredible level of comfort? 
Would that make it better?  Has the platform changed?   No.  Has 
the party changed?  No.  It is the same person sitting across the 
way, with the same ideas, the same rhetoric and the same 
right-wing policies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask Canadians when they examine that party, whatever the final 
name will be, to examine it on its platform and on its policies 
and, going back to my key word, to look to see if it has a 
balanced approach.  I truly believe that this is one of the most 
balanced and most effective budgets we have ever witnessed in 
this great House of Commons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to direct my closing remarks to the future, 
something which the Reform Party, the alternative or whatever, 
fails to deal with, fails to focus on.   My pledge to the future 
is simply this.  I intend to make sure that from February 29 
forward the constituents within my riding, in fact Canadians all 
across this great country, will continue to have an opportunity 
to bring forward their ideas, their suggestions and their values 
so that we might continue on this path of phenomenal success, not 
only building on the greatest country in the world, but also 
providing incredible opportunities for young people.  That is 
what we are here to do.  We are here to build a foundation.  We 
are here to build a country which will be better off than that 
which we were handed by our fathers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I asked my first question today in the House of Commons 
about the budget and the focus on debt reduction, I was pleased 
to see that the Minister of Finance will be focusing on exactly 
that priority. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I look forward to any questions my hon. colleagues may have. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B> It is my duty, pursuant to 
Standing Order 38, to inform the House that the questions to be 
raised tonight at the time of adjournment are as follows:  the 
hon. member for Halifax West, National Defence; the hon. member 
for New Brunswick Southwest, Hepatitis C.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dick Proctor (Palliser, NDP):</B>   Mr. Speaker, I 
congratulate the member for Simcoe—Grey.  I think I got his 
constituency correct, which the finance minister failed to do in 
Oral Question Period this afternoon. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member helped to make the argument which I was endeavouring 
to make with the member for Etobicoke—Lakeshore when he referred 
to the jobs that have been created in the car plant in his 
constituency.  What I was talking about were the head office jobs 
that are being lost and what is referred to by some as the 
hollowing out of Canada as the NAFTA kicks in. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The point the member for Etobicoke—Lakeshore was trying to make 
was that there somehow is a balance between our foreign 
investment in other countries and incoming foreign investment, 
which is simply not substantiated by the facts.

<A HREF="#LINKT29"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would point out that Statistics Canada numbers, after a decade 
of relative balance of inflow and outflow, in the last two years 
have been staggering.  Last year the imbalance was in excess of 
$30 billion.  A lot of that money is flowing into the country as 
a result of our cheap Canadian dollar.  What we are losing is 
significant in terms of head office jobs, lack of critical mass 
and forcing some of our youngest and brightest people to other 
countries, with the profit flows going out of the country as 
well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is the point I am trying to make on foreign ownership and I 
would welcome the hon. member's response. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Bonwick:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member 
for Palliser for his question.  I appreciate his clarification, 
because what he said was investment and ownership, and those are 
two different words. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I try to encourage many members of the NDP to listen to what 
economists and people in the country are saying.  They are 
telling the government to build a foundation upon which foreign 
investment would be welcomed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I appreciate the fact that the hon. member is speaking about 
white collar workers and the need to maintain and enhance 
opportunities for them.  Based on the fact that the hon. member 
is representing the NDP, I am quite surprised that he does not 
recognize that there hundreds of thousands, in fact millions of 
Canadians, in my riding and in ridings all across the country, 
who are not white collar workers and who look forward to foreign 
investment.  The people in our Honda plant, the satellite plants 
that feed it, and the countless thousands of workers throughout 
my riding and all across the country look forward to foreign 
investment because it provides good paying jobs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Insofar as the hon. member's comments regarding white collar 
jobs, all he has to do is walk through some of the plants and he 
will see some of the best and brightest in Canada working in the 
riding of Simcoe—Grey.  If he took a ride down Highway 417 and 
had a look at Kanata, for example, he would see some of the best 
and brightest in the entire world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some of the white collar jobs could be attributed to foreign 
investment.  The reason they are occurring is because this 
government and the Minister of Finance have created an atmosphere 
in which investors from all around the world want to put their 
money in Canada and we are the beneficiaries. 
<P><A NAME="LINK188"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I would like to inform you that I will be sharing my time with 
the hon. member for South Surrey—White Rock—Langley. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not really happy to be here today.  Today is March 29.  It 
is the birthday of my son, who is in Calgary.  It is birthday of 
my grandson, who is in Regina.  Very frankly, I would much rather 
be with my family today than to have to endure the lack of 
respect that we get from members on the other side. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to take a few minutes to speak about the budget and 
the impact it will have on us and on our country in the future. 
I suppose in that sense I am at the best place for my son, my 
grandson and my other grandchildren because I am concerned about 
what is happening in the country and the things we are missing 
because of the mismanagement of the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There has been quite a bit of talk about what a positive budget 
this is.  As I often do, I would like to begin my talk to that 
crowd of Liberals over there by saying that I would indeed give 
them a backhand compliment, a reluctant compliment.  I know that 
they have a congenital disposition to spend and somehow they have 
been able to resist spending all of the money that has come in 
because of the booming economy of the last couple of years. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1630"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT30"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, I do not think the Liberal government can claim any 
credit for the booming economy.  I believe everything that has 
happened has been despite the government.  If we were not next to 
the very buoyant economy of the Americans who have done things a 
little better than we have and have thereby boosted their 
economy, we would probably not be in this position. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Furthermore the prosperity we seem to have is also illusory. 
Because of the value of our Canadian dollar every one of us has 
taken a hit that is basically invisible since this government 
took power by the falling of the Canadian dollar. The value of 
the goods we purchase is more expensive than what it ought to be 
when we import goods and services. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we get for our product is greatly lessened in its value 
because of exchange rates.  That is just a simple fact, and it is 
one which is not apparent to many Canadians.  We are used to 
calling a dollar a dollar and we forget that the dollar we are 
dealing with now is worth only a fraction of what it used to be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Sometimes when I speak to students I apologize to them because 
of the fact that my generation and I allowed the last 30 years of 
consecutive Liberal and Conservative governments to do what they 
have done to the country.  I sometimes just shake my head in 
wonderment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What a rich country we have.  We are rich in resources, in mines 
and in minerals.  We are rich in agriculture across the country. 
We have much potential.  We have oil.  We have natural gas.  We 
have the ability to produce because we have a very good 
educational system which will prepare our young people to become 
productive citizens, whether it is in engineering, in the medical 
field or whatever. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What do we see?  We see a huge debt that has been accumulated 
over the last 30 years.  We get governments like the one we have 
now that are much more interested in the spin that they can put 
on it than in what is actually happening, thereby, I feel, 
effectively putting a blinder on the eyes of Canadians so that 
they do not know what is happening.  Governments sure are 
successful at their messaging, at getting their message out and 
making everyone feel good. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a feel good budget.  This is a political budget.  There 
is much more in it for the politicians, for the Liberal 
government and for their hopes of re-election than there is in 
actual fact.  Frankly I am very distressed when governments do 
this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have asked a number of people how much money the Liberals put 
into health care in the last budget.  I received two answers. The 
most frequent one was that they did not really know, but those 
people who had read the paper and had taken notice said that it 
was $11.5 billion.  This is on the verge of not being factual. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians have been deceived into thinking that there is $11.5 
billion in the budget for health care.  There is not.  The 
Liberals announced $2 billion that year, $2 billion the next and 
then three years at $2.5 billion.  It was not cumulative.  It was 
the amount that is above the floor from which they started. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I feel so inhibited, having been an instructor and a teacher for 
many years.  I would love to have a graph here to show that. When 
$11.5 billion per year are added year after year, most people 
have in their minds the idea that it is increasing year by year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not think it is against House rules to use an imaginary 
figure as a prop.  In fact what has happened is that in the first 
year they increased it $2 billion.  In the next year there was no 
further increase, so that was $2 billion.  Then they added half a 
billion and the next year there was no further increase, so that 
was $2.5 billion.  In the next year there was no further 
increase, so that was $2.5 billion.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals added up all those numbers over five years and 
communicated that they had put $11.5 billion into the health 
budget.  It will not be finished until long past the mandate of 
the present government because it was a five year projection.  It 
is very dishonest to do that when we are talking about a one year 
budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There should be a very clear delineation so that Canadian 
taxpayers can understand what is annual.  I think it is good to 
have long term planning.  There is no doubt about it.  The 
further we plan ahead, the better off we are.  However, it is 
deceptive to claim this and then to message it when the facts are 
quite different. It is wrong in that it lulls the Canadian people 
into a deep sleep and a sense of happiness that all is well when 
in fact because of what is happening that is not true. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us look at the tax cuts outlined in the budget. The 
government is claiming $58 billion in tax cuts.  Despite my age 
and my size, even I am tempted to stand and click my heels.  It 
is incredible that we have $58 billion in tax cuts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us look at what it really is.  We have $7.5 billion in 
social spending on child benefits.  While the Liberals are 
talking tax cuts and messaging them as such, they are really 
saying that they are increasing spending for child benefits. That 
is not a tax cut.  It just is not.  It does not reduce the tax 
bill.  For someone who has no children it has no application 
whatsoever.  They cannot claim that it is a tax cut because tax 
cuts have to do with people who are paying taxes.  They are 
mixing together income and expenditures. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us look at the next one.  During that same five year period, 
and here they are talking five years again, Canadian pension plan 
premiums will go up almost $30 billion.  That too is a tax 
because it is taken from people and it is given, to a great 
extent, to people other than those who are paying it.  To call it 
an investment, dare I say it, is a falsification.  It is not an 
investment.  It is a tax. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then they are claiming another $13.5 billion.  They are saying 
that if they had not done away with indexation they would have 
taken that much more tax away from the people.  Now they say they 
will not take it and therefore it is a tax cut.  That is absurd. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The whole reasoning of the government is based on political 
considerations and messaging.  The facts just do not bear it out. 
We will see in the future the effect it has on the economy and on 
the taxpayer bottom line, on their paycheques.  It just does not 
add up and Canadians will be aware of that.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Roy Cullen (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Finance, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I listened with interest to the 
member opposite.  Although he is a member of the finance 
committee and is normally very learned on these matters, 
unfortunately he has some of his facts on the budget slightly 
confused. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we talk in budget 2000 about $58 billion of tax relief, 
that is an absolute minimum.  If the economy continues at a rate 
of 3.54%, we will be able to accelerate some of the measures more 
closely into the years 2000-01 and 2001-02.  The $58 billion is 
an absolute minimum. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Despite the fact that many times in the House many of my 
colleagues and I have tried to explain to members opposite, they 
will not listen.  The member opposite would like to call the 
Canada pension plan a tax, but it is a contributions based 
pension system.  It is based on employer contributions and 
employee contributions which go to a pension trust administered 
by a board.  The revenues do not go anywhere near the 
consolidated revenue funds of the government. 
The government has no access to these revenues.  They are clearly 
a program.  Canadians value the Canada pension plan and are glad 
that the government put it on a sound financial footing last 
year.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Having heard the evidence again that the Canada pension plan is 
not a tax, would the member be prepared to accept that notion? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the answer is no and I will 
explain why.  As I said before, if it were an investment then the 
person making the investment would have a choice and would be 
able to get a decent return on his or her money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member is asking the wrong person this question.  The field 
of mathematics happens to be my profession.  Just for the fun of 
it, I sometimes solve little math and finance problems just to 
keep my brain alert around this place when things get dull.  I 
have done these computations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A young person subscribing to the Canada pension plan can expect 
around a 2.9% return on his so-called investment.  The difference 
between what that is and what he could get if he were to invest 
it almost anywhere else in the world is a tax.  Quite clearly the 
premiums are simply making up for the government's total 
mismanagement.  It is not listening to its actuaries and once 
again is making political decisions with taxpayer dollars.  It 
has done that consistently and it is wrong.  I stand by what I 
say and I will discuss that subject with the member any time he 
wants. 
<P><A NAME="LINK190"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Bonwick (Simcoe—Grey, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
hope Canadians are truly listening to the right wing rhetoric of 
the member of the Canadian Alliance.  Let us think about what he 
was saying. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He picked holes in and wanted to gut the social programs of the 
government that support low and middle class families who have 
children.  Members of that party do not want to support that. 
They think that is not an investment and want to keep their tax 
dollars.  It is a lot like their flat tax which will benefit the 
rich and not those who are in lower and middle class positions. 
It is absolutely ridiculous. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member stated for the record that the government should take 
no credit for the financial picture the country is enjoying 
today.  I simply ask the member to go back in time to 1993, if he 
can remember back that far when there was a $42.5 billion 
deficit.  The deficit is now gone.  Which party in the House 
brought forward the fiscal policies to eliminate that deficit? 
That is the only point I want to know from the member. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp:</B>  He is not going to be so fortunate as to get 
only that from me, Mr. Speaker.  I gave the government a very 
mild applause for resisting the temptation of spending all the 
money when it came its way.  I gave it credit.  It is quite 
possible that during the Trudeau years governments would have 
done it differently. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member expresses some terms in a pejorative way instead of 
debating what we are talking about.  He said that they were here 
to protect families whereas we on this side of the House would 
tax them to death.  That is not so.  Our 17% flat tax would give 
most poor people a 100% tax break.  That is what would happen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals are quite content to take $6 billion a year in tax 
revenue from families whose income is $20,000 a year or less, and 
they call themselves a pro-family government.  They are taxing 
them to death.  They are killing them. 
<P><A NAME="LINK191"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Val Meredith (South Surrey—White Rock—Langley, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to take part in the 
budget debate today.  This the Liberal government's seventh 
budget and it is pretty much more of the same.  The first mandate 
was high taxes and cuts to government spending.  The second 
mandate is high taxes and increased government spending. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals are trying to give the impression that they are 
making massive tax cuts for Canadians.  They are claiming that 
they are cutting taxes by $58.4 billion.  That is an illusion. If 
we take a closer look, and they can argue the finer points, the 
$7.5 billion are for the child tax credit.  That is a social 
program, the same as OAS and CPP.  It is not a tax cut; it is a 
social program.  Government members should be upfront and honest 
and say so.

<A HREF="#LINKT33"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some $13.5 billion of this supposed tax cut is a reindexation of 
tax brackets.  That is not a tax cut; that is just the government 
promising Canadians it will not be robbing them in the upcoming 
tax years, that it will forgo taking more tax money from them 
rather than giving them real tax relief. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The $58.4 billion tax cut is also offset by the $29.5 billion 
increase in CPP premiums. The taxpayer is actually only going to 
see a $7.9 billion tax cut and that is over five years.  That 
equates to about $2.07 additional money per week for the 
taxpayer.  If that is what the Liberals think is a tax cut, it 
certainly is not shared by the ordinary Canadian. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals have told Canadians that their priorities are going 
to be that 50% of the surplus will go to new social programs and 
the other 50% will be divided between tax cuts and debt 
reduction.  I asked my constituents if they agreed with the 
government's proposals of splitting the money this way. Over 
2,100 people responded and 73% said that they did not agree with 
the Liberal proposal of splitting the money 50% for new social 
programming and 50% between tax reduction and debt relief. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the individuals who said no to the Liberals' plan was a 
Mr. Paul Martin of Blackwood Street in White Rock. It is 
unfortunate that his namesake does not share his concerns that 
this is not the way to use the taxpayers' money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals are very proud of the $2.5 billion in new health 
care spending.  This afternoon in question period we heard just 
how proud they are of this $2.5 billion in new health care 
spending.  If we look at it more closely, that is divided over 
four years which means there is only $500 million per year in new 
spending for health care.  I do not need to remind the House that 
health care has been shown to be the number one concern of the 
Canadian people.  It is the number one concern. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This $500 million a year means only an additional $81 million 
per year for British Columbia.  That is 1% of the B.C. health 
care budget.  That is what the federal government is adding in 
new money to the crisis in our health care system.  This is what 
the government's response is to the highest priority of the 
Canadian people.  It works out to an additional $20 per British 
Columbian. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is interesting that the government in ignoring the priority 
of the Canadian people decided to give an additional $226 million 
to human resources development.  This is the department that has 
shown over the last number of years to have completely mismanaged 
the Canadian taxpayers' contributions.  Audit after audit after 
audit is showing that department has not handled and controlled 
taxpayers' money as it should have.  And what does the government 
do?  It gives more money to the department that the auditor 
general is saying has exceptional problems in controlling 
spending. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask members on that side why the government is putting more 
money into the black hole of HRDC than it is putting into health 
care.  Is it that building a fountain in the Prime Minister's 
riding is more important than adding hospital beds across the 
country? I would like to believe that the government has at least 
heard the concerns of the Canadian people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the other priorities outside of health care is that of 
transportation. 
This is one area in which the government should be increasing 
funding and looking at as a priority. It is an area that is 
completely disintegrating.  The transportation infrastructure in 
this country is falling apart.  We are consistently getting 
further and further behind and the government is doing absolutely 
nothing.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Last year the government collected $4.5 billion in fuel taxes 
and spent only $150 million on highways.  The budget this year 
has put in only $150 million for highways.  That works out to 
about 150 kilometres of road improvement over the next four 
years. Three years ago the transport committee reviewed the 
highway infrastructure of this country and reported that it would 
take $18 billion to bring our national highway up to a safe 
standard. The government is providing less than 1% of the 
required funds. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is quite conceivable that the prairie provinces will have to 
turn paved roads back into gravel roads because they cannot 
afford to maintain them.  Urban areas and border areas are going 
to recognize and have to deal with complete gridlock in their 
transportation systems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Transportation systems are instrumental in helping our economy 
with its trade obligations and its trade patterns.  Trade is a 
key contributor to Canada's economic well-being and 
transportation systems are essential in moving our goods in order 
to create this wealth. It is the creation of wealth through our 
economy that allows us to sustain the social safety nets we have 
in this country.  It is imperative that the government recognize 
the need to improve our transportation systems to ensure that the 
economic growth can be sustained and will support the economic 
growth of the future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would suggest that it is time for the government to show 
leadership.  It should show leadership by creating a safe, 
seamless and integrated transportation network, not just 
nationally but internationally and continentally. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is only by the federal government showing leadership and 
working with the other partners, the provincial governments, the 
municipal governments and the private sector, that we will be 
able to enhance our transportation system and ensure that there 
is no gridlock, that the trade can move, that the wealth is 
created so we can continue to afford the support for health care 
and education that our citizens are demanding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would hope that the government would listen, would readjust 
its priorities and would consider that perhaps spending more 
money in HRDC is not what the Canadian taxpayers want.  They want 
their money to go into priorities like health care, education and 
improved transportation systems.

its present form?  Does she support the five principles of the 
health care system?

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Val Meredith:</B>  Mr. Speaker, in response to the member 
for Ottawa Centre, I am not an expert in health care nor do I 
profess to be, and I am not an expert on a bill coming out of the 
province of Alberta. However, I will tell the hon. member that 
the system we have had for 30 years is not working. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member is fooling himself and the Canadian public if he 
maintains that there is not already a multi-tier health care 
system.  Anybody who has the financial wherewithal goes south to 
the United States for treatment.  In my riding which borders the 
United States, when people are told they are going to have to 
wait 8, 12 or 18 months for treatment, they go to the United 
States to get that treatment within days or weeks, if they can 
afford it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is already a multi-tier health care system.  The 
government deludes itself when it thinks and tells Canadians that 
that does not exist and that every Canadian has the same access 
to good quality health care in this country.  It is deluding 
itself if it thinks that.  The health care system that has been 
in place for 30 years does not work.  It has been proven that it 
does not work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government would be well advised to open its eyes and its 
brain and look at alternatives of how we can make our health care 
system really work.  The one it is supporting does not work.  As 
the leadership in this country it should be trying to find a 
system that does work.  All Canadians deserve access to the care 
that they need regardless of where they live or how much money 
they have.  They do not have that in today's health care system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government should not be asking me whether or not I support 
it.  Canadians are asking the government what it has to offer 
that will ensure they have access to health care when they need 
it. They do not want to wait two years or 18 months or 15 months 
for that care.  They are looking for leadership and they are not 
getting it from the federal government.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Reg Alcock (Parliamentary Secretary to President of the 
Queen's Privy Council for Canada and Minister of 
Intergovernmental Affairs, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, tempted as I 
am to jump into the current debate, I think I will take advantage 
of the very few minutes I have to make a few comments as I have 
every year since I came to the House in 1993. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will begin by congratulating the finance minister, members of 
the House and literally thousands of Canadians who participated 
in the development of this budget.  They participate every year. 
One of the things I particularly admire about our current finance 
minister is that he instituted a process some years ago to open 
it up.  He took it out of the secrecy of a few backrooms and put 
it in front of the Canadian people for comment, discussion and 
debate in the committee rooms, church basements and school 
gymnasiums across the country. That is what happens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are participating in a process which is extremely important. 
I want to offer a couple of comments to my friends in the 
official opposition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House of Commons in our history, which is British 
parliamentary history, came into existence to oversee the taking 
of taxes from people, to comment on and to act as a control and 
accountability structure for the money that was taken from people 
and given to the king. The watching, monitoring, criticizing and 
the acting as a check and a balance on the government has been an 
important function of this Chamber since its inception, yet this 
year we had a situation that I have not seen before. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am in my 12th year of elected office of which I spent five 
years in a provincial house and I have never seen a situation 
where the day after the budget was read, the official opposition 
stood and completely ignored it.  It could find nothing to 
criticize or comment on. It is absolutely incredible to me how 
the official opposition party, which has long prided itself on 
being different and into some new politic, immediately realized 
it did not have much to criticize and it switched tactics.  It 
got back onto something which it thought was a more fruitful 
political ground but not necessarily more fruitful for the people 
of this country.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Next week it starts all over again.  Next week we will begin a 
series of meetings with people.  We have looked at the 
initiatives in this year's budget.  We have looked at initiatives 
that we would like to have seen in it.  We are thinking anew 
about some of the concerns that people have raised with us as we 
have discussed these issues around the country.  We will go once 
more back into the same process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to use a very simple example just to highlight how 
useful and how important this process is.  The current 
Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Finance and I have had 
an interest in employee stock ownership programs for some time. 
It is an interest that was brought to each of us differentially. 
In his constituency people approached him and started raising the 
issue with him.  In my constituency in Winnipeg people met with 
me.  Interestingly enough I wrote about it once in one of my 
householders and a gentleman living a few blocks up the street 
from my office came in to see me because he had written a book on 
it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We began a discussion.  We did a little work on it.  We took it 
to the finance minister in that first year and it was felt that 
there was not a lot of information on it.  It was a complex topic 
so we put it off for a year.  During that year we went to work on 
it.  We met with more people and we built a database on it.  We 
had a better understanding of it and we made a presentation on it 
again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is interesting that in this year's budget plan we are 
beginning to see movement toward it.  There is actually a 
development of some stock option programs and a reference to 
employee stock option programs in the budget plan, which forms 
the basis of the work we will do this year.  We will go back into 
it one more time, drawing together experts from the community and 
looking at how we might make it help small businesses in this 
instance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is what this process is.  Literally thousands of people 
across the country will be invited to participate in the process. 
In my constituency they come together two or three times during 
the budget cycle in the fall.  We will add our voice to that of 
everyone else who comes before the committee. We will go to the 
minister with our ideas about how we can improve the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is what the budget is all about.  There is no secrecy in 
it.  The finance minister has consciously run a very open and 
transparent process, and I think he deserves an enormous amount 
of congratulations on it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is why the budget has come through with such ease.  People 
see it as their budget.  People see their concerns reflected in 
it.  There will always be demands for changes and improvements. 
We will continue to work on that.  We will continue to go back 
into the cycle.  We will continue to invite Canadians into the 
process.  It would be interesting to see if the official 
opposition would take its responsibilities and not hide from 
them.

approves in general the budgetary policy of the government. 
<P><A NAME="LINK200"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I congratulate the member on his speech because his 
words were very encouraging.  He reminded all of us in the House 
of something in which I firmly believe, that the role of 
parliament is to limit the ability of the government to tax and 
to spend. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We all know the history.  Originally it was the king and his 
horsemen around him who went around with a mace, the symbol of 
which we have here.  If people did not pay their taxes, I guess 
they were clubbed on the head with the mace.  We have that symbol 
of authority in the House.  It used to be that the king taxed 
people too much.  The people said that was the end of it and 
parliament came into being. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a member of parliament I would like to ask the member a 
couple of questions in that regard.  Has he ever voted against 
the current king's requisitions?  I say that advisedly. The Prime 
Minister and the finance minister seem to come up with a budget. 
It seems the only member on the other side who has ever voted 
against a budget measure sits right now beside me over here.  He 
was censured by the government for doing exactly that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Has the member voted in favour of an amendment to reduce it? For 
example, in an previous budget the Reform Party at the time put 
forward some amendments to reduce some departmental budgets of 
billions of dollars by $10,000.  At that time we made the point 
that it was symbolic, just to show that parliament had the final 
control on expenditures.  Did he vote in favour of it?  Does he 
represent his constituents as an MP when he supports by his votes 
the spending of money to make films like <I>Bubbles Galore</I> and 
to hang dead rabbits on fences? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Reg Alcock:</B>  Madam Speaker, actually on the final 
question I am quite proud to say yes, I do.  The rabbits were 
hung on fences in my riding.  I supported the display 
wholeheartedly.  I thought it was a very creative and interesting 
piece of art. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member asked a question and I will take it very directly. 
Have I ever voted against a budgetary motion of the government? 
The answer is no, I have not and I will not.  I am a member of a 
team, a member of a community.  Teams work together.  That is how 
this place runs.  That is how the government runs.  That is how 
human society runs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We think that somehow this organization, this government, will 
work with a bunch of independent members controlling their own 
destinies all the time.  It is a foolish, foolish symbol.  The 
reality is life.  When more than one person is involved in any 
exercise, it is an exercise of compromise. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have processes for that.  The processes are sometimes called 
parties.  We come together.  We think.  We work.  We fight.  We 
argue.  Do I fight?  I fight strongly.  I think some members will 
tell the House that I am not the least bit shy when it comes to 
discussions in my caucus, but when it comes to standing up with 
my team, with the people whose values I support, yes, I support 
them.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rick Casson (Lethbridge, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, I have a question for the member opposite.  One line in 
the budget of this year referred to the net public debt.  We 
heard the Minister of Finance say during question period today 
that money was put toward the debt and the debt is being reduced. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The line item in the government's own documents from last year 
indicated that the net public debt was $576.8 billion.  This year 
it is the same amount and next year it will be the same amount. 
If money is being applied to the debt, why is it not showing up 
in its own documents? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Reg Alcock:</B>  Madam Speaker, I spent five years in 
opposition.  Members could go through some of my statements about 
budgets and the way I would take particular terms, twist them 
around and throw them back, so I cannot be too critical of some 
of the things said here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we examine what has gone on in the fiscal management of the 
country, the reality is that we are far better off today than we 
were in 1993.  Growth is at levels we never predicted it would 
reach.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us look at unemployment.  I recall in the 1993 campaign one 
leader saying unemployment could not fall.  This was the leader 
of the party that had been in power at that time for nine years. 
He predicted that unemployment could not fall below 10%, and yet 
we are substantially below that today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Taxes are coming down.  The debt is coming down.  Employment is 
up.  There are some significant problems and there are problems 
looming over the horizon as there will be throughout our lifetime 
and into the future.  What we have here is a very responsible, 
reasonable and balanced approach to managing those problems, and 
I have no trouble supporting it. 
<P><A NAME="LINK202"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Scott Brison (Kings—Hants, PC):</B> Madam Speaker, my 
question for the hon. member is very simple.  As a member of 
parliament who was elected in 1988, although I am not absolutely 
certain of that, he is accountable not only for his current views 
but also for his views on issues and policies that were debated 
fiercely at that time and ultimately helped shape the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><I>The Economist</I> magazine 1998 preview listed several 
policies of the previous government and indicated that those 
policies provided the current government with the ability to 
eliminate the deficit.  I believe the article indicated that 
credit for deficit reduction in Canada belonged to the structural 
changes made to the Canadian economy by the previous government, 
the Progressive Conservative government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It listed free trade, the GST, and deregulation of financial 
services, transportation and energy. More specifically it 
identified free trade and the GST as the two policies which most 
fundamentally allowed the current government to eliminate the 
deficit.  Where did the member stand on the issues of free trade 
and the GST? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Reg Alcock:</B>  Madam Speaker, it is always interesting 
to hear members of the party, which I think is the most 
discredited party in the history of Canada, say that deficit 
reduction was because of their policies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They were in power for nine years, during which time the debt 
went up, costs escalated and unemployment went up.  Things got 
worse and worse and worse until Canadian voters threw them out. 
Only one sitting member was re-elected and one new member was 
elected.  It was the lowest return of any government in the 
history of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Scott Brison:</B>  Madam Speaker, I asked the hon. member 
where he stood on free trade and the GST.  According to very 
sound economic analyses, including probably the most credible 
economics and current affairs publication in the world, <I>The 
Economist</I> magazine, credited the structural changes made by 
the previous government with eliminating the deficit, free trade 
and GST, being the most important ones. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unless the hon. member wants to be accused of being the patron 
saint of hypocrisy in the House of Commons today, I suggest he 
answer the question and tell us where he stood on the free trade 
and GST policies that his government would not have had the 
vision or courage to initiate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Reg Alcock:</B>  Madam Speaker, it is very simple.  When 
this government came to power it changed its fiscal policy.  The 
former governor of the Bank of Canada, supported strongly by the 
previous prime minister, kept jacking up interest rates in some 
forlorn hope that it would somehow solve all the problems.  They 
reaped the rewards.  Their understanding of how to manage the 
economy was so weak and so meaningless that they earned their 
just rewards. 
<P><A NAME="LINK203"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rick Casson (Lethbridge, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, some days the debate in here is better than other days. 
I will be sharing my time with the hon. leader of the Canadian 
Alliance.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we talk about what was and was not in the budget, one thing 
we ask Canadians to do is to check their pay stubs.  Compare those 
of January this year with those of January last year and those of 
January next year, and then factor in just what kind of a tax cut 
they are getting from the Liberal government.  It will not add up 
to very much. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to touch on the concerns that people have brought to my 
attention as we talk about the country and the well-being of 
Canadians in general. The number one issue that keeps coming up 
is health care.  It has been on the table for a long time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians fear that the health care system is not going to take 
care of them when they need it.  They are worried that family 
members who become ill will not get the care they need and that 
it will not be available to Canadians on a universal basis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need to put into perspective what has actually happened. 
While the government was cutting billions of dollars out of 
health care since it was elected in 1993, the grants and 
contributions to departments like HRDC were going up. We need to 
keep in mind that the waiting lines are growing, that 212,000 
people are on waiting lists for health care in this country 
because of cuts that the government has made.  All the time it 
was doing that, it was increasing the grants and contributions to 
departments like HRDC.  That is not the way Canadians expect 
their government to act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are looking for solutions to the health care problem and we 
have heard a lot about Bill 11 in Alberta lately. I do not 
believe we have seen legislation that is going to solve Canada's 
health care problems. We have not seen it yet. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We and other Canadians have to allow ourselves to open up our 
minds and get into the debate.  Our country has a huge resource 
of very knowledgeable people in the health care field, people who 
know how to deliver it properly.  We have to open our minds and 
allow ourselves to create a system that is sustainable and 
universally available to all Canadians. If we do not allow that 
to happen, if every time someone comes up with an idea that is a 
little different from the status quo, we jump on them and try to 
beat them down, we are going to end up perpetuating the trouble 
we have now forever. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us allow ourselves to have that debate and come up with some 
sustainable solutions. Health care must be put at the top of the 
priority list.  Canadians want that.  They are demanding it.  It 
is a concern to everyone. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As our population ages, as the seniors who helped create this 
country need more and more care, it has to be available.  As 
people of my generation age, there will be a huge bubble of 
people to take care of.  All of these things have to be factored 
in when we are looking at solutions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I mentioned the trouble we have seen at HRDC with the 
unaccountability of the government in handling taxpayers' 
dollars.  One thing Canadians are extremely disturbed about is 
that the government takes money out of their pockets, takes it to 
Ottawa and then mismanages it. We cannot have that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are hurting.  We are paying the highest taxes of the 
industrialized countries.  The government takes the money and 
mismanages it and we cannot track where it went. Grants were 
given when there were no applications.  No follow-ups were done 
to see if jobs were actually created. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Day after day the HRDC minister stands in the House and drags 
into this debate hardworking, honest, volunteer organizations in 
all of our communities. She drags their names into this debate. 
They are not the problem. The hardworking organizations that do a 
great job are not the problem.  The problem is the government and 
the minister that is mismanaging their money. I feel sorry for 
the groups that have been mentioned by the minister. She is 
bringing them down to her level instead of raising herself up to 
their level of accountability and hard work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A little earlier I asked a question of the member opposite about 
the debt. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1720"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT41"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT41"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1720

<A HREF="#LINKT40"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again today the finance minister said the debt is being paid 
down.  However in the five year projection that was in this 
year's budget documents, the debt does not go down; it stays at 
$576.8 billion.  It takes over $40 billion a year in interest 
payments to service that debt.  In a five year period that is 
$200 billion just for the interest.  According to the document I 
am looking at which was produced by the government, the principal 
does not go down one nickel. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we think about the $40 billion that is being spent on debt 
charges, what happens if the economy turns a bit and interest 
rates go up a couple of percentage points?  That will cause a 
change in a hurry and it will hurt every program. Every 
worthwhile need that citizens in the country have will be 
affected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The high cost of fuel is a huge issue from coast to coast to 
coast. Certainly in my riding it is.  A group of people has come 
together to raise the awareness of the cost of fuel. There is a 
tax component both provincially and federally in the cost of a 
litre of fuel.  That should have been addressed in the budget. 
Where is the break for people who are on fixed incomes who try to 
get by when their cost of living keeps going up? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On transportation, our highway system has degenerated to the 
point where doing trade east and west is becoming difficult. It 
has been run down.  There are $4.5 billion collected in fuel 
taxes and only a small percentage of that is put back into the 
highway system.  We have to do something about that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Concerning our airports, the local municipality in the county of 
Lethbridge negotiated with this government to take over the 
operation of the airport on one condition, that the expense of 
the on-site fire services be taken away.  That was done.  The 
county took it over and now there is talk about putting that back 
in.  That is a $300,000 expense that was negotiated in good faith 
by the local municipality with this government and now the 
government is turning its back on it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The whole air transportation industry is in turmoil.  We have 
not seen any solid answers from the government on that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the grain transportation system we have had the Estey report 
and the Kroeger report.  There have been many hours of debate 
across the country by many organizations.  The grain 
transportation system on the prairies has to be reformed and it 
has to be done immediately in order to bring some relief to our 
beleaguered producers.  Where is that?  It is tied up somewhere. 
The minister has not made an announcement on that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We could go on and on.  Recently programs have been announced 
over and over by the government such as money for the disaster in 
agriculture on the prairies and across Canada.  Of the money that 
was put aside to service the disaster component of the problem 
that agriculture has right now, only 26% has got to the farmers. 
Sixty per cent of the people who applied, who felt they needed 
help, have been rejected.  The system has failed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have held meetings across the country with farmers and farm 
groups.  These are quotes from people in Unity, Saskatchewan: 
“AIDA created hope and then it slam-dunked us.  AIDA takes your 
figures and then invents its own and disqualifies you”.  These 
types of comments about a program that this government developed 
are coming from people who are on their last legs struggling to 
keep their heads afloat. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleague from Elk Island did say he had a small bouquet for 
the folks across the way.  I would like to give them one on 
bracket creep. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian Chamber of Commerce lobbied hard and we have 
lobbied hard for years to get the tax brackets indexed with 
inflation.  Finally it has been done.  But what the government 
did with that figure is it took the savings that we will realize 
from bracket creep because our taxes will not be going up and 
said it was a tax cut.  That is not a tax cut.  It is just money 
the government will not get its hands on.  That has been factored 
into the figures it has used in this tax cut of $58 billion, or 
$85 billion, or whatever it is.  It does not add up. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will end my comments with that.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Roy Cullen (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Finance, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, in reference to the comments 
from the member opposite, I recall when the former leader of the 
former opposition party, or to be more clear, the member for 
Calgary Southwest, was in this House at the start of the budget 
debate, he used the example of a retired couple, Paul and Fran 
Darr of Calgary, Alberta with a total income of $28,000.  He 
related how this couple had come to him and said that they were 
paying too much in taxes and they were tired of paying taxes.  It 
was the old pay stub or equivalent debate that the Reform Party, 
or the alliance or whatever it is called, was putting forward. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I asked the tax department how much in federal income tax Paul 
and Fran Darr of Calgary, Alberta would save with this new budget 
2000. The answer was they would save 39% in their federal income 
taxes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When opposition members talk about pay stubs and all that stuff, 
I ask them to check whether the pay stubs reflect even the budget 
measures we brought into place in 1998-99.  They certainly do not 
reflect the budget measures we introduced in 2000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another thing is the transfers to the provinces for health care, 
the CHST.  For Canadians who are actually listening to the debate 
they must be hopelessly confused and I do not blame them.  There 
is a way of twisting and contorting the facts.  Let me again put 
the facts on the CHST on the table. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1993-94 the total CHST transfers to the provinces were $28.9 
billion.  Forget equalization.  In 1999-2000 they are now at a 
level of $29.4 billion.  They are completely restored from the 
levels when we came into office.  At the same time our direct 
program delivery budgets are down $4 billion. Does that not say 
something about the priority the government attaches to health 
care? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the intervening time, perhaps the member has had a chance to 
go back to check the budget notes.  Perhaps he would like to 
clarify the points he made earlier. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rick Casson:</B>  Madam Speaker, I would like to clarify a 
couple of points especially about family taxes, tax cuts and the 
whole idea of getting the government's hands out of the pockets 
of hardworking Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We put out a proposal on a 17% single rate tax.  An income of 
$28,000 has been mentioned.  Let us look at a single income 
family of four.  This is federal personal income tax payable in 
the year 2004.  This is after the implementation of the 
proposals.  Let us look at a family of four earning $30,000. 
Under this Liberal status quo budget and tax regime this family 
would pay $2,541 annually. Under solution 17 the family would pay 
$387. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is substantial tax relief. That is the kind of tax relief 
Canadians are expecting when revenues and budget surpluses are 
going to be in the tens of billions of dollars, approaching $100 
billion.  That is the kind of tax relief Canadians expect from 
their government, substantial tax relief that will leave more 
money in their pockets, $200 or $300 a month, instead of the $200 
or $300 a year that has been proposed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us look at a family of four earning $40,000.  Under this 
Liberal government's status quo tax regime, that family will pay 
a little over $5,000 a year in tax.  Under solution 17 a single 
rate tax, it would be $2,000.  That is a 60% saving in taxes. 
That is the kind of substantial tax relief Canadians are 
expecting from their government when they are looking at huge 
surpluses.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Miss Deborah Grey (Leader of the Opposition, Canadian

the last speaker in the budget debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I sat through the spring session which began on February 7 and 
it was interesting to think about what it was this budget was 
trying to accomplish, what the great fanfare was all about.  We 
heard about how wonderful the budget was, how there was going to 
be tax relief and how every Canadian would actually feel better 
when they went to bed at night.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As members know and have watched, superseding that we have 
witnessed in the House day after day questions and serious 
concerns about the actual financial mismanagement of the 
government.  Of course the Liberals brag all the time about how 
they are great managers of our money, and yet we saw a billion 
dollars not go missing or lost, as the HRD minister likes to 
accuse us of suggesting, but go to many of the wrong places.  It 
has gone for political motivation, maybe buying a seat if someone 
was in close danger of losing a seat in any particular election. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>People have asked me why I have not actually asked a question 
about the budget.  This scandal and the billion dollar boondoggle 
is the budget.  It is about unbelievable spending and 
unbelievable waste, and yet I noticed in the budget that the 
government in all government departments will spend $13.3 billion 
on grants and contributions.  That is a pile of money.  As people 
across the country have watched the HRDC scandal and this amazing 
boondoggle, they have said that they resent working hard, sending 
their money to Ottawa in the form of tax dollars and then having 
it disappear to various places. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The question is not whether some of the HRDC programs are good. 
There are benefits in some of the things that have happened, but 
that is a debate for another day.  What we and Canadians across 
the country are critical of is this unbelievable waste and 
unbelievable sense that government has largesse and is free to 
hand this money out to whomever it pleases for either political 
or personal purposes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is the frustration which I think people feel across the 
country, and it is probably not just in ridings that are not held 
by Liberals.  I have spoken to Liberal members of parliament who 
have gone home to try to pump the budget as being wonderful, and 
yet the question that comes back to them is about the money that 
is being mismanaged.  I think that all of us have been asked that 
question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was at the Alberta Land Titles Registry just before the budget 
came down.  A fellow who was standing in line and did not 
recognize me or my husband said “Maybe I should get an HRDC 
grant for this”.  We know, if people are hanging out in offices 
or coffee shops or whatever and the level of discussion from 
parliament has filtered down to the ground level so that people 
are using it as buzzwords and saying things like “Maybe I should 
get an HRDC grant”, that the public is starting to register 
their frustration.  They are saying that it is their cash and 
they want a few answers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the budget talked about tax relief and told Canadians about 
tax relief, I am not so sure they were convinced.  People right 
across the country are saying “Don't tell me, show me”. They 
want to see physical proof on their paystubs that they are 
getting tax relief. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have to tell members that I have not been swamped in my 
constituency office or on an airplane or in a washroom at Pearson 
airport or on Parliament Hill with people saying that the tax 
relief feels good.  In fact I have not had one person tell me 
that.  They are hearing about that tax relief, but they are not 
seeing it.  The government has told them how wonderful it is, but 
nobody has come thundering down to my door saying “I love this 
tax relief.  It feels so good”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us look at some of the numbers.  We were told, with trumpets 
on budget day, that taxes will decrease $58.4 billion.  That 
ought to feel good.  That is a pile of cash.  That money is not 
just going back into peoples' pockets, it means that the circle 
is complete by not having to send that money to Ottawa in the 
first place.  The finance minister thought that $58.4 billion was 
wonderful and that people would feel much better and happier. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have never been good at magic, but what I saw happen that day 
and in the ensuing weeks was probably one of the best magic acts 
we have seen in a while.  We put our hand in the hat, pull it out 
and say “Wow, there is $58.4 billion in tax relief”.  However, 
if we look at it, the rabbit that came out of that hat has a 
different thing to say.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The finance minister said that the $58.4 billion in tax relief 
was going to be over five years, but if we look at the numbers 
and scratch a little deeper this is what we find. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Sure, we have the Liberal claim of $58.4 billion in tax relief 
over five years, but then we have to do the math, the real math, 
not the new math and not the Liberal math.  If we did that we 
would find that there is a minus.  Over five years $7.5 billion 
will be used for social spending on the child benefit.  That is 
not really tax relief.  It is a social program, so we cannot 
really say that it is tax relief.  Off the top we have to take 
$7.5 billion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then of course there is a mere $29.5 billion that has to be 
subtracted in increased Canada pension plan premiums over the 
same five year period.  If a person was a responsible finance 
minister or any other member of government they would say 
“Whoops”.  That really does need to be fit into the equation 
because $58.4 billion is not all that it is trumpeted up to be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Off that amount we have to take $29.5 billion because with the 
shell game that the Liberals are playing they say they are giving 
us $58.4 billion, but they forget to say that they are taking 
$29.5 billion off in increased CPP premiums.  Every single 
Canadian who is working knows that since the beginning of January 
they have had a few more dollars snapped off their paycheques in 
CPP premiums.  This could have been an oversight, it could have 
been an accident, but we do have to figure the $29.5 billion into 
the mathematical equation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to make another subtraction from the $58.4 billion. 
There is $13.5 billion in scheduled tax hikes which have been 
cancelled.  There are some pretty hot semantics.  “We are giving 
Canadians an amazing deal.  We are giving Canadians $13.5 billion 
in tax breaks, but in fact”—and this is the new math, the 
Liberal math—“what we are doing is cancelling what Canadians 
were going to be hit with”.  Canadians really had not paid that 
money anyway.  They would have gotten stuck with paying it if the 
program had carried on.  The government is not really taking this 
money off taxes.  It was going to nail us with that, but decided 
not to.  I suppose that could be called a tax break. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I taught English, not math.  Math is not my finest suit, but I 
could figure that much out.  If someone said they were going to 
hit me with something and then said they were not going to hit 
me, then I am not really getting a break.  I am then told that I 
will not to be hit quite as badly as planned by scheduled 
increases.  That is not exactly terrific.  It is not a tax break. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us do the mathematical equation.  I have a mathematician 
sitting behind me, one of my colleagues, who knows his math 
better than I do and some others in this Chamber.  If we take 
$58.4 billion and subtract $7.5 billion, and then subtract $29.5 
billion, and then subtract $13.5 billion, that equals $7.9 
billion in tax relief.  That is not quite as glamorous as it 
seemed when the budget was being delivered. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This will happen over five years, so we need to divide that 
amount by five, which equals $1.58 billion per year.  If we want 
to work that amount down a bit, because that is still quite a few 
zeros, let us look at it this way.  This wonderful tax cut which 
everyone is bragging about, while they are waltzing around the 
country telling people how wonderful they are, equals $107.06 per 
year per taxpayer.  If that does not seem quite so glamorous, it 
equals $8.97 a month or $2.07 a week. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can understand why people have not been coming like rolling 
thunder into my office out west to say they are thrilled with 
$2.07 a week.  A person cannot even go to McDonald's on that 
amount.  That is why people are not praising the government for 
this wonderful tax relief which the Liberals bragged about in the 
budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian public want straight answers on the billion dollar 
boondoggle and where that money has gone.  Canadians are far more 
concerned about that than the $2 a week they will be getting with 
this hotshot tax relief.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Roy Cullen (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Finance, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, maybe the new Canadian 
Alliance has some new math, but under the old math of the Reform 
Party, if we look at its tax plan, it said that in year three it 
would give $26 billion worth of tax cuts and $26 billion worth of 
debt reduction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we look at the surpluses that are being projected by eight of 
Canada's leading economists, the way I read it, in 2002-03 we 
should expect surpluses of $12.5 billion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is the same party that was asking for increases in 
expenditures for the military, the RCMP, infrastructure and aid 
for farmers.  If we add $26 billion and $26 billion we get $52 
billion, and then we have to add the additional expenditures 
which the Reform Party was pursuing.  It seems to me that would 
be quite a bit more than $12.5 billion, which is the amount we 
would actually have in surpluses.  Maybe the Canadian Alliance 
has some new math. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A person came to my office who was very excited and said “I 
have heard about Reform's solution 17.  If the government would 
implement a flat tax, I would save a lot of money”.  It turned 
out that under the Reform Party's proposal for a flat tax that 
person would save 39%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I scratched a little more and, lo and behold, that person was 
earning $200,000 a year.  I scratched a little more and I 
compared that with someone under the flat tax who earned $30,000. 
They would only save 12%.  Yes, there was someone who was quite 
excited about the flat tax proposed by the Reform Party, but they 
happened to be earning $200,000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lou Sekora:</B>  That is who they like. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Roy Cullen:</B>  Exactly, those are their supporters.  But 
the poor person and the middle income Canadian would not get the 
benefit of that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am wondering if the Leader of the Opposition could rethink the 
math on her tax proposal and clarify things for the House, 
because I think Canadians must be very confused. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Miss Deborah Grey:</B>  Madam Speaker, boy, there is a ramble. 
If that is how the Liberals do math on the other side I can 
understand why we have some pretty serious problems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member is talking about a tax plan and $26 billion in 
surpluses.  The member would know that the most conservative 
estimates of 2.5%, 3%, 3.5% in economic growth are very, very 
conservative, so we have estimated those surpluses probably not 
quite as hugely or as magnificently as the finance minister.  I 
think he was talking about $95 billion a year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member asked me a question about our solution 17.  I would 
like to tell him, as I certainly hope he knows, because I know he 
does his research well, that WEFA, the economic forecasting think 
tank, said that the solution 17 which we have proposed under the 
Canadian Alliance would be absolutely workable.  WEFA ran the 
numbers once, twice, perhaps even three times and said that this 
would be a workable solution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know the hon. member would jump up if he had another chance to 
be recognized and ask who these people are who we found to come 
up with numbers the way we wanted the numbers to be.  In fact, it 
is the very same group that does the economic forecasting and 
think tank work for the Minister of Finance.  That group ran 
exactly the same numbers for him. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I put my faith in solution 17.  It has been verified by the very 
group that verifies the budget, the finance minister's plan.  I 
think if solution 17 were implemented it would be terrific. 
There would be a basic exemption of $10,000 for person <I>A</I>, 
and then the spouse would get another $10,000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What if a person is not married?  I was not married for it 
seemed like forever, but I am now and I love Lew.  If a person 
does not have a spouse, he or she could claim a child as a 
spousal equivalent.  People would get a $20,000 exemption before 
they would even have to think about paying tax. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think the couple in Calgary to whom the member referred 
earlier would be wonderfully blessed by solution 17.

to order made earlier today, the House will now proceed to the

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gordon Earle (Halifax West, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I was 
appalled by the Liberal government's answer to the question I 
raised in the House of Commons on December 3, 1999.  The answer, 
or rather lack thereof, provided by the Liberal government makes 
me wonder if it really has control of government or not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My question was a simple one:  Given that the auditor general 
commended in-house bids for military contracts for meeting all 
the criteria of being good business cases, would the Liberal 
government ensure that an in-house bid would be welcomed and 
considered? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Incredibly, the Liberal government refused to answer this 
question, spouting generalities instead. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I then became more specific, indicating savings projected in 
supply chain business cases.  My figures showed that the Liberal 
government's projected savings from contracting out through 
alternative service delivery may have been overstated.  When I 
asked the government to clarify the matter, the response I 
received again did not answer the question at hand. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This leaves me very concerned indeed about who is in control of 
contracts and expenditures in our military. 
I received a letter from a constituent dated March 16 of this 
year which stated: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have had to fight tooth and nail to keep our jobs from going 
out to contractors who charge the government ridiculous amounts 
for the tasks we used to do and these contractors pay employees 
just above the minimum wage. They (meaning the contractors) are 
paid huge amounts for nothing and some of them have been fired 
before completely their contract.  We have a large battle ahead 
of us just to keep our jobs from going to the private sector even 
though we are the most cost effective organization.

<A HREF="#LINKT50"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am concerned that this whole contracting out process is a 
waste of taxpayers' hard earned money.  It makes me wonder if the 
Minister of National Defence was out of town during the human 
resources department scandal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another constituent wrote to me on February 17 stating: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The only people who are walking to the bank are the consulting 
firms and military brass who are walking out one door in military 
dress and walking back in with suit and tie working for these big 
conglomerates.  We were the guinea pigs for their first trial run 
with Alternative Service Delivery, we cut our workforce by more 
than half.  We told these consultants we are the best bang for 
the taxpayers dollars, but off they went to the bank. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to direct the Liberals' attention to a report 
produced by their own defence department and the comments made 
therein concerning ASD: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Had the management of this Montreal-based CF supply and 
maintenance infrastructure been turned over to the private sector 
under the ASD program, it is doubtful whether the military could 
have transformed it so quickly into such an effective third line 
support organization. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>When civilian military workers successfully beat the ASD 
contract bids of private companies, the government abruptly 
changed the rules of engagement to favour large corporations. The 
bundling of bids provides for the awarding of contracts on a 
national basis, not only a cheap shot at our military, but a slap 
in the face to small business throughout the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is the Liberal government's real agenda?  An efficient 
military or a privatized and gutted military with enough funds 
for huge capital purchases but not enough to sustain the 
dedicated men and women serving Canada in both civilian and 
military roles? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before rushing blindly into a minefield, will the government not 
take time and fully explore what continued contracting out will 
mean to the people of Halifax and elsewhere? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On behalf of the many Canadians who work hard and efficiently 
for our Canadian forces and on behalf of all taxpayers eager not 
to see their hard earned money wasted, will the Liberal 
government review its contracting out policy within our military? 
Will the government involve all of those affected in this review 
and will it make the findings public? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Once and for all I ask for a direct answer instead of a sales 
pitch from the Liberals about how wonderful and rosy things are 
in the military. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK221"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Robert Bertrand (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
National Defence, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, the Department of 
National Defence and the Canadian forces remain very determined 
to maintain a multipurpose combat ready force.  They are, 
however, obliged to run the defence program as efficiently and 
cost-effectively as possible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The department remains firmly in favour of ASD, alternative 
service delivery, which is an important tool in improving the 
efficiency of the organization by freeing up resources and 
putting them to work where the need is greatest, that is 
operational readiness. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In simple terms, the department and the Canadian forces must 
devote their limited resources to the functions that they alone 
can perform.  To date, annual savings from ASD initiatives are 
estimated at around $62 million.  However, the department expects 
these annual savings to increase to approximately $175 million in 
the years to come. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Given the complexity of managing the supply chain for an 
organization as broad as DND and the Canadian forces, the 
department believes that the only feasible option is to pursue a 
commercial approach through a competitive process.  These savings 
resulting from the supply chain project are expected to be 
between 20% and 30%.  Its aim is to improve the efficiency of 
supply activities by introducing a competitive process and using 
private sector expertise.  The supply chain project will allow 
DND and the Canadian forces to get access to critical logistics 
expertise, innovation and leading edge technologies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can assure the House that the Department of National Defence 
continues to make progress on various ASD initiatives.  It will 
continue to consult closely with all stakeholders, including 
unions and employees.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Greg Thompson (New Brunswick Southwest, PC):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, I am following up on a question I had for the health 
minister on March 17 in regard to the compensation package for 
hepatitis C victims. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is no secret that all of us on this side of the House are 
very disappointed with this package.  To begin with, it only 
covers the victims between the years 1986 and 1990.  Victims 
prior to 1986 are not included in the package.  Victims after 
1990 are not included. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To add insult to injury, aside from leaving out those innocent 
victims prior to 1986 and after 1990, not one victim has received 
a nickel of compensation from the federal government.  Not one 
single person. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Adding insult to injury once again, the only people who have 
been paid by the federal government are the lawyers who are 
handling this case. The legal nightmare that we envisioned has 
evolved in the way we said it would.  Only the lawyers have been 
paid.  There is something wrong with a package that only pays the 
lawyers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I asked the minister to take some leadership on this issue and 
do something.  For example, do what the province of Ontario and 
the province of Quebec have done, which is to introduce a no 
fault compensation scheme. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To conclude, I want to quote from Justice Krever's report. He 
recommended without delay that the government, the provinces and 
territories devise statutory no fault schemes for compensating 
persons who suffer serious adverse consequences as a result of 
the administration of blood components and blood products. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government has simply not done that.  We are asking 
it to get on with the business of compensating those innocent 
victims.  We want action.

<P><A NAME="LINK224"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Robert Bertrand (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
National Defence, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, the Government of Canada 
met the provincial and territorial representatives and, in March 
1998, the Minister of Health announced a plan to provide 
financial assistance of $1.1 billion to the thousands of victims. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By working collaboratively with the lawyers for the class action 
plaintiffs, we reached a settlement agreement which was approved 
by the Ontario, B.C. and Quebec courts in December 1999. This was 
only possible because the Government of Canada went to the 
provinces and to the claimants and proposed a solution to spare 
everyone the potential of even longer litigation. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Immediately following approval of the settlement, the Government 
of Canada transferred some $855 million into a trust fund in 
order to compensate the complainants.  In doing so, the 
Government of Canada met all its obligations under the 
settlement. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>]

begin processing claims and make payments as soon as possible.
