an indictable offence under the Criminal Code to kill, capture or 
sell wildlife or wildlife parts if the act is carried out without a 
licence, permit or an exemption order.
<P>
	The bill does not replace provincial wildlife laws, but rather it 
complements them in a similar manner that the Criminal Code also 
deals with serious driving offences.
<P>
	It provides for a maximum sentence of two years incarceration 
for a first offence and a maximum of three years for subsequent 
offences. If the animal in question is a threatened or endangered 
species, the maximum sentences are increased to a maximum of 
four years for a first offence, and eight years for a subsequent 
offence.
<P>
	The bill also calls for this section of the Criminal Code to be 
included as an enterprise crime, which means that it would be 
subject to the proceeds of crime legislation.
<P>
	This bill is a necessary piece of legislation to protect one of 
Canada's greatest treasures, its wildlife.

	<B>Mrs. Elsie Wayne (Saint John, PC):</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise, 
pursuant to Standing Order 36, to present a petition signed by 100 
people from Ontario and British Columbia.
<P>
	The petition states that we, the undersigned residents of Canada, 
draw the attention of the House to the following: that the wartime 
merchant navy was the fourth arm of the armed services; that 
veterans of the wartime merchant navy are under the Civilian War 
Related Benefits Act; that one in ten Canadian merchant seamen 
lost their lives, the highest proportional rate of all services; that 
merchant navy prisoners of war spend 50 months on average in 
imprisonment but only 30 days are recognized; that veterans of the 
wartime merchant navy are excluded from the War Veterans 
Allowance Act, from pensionable benefits, from veterans post 
World War II free university education, housing and land grant 
benefits, small business financial aid and veterans health care 
benefits.
<P>
	Therefore your petitioners call on Parliament to consider the 
advisability of extending benefits or compensation to veterans of 
the wartime merchant navy equal to that enjoyed by veterans of 
Canada's World War II armed services.

	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney General 
of Canada, Lib.)</B> moved that Bill C-33, an act to amend the 
Canadian Human Rights Act, be read the second time and referred 
to a committee.
<P>
	He said: Mr. Speaker, it is an honour for me to speak on second 
reading of Bill C-33 by which the government of Prime Minister 
Jean Chrétien achieves a number of important objectives at the 
same time.
<P>
	First, we fulfil an outstanding political commitment to the 
people of Canada. Second, we act to implement a longstanding 
policy of the Liberal Party of Canada. Third, we move to fill a gap 
in the federal human rights legislation, identified at various times 
in the past 20 years by previous Parliaments, by human rights 
commissioners and by the public at large.
<P>
	As to fulfilling a political commitment, the Prime Minister in the 
course of the last election campaign undertook to introduce this 
amendment. In the first throne speech in this Parliament after the 
election, that undertaking was repeated. In the months, indeed, in 
the years since as the Minister of Justice and Attorney General of 
the government I have repeated that commitment. And what is 
more, Canadian governments going back a decade have made the 
undertaking. It falls to us today at long last to fulfil it.
<P>
	In the policy of the Liberal Party of Canada which forms the 
government of the country, it is now almost 20 years since that 
party in its national convention adopted as a policy, a resolution 
that the act governing human rights should be amended in the very 
fashion prescribed by Bill C-33. That resolution has been repeated 
at various policy conventions in the years since.
<P>
	Indeed, in 1994 at the biennial convention in Ottawa, just such a 
resolution was once again adopted. As recently as this past 
weekend as the Ontario branch of the party met in Windsor, the 
subject was discussed and decided anew. The resolution once again 
is that sexual orientation ought to be added as a ground on which 
discrimination is prohibited in the federal human rights legislation.
<P>
	In filling a gap in the federal human rights law, the statute as it 
stands was enacted in 1975. Ten years later, eleven years ago, a 
resolution was adopted unanimously by an all-party committee of 
the House endorsing the concept of amending the statute in just the 
fashion that is proposed in Bill C-33.
<P>
	The courts have identified the gap. In the case of Haig in the 
Ontario Court of Appeal some years ago, it was the decision of that 
most senior appellate court that the federal act must be read as 
though it includes the words sexual orientation in prescribing 
discrimination and discriminatory practices in matters governed by 
the statute. The provinces have identified and have dealt with this 
gap.
<P>
	In the years since 1977 when Quebec was the first to amend its 
human rights legislation to add this ground, eight provinces and 
territories have moved to do so.
<P>
<B>(1015)</B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	So, this amendment is far from revolutionary. Quebec prohibited 
all discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation in 1977. 
Ontario did the same in 1986. In all, eight provinces or territories 
have amended their legislation in this regard. This means that 
almost 90 per cent of the population is protected by similar 
provisions.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Against this background, in the midst of all these commitments, 
these resolutions and all the action elsewhere, what has kept the 
federal government from following through? Why has it taken all 
these years before this step has been taken? Quite simply, there is 
real controversy about what such an amendment is and what it is 
not.
<P>
	The proposal stirs powerful feelings, caught up in notions of 
family and religion, who is and is not entitled to benefits in our 
society. That controversy, those issues and those feelings must not 
be allowed to stand in the way of simple human justice and 
equality. It is in the face of that controversy and notwithstanding 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2105"> 2105 </A></B>
<P>
those feelings  that we introduce and propose this amendment 
because it is the right thing to do.
<P>
	I want to make clear before I go on that as this debate unfolds, at 
least in my respectful view, no participant has the moral high 
ground, no one is holier than any other. I know there are strongly 
held views among those even within my own caucus who oppose 
this proposal. I respect those who take a different approach. 
However, at a certain point a government has to make a choice. At 
a certain point a government has to plot a course.
<P>
	In introducing this legislation the government has chosen to 
prohibit discrimination as a fundamental part of the equality of 
citizens in our country. I acknowledge that any government that 
introduces such a measure must accept responsibility for 
explaining what it is and what it is not. That we have undertaken to 
do. That I will attempt to do today.
<P>
	Let us look at what this amendment is and what it is not, so that 
we can agree on the real issues in this debate. It is an issue of 
human rights. It has to do with equality, with the dignity of 
individuals, with the principle that someone should not be 
discriminated against in the federal workplace because of who or 
what they are.
<P>
	The federal statute applies to the provision of goods and services 
and to employment in the federal public service and in 
undertakings regulated by federal legislation. Close to 11 per cent 
of the Canadian workforce is directly affected by the act.
<P>
	The statute sets out its purpose in section 2. It is there provided 
that the purpose of the act is to give effect to the principle that 
every individual should have an equal opportunity with other 
individuals to make for themselves the life they are able and wish 
to have, consistent with their duties and obligations as a member of 
society, without being hindered or prevented from doing so by 
discriminatory practices based on race, national or ethnic origin, 
colour, religion, age, sex, marital status, family status, disability or 
conviction for an offence for which a pardon has been granted.
<P>
	In the following part of the statute, under the heading 
``proscribed discrimination'', we learn what this statute deals with. 
I think it is very important throughout this debate to focus on the 
stuff and the substance of this legislation. We are not here talking 
about the make-up of the family. We are not here talking about the 
freedom to hold certain religious beliefs. We are not talking about 
promoting lifestyles. We are talking about discrimination.
<P>
<B>(1020)</B>
<P>
	In section 3 it is provided that for all the purposes of this act the 
enumerated characteristics I have read, age, gender, marital status, 
et cetera, are prohibited grounds of discrimination.
<P>
	In section 5 it is provided that it is discrimination in the 
provisions of goods and services or facilities or accommodation to 
deny access to any person because of one of the stated grounds.
<P>
	It is discrimination in section 6 to deny the rental of commercial 
or residential accommodation because of one of those grounds.
<P>
	It is discrimination in section 7 to refuse to employ or keep 
someone in employ simply because of one of those grounds; in 
section 8 to use or circulate any form of application for 
employment; in section 9 to refuse someone membership in an 
employee organization.
<P>
	In section 13 it is provided that it is unlawful to send hate 
messages, in citing hatred against persons identifiable on the basis 
of a prohibited ground of discrimination.
<P>
	In section 14 it is provided that it is a discriminatory practice to 
harass someone on the prohibited grounds of discrimination.
<P>
	That is what this legislation is about. It is about protecting 
Canadians on the grounds of their race, their ethnic or national 
origin, their colour, their religion or their marital status, from 
discrimination in their employment or their advancement or the 
availability of services, from discrimination based on messages of 
hatred based on one of the grounds on which discrimination is 
prohibited.
<P>
	All we seek to do is add sexual orientation to that list of grounds 
so that people will be protected on that basis as well. That is what 
this is about.
<P>
	In the absence of those words what recourse does one have if 
they are fired or not advanced or refused a service on the basis of 
sexual orientation? At the moment their only recourse is to rely on 
a decision of the Ontario Court of Appeal which requires the 
commission to read those words into the act so that complaints can 
be brought forward on that basis.
<P>
	Let me say two things about the insufficiency of that remedy for 
persons in that position. First it seems to the government that it is 
up to the Parliament of Canada to articulate and to codify 
fundamental principles of equality in this country and not leave 
that job to the courts.
<P>
	Second, while the Haig decision in Ontario had the effect I have 
described, there has already been a decision from the Alberta Court 
of Appeal to the contrary effect. There now exists confusion which 
will have to be resolved, if the Supreme Court of Canada grants 
leave, by the highest court in the land. Must the rights of Canadians 
to be free from dissemination on this ground be left to the outcome 
of contested litigation? I think not. It is time for Parliament to 
speak. It is time for us to codify this fundamental right.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2106"> 2106 </A></B>
<P>
	That is what this amendment is. It is a measure that would move 
against discrimination in the federal workplace and assure 
fundamental dignity and equality to Canadians.
<P>
	Let us treat for a moment that which this amendment is not. It 
does not deal with the conferral of benefits on any class or category 
of persons. It does not confer benefits on same sex couples. It does 
not confer benefits on homosexual individuals. The bill is silent on 
this point.
<P>
	No matter what Parliament does in relation to this bill the contest 
in tribunals and courts goes on. For many years courts have been 
asked to extend same sex benefits based on provincial and federal 
legislation. No matter what Parliament does in relation to this bill 
that issue will go on in the courts.
<P>
	It seems there is very powerful response to those who say that 
adding these words will lead to same sex benefits. The provinces 
since 1977 have almost all moved to add these words to their 
human rights legislation. Yet same sex benefits have not 
automatically followed from that measure. Those matters are still 
very much an issue throughout the country. Those who suggest 
adopting this bill will result in same sex benefits being extended 
should look to the provinces and see for themselves how faulty that 
logic is when applied in jurisdictions where this amendment was 
made.
<P>
<B>(1025 )</B>
<P>
	A recent judgment in the Supreme Court of Canada makes this 
point crystal clear. In the case of Egan and Nesbitt the Supreme 
Court of Canada was asked to decide based on an argument 
founded on the charter whether provisions in pensions benefits that 
were not available to same sex couples were discriminatory. The 
Supreme Court of Canada in the Egan and Nesbitt case earlier this 
year decided that sexual orientation must be read in as one of the 
grounds in section 15 of the charter on which discrimination is 
prohibited. It was unanimous on that point because it is an obvious 
principle of law.
<P>
	When it came to extending the benefits in the pension scheme to 
same sex couples, the court by majority refused it. The court by 
majority decided that the mere fact the charter prohibits 
discrimination does not equate with the proposition that benefits 
must be extended. That is a vivid demonstration of the principle 
that simply adding these words does not automatically lead to the 
extension of benefits.
<P>
	Let us look at the next category of what this bill is not. It is 
suggested by some that this bill will either directly or indirectly 
undermine or diminish the importance of family in Canadian life. 
The House will observe we have included a preamble in the bill 
which repeats and emphasizes the cardinal importance the 
government on behalf of all Canadians places on the role of family 
in Canadian life. It is fundamental to Canadian society and  we are 
determined to promote, protect and preserve the family as a centre 
point of society.
<P>
	What is it about this bill that founds the argument that it 
somehow diminishes family in Canadian life? Some say it will lead 
to same sex marriage, to which I respond it cannot do so.
<P>
	The solemnization of marriage is by the Constitution of the 
country a provincial and not a federal jurisdiction. While it is true 
to say that in section 91(26) of the Constitution Act of 1867 
marriage and divorce are assigned to the federal government, the 
included category of the solemnization of marriage is by section 
92(12) assigned to the provinces. There is legislation now before 
the courts by which applicants seek relief requiring Ontario to issue 
a licence to a same sex couple who apply, recognition that it is 
provincial regulation of the solemnization of marriage, including 
the issuance of licences, that governs who can marry. It is not a 
federal jurisdiction at all.
<P>
	When the federal Parliament came to legislate on the subject of 
marriage, it did so in a very narrow category. In Chapter M-2.1, the 
Marriage Prohibited Degrees Act, Parliament dealt with matters of 
consanguinity and prohibited marriage between related persons. 
When it comes to the solemnization of marriage in determining 
who is eligible for a licence, that is provincial and not federal 
jurisdiction.
<P>
	It is next said by some that this bill will undermine family by 
changing the definition of spouse, to which I say the bill does no 
such thing. The bill does not deal in any way with marriage, marital 
status or the definition of spouse. That word remains exactly as it 
appears in all federal legislation, including the Income Tax Act.
<P>
<B>(1030)</B>
<P>
	I am very sensitive to the need to support family as an essential 
component of Canadian life. I have been married for 13 years. I 
have three children, a daughter who is 11 and twin boys who are 8 
and about to be 9. My wife and I work very hard together to create a 
family home in which to nurture those children, in which to educate 
and prepare them for life by among other things instilling in them 
values that they can live by. One of those values is tolerance of 
others. I believe that tolerance is a family value.
<P>
	In my respectful view, nothing in this bill, no part of this 
amendment, diminishes my family. Nothing about this amendment 
threatens the security of our home or the love we feel for one 
another. Nothing reduces or impairs the rights that my wife and I 
enjoy to raise our children and live our lives according to our own 
values and according to what is in our hearts.
<P>
	Indeed, I suggest to this House today that the adoption of this bill 
which extends fundamental rights against discrimination to all 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2107"> 2107 </A></B>
<P>
Canadians can only improve the  world that my children will grow 
up in. It can only improve the country and society that willbe theirs.
<P>
	It is suggested by some that adopting this bill will lead to same 
sex adoptions to which I say that nothing could be further from the 
facts. The whole process of adoption is governed by provincial 
jurisdiction under the property and civil rights rubric in the 
Constitution.
<P>
	Again, I invite hon. members to apply logic in analysing this 
issue. In 1985 the government of the province of Ontario moved to 
add sexual orientation as a ground on which discrimination was 
prohibited in the Ontario human rights legislation. That bill was 
adopted in 1986 and became law in that year.
<P>
	Some eight years later in 1994, the legislature in Ontario was 
engaged in the debate on Bill 167 on whether to allow adoption for 
same sex couples. While that bill was defeated, the fact is that 
notwithstanding the addition of sexual orientation to the human 
rights act some eight years earlier, it was necessary to treat as a 
separate and distinct issue the question of adoption, recognizing 
that adding sexual orientation does not lead to that result. Those are 
the facts and that is the logic.
<P>
	To those who contend that on any basis adopting this amendment 
will confer special rights on gays and lesbians, let me point out to 
the House that the modification prohibits discrimination on the 
basis of sexual orientation, that we all have a sexual orientation, 
that it includes heterosexuality as well as homosexuality.
<P>
	May I also point out that in 1975 when this act was first adopted 
by this body no one suggested that by prohibiting discrimination on 
the basis of religion, race or ethnic origin we were conferring 
special rights on Catholics, on Caucasians or on those from a 
certain country. No such argument was tenable and no such 
argument can be made. I suggest that in the present context no such 
argument can be made.
<P>
	Let me continue to deal with what this bill is not so that this 
debate can be carried out on the facts and the merits of this case. 
Some suggest that this bill is inconsistent with principles of 
religion, that it is contrary to precepts or concepts of the worship of 
God. I am proud to stand in the House today to tell my colleagues 
this amendment has the support of the United Church of Canada, 
the Anglican Church of Canada, B'nai Brith Canada, the Canadian 
Jewish Congress. This bill is fundamentally consistent with the 
most basic teachings of religion.
<P>
<B>(1035)</B>
<P>
	I am by faith a Roman Catholic. My Irish Catholic mother saw to 
it that I was brought up in the church. I attended regularly, served 
as an altar boy and was educated from the beginning to the end of 
my years at school in Catholic institutions. I developed a deep 
respect for the tenets of the Catholic faith. I suggest this  
amendment and the action it constitutes is completely consistent 
with those tenets.
<P>
	Let me read from the apostolic constitution ``Life in Christ'' in 
the new catechism. In paragraph 2358 of the new catechism of my 
church, the Roman Catholic church, the subject of homosexuality 
is dealt with. In speaking of homosexuals, in speaking of gays and 
lesbians, in speaking of those very people against whom we 
propose to prohibit discrimination by Bill C-33, this is what my 
church, the Roman Catholic Church has to say: ``They''-gays and 
lesbians-``must be accepted with respect, compassion and 
sensitivity. Every sign of unjust discrimination in their regard 
should be avoided''.
<P>
	That is from ``Life in Christ''. That is the fundamental tenet of 
my church and that is the fundamental proposition of my bill: that 
every element of unjust discrimination should be prohibited.
<P>
	I believe that in adopting this bill the House would be acting on 
an important and basic principle in Canadian life. In the federal 
workplace, in those shops, stores and offices over which we have 
jurisdiction in prescribing basic principles of human rights, they 
shall not be discriminated against merely because they are gays and 
lesbians. That is the teaching of Christ and that is the principle of 
this bill.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	This amendment is a matter of fundamental justice, of protecting 
those who are discriminated against in our society, of tolerance, of 
treating all our fellow citizens with dignity and respect and of 
looking out for one another.
<P>
	Canadians have a tradition of tolerance and fairness they are 
proud of. This amendment will prove definitively that these very 
Canadian values continue to be part of our identity.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	We are discussing amendments to the human rights act. We deal 
here not with abstractions but with people, with humans. Gays and 
lesbians are not abstractions. They are very real, with very real 
entitlements to dignity and respect. They are our brothers and our 
sisters. They are our sons and our daughters, our neighbours and 
our friends. They are our colleagues.
<P>
	I urge the House to assess this bill based on what it is and not on 
what it is not. I urge the House to assess this measure on what it 
achieves and not on what some suggest and which cannot be 
maintained. When this bill is assessed on the facts, when we look at 
it for what it is, I suggest it deserves the wholehearted endorsement 
of this House of Commons.

[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Maurice Bernier (Mégantic-Compton-Stanstead, 
BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased, both in my capacity as the official 
opposition critic on human rights and the status of the disabled, and 
personally, to take part in this debate on Bill C-33, the objective of 
which is, as the minister has just reviewed for us, to amend the 
Canadian Human Rights Act, in order to add sexual orientation as a 
prohibited ground of discrimination.
<P>
	Before addressing the matter of homosexual rights, I would like 
to begin with a criticism of the government for the way it has 
handled this issue.
<P>
	Only two and a half years into its mandate, we find this 
government is wearing out, in fact I would call it a government on 
its last legs. It is obvious in several areas. On the constitutional 
level, the ``principal homeland'', its latest invention for 
recognizing Quebec and its specific character within Canadian 
federation did not last long. We have also seen this on the economic 
level, with all the humming and hawing around the GST. We have 
seen it as well, and still do, in connection with national defence and 
unemployment insurance. Now we see the same wishy washy 
approach to human rights.
<P>
	Why am I blaming the government? Because we really have the 
impression that this bill has created enormous tensions within the 
Liberal caucus. This is the reason the government has waited so 
long before settling this question, which has dragged on for so 
many decades.
<P>
	I am, of course, pleased that this bill has got to the House, 
although, as the Minister of Justice has already told us, we have 
had to wait more than 20 years since the Canadian Human Rights 
Act was first adopted to add sexual orientation to the prohibited 
grounds.
<P>
	For more than 20 years now, as the Minister of Justice has also 
pointed out, the Liberal Party has made it one of its platform 
policies, but when they formed the government no political 
decision was made to support that policy, nor to give it concrete 
form.
<P>
	The human rights commissioner has intervened regularly since 
1979, and in report after report in recent years has reminded the 
government of its irresponsibility concerning human rights as they 
apply to homosexuals.
<P>
	Again in the latest report, tabled in this House a few weeks ago, 
human rights commissioner Yalden had some very harsh words for 
the government, describing its non intervention, its inaction in this 
matter, as irresponsibility.
<P>
	The official opposition has also needed to hassle the government 
on numerous occasions since the election to get it to, finally, decide 
to do something.
<P>
<B>(1045)</B>
<P>
	It took the passing of a piece of legislation similar to the one 
before us today, just a few days ago, by the Senate, the other place, 
for the justice minister to finally decide to table Bill C-33 putting 
an end to discrimination against the gay and lesbian community on 
such a ground. Also, I would have liked the justice minister to 
behave in a less partisan fashion with regard to this issue. It seems 
to me that when dealing with human rights, one should transcend 
party lines. I believe everybody should agree that, in this country, 
every one is entitled to being treated with respect and fairness.
<P>
	Last week, I asked the justice minister when he was going to 
table his bill. I would have liked him to let the official opposition 
know ahead of time instead of waiting until the last minute, as if he 
wanted to get rid of this issue in a hurry; obviously, as I said before, 
judging by the split we can feel in the Liberal caucus, this is a hot 
potato indeed.
<P>
	When talking about human rights, there cannot be any grey area. 
It is not a question of tolerance. Sure, mindsets are changing with 
time, but the arguments we hear from the opponents to this bill are 
in every way similar to those we heard just a few years ago 
regarding women.
<P>
	For centuries, women were not even recognized as having a soul. 
They had to wait until the 20th century to be allowed to vote both at 
the federal and provincial levels. Last year, in Quebec, we 
celebrated the 50th anniversary of women's enfranchisement. The 
arguments raised in those days are essentially the same we are still 
hearing today.
<P>
	I will give you as another example the history of blacks in the 
United States. For centuries, men and women had to fight just to be 
recognized as human beings with feelings, with hopes, with a 
desire to improve their status in their own community.
<P>
	I hope that during the debate we are launching into today, 
members of this House as a whole will keep in mind that we are 
talking about human beings. Last week, or maybe it was ten days 
ago, during the human rights committee proceedings, the member 
for Notre-Dame-de-Grâce asked human rights commissioner 
Yalden if the bill would allow homosexuals, gays and lesbians, to 
marry. The commissioner answered: ``As far as I am concerned, 
when you are talking about human rights, you are not talking about 
marriage''. I will come back to that point later.
<P>
	The issue at hand is human rights. Therefore, I hope everyone 
participating in the debate will keep in mind that we are talking 
about human rights. What does Bill C-33 propose? What is the 
purpose of Bill C-33? Only to recognize a reality.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2109"> 2109 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1050)</B>
<P>
	That bill proposes that sexual orientation be added to the 
Canadian Human Rights Act as a prohibited ground of 
discrimination. In fact, it will mean that, once the bill is passed, all 
entities under federal jurisdiction will no longer have the right to 
discriminate against people because of their sexual orientation in 
matters pertaining to jobs or goods and services. That applies to all 
businesses and agencies under federal jurisdiction.
<P>
	We must also ask ourselves why we insist, why we want that act 
amended. Are homosexuals protected or not by our legislation?
<P>
	Let me remind the House that the federal government has almost 
abdicated in that area, as many members have already said. In 
Quebec, sexual orientation has been included in the charter of 
rights and freedoms as a prohibited ground of discrimination since 
1977, for 26 years now.
<P>
	As I said before, in 1978, the Liberal Party of Canada included 
that in its program. In 1985, a sub-committee of the House of 
Commons recommended that this issue be addressed. In 1993, 
during the election campaign, Jean Chrétien, the Prime Minister, 
made a firm commitment, saying he would submit a bill as soon as 
possible to settle that situation. So I do hope we will proceed as 
soon as possible.
<P>
	There is another question we must ask, and the minister 
addressed it earlier: Will the bill give a special status to gays and 
lesbians? Naturally, the answer is no. It only recognizes what many 
pieces of legislation already recognize, here in the federal 
Parliament and in other jurisdictions. Even Supreme Court justices 
recognized discrimination based on sexual orientation, even though 
section 15(1) of the Canadian charter does not specifically mention 
sexual orientation.
<P>
	We must also ask ourselves, and the answer seems particularly 
hard to find within the Liberal caucus: Is the bill changing the 
concept of family? There again, clearly, the answer is no. 
Unfortunately, I would say this bill does not go far enough, at least 
as far as I am concerned, but it is clear, and the minister confirmed 
it earlier, that it does not change in any way the concept of family 
as we know it. However, we should recognize that the concept of 
family changes with time.
<P>
	Our laws refer to the traditional family, a man and a woman 
married in church or legally, but we have to recognize that for a 
number of years now several jurisdictions have recognized 
common law unions.
<P>
<B>(1055)</B>
<P>
	When the human rights commissioner appeared before the 
human rights committee, the hon. member for 
Notre-Dame-de-Grâce asked him whether adding 
non-discrimination of homosexuals in the Canadian Human Rights 
Act would automatically give gays and  lesbians special privileges. 
In other words, would that lead to recognition of gay couples? The 
commissioner said, and I mentioned it earlier, this does not change 
in any way the concept of marriage as we know it.
<P>
	However, when the time comes to implement legislation, if we 
accept non-discrimination based on sexual orientation, if we accept 
common law marriages, we will of course have to recognize one 
day or the other that two men or two women could live together, 
recognize each other as spouses and benefit from the advantages 
resulting from that.
<P>
	The point is not to change the concept of family, it is to 
recognize de facto situations, to recognize that in our world today, 
some men and some women decide to live together without 
necessarily having their union approved on a legal or religious 
level, and that is recognized in terms of the benefits that must be 
given to these individuals. As soon as we accept to ban 
discrimination against gays and lesbians, it is obvious that, sooner 
or later, a further step will have to be taken to recognize that two 
men or two women can live together, and I repeat, benefit from the 
advantages resulting from that.
<P>
	There are already precedents in this regard. Once again, Quebec 
is showing the way. The National Assembly is currently 
considering Bill 133 that aims to give gay couples the same rights 
as heterosexual couples in terms of social and economic benefits.
<P>
	If, as the justice minister mentioned in his speech, some 
provinces, in this case Quebec, take specific action to recognize 
gay couples, it is obviously because the simple fact of listing sexual 
orientation among the prohibited grounds of the discrimination in 
Quebec's Rights and Freedom Charter and in the Canadian Human 
Rights Act does not allow to automatically provide to gay couples 
benefits that are presently provided to heterosexual couples. I point 
this out to demonstrate and to insist upon the fact that we will soon 
be taking one step, but that there is still work to be done in this 
direction.
<P>
<B>(1100)</B>
<P>
	Another key argument we often hear every time the subject of 
sexual orientation is raised, every time there is talk of granting 
homosexuals the same rights as those enjoyed by all other members 
of society, is that those who are opposed are betraying their own 
insecurity toward homosexuality. They wrongly claim that 
recognizing the rights of homosexuals is tantamount to promoting 
homosexuality. Worse yet, we have heard members of this House 
link homosexuality with paedophilia. We heard members of this 
House liken homosexuality to a disease, to an immoral act.
<P>
	I find this kind of talk unacceptable, because it is not based on 
reality and only intended to discredit, to show contempt for men 
and women who are only seeking respect and recognition for their 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2110"> 2110 </A></B>
<P>
basic rights, which are  indeed recognized by the Catholic Church, 
as the Minister of Justice pointed out in his speech.
<P>
	In the few minutes I have left I would like to refer to the Bloc 
Quebecois' position. As he was leaving the House of Commons 
yesterday, the leader of the Bloc Quebecois indicated that his party 
would support Bill C-33. We in the official opposition would like 
the Prime Minister to see to it that his party, the Liberal Party, 
adopts a similar position.
<P>
	It is important to send our fellow citizens a clear message that 
intolerance in any way, shape or form cannot tolerated, that 
discriminating against, discrediting or bringing shame on 
honourable men and women is unacceptable.
<P>
	This Parliament is making an important gesture today, even with 
the limited impact of this bill.
<P>
	I want to remind the Prime Minister that he has made formal 
commitments in this regard. During the 1993 election campaign, 
the Prime Minister promised to ensure that gays and lesbians are 
granted the same rights as those enjoyed by all other Canadians. 
This promise was reiterated in a letter sent to EGALE by the Prime 
Minister's senior adviser on October 18, 1994.
<P>
	This adviser, Mr. Goldesberg, wrote this on behalf of the Prime 
Minister, and I quote:
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	``As this initiative is a matter of longstanding party policy and 
fundamental human rights, the bill will not be the subject of a free 
vote''.
<P>
<B>(1105)</B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	I insist in the name of human dignity, fundamental justice, equity 
and tolerance that all members of this House give their support to 
this bill. By amending its human rights legislation, Canada will not 
set a precedent at the international level, or even at the national 
level. As I mentioned earlier, Quebec has had its pioneering 
legislation since 1977, that is the Charter of Human Rights and 
Freedoms, in which sexual orientation is included as a prohibited 
ground of discrimination.
<P>
	Similar legislation was also passed in seven other provinces, the 
exceptions being Alberta and Prince Edward Island. Countries such 
as Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Holland also passed such 
legislation to give gays and lesbians rights similar to those of the 
rest of the population.
<P>
	I will conclude by emphasizing the exceptional work done by the 
hon. member for Hochelaga-Maisonneuve regarding this issue. 
Members will remember that, when he was the critic for human 
rights issues, our colleague rose on many occasions to remind the 
government of the importance of taking action regarding this issue.
<P>
	You will also remember the private bill tabled in this House to 
recognize the rights of same sex couples. Today, we should 
unanimously resolve this issue once and for all. As Stéphane 
Baillargeon from <I>Le Devoir</I> pointed out: ``Nowadays, homosexuals 
want to be fully recognized, just like ordinary citizens, with no 
more and no less rights than left handed people or members of 
other minority groups''.
<P>
	It is in this spirit that the official opposition will support Bill 
C-33.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Sharon Hayes (Port Moody-Coquitlam, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am pleased to speak on Bill C-33 today. This bill was 
tabled in the House yesterday and second reading debate is today. It 
is a bill to add sexual orientation as a prohibitive ground of 
discrimination under the Canadian Human Rights Act. Just 
yesterday the minister stated that he wants to deal with this bill 
quickly.
<P>
	I have two main concerns about this bill and I want to address 
those today. The first is that the bill truly address equality and the 
equality issue in Canadian society. Perhaps we will look at some of 
the implications of equality and even at the word discrimination. 
The second concern I have is one which stems from what the 
justice minister has said. If he wants to put this bill through 
quickly, will this bill indeed express the wishes of a fully informed 
Canadian public and will the Canadian public be represented in the 
decision that is made?
<P>
	I will address the second issue first because it will be briefer in 
my comments, which is whether the wishes of a fully informed 
Canadian public will be represented. Need I remind this House that 
even recently this government has had a litany of broken promises. 
Certainly we all know of the broken promise of the GST, a promise 
made in the red book and trumpeted in a different fashion but 
certainly trumpeted and responsible for many of the members who 
are sitting on the far side of the House. That promise they made at 
the doors of Canadians has been broken.
<P>
<B>(1110)</B>
<P>
	The Deputy Prime Minister has broken her promise to resign. 
There has also been another broken promise, one made in the red 
book, the one to allow MPs greater freedom to vote. The member 
for York-South Weston was booted out because he kept his 
promise. This government is not great at keeping its promises.
<P>
	It is interesting to note there was no promise in the red book to 
bring this particular legislation into the House. There was no 
mention in the recent throne speech to enshrine sexual orientation 
in the Canadian Human Rights Act. However, the government now 
chooses not to follow through on the promises that were made to 
Canadians, but promises that have been made over a number of 
years to a very powerful special interest lobby.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2111"> 2111 </A></B>
<P>
	There was however a very important promise which I mentioned 
in connection with more free votes for members of parliament. 
Key to all discussions in this place is that this vote go forward 
with a free vote for members of the government side. Reformers 
believe that the main purpose of members standing in the House 
is to represent the wishes of their constituents. Canadians believe 
that they send representatives to Ottawa to represent their wishes. 
That must be a priority in this place and it must be a priority of 
this bill.
<P>
	It would seem however that the Liberal government will once 
again enforce party line. Worse still, because the minister wants 
this through so quickly, again the government will probably force 
closure on this bill. Both of those things are an insult, not only to 
the issue but to the Canadian public which the bill will greatly 
affect.
<P>
	To comment on our situation in the country right now, social 
institutions are failing us through government overspending. 
Through government decisions and government policies, 
institutions are failing the very Canadians who depend on them. At 
this time fundamental institutions are being redefined.
<P>
	Today's debate concerns a bill of three pages and basically looks 
at two words which would be added in a few situations. However, 
this particular bill is another step in a long journey of social 
reconstruction which is not working. We see it on our streets and 
we see it in our homes.
<P>
	The implications of this bill will reflect on the integrity of the 
government in that what it is saying and putting forward as the 
reason for the bill is not the full impact of the bill. In their 
comments the Liberals simply say it is human rights and it will 
only do such and such. I put it to the House that there is much more 
involved and I will expand on that.
<P>
	The Reform Party has taken several positions which would run 
contrary to the essence of the bill. I will review them to begin.
<P>
	First, I would like to read the Reform blue book policy on the 
family: ``The Reform Party supports limiting the definition of a 
legal marriage to the union of a woman and a man, for the purpose 
of the provision of spousal benefits for any program funded or 
administered by the federal government''.
<P>
<B>(1115 )</B>
<P>
	Also, as a caucus we have put forward a position that will go to 
our assembly in June for ratification. It reads:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The Reform caucus affirms the equality of every individual before and under 
the law and the right of every individual to live freely within the limits of the law 
and with the full protection of the law.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Under the charter of rights and freedoms, homosexuals have the 
same rights and privileges as all other persons in Canada. The 
Reform caucus supports the continued  protection of these rights, 
based on the position of each human being, not on his or her sexual 
orientation.
<P>
	For these reasons the caucus opposes as unnecessary and 
inadvisable the government's announced intention to include 
sexual orientation as a prohibited ground of discrimination in the 
Canadian Human Rights Act and in other legislation.
<P>
	I would like to repeat some of the key notions of our position. 
We affirm that all Canadians, including homosexuals, are entitled 
to life, liberty, security of person and freedom from discrimination 
regardless of personal characteristics and that these entitlements 
should be strictly enforced. We affirm that these entitlements 
should be based on personhood, not on sexual orientation or on any 
other personal characteristics.
<P>
	We oppose the tendency of the courts and of Parliament to create 
or recognize different categories of persons for the purposes of 
defining or augmenting their rights under the charter or the 
Canadian Human Rights Act. We oppose the practice of granting 
undefined or unlimited rights under the charter or the Canadian 
Human Rights Act. We oppose the government's announced 
intention to specifically include sexual orientation as a prohibited 
ground of discrimination in the Canadian Human Rights Act as 
unnecessary and inadvisable.
<P>
	There has definitely been a history of a push to have this 
enshrined in legislation. However, I would like to go back to April 
17, 1982 when the charter of rights and freedoms enshrined the 
recognized rights and freedoms as fundamental to the principles of 
liberty and human worth by putting them beyond the reach of 
Parliament and provincial legislatures in a document which is part 
of the Constitution.
<P>
	By its mandate, the supreme law of Canada, every law must 
conform. Otherwise it will likely be struck down by the courts as 
having no force or effect.
<P>
	One of the guaranteed rights is the right to equality which is 
enshrined in section 15 of the charter of rights and freedoms. 
Subsection 15(1) reads:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Every individual is equal before and under the law and has the right to the 
equal protection and equal benefit of the law without discrimination and, in 
particular, without discrimination based on race, national or ethnic origin, 
colour, religion, sex, age, or mental or physical disability.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	That particular section could have stopped after the words, ``and 
equal benefit of the law without discrimination'', in that it reads 
that every individual is equal before and under the law and has the 
right to the equal protection and equal benefit of the law without 
discrimination. Surely that covers Canadians as equal participants 
in a society of equals.
<P>
	The list that follows is an open list, granted, but it categorizes 
individuals which then, in turn, puts those  with special rights or 
privileges above those who may not be on the list. Perhaps that is 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2112"> 2112 </A></B>
<P>
why there has been a concerted effort to add to the list. I ask where 
the additions will stop.
<P>
	In 1986 a parliamentary committee had as its mandate the 
bringing of federal laws into conformity with the charter. It is 
interesting because that committee went far beyond its mandate. It 
suggested including sexual orientation in the charter at that time 
which was far beyond its mandate and completely out of place. 
Lately I have heard that it was a compromise solution to a 
suggestion that it recommend inclusion of sexual orientation in the 
Canadian Human Rights Act, again because of persistent demands 
of committee members with a very definite agenda in mind.
<P>
<B>(1120)</B>
<P>
	Recall that in December 1992, when justice minister Kim 
Campbell introduced Bill C-108, an act to amend the Canadian 
Human Rights Act, one amendment in the bill added sexual 
orientation as a prohibited ground for discrimination. 
Simultaneously, Bill S-15 was introduced in the Senate by Senator 
Kinsella who has recently introduced Bill S-2 which has just passed 
the Senate again. Both bills were interrupted by the dissolution of 
Parliament.
<P>
	Key to all of this has been a concerted and ongoing effort with no 
record of demand by the Canadian people. There have certainly 
been efforts by individuals through the years to put this initiative 
forward.
<P>
	I would like to spend some time looking at what is meant by 
discrimination. It is part of the protection for every Canadian 
according to the charter of rights. The list in the charter of rights is 
an enumeration of certain classes of people who are discrete and 
insular minorities with distinct and immutable status. They have 
been given a protected class status and special legal standing. As 
we have seen with our laws that legal standing includes 
consideration in affirmative action programs. When we look at lists 
we look at special standing, at inclusion in our laws and special 
recognition within those laws.
<P>
	Do homosexuals as a group, which is addressed by the definition 
of sexual orientation, whose members are linked solely by a shared 
sexual behaviour, warrant a protected class status such as that 
which is implied by the word discrimination? Historically there 
have been three touchstones in awarding protected class status to a 
group of individuals.
<P>
	The first touchstone is that the entire class has suffered some 
history of social oppression evidenced by a lack of ability to obtain 
economic success, adequate education or cultural opportunity. The 
second category is that the entire class would exhibit immutable 
characteristics like race, colour, sex, that define them as a discrete 
group. The third touchstone is that the entire class exhibits political 
powerlessness. These are the definitive  characteristics of classes 
which would be protected specifically within our discrimination 
list.
<P>
	Not all minorities are eligible for protected class status under 
discrimination. For instance, top corporate executives could be 
seen as a class of Canadian citizens but they would obviously not 
fall within these three categories. This group would not be eligible 
for protection against discrimination. Another group who could be 
identified are the 295 members within this House. Obviously we do 
not qualify under these guidelines.
<P>
<B>(1125)</B>
<P>
	If as MPs we organized ourselves or if top corporate executives 
organized themselves to lobby for special recognition they would 
represent a special interest group, not a true minority.
<P>
	Looking at the first criteria, are gays economically, 
educationally or culturally disadvantaged? Under that criteria 
would they be included as a group who should be specifically 
protected from discrimination?
<P>
	There have been recent studies done by homosexuals which 
indicate that they are enormously advantaged in our society. On 
July 18, 1991 the <I>Wall Street Journal</I> carried an article called 
``Overcoming a deep-rooted reluctance, more firms advertise to 
gay community''. That article reported findings by the Simmons 
Market Research Bureau and the U.S. census bureau.
<P>
	Some conclusions of that report are that gays have an average 
household income in the United States, but it would be reflected 
within Canada, of $55,430 contrasting the general population 
income of $32,144. More than three times as many gays as average 
Americans achieved graduation from college, 59 per cent versus 18 
per cent.
<P>
	More than three times as many gays as average Americans hold 
managerial or professional positions, 49 per cent versus 15.9 per 
cent. And 65.8 per cent of gays were overseas travellers, more than 
four times the percentage of average Americans and 13 times as 
many gays as average Americans, that is 26.5 per cent versus 1.9 
per cent, were frequent flyers. Certainly these statistics do not 
represent a community that is economically deprived.
<P>
	Another contention put forward is that there is a preponderance 
of violence against this group in our society. I will admit there is a 
rampant increase of random violence in our country but that is seen 
everywhere. We have been shocked with what is happening on our 
streets and the feeling of unrest and insecurity of the members of 
our community. We can lay that at the feet of a faulty criminal 
justice system, a criminal justice system that demands no 
accountability.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2113"> 2113 </A></B>
<P>
	The present Young Offenders Act is designed so that there is 
nothing to stop establishing behaviour patterns within youth. 
Criminality pays no price. All Canadians need protection and the 
security of their person.
<P>
	For instance, a local gang in our area, a small minority, attacked 
anyone in a local mall who was wearing the colour purple. During 
the year or so that this was going on I heard of no individual attacks 
on the homosexual community. I have not seen any evidence of any 
greater proportion of violence against homosexuals as violence 
against other Canadians.
<P>
	Again we concur that homosexuals, just as every Canadian, 
demand protection and should be protected under Canadian law but 
special protection is not indicated.
<P>
<B>(1130 )</B>
<P>
	It is interesting and actually strange that this government should 
bring forward this legislation at this time. Why this particular 
group when there is no indication it needs special protection 
beyond any other Canadian when there is a group of Canadians, the 
minority English in Quebec, and what they are facing and how they 
are being ignored by the government.
<P>
	The minority English in Quebec are facing inferior education. 
And what other group would see tens of thousands of their ballots 
rejected at a democratic election and not have an outcry from the 
federal government that is supposed to represent them? In Quebec 
this group is excluded from government positions. Yet this 
government says nothing about this group, which is obviously 
facing discrimination within the context of its community. Instead, 
this government introduced Bill C-33.
<P>
	The second criteria was that specially protected classes should 
exhibit obvious immutable or distinguishing characteristics like 
race, colour, gender, national origin, which define them as a 
discrete group.
<P>
	There have been many studies. A study of twins has been 
discredited. Researchers Bailey and Pillard were discredited 
because twins from this study were from the same household. 
There was a lack of scientific credibility with that result.
<P>
	A study by Simon LeVay looked at the brains of 19 homosexual 
male corpses and tried to determine whether there was a 
distinction, an immutable characteristic. This study was discredited 
because of misclassifications, incomplete data or irregularities.
<P>
	Author and American University associate professor Jerry 
Muller talks of sexual politics on America's college and university 
campuses:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>In political arguments toward the non-homosexual public, the homosexual 
movement has tended toward a deterministic portrait of homosexuality as 
grounded in irrevocable biological or social-psychological circumstance. Yet 
among homosexual  theorists in the academy, the propensity is toward the defence 
of homosexuality as a voluntarily affirmed ``self-fashioning''.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The confluence of feminism and homosexual ideology has now led to a new 
stage, in which the politics of stable but multicultural and multisexual identities 
is being challenged by those who regard all permanent and fixed identity as a 
coercive restriction of autonomy, which is thought to include self-definition 
and redefinition.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	It seems there is a fluidity in the definition of sexuality within 
the homosexual community which indicates that even their own 
concept of the immutable characteristics or the constancy or even 
the identity of sexual orientation would be very difficult to pin 
down. The second criteria that they should exhibit immutable or 
distinguishing characteristics is nullified by the very notion that 
there is no identification within that category.
<P>
	The third criteria is that specifically protected classes should 
clearly demonstrate political powerlessness.
<P>
	As I have traced in the last number of years, there has been a 
steady progress in parliamentary decisions very lately, but if not 
within legislation certainly within the courts there has been a 
steady progress of sexual orientation within legal decisions and 
within the bureaucratic documents of government.
<P>
<B>(1135 )</B>
<P>
	An interesting contrast was a private member's bill last 
September that thoroughly rejected the recognition of same sex 
spouses. It was a free vote and the count was 124 to 55, a rejection 
of the recognition of same sex spouses. The government, despite 
that decision, two months earlier through the Treasury Board had a 
directive which extended leave related benefits to partners of same 
sex civil servants. That was in direct opposition to what was 
decided here and I believe in opposition to what the public would 
say.
<P>
	Does the homosexual community have political clout? Certainly 
as I have sat in the health subcommittee on AIDS I have seen that 
this is the case. In a subcommittee report we reviewed funding for 
diseases within our society and within the AIDS strategy.
<P>
	The results of health funding for different diseases read like this: 
In 1994-95 $43.5 million was allocated by government to AIDS 
funding. Breast cancer funding for 1994-95 was $4 million, 
one-tenth the amount. Funding by Health Canada for 
cardiovascular disease was $3.8 million. It is interesting to note 
that the total incidence of HIV in Canada at the end of December 
1994 was 10,000 cases with 7,471 deaths. Compare that with 
17,000 cases of breast cancer diagnosed in 1995 alone with 5,400 
deaths. Decisions like this, decisions that come to the bottom line 
of government spending speak to me not of political powerlessness 
but of extreme political activity and effect.
<P>
	Do homosexuals only want protection from discrimination, or 
with protection from discrimination  could they also want 
protection from public scrutiny, from public criticism and perhaps 
from public accountability? I know the numbers I have just quoted 
have 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2114"> 2114 </A></B>
<P>
enraged Canadians from coast to coast. They question, they ask and 
they are very concerned that their health care dollars do not relate 
to the severity of the diseases in our communities.
<P>
	Myself I ask why this kind of spending was not questioned 
before this time. Is it that perhaps AIDS is a politically correct 
disease that falls outside the scrutiny of the Canadian public? I 
question too whether the very question that I have asked would be 
allowed in the future as we continue on this process concerning 
discrimination.
<P>
	To give an illustration of that, recently a pamphlet from the 
Canadian AIDS Society came into my possession. Part of the AIDS 
funding is going to an AIDS awareness campaign and an 
anti-homophobia campaign. This may be part of that very 
campaign. This pamphlet is on homophobia. It says homophobia is 
another kind of prejudice. Prejudice is a word that occurred in Bill 
C-41 alongside hatred, alongside this whole business and this 
whole notion of discrimination. In this very document which I 
presume is funded partly by government it states: ``We all take part 
in homophobia when we''-and there are a number of things on the 
list. The fourth one on the list is ``when we deny basic rights like 
spousal benefits to lesbian and gay couples''.
<P>
	Is this what the government says is simply allowing two words to 
be protected from discrimination or is this a larger package: 
discrimination today, homophobia tomorrow, within the context of 
what can be said and what can be addressed. What we are seeing 
today threatens to impact more individuals in more life aspects 
than any single political move of this day.
<P>
<B>(1140 )</B>
<P>
	Under homosexual advantage legislation whose rights would 
stand: a parent who resisted a homosexual's influence on their 
children within their school or within their community; school 
teachers or administrators, public or private, who are forced to 
persuade children that homosexuality is normal and attractive even 
though they do not personally agree; employers, business owners 
or the military that would be under coercion to recruit and promote 
homosexuals within some type of affirmative action program; 
employees who would be forced to value homosexual behaviour or 
they might lose their jobs; health care workers or victims who 
remain vulnerable because of privacy rights of the very serious but 
very deadly disease of AIDS; landlords who would be forced to 
rent to homosexuals when they or other tenants within their 
building may conscientiously disagree with this behaviour; or 
churches or parent church ministries that are faced with the 
contradiction to their firmly held doctrine and belief in hiring or 
perhaps even speaking of this behaviour?
<P>
	I have heard the justice minister say that he values the beliefs of 
all Canadians. However, I ask how that value would be translated 
when a special interest group's agenda overrides the values of 
Canadians.
<P>
	I have mentioned briefly Bill C-64, the affirmative action 
program in Canada, which we call employment equity. That too has 
a list within it which has been derived from the disadvantaged 
groups which are enumerated within the charter and the human 
rights act. That particular notion of giving special rights or special 
entry into employment has been rejected by Canadians.
<P>
	It is interesting that the government census contains questions 
about sexual orientation that will be, I presume, used to determine 
numerical goals and quotas including that particular category in the 
future.
<P>
	I was part of the human rights committee when it looked at Bill 
C-64. It was very apparent in the testimony of witnesses who came 
before us that it was the strategic success of the most powerful 
groups claiming historical disadvantage that won out, certainly the 
truly disadvantaged. Very often they were the aboriginal peoples or 
the disabled. The advantage of the other groups which were more 
politically powerful came at the expense of those truly 
disadvantaged groups. Employment equity does not work. 
Employment equity will not work and we certainly do not need 
another category added to it.
<P>
	Much attention has been given to the preamble of the bill in the 
media which states: ``Whereas the government recognizes and 
affirms the importance of the family as the foundation of the 
Canadian society''. As we have seen in this list, the family may be 
asked to give up its personal choices and values in light of the label 
of discrimination against it. Rightly so, the question has been asked 
of the government as to why it put this in. In my estimation the 
government is bent on remaking and redefining the family unit. 
Here again we have another example of that.
<P>
	We have a government that works against the family in its 
taxation and spending priorities. In the last 20 some years this 
government, and certainly we have to lay it at the Liberals' feet, 
has put a debt on our families which our children and perhaps our 
grandchildren will not be able to overcome or see the end of. It will 
affect their ability to get jobs and make a living.
<P>
<B>(1145)</B>
<P>
	The level of taxation has made it so that 46 per cent of a family's 
income goes to taxes. That level creates two wage earners not by 
choice, but by force.
<P>
	The government has created social programs that are clearly 
unsustainable. Choices have to be made. We have received empty 
promises from a government that has proven it is untrustworthy in 
providing security for our families.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2115"> 2115 </A></B>
<P>
	The criminal justice system ignores the security of law-abiding 
citizens, releases criminals when they are known risks to our 
streets. The Young Offenders' Act is a joke to our youth and a 
curse to parents and communities. Yet the government says it 
stands for families. No wonder the media is surprised to see that 
in this bill.
<P>
	The latest move, the inclusion of sexual orientation as a 
prohibited ground within the human rights act, is again part of a 
homosexual agenda to see their lifestyle affirmed and recognized in 
law.
<P>
	Jeffrey Levi, a former executive director of the national gay and 
lesbian task force made a statement that relates to family and to the 
agenda of this group:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>But our agenda is becoming broader than that; we are no longer seeking just 
the right to privacy or right to protection from wrong. We also have a right-as 
heterosexual Americans have already-to see government and society affirm 
our lives.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Now, that is a statement that will make our Liberal friends queasy. But the 
truth is, until our relationships are recognized in the law-through domestic 
partnership legislation or the definition of beneficiary, for example-until we 
are provided with the same financial incentives in tax law and in government 
programs to affirm our family relationships, then we will not have achieved 
equality in American society.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	The goal is to become included in the family definition. That is 
not what Canadian families are looking at or want.
<P>
	Canadian families are in distress. They are overtaxed, they are 
insecure and here we have a government bound on redefining the 
very family to include more, extending benefits or creating greater 
impact on the families which are now in distress.
<P>
	Our party says that if Canadian families are broken, if they are in 
distress, the solution is not to redefine the family, not to explain it 
way, but to fix the programs that have caused the problems. 
Families are too important to his society and to future generations 
that will make up the next society. Government policy should 
always be evaluated in terms of how it affects our families.
<P>
	The extension of benefits or the definition of family will affect 
more than 50 federal statutes. They will have a very real dollar cost 
at the expense of those who need protection and they will have a 
very real societal cost in weakening the understanding of 
commitment, nurturing and procreation that are the roles of the 
established husband and wife family.
<P>
	This is not a simple addition of two words to a list. This is not 
simply addressing a basic human rights issue. And no, this is not 
only a moral issue, although it has the potential for negating the 
rights of those whose personal values reject homosexuality.
<P>
	This is a special interest group hijacking the provisions in law 
that are meant for the disadvantaged of our society.
<P>
<B>(1150)</B>
<P>
	Again I say the gay and lesbian community has the same rights, 
privileges and protections under law as the rest of the population.
<P>
	The Reform Party has taken the position that it rejects the 
inclusion of sexual orientation in the Canadian Human Rights Act 
as both unnecessary and inadvisable. As a party we take that 
position. As a party we also commit to representing the expressed 
wishes of our constituents in taking that position. I stand with my 
constituents and I stand with my party. I stand, I believe, with the 
majority of Canadians who resist the inclusion of sexual 
orientation and the incumbent rights of family which go with it. I 
represent my constituents in doing so.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Harvard (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Public Works and Government Services, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
appreciate the opportunity to comment on Bill C-33.
<P>
	Everything we say, do and touch in the House of Commons is 
important, one way or another, to all Canadians. Some things are 
more important than others. This bill to ban discrimination on the 
grounds of sexual orientation is one of the more important 
measures to come before the House.
<P>
	It is important to all Canadians because it is about fairness. It is 
about tolerance. It is about equality. It is a message to all Canadians 
that discrimination will not be and is not acceptable.
<P>
	For those of us who feel it is important, I point out I am a family 
man. I come from a large family, raised on the prairies. I am one of 
12 surviving children. My mother gave birth to 14 children. I am 
number 11. I have a large family, at least in contemporary terms. I 
am the father of five children. I am the grandfather of four children.
<P>
	Family values to me are very important. I assure all Canadians 
watching today that my wife and I take our family responsibilities 
very seriously. We think values are very important and we pass 
those values which we hold dear to us on to our children. We impart 
those values. I feel very strongly that Bill C-33 represents no threat 
to me, no threat to my wife, no threat to my children.
<P>
	I understand that from time to time in the affairs of human kind 
certain ideas come along and certain changes are made. Some 
frighten people. I can understand that. Banning discrimination on 
the grounds of sexual orientation is one of the changes which 
frightens people. People say ``don't do it, for it frightens me''. We 
have heard these voices before. We have heard these voices on very 
important issues throughout history.
<P>
	Slavery was abolished in the United States over 150 years ago. 
Before that happened there was a great debate. There were 
Americans who said ``don't do it, for I am afraid''.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2116"> 2116 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1155 )</B>
<P>
	More than 30 years ago integration became a hot issue in the 
United States. People said ``don't do it, for we are afraid. Do not 
allow blacks to ride at the front of the bus''.
<P>
	In Canada in 1916 or 1917 Canadians were debating the right of 
women to vote. People said ``don't do it, for we are afraid''. The 
same thing happened in the 1960s on the issue of contraception. 
``Don't allow it, for we are afraid''. The same voices were heard on 
the issue of divorce: ``Don't permit the state to allow divorce, for 
we are afraid''.
<P>
	When we face these issues, people like me who feel a 
responsibility to push changes of this kind have a responsibility to 
allay fears. I want to allay some of the fears respecting Bill C-33. I 
refer people in the House and people watching across the land to 
the preamble of the bill.
<P>
	The preamble has two important ``whereas'':
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Whereas the Government of Canada affirms the dignity and worth of all 
individuals and recognizes that they have the right to be free from 
discrimination in employment and the provision of goods and services, and that 
right is based on respect for the rule of law and lawful conduct by all;</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>And whereas the government recognizes and affirms the importance of 
family as the foundation of Canadian society and that nothing in this act alters 
its fundamental role in society;</BLOCKQUOTE>
	It is important to point out that preamble, for it gives this act 
meaningful context. It should allay some of the fears and concerns 
of some Canadians.
<P>
	Let me put something else to rest. The bill is not about special 
rights. It is about equal rights. Right now in this land the human 
rights act states that one cannot be discriminated against on the 
grounds of age, sex, colour, religion. These are not special rights, 
because everyone enjoys them. The same can be said when the 
words sexual orientation are added to the list of prohibited grounds. 
It will not be a special right belonging to homosexuals or 
heterosexuals, because everyone will enjoy this same right, be they 
homosexual, heterosexual or bisexual.
<P>
	This amendment provides for protection against discrimination 
in the workplace and in the provision of goods and services. It 
means an individual cannot be fired on the basis of his or her sexual 
orientation. The law also prohibits an employer from doing this on 
the basis of other grounds such as race or religion.
<P>
	It is not a special treatment but the very opposite. It is intended 
to stop employers from singling our homosexuals or blacks or a 
religious minority and instead treat them as everyone else, the 
same as everyone else. And so I say this is not a special right.
<P>
	People might ask what does the Canadian Human Rights Act do? 
The title of the statute suggests a broad range of coverage, but 
when we look at what this law  actually covers, we gain some 
perspective. It applies to employment and the provision of goods 
and services. It does not apply to other matters. It applies only to 
areas under federal jurisdiction, which is fairly narrow. The vast 
majority of employers and service providers, about 90 per cent, 
come under provincial human rights laws. Therefore the changed 
law would not be all encompassing, as some people might suggest. 
The interesting thing is that most employers and service providers 
are covered by provincial rights codes. The majority of these 
provincial laws have already been changed to add sexual 
orientation.
<P>
<B>(1200)</B>
<P>
	What about the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms and 
why is it important? It is important because the charter is part of the 
Canadian Constitution. It applies to all other laws in Canada be 
they federal, provincial or municipal. This is important because the 
Supreme Court of Canada has said that section 15, the equality 
guarantee, prohibits discrimination on the basis of sexual 
orientation. It is in the law already. It is in the charter and the 
charter applies to all federal laws.
<P>
	In this respect the Canadian Human Rights Act changes nothing. 
This is very important and worth repeating. The charter already 
prohibits discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation at the 
federal level regardless of whether this amendment comes along or 
not. It is very important to take note of this. Thus before one draws 
conclusions about the impact of this amendment, it must be 
understood that its impact already exists because of the charter.
<P>
	Another point I would make about the state of the law is that the 
courts have already ruled that sexual orientation is in the Canadian 
Human Rights Act. There has been, admittedly, a contrary decision 
about the Alberta legislation but the decisions with respect to the 
federal legislation stand. Overall the state of the law is such that it 
is hard to see this bill as anything but a catching up to what has 
already happened in most places across the country.
<P>
	How does it affect the family? How does it affect marriage? How 
does it affect adoption? The preamble to this bill which I cited 
earlier answers the question. It recognizes that the family remains 
at the foundation of our society and this amendment is not going to 
change that. The family remains strong.
<P>
	How does it affect marriage? This law has nothing to do with 
marriage. The Canadian Human Rights Act has no application here.
<P>
	How does it affect adoption? This law has nothing to do with 
adoption. Adoption is a provincial matter.
<P>
	This brings me to a fundamental point about this bill and the 
Canadian Human Rights Act. The purpose and impact of this bill is 
not as broad as some would have it. Its purpose is not to change 
people's sincerely held  beliefs. Its purpose is to prevent an 
employer from firing someone because of his or her sexual 
orientation. It is to prevent someone from being denied service by a 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2117"> 2117 </A></B>
<P>
federally regulated business simply because of his or her sexual 
orientation.
<P>
	It is important to note that the law makes this distinction. The 
law says that when the border between belief and action is crossed, 
that is when an employer or service provider acts to refuse a job or 
service simply because of a person's sexual orientation, then the 
point has been reached where the law should intervene.
<P>
	When you look at this bill more closely, Mr. Speaker, you realize 
that it does a lot less than some suggest but something still very 
important.
<P>
	Let me address some other issues that have been raised. One is 
the meaning of sexual orientation. Some have asked if this might 
include unlawful conduct. As I mentioned, sexual orientation is 
already in the charter and the majority of provincial human rights 
laws, as well as being read into the Canadian Human Rights Act.
<P>
	There have been quite a few cases and there is a well-developed 
understanding of this term. It means homosexuality and 
heterosexuality as well a bisexuality.
<P>
	The answer to the question about unlawful conduct is a clear no. 
This law does not apply to such conduct. The preamble to the bill 
confirms this. There is no doubt about it. I remind the House of this 
and it is very important: pedophilia is not a sexual orientation. It is 
a crime. It is a crime regardless of whether the offender is 
heterosexual or homosexual. It is important to put those facts on 
the table. It is very important to understand that.
<P>
<B>(1205)</B>
<P>
	I have heard it suggested that it would be better to drop the list of 
grounds from the Canadian Human Rights Act altogether rather 
than adding the two words sexual orientation. I am not really 
certain if I understand this point. If the list of grounds is dropped, 
with what would it be replaced?
<P>
	How do we protect against discrimination on the basis of race, 
religion, sex and sexual orientation? How would we know what 
forms of discrimination are prohibited and which forms are not? I 
do not understand what this would accomplish. Either we protect 
against discrimination on the basis of race, religion, sex, sexual 
orientation and other listed grounds or we do not.
<P>
	In my view it is misleading and disingenuous to suggest 
dropping the list. Ultimately this suggestion is quite meaningless. 
It is designed to stir up trouble and it is intended to avoid the issue.
<P>
	Ultimately if we are to protect against discrimination on the 
basis of sexual orientation, the proposed amendment to the 
Canadian Human Rights Act is the way to do it. There is really no 
other way.
<P>
	Having reflected on this, and having carefully considered the 
purpose and the effect of the bill, what else can be said about this 
amendment? It is a rather modest bill, despite the kind of attention 
it is getting. It allows the federal government essentially to catch 
up, to the courts, to the provinces and to catch up to the law. When 
this is looked at issue by issue, point by point, the impact of this 
amendment has been greatly exaggerated by some. This 
amendment is about human rights, a simple matter of fairness and 
tolerance.
<P>
	A majority of Canadians support this amendment and they have 
for years. For most people this is not a controversial issue. This is 
because Canadians understand that this comes down to a basic 
question: ``Do you think it is right to discriminate against gays or 
lesbians, to fire them from their jobs, or refuse them a service 
simply because of their sexual orientation?'' The majority of 
Canadians know that it is not. This flows from basic Canadian 
values, important values, values that we all hold very sincerely.
<P>
	I have talked about catching up. Most of the provinces with the 
vast majority of the population have voted to add this protection to 
their human rights acts. This is not something new. It has been the 
Liberal Party's policy for a good many years. I think it goes back to 
1978. The fact that the Liberal Party has supported this amendment 
has been known to people for a long time.
<P>
	After so many years, after being elected to govern this country it 
is really time to act. Enough time has passed and now is the time to 
follow through. I sincerely ask all members to consider this bill, to 
examine it, and in the final analysis I think they will find that it is 
very worthy of their support.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ghislain Lebel (Chambly, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I would 
like to tell the hon. member who just spoke on this bill and claimed 
he looked at it inside and out that on the whole I subscribe to his 
line of questioning. I think that discrimination, whatever its nature 
and whatever its basis, is something harmful to our society. 
Regardless of the ground, be it sexual orientation, colour of skin or 
political ideas, discrimination is unjustifiable.
<P>
<B>(1210)</B>
<P>
	There are two kinds of discrimination, however, and I wonder if 
the bill introduced by the Minister of Justice, contrary to what he 
claims himself, does not extend any additional right to the gay 
community; I would like to believe that, and I hope it does not. But 
I do have problems reconciling the French version and the English 
version of the bill.
<P>
	The hon. member who just spoke is an anglophone from Ontario, 
I believe, whom I respect very much, but I doubt he had the 
opportunity to compare the French version and the English version. 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2118"> 2118 </A></B>
<P>
I can understand that,  like myself, he reads and obtains 
information in his mother tongue.
<P>
	I am trying to compare both versions to see if there might be a 
drafting error that could be corrected right away. Let us look at 
section 3 in the English version.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	``For all purposes of this act, the prohibited grounds of 
discrimination''.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The English version says: ``prohibited grounds of 
discrimination.''
<P>
	The French version reads: ``Pour l'application de la présente 
loi'', which is the exact translation of the first phrase in the English 
clause, and the words ``motifs de distinction illicite'' are used. As 
if the word ``illicite'' were the correct translation of ``prohibited''. I 
really have to examine this, and members of Parliament who do not 
are perhaps demonstrating real carelessness.
<P>
	The word ``illicite'' has to be seen in its context. Our rules of 
construction say that statutes are to be administered and interpreted 
according to their content and their wording. But they can also be 
interpreted a contrario, which means by reading between the lines.
<P>
	If I state that illicit discrimination on the basis of sexual 
orientation is prohibited, can I also suggest a contrario that a form 
of legal discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation is allowed 
ipso facto? Would I not be opening the door to the setting of quotas, 
which were so crucial an issue in the last election campaign in 
Ontario? We have seen the results of these quotas in Ontario. Those 
who know best about this are the Ontario Liberals; they lost the 
election because of quotas.
<P>
	Discrimination is completely immoral. If a federal statute says 
so, I am in full agreement. But if its wording opens the door to the 
opposite interpretation, I have to give a warning.
<P>
	It is acknowledged that homosexuals represent about 10 per cent 
in our population. Therefore, homosexuals have the right to claim 
the same proportion of jobs in the public service, in police forces, 
and so on. They have the right to exist, and that right should be 
acknowledged. If I were to interpret this clause a contrario, it 
would be like saying: ``There are 4,000 male police officers in the 
Greater Montreal Area. To properly represent the gay and lesbian 
community in the Montreal region, we would need 400 officers 
from the gay and lesbian minority, which would mean that the 
hiring policy would have to be changed to ensure that the next 400 
officers to be hired are gay or lesbian''.
<P>
<B>(1215)</B>
<P>
	The thing is that, in these kinds of jobs, sexual orientation does 
not really have anything to do with the duties to be carried out. We 
should be able, for example,  to hire 400 police officers without 
asking them about their sexual orientation.
<P>
	Would sexual orientation not take precedence over skills? It has 
happened in other fields. This is not something that has come out of 
the blue. I met with a cadet, a police recruit, who had attended the 
Institut de police de Nicolet and had been designated the best cadet 
of his class. He had earned his diploma and some awards from the 
lieutenant governor. Despite all his achievements, he could not find 
a job, although everybody recognized that he was the best in his 
field. There is a positive discrimination system, as it is called, and I 
am afraid this poor guy will have to wait a long time before joining 
a police force. That is my only concern.
<P>
	As regards discrimination based on sexual orientation, I agree 
100 per cent with the minister and with his concerns and those of 
my Bloc colleagues. However, as a jurist, I have spent a good deal 
of my life interpreting legal material. I can now see the conflict that 
could come out of the interpretation or the wording of the French 
and English versions. I listened to my Liberal and Reform 
colleagues, who speak English version. But when you compare 
both clauses, you realize that they do not mean exactly the same 
thing.
<P>
	I would like to ask the hon. member if he has thought about the 
consequences such a discrepancy or an inconsistency in the English 
and French versions could have.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Harvard:</B> Madam Speaker, for the information of the hon. 
member, I am not from the province of Ontario. I am from the 
province of Manitoba.
<P>
	The hon. member raises a couple of questions. One is a more 
technical question. He really wonders whether there is a 
discrepancy or a difference between the English language version 
of the bill and the French language version.
<P>
	I am not a lawyer and I am not competent to address that 
question but let me assure the member that a question of this kind is 
certainly appropriate to raise at committee. At committee there will 
be members of the government and lawyers and others who can 
answer any technical questions. I invite the member to raise that 
question before committee. He will not have to wait long for that.
<P>
	On the question of quotas, targets and affirmative action, let me 
assure the hon. member the bill has nothing to do whatsoever with 
affirmative action.
<P>
	We have to be careful when dealing with the bill not to read more 
into it than is there. We are talking two words, sexual orientation. 
Those two words are being added to the list of prohibited grounds 
of discrimination. There is nothing more to this, nothing less. It 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2119"> 2119 </A></B>
<P>
simply  means Canadians, after the bill becomes law, will not be 
able to discriminate on the grounds of sexual orientation. I assure 
the hon. member it has nothing to do whatsoever with affirmative 
action.
<P>
	While the hon. member has some questions, I realize, recognize 
and appreciate that he and his party support the bill. That is very 
important. The bill is about equality and tolerance. We appreciate 
their support very much.
<P>
<B>(1220)</B>

[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Réal Ménard (Hochelaga-Maisonneuve, BQ):</B> Madam 
Speaker, you will not be surprised to hear that I stand today to 
express my firm support for this bill. I do it with great pleasure, 
since I know that in this House there are times for being partisan 
and times for not being partisan. If you ask me what is the main 
reason for my involvement in politics, I would tell you that 
sovereignty was the first reason, of course, closely followed by my 
determination to promote equality among individuals. I think that 
each time Parliament discusses the promotion of equality among 
individuals, there should be no partisanship involved.
<P>
	I listened to what my colleagues from the Reform Party had to 
say, but not only does it not conform to reality, it is in my opinion 
riddled with inconsistencies and nonsense to the point that it 
borders on the unacceptable. But this is not what I want to discuss 
today.
<P>
	I know that my chances are very slim indeed, with a few notable 
exceptions-and I will always respect them for the great 
parliamentarians they are-of convinving Reformers, as I am fully 
aware that the Reform Party is to human rights what silent movies 
are to the motion picture industry. These are people who, oddly 
enough, take pride in looking back and confusing genres and styles 
with disconcerting aptness and eloquence.
<P>
	This being said, what are we talking about today? Today, we are 
asked to examine the Canadian Human Rights Act. We have to 
remember-since this is a common mistake, including among the 
media-that we are not talking about the Charter. The Canadian 
Human Rights Act has no constitutional value and is not included 
in the 1982 Constitutional Act. It is one of two instruments to 
promote human rights. Thus it is an organic law, whose scope and 
status are the same as those of the other laws of this Parliament.
<P>
	The Canadian Human Rights Act applies to all those who benefit 
from federal government services and to all workers under federal 
jurisdiction. So, essentially, we are speaking of interprovincial 
transportation, banks, the public service, large crown corporations 
such as the CBC, etc.
<P>
	All we are asking members today is to accept that, as far as the 
Canadian Human Rights Act is concerned, discrimination based on
<P>
sexual orientation against people  who receive services will not be 
tolerated. That is what this bill is all about. All efforts by our 
colleagues of the Reform Party or of the ``Flintstone'' wing of the 
Liberal Party would be intellectually dishonest.
<P>
	Let them rise in the House and say that yes they believe that 
discrimination based on sexual orientation is acceptable; I am 
ready to accept that. It is not my opinion, I will not be pleased by 
that, but people have a right to be against the end of discrimination. 
But let us have the courage, as members of Parliament, to 
recognize that what we are speaking of today is the end of 
discrimination.
<P>
	I will try to explain, a little later, that this has nothing to do with 
a redefinition of the family and, especially, that it has nothing to do 
with possible recognition of same sex spouses, something I want 
with all my heart. For as long as I will be in public life, I will never 
stop asking for it, but I will be honest enough, I will be intelligent 
enough to call a spade a spade and make the distinction where it 
exists.
<P>
	Today, once more, allow me to be out of order and to look in that 
direction for 30 seconds, because what we are talking about is the 
end of discrimination based on sexual orientation. Discrimination, 
what does that word mean? It is clear in the act. Discrimination is 
treating a group of people differently or giving them different 
benefits from what they are entitled to.
<P>
	I will give you a concrete example. Of course, these last few 
years, legal progress has been made.
<P>
<B>(1225)</B>
<P>
	It is true that between 1968, when John Turner, then minister of 
Justice, decriminalized homosexuality, and 1996, we not only 
made legal progress but we also developed an intellectual maturity, 
with some 52 exceptions.
<P>
	It is this intellectual maturity that allows us today to be MPs and 
to rise in this House knowing full well there is, in Quebec, a 
majority of people who clearly showed us their support in surveys, 
and I personally think that such a majority also exists in English 
Canada.
<P>
	As a Bloc member, I must frequently go to Vancouver and 
Toronto and to Manitoba. Since I was elected, I have gone to many 
parts of English Canada to give conferences and nobody ever told 
me that: ``Yes, we must perpetuate discrimination''.
<P>
	When we address the issue intelligently and explain it with some 
consistency, we notice that people do understand that 
discrimination based on sexual orientation is unacceptable in our 
society.
<P>
	How does one live that kind of discrimination? Not long ago, and 
I am not talking about 25 years ago-and I will choose my words 
carefully because I know that things are changing more and 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2120"> 2120 </A></B>
<P>
more-known homosexuals  were not accepted without some 
coolness. The first example that comes to mind is that of thearmed forces.
<P>
	Does this mean that the senior command of the armed forces 
systematically practice discrimination? Of course not. That is not 
what it means. But we know very well that, by adding sexual 
orientation to the list of prohibited grounds of discrimination 
included in the Canadian Human Rights Act, we are giving judicial 
protection to a category of individuals who, one might say, is very 
likely to experience discrimination.
<P>
	Not long ago, in fact, two years ago, a officer in the Canadian 
forces, a sergeant I believe, was fired because her colleagues 
discovered that she was a lesbian. At that time, the Canadian 
Human Rights Act did not offer the protection we are about to 
include in it. That woman had to take her case to a civil court, but, 
in the end, there was an out of court settlement. Today, we are 
sending a clear message as to the way we want the laws interpreted.
<P>
	Why do we have to take such action? We have to do it, and I 
think the Minister of Justice spoke eloquently about that, because 
we are parliamentarians. Being parliamentarians means that we 
have a public voice, of course, but it also means that we pass laws.
<P>
	If we, as parliamentarians, do not have the courage to say that we 
want the words ``sexual orientation'' to be included explicitly in 
the Canadian Human Rights Act, how can we expect the judiciary 
to have the courage to interpret these words and how can we expect 
Canadians not to suffer from discrimination when we, as 
parliamentarians, do not have the courage to fulfil our 
responsibility to define in legislation the kind of society we want to 
live in?
<P>
	I think that if we do not understand or subscribe to this basic 
principle, I would even go so far as to say that we do not deserve to 
have a public voice and that we certainly do not deserve to sit in 
Parliament. It has been mentioned, and I think it must be part of our 
understanding, that the Canadian Human Rights Commission, 
which is not a political body, a partisan body, has been saying since 
1979-and that is a very long time in political terms-that the 
Canadian government must have the courage of its rhetoric.
<P>
	I say that because, at the rhetorical level, there have been many 
occasions when parliamentarians rose in this House to say that 
discrimination is indeed unacceptable, that the situation must be 
rectified. However, in reality, it is today that things are happening, 
that we are getting serious about this issue and that we have to 
begin to take concrete measures to rectify the situation.
<P>
<B>(1230)</B>
<P>
	I would just like to read a short extract from an exchange 
between Human Rights Commissioner Max Yalden and a senator 
from the other House: ``We are doubly pleased to see that Senator 
Kinsella has introduced a private member's bill that will add sexual  
orientation to the prohibited grounds of discrimination. Parliament 
has a responsibility-and that is the key point he makes-to 
legislate in this kind of important matter. Canadians should be able 
to find out what is in their legislation without having to read reports 
or interpretations of the courts. If Parliament does not amend the 
Canadian Human Rights Act, it would, in our view, amount to an 
abdication-this could not be clearer, I think-of its 
responsibilities''.
<P>
	This, then, is exactly what the Minister of Justice is calling on us 
to do. Naturally, one may ask oneself questions, and you will 
understand that I have asked myself some, on what it is that makes 
some people homosexual. There are many theories. There are those 
who say you are born that way, that it is in the genes, that you come 
into this world homosexual, and that some people take longer to 
come to the realization, but if you are profoundly homosexual, 
sooner or later you are condemned to act on it. That is one view.
<P>
	There are others who say that, no, homosexuality is not innate, 
that it is a social thing and that one context will predispose us to 
homosexuality and another to heterosexuality.
<P>
	All this is terribly theoretical. But I think that what is important 
in society is that whether one is homosexual or heterosexual, 
whether one is polygamous or abstinent, whether one leads the life 
of a monk or is a little more hotblooded, what is important is that 
whatever one's choice, one can make it with respect for oneself and 
for others. And if there is to be this respect for others, some 
legislative conditions must be put in place.
<P>
	And the most important of all is that we come to have a 
normative view of homosexuality. That does not mean that any of 
us is obliged to promote homosexuality. Someone said-I do not 
know if it is the hon. member for Chambly or my colleague from 
the government majority-that homosexuals make up about 10 per 
cent of every society. This figure was arrived at in the 1952 Kinsey 
report, the most comprehensive study on the sexual behaviour of 
Canadians ever made, a first. The study revealed that 10 per cent of 
people openly said they were homosexual.
<P>
	Again, the important thing is that we, as parliamentarians, work 
to establish conditions of optimum tolerance. Whether you live in 
Calgary, Winnipeg, Vancouver or Montreal, the important thing is 
to know you will not be discriminated against if you are 13, 14 or 
60-years old and you are homosexual. Homosexuals must know 
they are entitled to the same services whatever the circumstance. 
More importantly, homosexuals must have the assurance that in 
their professional life they will not be subject to discrimination or 
reprisal because they belong to a sexual minority.
<P>
	Again, this is why we have to pass this act. The Canadian Human 
Rights Act is a concern for many people. The complaint procedure 
under the act starts with an investigation, followed by the
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2121"> 2121 </A></B>
<P>
establishment of a tribunal and if someone is unhappy withthe tribunal's decision the matter can be heard by an ordinarylaw court.
<P>
	Most of complaints submitted to the commission concern 
prejudices in the workplace.
<P>
<B>(1235)</B>
<P>
	I regularly meet people who are homosexual and who are 
experiencing discrimination. Sometimes very borderline 
discrimination, not always as straightforward as what we hear from 
the Reform Party, sometimes a situation is not that cut and dried. 
Sometimes the discrimination is as clear as black and white, 
sometimes it is grey. It may be in the workplace, when you are 
passed over for a promotion because of your homosexuality, when 
you are excluded from a delegation because of your homosexuality. 
It may be in daily life, where you bear the brunt of all manner of 
seriously inappropriate remarks disguised as humour.
<P>
	Our responsibility, in the coming years as today, is to make it 
possible for someone who discovers he or she is homosexual to 
state it openly, to be comfortable with it. To get to that stage, 
however,-and we are not yet there-conditions of 
non-discrimination must be put in place. The real victory will be 
the day when people in Quebec, or anywhere in the country, can 
define themselves openly as homosexual without fear of reprisal.
<P>
	Just imagine what a tolerant society, an ideal society, an 
absolutely admirable society, we will be living in when the day 
comes that there is no longer any differentiation, any different 
labelling, of those defining themselves openly as homosexual and 
those who are heterosexual.
<P>
	We must be clear on this. If the government goes on to the next 
step I will be the first to state-the government could have no 
stauncher ally than myself-that it has not only fulfilled a 
commitment to which it had subscribed in the past, and I will say 
this every chance that I get, it will have taken a profoundly 
dignified and worthy step concerning human rights, for once again 
when human rights are the topic in a parliament, there can be no 
political partisanship.
<P>
	We must be very clear. I believe my hon. colleague from 
Chambly is a notary, and you all know what they are like about 
documents and papers, and that I respect. That is what you need to 
be like to be a notary, but let us not kid ourselves. The bill before us 
is not about employment equity. The example our colleague gave a 
little while ago about police officers was not particularly 
enlightened, because no employer will be taken to court, after we 
pass this bill tomorrow, for taking a person's sexual orientation into 
account for hiring purposes. That would be out of the question in 
human resources management policy.
<P>
	Even the Employment Equity Act, which the Reform Party 
opposed tooth and nail, does not require employers to hire people 
who are not competent. These myths arise from ignorance of the 
law.
<P>
	I conclude by saying that I am a homosexual. I have already said 
so, and I am very proud indeed to be one. If you had a page deliver 
a pill for me to take to become a heterosexual I would refuse, 
because in my life, with my family, within my caucus, people have 
always known what I was. It is because people understood what I 
was that I saw homosexuality so positively. I do, however, 
understand that this bill before us also calls for respect for the 
concept of the family.
<P>
	Families are special in society. Some of our colleagues, 
especially members of the Reform Party, might be tempted, rather 
awkwardly and with a narrow-mindedness that does them no credit, 
to vote against this bill saying, and you will not miss them, no 
voice is strident enough for what they have to say and no room big 
enough to resound with the inappropriateness of their 
discrimination. They will say: ``Oppose this bill, because it calls 
the family into question''.
<P>
	I hope they will be honest enough to read the bill. I agree that the 
family is important in society. It can take all sorts of forms, not just 
the traditional family in which you and I were raised. One thing 
remains, and that is the family as a place for learning, for 
socialization and for mutual assistance. No one can deny that. 
However the bottom line is that no member should abstain or vote 
against this bill because they think it calls the family into question 
because that is not true.
<P>
<B>(1240)</B>
<P>
	Think how the stature of Parliament will grow if we send a clear 
message of non-discrimination with one voice. I hope the Reform 
Party will extend this generosity.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ian McClelland (Edmonton Southwest, Ref.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I will be standing for my intervention shortly, but before I 
do I will take this opportunity to say a few words through you, 
Madam Speaker, to the member who has just spoken on this issue.
<P>
	In the last two and one-half years I have been in Parliament I 
have come to know the gentleman as a very fine individual. I am 
very proud to have him among my friends here in the House. I hope 
we will be friends as our lives progress no matter where our paths 
may take us. I speak and think very highly of the member, but we 
come at this from slightly different perspectives.
<P>
	I concur and agree with him 100 per cent with regard to 
discrimination and the prevention of discrimination. Where we 
would divert is in the affirmative action that is bound to follow.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2122"> 2122 </A></B>
<P>
	As a direct result of this change in the legislation, is it the 
opinion of the hon. member that eventually we will be recognizing 
same sex marriages?
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ménard:</B> Madam Speaker, the hon. member is my friend 
and, to tell you the truth, I would have preferred that some other 
member ask me this question. If there is a Reformer who 
understands and is sensitive to this bill, it is him. It is, however, 
their prerogative to decide who asks the questions and I will tell 
him two things.
<P>
	I do not think this bill will lead to positive discrimination. 
Looking at things from a different angle, has the fact that the 
Canadian Human Rights Act prohibits discrimination based on 
religion led to positive discrimination for Catholics? Has the fact 
that the Canadian Human Rights Act prohibits discrimination 
based on, let us say, conviction for an offence for which a pardon 
has been granted resulted in employers hiring more pardoned 
offenders?
<P>
	Again, this bill will not lead to positive discrimination in terms 
of employment equity, something for which we both worked.
<P>
	In response to the second question-will this bill lead to de facto 
recognition of same sex marriages?-the answer is no. The best 
proof of this is that even though seven provinces and one territory 
in Canada have human rights codes prohibiting discrimination 
based on sexual orientation, none of them recognize same sex 
marriages. Yet I feel that same sex marriages will inevitably be 
recognized in the short, medium or long term. I am going to work 
very hard to see it happen.
<P>
	I cannot tell you that this bill will automatically lead to legal 
recognition of same sex marriages. We are talking about two totally 
separate things. I think same sex marriages should be recognized 
because we cannot claim to reject discrimination based on sexual 
orientation without going so far as to recognize homosexual 
relationships.
<P>
<B>(1245)</B>
<P>
	But the law should be clear. The Minister of Justice was clear; 
the human rights commissioner was clear. We have in Canada 
seven provinces and one territory where one has not led to the 
other. I would say that in statistical terms-you know how statistics 
courses usually made us sweat in the past-there is no cause and 
effect relationship between the two.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bill Graham (Rosedale, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, further to 
the last question, I would like to ask the member for 
Hochelaga-Maisonneuve whether, in the province of Quebec, 
since measures were adopted to eliminate discrimination on the 
grounds of sexual orientation, that has posed social problems for 
the traditional family?
<P>
	Can one say that, in the province of Quebec, the situation of the 
family-let us leave aside the marriage certificate, which is after 
all a formality-is worse since the passage of legislation promoting 
tolerance and respect for others?
<P>
	You have spoken about causality, and I recognize that, in the 
circumstances, it is very difficult to draw hard conclusions, but 
could you perhaps help the hon. members sitting in this House by 
telling them whether people in Quebec are saying: ``Well, for ten 
years now, Quebec has had a measure to eliminate discrimination 
against gays and, ever since, the family in Quebec has deteriorated, 
there is a clear deterioration of the traditional family in Quebec''?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ménard:</B> Madam Speaker, let me quickly say that, last 
weekend, I delivered a speech in Toronto and paid tribute to the 
hon. member who put the question, because I know he is a 
enlightened colleague.
<P>
	That being said, the issue is the following: Has the fact that, 
since 1977, Quebec has recognized in its Charter of Human Rights 
and Freedoms sexual orientation as a prohibited ground of 
discrimination noticeably changed the family, or is there, in all the 
documentation on this issue, information suggesting that this 
recognition has changed the family or inhibited people from 
starting a family? This is the real issue, and I believe the answer is 
no.
<P>
	After all, there is still a secretariat for family affairs in Quebec, 
family allowances are still being paid, and there are still people 
interested in starting a family.
<P>
	One day, I visited a community organization on international 
family day, and met a person who had no university degree but a 
healthy dose of common sense and who suggested a definition of 
the family I have never forgotten. That person said: ``A family is 
made up of people who love, help and protect each other''.
<P>
	If we love, protect and help each other, we form a family. This 
definition can include all sorts of combinations. There are single 
parent families, blended families, nuclear families and families 
living with the grandparents. These are different families, but they 
all have one thing in common: their members love, protect and help 
each other.
<P>
	This is absolutely fundamental and, again, we have to make it 
clear. I firmly believe in this principle as an individual and I 
personally adhere to it. My family plays a determining role, and I 
hope that some day you will meet my father, who has more or less 
my sense of humour. There are five children in my family, 
including a twin brother. I live on Viau Street and my parents are 
just around the corner. There is some good and bad in this 
arrangement, but I will not go into details. The bottom line is that 
the family is important, because it is still the place where solidarity 
is best displayed.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2123"> 2123 </A></B>
<P>
	Sometimes things do not go well in my life, for example when 
the Liberals give me a hard time-it does not happen often, but 
it has been the case at times; luckily, the Chair is there to see that 
it does not happen too often. Each of us knows that when things 
are not going well, the only reality is the family.
<P>
	Knowing we can count on our family makes us hope that it 
continues to exist, that it is recognized as an established value, and 
that it can take several forms. It goes without saying that many 
members in this House belong to families very different from the 
one I described and grew up in. However, the importance of the 
family remains and is affirmed in the preamble to the bill. The 
family is something that must be preserved; it is a value that must 
be recognized. Again, there is no link between making sexual 
orientation a prohibited ground of discrimination and any attempt 
to undermine the family.
<P>
<B>(1250)</B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bill Graham (Rosedale, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, it is a 
privilege to rise and discuss the motion before the House today.
<P>
	I would be tempted to review some of the factors that relate to 
the history of this measure. However, the minister in his 
introduction clearly indicated the importance of the measure, its 
historical background and origin.
<P>
	It is worth remembering this is not the first time this matter has 
been debated in the House. It is not the first time we have had to 
concern ourselves with this issue, a matter which an all-party 
committee of the House recommended in 1985 be done. It is a 
matter which the government said in the speech from the throne 
would be done. It is a matter the Minister of Justice has on many 
occasions said in response to questions in the House would be 
done. It is a matter the Prime Minister said in the House would be 
done.
<P>
	It is thus time that it be done. It is time because justice and 
humanity in communities demand it, because the laws of the 
country which are being interpreted by our courts demand it.
<P>
	We as ordinary citizens recognize that if we are to live in a 
society based on understanding, compassion, tolerance and respect 
for one another, precisely the qualities necessary in today's society, 
if we are to confront the unease being caused by rapid social 
change, by circumstances difficult for many of us to grasp in our 
lives, these very qualities necessary for societal survival, for the 
survival of our communities and the survival of our countries are 
precisely the qualities that make it required for us as we debate in 
the House to adopt this measure.
<P>
	There are consequences of discrimination of which we must be 
aware and which even in a country as privileged as ours we cannot 
afford to ignore.
<P>
	There are other parts of this world where discrimination has led 
to terrible social consequences. I do not talk of the evils of the past. 
I talk of the world in which we live today. I talk of the Rwandas, the 
Bosnias. I talk of suffering countries like that. If we trace the 
underlying evil, which is man's violence unto man, it is largely 
from circumstances that have arisen from discrimination.
<P>
	The learned Judge Goldstone who until recently was prosecutor 
at the Hague tribunal for the Bosnia war crimes had this to say 
about discrimination, learning how discrimination leads to 
genocide. I do not suggest the conditions are the same in Canada. 
He had this to say, which it behoves us to remember if we wish to 
avoid the lessons other peoples have to teach us: ``This kind of 
brutal ethnic or religious warfare is just discrimination taken to a 
violent phase. The victimized group must be dehumanized or 
demonized. Once this is done, it frees ordinary people from the 
moral restraints that would normally inhibit them from doing such 
terrible things''.
<P>
	There is a concern in this country that such moral constraints can 
be loosened. There are voices out there. I could bring items into the 
House items I have pulled from the Internet that incite people to 
violence based on other people's sexual orientation, race or 
religion. These items incite people to eliminate homosexuals from 
the face of the earth. We are not free from these influences. They 
are prevalent. They are here and we can find them.
<P>
<B>(1255)</B>
<P>
	That is why it is most important this measure be adopted. That is 
why it is supported by the National Association of Women and the 
Law, the Canadian Bar Association, the Canadian Jewish Congress, 
B'nai Brith, the Canadian Foundation of University Women, the 
Canadian Association of Statutory Human Rights Agencies, among 
others.
<P>
	I have the privilege of representing a riding in which it is said 
there is the largest gay and lesbian community in Canada. This in 
many ways does not make us remarkably different from other 
ridings.
<P>
	We are an urban riding with all the attributes of that. In that sense 
we are unlike many of our rural counterparts. There are other 
ridings across the country where similar conditions prevail.
<P>
	My riding is particularly fortunate to have within it a large 
section of the gay and lesbian community, at least in the city of 
Toronto, and in Ontario.
<P>
	There are two faces to this community in my riding. I invite 
members concerned about this issue and who would like to learn 
more about it to come to my riding and examine with me those 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2124"> 2124 </A></B>
<P>
different faces. There is the positive face of people who are making 
their lives, carrying on their lives and making contributions to our 
society. There is another face, a face of unhappiness, of worry. 
Particularly, it is the face of youth who come to downtown Toronto, 
youth who have been discriminated against.
<P>
	They have been driven from home by perplexed or 
unsympathetic parents, from school where they have been treated 
like outcasts, where it is permissible to be discriminated against 
because of one's difference. It is legally permitted in a way that 
would not be tolerated if one were of a different religion, race or 
colour.
<P>
	In my riding we have organizations like the gay and lesbian 
youth hotline. It deals with the crises in these young people's lives. 
They are suffering and unable to cope with the discrimination they 
have to face at a young and extremely vulnerable age.
<P>
	We have institutions such as 519 Community Centre directed by 
Alison Kemper, a dedicated board and many volunteers who have 
given years of service to bring together all the elements of our 
community, those who are well off and those who are not so well 
off, to deal with the issues and the fallout that discrimination 
produces in people's lives.
<P>
	I am proud to report there are some 600 organizations similarly 
spread across the country dedicated to bringing people together, to 
making society work not to discriminate, not to divide, not to make 
one group feel inferior to another, but to bring us all together.
<P>
	There is another face in my community. It may be contrasted 
with that. It is the face of a gay and lesbian community of people 
who have established themselves, who have overcome 
discrimination, who have established healthy, productive lives in 
our communities, who work hard and who contribute to society, 
living stable lives, who contribute to the well-being of our city 
where often we face crises and breakdowns of social values.
<P>
	This produces crime, violence and problems that often result 
from poverty and an inability to take advantage of what our society 
and our economy can offer. Many who argue against this measure 
base their case on a sincere belief that social stability is based on 
the family.
<P>
	I subscribe to the view that the family is the cornerstone of social 
stability. If we threaten that in any way, we will be contributing to 
the lack of stability in society.
<P>
	If those people were to come to my riding of Rosedale they 
would find that exactly the contrary prevails. If we are interested in 
a healthy, stable community, how can we tolerate a situation where 
discrimination is tolerated? It puts a part of our citizenry in a 
disadvantaged position and creates all the problems that entails.
<P>
	Some people have said this measure is directed toward a small 
proportion of our population as if we were trying  to give special 
rights to a small group and therefore this should not be important. 
The academic literature estimates this proportion of the population 
as ranging from anywhere as low as 3 per cent to anywhere as high 
as 10 per cent. If we believe the 3 per cent figure, we are still 
talking about 900,000 people in a country of 30 million. If we 
subscribe to the 10 per cent figure we are talking about three 
million of our fellow citizens against whom we say we are entitled 
to discriminate because of their sexual orientation.
<P>
<B>(1300)</B>
<P>
	The family is threatened in today's society not by measures 
which extend justice, tolerance and respect to others but by serious 
social problems which have led to high divorce rates and other 
problems. These are issues which we must address. We cannot 
persuade ourselves that these issues will be resolved and addressed 
if they are done so at the expense and the sacrifice of the rights to 
justice of our fellow citizens; citizens who are making an effort to 
make a contribution, who have been recognized already by eight 
provinces which have sought to eliminate discrimination in areas 
covered by their jurisdictions.
<P>
	Private firms such as Bell Canada and the Toronto <I>Sun</I> ensure 
that in their employment practices they do not discriminate. The 
federal government has recently announced, to its credit, that it will 
ensure in its employment practices it too will not discriminate 
against its employees based upon sexual orientation.
<P>
	Why is this? The answer is simple. It is an answer that should 
appeal to my colleagues in the Reform Party who search for an 
economic rationale, quite often wisely, in the social measures we 
seek to achieve in the House.
<P>
	Why is it that private firms would remove discrimination? Why 
is it that universities would remove discrimination? They give 
pension rights even though they pay extra taxes and are not given 
the same tax break, although the people who pay into them pay the 
same taxes. Why is it that these private firms and other individuals 
do this? They do it because they recognize it is in their economic 
interest to do so. It is to their advantage to do so.
<P>
	Discrimination whether based on race, religion or on any other 
ground is counterproductive. It denies opportunities to qualified 
people for a reason that is totally extraneous to their qualifications 
and thus is counterproductive. It impoverishes a firm, it 
impoverishes a nation, by putting a barrier between the way of 
qualified people and their access to opportunity. Thus, it 
impoverishes us all just as I suggest to members of the House that 
its elimination will enrich us all.
<P>
	Cannot this Parliament, this federal government, enact into law 
this measure which is justified not only on the basic grounds of 
decency, justice and humanity, but on the economic and social 
health of the nation as well?
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2125"> 2125 </A></B>
<P>
	We are not alone in grappling with this measure. Other 
countries, other societies, are also concerned with this. It is a 
complicated issue. It arises out of our evolution as a society, as 
a democracy and as individuals. It must be treated with great 
respect. If we look at what other societies are doing, we see that 
they too are adopting similar measures.
<P>
	I had the great privilege of teaching public international law 
before I was elected to the House. I had occasion to look at what the 
European Community is doing. The European Convention on 
Human Rights, which to some extent is the inspiration of our own 
charter, prohibits discrimination. The European courts have 
interpreted those prohibitions in a way which strikes down national 
laws which discriminate.
<P>
	I recommend to members of the House the Dudgeon case before 
the European commission and the European court on human rights, 
which examined this issue when it put into question the criminal 
laws of Northern Ireland. It came to the conclusion that in spite of 
the fact these laws were rooted in centuries of practice, they could 
not stand in the face of a modern view about discrimination.
<P>
	The European commission covers a vast range of societies, from 
Greece and Spain in the south right up to the Nordic countries of 
Europe. It covers Protestant and Catholic societies. It has examined 
a whole host of complexities of modern societies and has come to 
the conclusion that discrimination of the type we are discussing 
today cannot be permitted in an enlightened, tolerant and modern 
society if we are to go into the 21st century in conditions which will 
be socially productive. I recommend that model to the House. I 
recommend the literature from Europe and I recommend the cases 
to members who are troubled about what this measure is about.
<P>
<B>(1305)</B>
<P>
	We have talked about what this measure is designed to do, but 
what about what this measure is designed not to do? It is not, as was 
suggested by the member for Hochelaga-Maisonneuve, designed 
to create a new form of marriage. That has never been and the 
minister never suggested that that would be. In fact it is clearly said 
in the preamble to the bill that it will be preserving our traditional 
family. It is not designed to confer special status or confer special 
rights on anyone.
<P>
	There are still concerns about it but there are also some wildly 
exaggerated ones. I have heard it said by some that this will lead to 
a problem of pedophilia. Pedophilia is properly condemned in the 
Criminal Code of Canada. This was said by the member for 
Hochelaga-Maisonneuve. It is fantasy to suggest that a measure 
like this could be interpreted in a way that would overrule the 
criminal law provisions of this country.
<P>
	In no case reported in this country has it ever been suggested that 
an assault or other form of criminal act could be justified because 
of a religious, racial or other characteristic of a person who has 
committed that act. Why would it be extended in these 
circumstances? As a lawyer by background, I find such suggestions 
fanciful and designed to mislead.
<P>
	We have also heard some comments based on psychiatric 
evidence that was rooted in the fifties and led to the most atrocious 
conditions being perpetrated on people. People were given 
lobotomies in the fifties on the basis that they could be cured of 
their sexual orientation. The psychiatric community of those days 
believed what today would be considered values that are totally out 
of the middle ages. That is not modern psychiatry. Lobotomy 
practised on people is something rooted in a misunderstanding of 
human nature and a misunderstanding of the nature of humanity.
<P>
	Similarly, we are told that the family will be threatened by the 
existence of such legislation. That matter was addressed by the 
member for Hochelaga-Maisonneuve. My parents' generation 
believed the family would be threatened if people who were not 
married lived together. Today many people who are not married 
live together and we do not discriminate against them. In previous 
societies they were discriminated against. The laws in respect of 
heritage for a long time discriminated against those who were born 
out of wedlock.
<P>
	Can anyone imagine we would permit such discrimination in 
society today? We have moved. We have evolved. We will always 
move. We will always evolve. We recognize common law 
marriages today which is completely different from the situation 
that prevailed in my parents' time.
<P>
	I am not suggesting that all the solutions we have found are 
perfect. But I am suggesting the solutions that we have found 
which are rooted in tolerance, mutual respect, and decency and a 
removal of discrimination are far more likely those that will aid in 
the resolution of social problems than others.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	I have referred to the provinces. Eight have passed legislation 
eliminating discrimination on the grounds of sexual orientation. 
Quebec adopted a similar measure ten years ago, and I asked the 
hon. member for Hochelaga-Maisonneuve whether he has noted 
any threat to the family as a result. I believe his reply was clear and 
convincing. There is no evidence, not even a hint, that there has 
been any cause and effect relationship between that measure and 
the status of the family.
<P>
<B>(1310)</B>
<P>
	The same can be said about other provinces. No doubt that is the 
reason the Bloc supports this measure and indicates that we can go 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2126"> 2126 </A></B>
<P>
beyond the deepest political  differences that separate us when 
human rights in this wonderful country are at stake.
<P>
	I congratulate the hon. member for Hochelaga-Maisonneuve, 
as well as the hon. member for Burnaby-Kingsway, for all of their 
efforts over the years to advance such measures and to ensure that 
each and every Canadian citizen can enjoy the same dignity and 
independence.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	In conclusion, it is a great privilege to be a part of this House. It 
is always a privilege to debate measures which relate to the 
well-being of our country. There are times when I have been in this 
House and have wondered how serious the things are that go on 
here. There are days when one wonders what we are doing here. I 
suggest to those of us who are here today that we are here debating 
our society, ourselves and our notions of respect, tolerance and the 
dignity of mankind. There could be no greater calling or privilege 
for us than to address these measures.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ian McClelland (Edmonton Southwest, Ref.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, for some members in the House today this vote will be 
very easy; it will be just a matter of coming in and doing it. For 
other members in the House today this vote is going to be much 
more difficult and that is on both sides of the issue.
<P>
	The one thing that does unite all members, at least I pray it does, 
is that all Canadians share a bedrock value and do not discriminate 
against one another. It is our shared values that at least give me 
hope that our country and our legislatures including this one will 
fumble on into the future and things will turn out just fine, perhaps 
even in spite of us.
<P>
	As my colleague from Rosedale just mentioned, today we are 
privileged to be speaking to a very important consideration that 
strikes at the heart of the deepest convictions and personal values 
of many people. These should not be taken lightly.
<P>
	When I spoke earlier I mentioned my friendship with the 
member for Hochelaga-Maisonneuve which I enjoy and value 
very much. This friendship might seem passing strange, the Bloc 
member for Hochelaga-Maisonneuve who is gay and proud of it, 
and myself, a member of the Reform Party from Edmonton 
Southwest neither of whom could speak each other's language very 
well when we arrived at this place, and I still cannot. The thought 
of voting against a measure that would cause him pain hurts me. I 
do not want to do it because I would never vote in favour of a 
measure that in my view would add to discrimination against any 
human being.
<P>
	All of us in the Chamber if not in our immediate family as is my 
case, have members of our extended family who are gay. It is a fact 
of life and something we cannot pretend does not happen. None of 
us would want  to see persons whom we love and our friends 
discriminated against for any reason.
<P>
<B>(1315 )</B>
<P>
	I concur with the member for Rosedale when he mentioned that 
people who would throw out the red herring of pedophilia are not 
bringing a measure of dignity or worth to this debate. Pedophilia is 
a criminal offence that has nothing to do with sexual orientation. 
Pedophiles can be heterosexual, bisexual or homosexual. It has 
nothing to do with sexual orientation.
<P>
	As well, if we were to rank a threat to the family, certainly 
amending the Canadian Human Rights Act to include sexual 
orientation would not rank as high as tax policy. The tax policy is a 
far greater threat and far more damaging to the traditional family 
than adding the term sexual orientation.
<P>
	Why then would I speak against the motion? I do not think that 
by adding the two words sexual orientation to the Canadian Human 
Rights Act will change anything. It will not change discrimination 
against gay persons one iota.
<P>
	If I felt there was any evidence to support the notion that by 
amending the Canadian Human Rights Act to add those two words 
would somehow magically change the Canadian populace so that 
there would be no more discrimination against gays or anyone else, 
then I would vote for it in a minute. But it will not. All that will 
possibly change that is education and enlightenment.
<P>
	Members who have spoken expressed concerns saying that the 
enhanced dignity of gay people would be achieved through 
amending the human rights act are already there. As a matter of 
fact, the Canadian Human Rights Act is particularly eloquent in its 
defence and the statement of values that we as Canadians share:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The purpose of this Act is to extend the laws in Canada to give effect, within 
the purview of matters coming within the legislative authority of Parliament, to 
the principle that every individual should have an equal opportunity with other 
individuals to make for himself or herself, the life that he or she is able and 
wishes to have, consistent with his or her duties and obligations as a member of 
society, without being hindered in or prevented from doing so by discriminatory 
practices-</BLOCKQUOTE>
	That is, at least in my opinion, an eloquent statement of values 
that virtually every Canadian can share.
<P>
	Then regrettably, again in my opinion, we add a list:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>-based on race, national or ethnic origin, colour, religion, age, sex, marital 
status, family status, disability or conviction for an offence for which a pardon 
has been granted.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Now we want to add sexual orientation.
<P>
	The statement of values that preceded the list is of such 
magnitude and beauty that if we could somehow imbue Canadians 
from coast to coast with those values as an obligation and right of 
citizenship, none of us ever should fear being discriminated 
against. As citizens we  would know that we have an obligation not 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2127"> 2127 </A></B>
<P>
to discriminate against anyone for any reason. Then we would not 
be quibbling over whether a particular group is on or off the list. It 
is not the values that some Canadians have a problem with, it is the 
notion of a list. There is the concern that having made the list, this 
will then evolve into affirmative action.
<P>
<B>(1320)</B>
<P>
	We went through an affirmative action debate recently and 
another debate that had to do with hate crimes, Bill C-41. In that 
bill crimes were defined as worse and subject to more severe 
penalties if they were committed against persons identified on a 
list. That list included sexual orientation.
<P>
	The net result is that if someone is lying in a ditch with a cracked 
skull it is a more serious crime if the person happens to be one of 
the people on the list than it is if a person is not on the list. That is 
absolutely preposterous.
<P>
	This brings us to this bill. By amending the human rights act to 
include sexual orientation are we doing the same injustice to 
Canadians by suggesting that somehow we have to have a list about 
whom it is wrong to discriminate against?
<P>
	It is the act of discrimination that is wrong. It is not determined 
to be wrong by whom the discrimination is against. It is every bit as 
wrong to discriminate against a person that is gay, a female, a 
person of colour or religion as a white male. Discrimination is 
discrimination.
<P>
	If we did not have a list how would we go about having recourse 
if someone is discriminated against? If we did not codify what is 
right or wrong as we have been doing through the charter of rights 
and freedoms, but had a sense of what is right and wrong through 
our common law heritage, where would that put persons that are 
discriminated against? How would there be recourse and wrongs be 
righted?
<P>
	That is the problem, the nub of the question. By adding the term 
sexual orientation to the Canadian Human Rights Act that is not 
going to be addressed. Nothing is going to change as a result of the 
change. We are going to be in exactly the same situation tomorrow 
as we are today, not one bit further ahead.
<P>
	How do people who have been discriminated against find justice 
under the current system? A complaint is filed with the Canadian 
Human Rights Commission. What happens then? Well, you grow 
old, that is what happens. It might take three years or more before 
anything happens and justice delayed is justice denied.
<P>
	If someone is discriminated against in employment or for any 
other reason, it is no different than from stealing from that person. 
If you steal a person's potential and future that is the same as taking 
money from their pocket.
<P>
	We need all Canadians to share a common value that we do not 
discriminate one against another and that common value should be 
clearly understand and shared on a federal, provincial, municipal 
and corporate level. As the member for Rosedale said earlier, 
corporate Canada is light years ahead of public Canada as far as its 
relations with its work force is concerned. This is an absolute 
non-issue as far as the vast majority of Canadian business is 
concerned.
<P>
	How do people who have been discriminated against get 
recourse? It would seem to me that it would be worthwhile if we 
could contemplate a situation whereby a person having been 
discriminated against would be able to go to a tribunal or a justice 
of the peace or some such body that greater minds than mine would 
determine, and make his or her case that he or she has been 
discriminated against. By convincing that body in short order that 
the person has a case, the person who has been discriminated 
against should be able to sue then and there. The benefit of that 
would be to bring community values into play.
<P>
<B>(1325)</B>
<P>
	For example, in Alberta there was a recent case everyone should 
know about of a gay person who was teaching at King's College, a 
religious institution. When he came out of the closet he was fired. 
He complained to the human rights commission in Alberta. His 
case was not supported.
<P>
	On the surface this would seem to be a pretty clear cut case of a 
person being discriminated against because of his sexual 
orientation. However, I put to the House that in exactly the same 
situation, if that person had been working and teaching at the 
University of Alberta, which is a public institution, not a religious 
institution, then that person would not have been contravening the 
basic precepts of the institution for which he was working, and 
exactly the same jury in exactly the same circumstance would have 
found for him.
<P>
	Common sense does come into play in the interpersonal 
relationships of people in the country. If we find the outcome of 
every single circumstance that we as citizens find ourselves in is 
determined because it has been codified and is written in law, then 
we will be removing the opportunity for the people to have their 
own community standards and community values.
<P>
	That is not to say we would find ourselves in a country of 
patchwork where the strongest would survive here and the 
strongest would survive there. That is not my point at all. I am 
saying that there are two sides to every issue. Most Canadians live 
and let live and will look for reasons and ways to accommodate 
each other.
<P>
	As we progress more and more into the realm of codifying 
relationships, the opportunity for discourse and settling things is 
taken away. This brings resentment and fuels reverse 
discrimination. To a large degree that is why  affirmative action has 
been 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2128"> 2128 </A></B>
<P>
discredited in the United States and is being reversed at exactly the 
same time we are implementing it here in Canada.
<P>
	I had occasion to speak about just this. It has troubled me for 
quite some time. I have agonized over my approach, how I would 
speak to it and the position I would bring to this debate. A couple of 
weekends ago I had coffee with a friend in Minnesota who is gay. 
He told me that he almost ran off the road driving past the 
Humphreydome, the home of the Minnesota Vikings. On the 
billboard which flashed a sign to buy tickets, there was a slogan 
``remember gay pride week next week''.
<P>
	He said he could not believe it. He drove around the block to see 
if he was really seeing that sign, but there it was. He said that even 
10 years ago he could not have visualized the remotest possibility 
of seeing a sign like that.
<P>
<B>(1330 )</B>
<P>
	His life has not been made easy by the fact that he is gay. I asked 
him: ``Are you gay because you want to be gay or are you gay 
because that is the way you were born?'' His response was: ``Why 
would anybody in their right mind choose a lifestyle like mine? 
Why would anybody go through the same grief I have gone through 
in my life, in family, in job, in housing and in everything people 
have talked about?'' However, he said the wrong way to change this 
is by codifying or driving it through legislation. The right way to 
change things is through education and enlightenment.
<P>
	That is the reason, although I am troubled, I feel confident that 
when I vote against this measure I will not be voting against people 
who are gay. I will be voting in the greater light by saying we must 
speak to the root problems of discrimination, not the surface 
symptoms.
<P>
	I know the people in my constituency are divided on the issue. I 
know they are not divided on the notion of extending benefits to 
people because of their sexual orientation. I know people in my 
constituency are very concerned that I do the right thing and that I 
represent them in a way they would feel comfortable with and in a 
way they would be proud of. In this instance I know I am 
representing not just the people who voted for me but all the people 
of my constituency.
<P>
	I am very conscious that the country is divided on this issue. 
Parliament is divided on this issue. It is a very difficult decision for 
many of us.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Geoff Regan (Halifax West, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
thank the hon. member for his comments. I have always enjoyed 
listening to his speeches in the House. I appreciate that he has a 
more enlightened view than other members of his party on a variety 
of issues.
<P>
	I was interested to hear the speech of the hon. member for 
Rosedale, particularly a quotation from the learned Judge 
Goldstone, the leading prosecutor of the war  crimes in Bosnia. He 
talked about Bosnia and what had happened there in terms of the 
terrible killings and atrocities and how that came to be possible. He 
said dehumanizing people loosens the moral constraints and allows 
people to demonize and dehumanise them and ultimately leads to 
genocide.
<P>
	I believe that is related to this issue. What we are talking about in 
having a list of prohibited grounds of discrimination in the human 
rights act is who we can treat as less than human. History is replete 
with cases of society's treating certain individuals as less than 
human beings. The human rights act is where we say because 
someone fits in this particular category we cannot treat them as less 
than human.
<P>
	For example, there have been times in the past when people who 
were black or of other races were treated as less than human. 
Society said it was all right to do that. Even the courts said it was 
all right to do that. We are saying to the courts, by saying we cannot 
discriminate on the ground of race, that is not right any more, we 
cannot do that.
<P>
	There was a time when Jews were treated as less than human. 
People of other religions were treated as less than human. We are 
saying that is not permissible.
<P>
	There were times when children were treated as less than 
children. Society said it was all right. The courts said it was all 
right. However, the Canadian Human Rights Act states we cannot 
discriminate on the basis of age, ethnic origin, colour, religion, sex 
and so on, because these are people who have at times in the past 
been treated as less than human.
<P>
	It used to be that children who were born out of wedlock were 
the outcasts of society and were treated as less than human. 
However, they cannot be treated that way today because the 
question of family status is listed here.
<P>
	If there are any outcasts in this day and age, gays and lesbians 
are treated by much of society as the outcasts of this time.
<P>
<B>(1335 )</B>
<P>
	When I think of Christian principles and the life of Christ, who 
showed more concern for outcasts than he did? From my point at 
least, my Christian values require me to support this bill. It is not 
okay to treat these people because of their sexual orientation as less 
than human.
<P>
	<B>Mr. McClelland:</B> Madam Speaker, I concur with much of what 
my friend from Halifax said. He reinforced much of what I said in 
my dissertation. I do not argue with the member opposite.
<P>
	My concern is that I do not think this bill will do what he and 
others expect it will do. I do not think there is even the remotest 
possibility that by adding two words to the Canadian Human Rights 
Act the intent will come through. This is more window dressing.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2129"> 2129 </A></B>
<P>
	Be that as it may, on the issues raised earlier and the notion 
of dehumanizing people, we are in another age of enlightenment 
and that ages of enlightenment are ongoing. Major societal 
changes are evolutionary rather than revolutionary.
<P>
	On the very issues we are debating here today, as I look in my 
constituency people of younger generations have a different 
mindset by and large than people of older generations. That does 
not mean the people of the older generations should not be 
respected. That means very likely the very issues which are so 
troublesome today will evolve and 10 or 20 years from now will 
not be at issue at all because society is in evolution. Changes do not 
come rapidly, much as this institution is protected from rapid 
change by the way it functions. That is probably good. It is a check 
and a balance.
<P>
	I suspect our culture and our country and our society at large are 
far more sensitive to the notion of genocide and to dehumanizing 
people than other generations that preceded us have been. We 
spoke to that at great length in the debate last week concerning the 
Armenians and genocide and the term and the use of the word 
genocide.
<P>
	I do not think we are all that far apart. People who have a 
different and just as passionately and strongly held view are worthy 
of the same respect as people on the other side of the issue.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bill Graham (Rosedale, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
congratulate the hon. member for Edmonton Southwest for his 
thoughtful consideration of this issue. It is a consideration and a 
thoughtfulness one would come to expect from the member.
<P>
	I hope he will not be hurt if I tell him my reaction to his 
comment is that it is the rankest sophistry to say that one is in 
favour of eliminating discrimination or against discrimination but 
against a measure which is destined to eliminate that 
discrimination.
<P>
	What does he say to those who say it is okay under federal 
legislation to discriminate? Will he stand in the House when other 
measures are talked about which deal with discriminatory 
measures based on sexual orientation in federal legislation and 
speak out against them? Will he denounce them?
<P>
<B>(1340)</B>
<P>
	Should members of the courts and human rights commissions 
read the statement he made in the House today as the reasoned 
argument that those who voted against this measure are not in 
favour of discrimination but just have some trouble with this 
measure and therefore our courts can proceed with the work they 
are already doing to eliminate discrimination? They could say that, 
after all, the will of the House is clearly expressed by that member 
that even those who vote against it are in favour of eliminating all 
forms of discrimination.
<P>
	Is the member advocating we should take all the other lists such 
as references to ethnic origin, colour, religion, age or sex from the 
bill for the reasons he suggested? Does he not subscribe to the point 
made by the hon. member for Halifax that there is a historic reason 
why these provisions are in the bill?
<P>
	These provisions are in the bill because those were categories of 
people who were discriminated against by a dominant class. That is 
the position we find ourselves in with respect to sexual orientation 
today.
<P>
	Given what he said about his wish to get rid of discrimination, he 
should embrace this concept. If we have to clean up the bill to make 
it better and more effective along the lines he suggested, let us 
work on that together.
<P>
	At least let us address this issue in an efficient way at this time.
<P>
	<B>Mr. McClelland:</B> Madam Speaker, I appreciate the opportunity 
to expand on some of the difficult aspects of the approach I brought 
to this.
<P>
	I want to make it clear that I am absolutely, totally and 
completely against the notion of discrimination to anyone. 
Anybody who knows me or my family knows this to be true. This is 
not something that just happened. It is the way I have lived my life. 
It is the way our family is and has always been.
<P>
	It is not okay to discriminate, it is not right, but both sides of an 
issue must be given the opportunity to present their cases without 
being considered something less than human.
<P>
	It is not wrong to question. It is not wrong to debate. It is not 
wrong to oppose even difficult legislation such as the situation in 
which I find myself.
<P>
	The hon. member from Rosedale said I am not insulted by his 
use of the word sophistry, and how can I be on both sides of the 
issue at the same time. The Liberals opposite do it all the time. I 
have had a great teacher. This is not that simple a question.
<P>
	I would get rid of the list in its entirety and make it the value that 
we do not discriminate, not against a list.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Georgette Sheridan (Saskatoon-Humboldt, Lib.):</B> 
Madam Speaker, I will be sharing my time with the hon. member 
for Nunatsiaq.
<P>
	It is with some impatience that I rise today to speak in support of 
Bill C-33. I say impatience because the policy embodied in this 
legislation has long been supported by the Liberal Party of Canada.
<P>
	Some 20 years ago the Liberal Party of Canada agreed that 
discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation should be 
prohibited. The Liberal Party passed a resolution in 1978 that urged 
a revised Canadian Constitution to guarantee fundamental human 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2130"> 2130 </A></B>
<P>
rights in  order to prohibit discrimination by virtue of, among other 
things, sexual orientation.
<P>
	In 1985, just over 10 years ago, the Liberal Party participated in 
an all-party House of Commons committee that unanimously 
endorsed the resolution that this amendment should be made. More 
recently, at the 1994 biennial convention of the Liberal Party a 
resolution supporting this amendment was passed.
<P>
	The amendment was promised during the federal election 
campaign. I campaigned on this promise. The Prime Minister has 
put his commitment behind this both during the campaign and in 
putting forward this legislation through the justice minister.
<P>
	Speaking of the justice minister, he has repeatedly promised in 
the House that this commitment would be honoured. The <I>Star 
Phoenix</I>, the home newspaper in Saskatoon, wrote an editorial on 
March 26 with the caption that this protection was long overdue.
<P>
<B>(1345 )</B>
<P>
	It also urged politicians to take the risk of doing the right thing 
even if it might not be the most politically expedient thing.
<P>
	If everyone agrees that this is long overdue what has been the 
hold up? Why did this amendment not pass years ago? It is my 
belief that the biggest obstacle to this amendment is lack of 
information. Misinformation is sometimes deliberately put and it 
can be a complicated issue in terms of legislation and legalities.
<P>
	Let me take this opportunity to set the record straight. Let us 
look at exactly what Bill C-33 does and does not do. This section 
applies to federal legislation. It applies to employment in and the 
provisions of goods and services delivered by the federal 
government and federally regulated businesses such as banks and 
airlines. These organizations employ approximately 10 per cent or 
11 per cent of the workforce. Most employers such as schools, 
small businesses, religious and cultural organizations are regulated 
provincially and will not be affected by this proposal.
<P>
	This proposal is not particularly earth shattering either. The 
amendment to the Canadian Human Rights Act merely brings the 
federal legislation into line with most corresponding provincial and 
territorial laws, with court decisions that have provided gays and 
lesbians with the same protection from discrimination under the 
Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms as other Canadians, and 
with the unanimous recommendations of the 1985 all-party 
parliamentary subcommittee report.
<P>
	Eight provinces and territories, including my home province of 
Saskatchewan, have already amended their human rights 
legislation to include sexual orientation.
<P>
	Why is the amendment needed? This is a question we constantly 
hear from the members of the Reform Party. Why do we need this 
protection for this group in society?  As it stands right now there 
are two ways individuals can be protected from discrimination in 
this country. The first is under the Canadian Human Rights Act to 
the extent that it applies to the individual in question. The second is 
under the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.
<P>
	The difficulty is that when there is a gap in either of those pieces 
of legislation the Canadian who is a victim of discrimination must 
resort to the judicial system. We all know that resorting to the 
judicial system can be both expensive and risky.
<P>
	I cite as an example two recent court decisions on the matter of 
sexual orientation. First, the Ontario Court of Appeal has suggested 
that sexual orientation ought to be read into the legislation when it 
is not present. Second, the Alberta Court of Appeal stated that is 
indeed not the case. The only way to resolve that discrepancy is 
through the Supreme Court of Canada which may or may not hear 
the case.
<P>
	A more simple approach would be to codify this protection in 
federal legislation, which is what this bill is here to do today.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	No one in this country should suffer discrimination because of 
their sexual orientation. This is a matter of fairness and 
fundamental justice. It is not up to us to judge people's 
homosexuality or heterosexuality, but we must protect all 
Canadians from discrimination in our society.
<P>
	Both the courts and the people of Canada have recognized that 
gays and lesbians are a group at risk. They have been 
disadvantaged historically, stereotyped, they have suffered 
considerable prejudice and discrimination in our society. No one 
should be considered any less than a full member of society 
because of their homosexuality.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	As I said earlier, the greatest impediment to passing this 
legislation is ignorance of the facts. The controversy surrounding 
this issue particularly in the media, which is fuelled by the party 
opposite, has resulted in many of my constituents being confused. 
They have written to me with questions about what this legislation 
will do. We cannot be disrespectful of the emotional side of this 
issue or of the deeply held feelings of many Canadians, including 
some within my own caucus.
<P>
	However, my belief as a mother and as a teacher has always been 
that the best antidote to misinformation is information. Let us have 
a look at the bill to see what it will do. In framing my responses I 
will refer questions in a generic form that I have received from my 
constituents.
<P>
	The question most often asked is related to the special benefit 
issue. This question is fueled by the Reform Party, that somehow 
Bill C-33 is to give special benefits  to this group in our society. 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2131"> 2131 </A></B>
<P>
The proof is in the pudding. Sexual orientation has been consi-dered prohibited grounds of discrimination under provincial law 
since 1977.
<P>
<B>(1350)</B>
<P>
	No one could credibly argue that the provincial legislation has 
conferred special rights on any other groups protected by that 
legislation. Although each of the characteristics is now expressly 
covered by the existing statute, it is obvious that no special rights 
are conferred. It will be no different for sexual orientation. The 
amendment will prohibit discrimination in areas of federal 
jurisdiction, including employment and access to goods and 
services.
<P>
	Another type of question I have often received from constituents 
has to do with whether the amendment will lead to benefits for 
same sex partners. That is unlikely to be the case. In fact, it will not 
be the case given the experience we have had with a similar 
provision in provincial legislation.
<P>
	Another question is will the legislation not lead to adoption by 
same sex couples. The answer is no. Matters of adoption are 
primarily under provincial jurisdiction, not federal. The 
amendment does not in any way deal with matters covered in Bill 
C-167 proposed by the Ontario government in 1994.
<P>
	The amendment deals with discrimination in employment, 
accommodation and provision of services and nothing else. It does 
not condone or condemn homosexuality or heterosexuality.
<P>
	Section 2 of Bill C-33 simply adds to the existing legislation 
sexual orientation as a grounds of prohibited discrimination. I 
highlight that because a question related to the same sex adoption 
question concerns the impact this legislation will have on the 
family.
<P>
	There is a belief that protecting gays and lesbians from 
discrimination will bring about the end of the family as we know it. 
I am offended by the implication that somehow gays and lesbians 
are not part of the Canadian family. Let us not forget the human 
side of this issue. Gays and lesbians are not aliens from outer space. 
They are our brothers, sisters, grandchildren, sons and daughters.
<P>
	Will Bill C-33 lead to the destruction of the family? No, it will 
not. The proof lies partly in the application of existing provincial 
laws, but also in the preamble to Bill C-33. The second part of the 
preamble states:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>And whereas the government recognizes and affirms the importance of 
family as the foundation of Canadian society and that nothing in this act alters 
its fundamental role in society;</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Another question of great concern to many of my constituents is 
what impact this legislation might have on churches and religious 
organizations in terms of their teachings and with regard to the 
hiring and firing of their staff. There is nothing in the Canadian 
Human Rights Act amendment that would affect that.
<P>
	In relation to the matter of the churches, the amendment has 
been endorsed by the United Church of Canada, the Anglican 
Church, B'nai Brith, the Canadian Jewish Congress and the 
Canadian Conference of Catholic Bishops, which is of special 
interest to some people in my constituency. The Canadian bishops 
are in step with the opinions of their church community and 
Canadians in general. The polls have shown that most Canadians 
support the amendment.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Myron Thompson (Wild Rose, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
moved here some 30 years ago from the United States. I have 
witnessed some terrible cases of intolerance and discrimination 
south of the border. When we moved to Canada one of the first 
things my wife and I noticed was the huge difference, and what a 
pleasure it was. I have found over the last 30 years that Canada is 
indeed a very tolerant society.
<P>
<B>(1355)</B>
<P>
	Does the member not agree that this kind of legislation questions 
the judgment of our society? By putting out this kind of legislation 
are we saying that we cannot trust Canadians as people to be 
non-discriminatory, that we will legislate it so they must be?
<P>
	I believe Canadians are a tolerable group and that the House 
should have trust in the people of Canada. I would like a comment 
from the hon. member.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Sheridan:</B> Mr. Speaker, Canadians are not tolerable but 
tolerant. We are proud of that tolerance and of our range of views.
<P>
	My province of Saskatchewan is no different from any other part 
of Canada. One of our most famous native sons is a former prime 
minister, the Right. Hon. John Diefenbaker, who brought forward 
the first Canadian bill of rights to protect, among other things, 
ethnicity, which was of particular concern to him.
<P>
	Canadians are right to look to their Liberal government for 
leadership on this issue, to stand up for the vulnerable and not to do 
the politically expedient thing, not to govern by 1-900 numbers like 
the Reform Party.
<P>
	Canadians would be ill advised to rely on the Reform Party for 
any assistance on this very important issue. The members of this 
party are pen pals with Newt Gingrich and the American right. This 
is a party that would take us back to the days of ``Father Knows 
Best''. This is a party that when Pat Buchanan burps, its leader says 
``pardon me''.

	<B>Mrs. Rose-Marie Ur (Lambton-Middlesex, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, April 21 to 28 was National Volunteer Week in Canada. 
This week provided an opportunity to acknowledge and celebrate 
the contributions made by volunteers in every community across 
the country.
<P>
	There are estimated to be over 10 million volunteers in Canada. 
They donated more than one billion hours of service each year at an 
economic value of $16 billion.
<P>
	Volunteers work for many causes including literacy, the 
environment, community safety, health promotion, elderly 
outreach and children's welfare. All volunteers make a difference, 
a huge difference to our communities and our society.
<P>
	Volunteer centres spearheaded a wide variety of events in many 
communities. I took part in a tree planting ceremony with the 
Lambton Elderly Outreach and visited mall displays in Strathroy.
<P>

Lambton-Middlesex who donate so many valuable hours and

workers.
<P>
<B>(1400)</B>
<P>
	As well, the contribution rate of employers and workers should 
be lowered, instead of accumulating surpluses in excess of $5 
billion in the employment insurance fund, given that the current 
rate has a negative impact on the level of employment.
<P>
	Lowering the rates would pump new money into the Canadian 
economy, which would result in the government reducing payroll 
taxes and encouraging the private sector to create more jobs. I urge 
the Minister of Finance to reflect on this.

employee in order to please bigoted and racist customers.
<P>
	Imagine the hurt and dismay that must be felt by Canadians who 
are members of minority groups, the disabled and their families 
because a member of this House wants to push them to the back of 
the room rather than deal with bigotry and racism. The behaviour 
he is advocating would violate the human rights act in his own 
province of British Columbia. Shamefully, the member who made 
those remarks is the Reform Party whip.

<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="REFERENDUMS">REFERENDUMS</A></H3>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, again yesterday the Minister of Justice commented on the 
holding of another referendum on the future of Quebec, stating that 
the results would not be recognized. This is tantamount to saying 
the federal government does not acknowledge the right of 
Quebecers to determine their future democratically.
<P>
	My question is for the Prime Minister. Does he agree with his 
Minister of Justice that the next referendum in Quebec would be 
merely consultative in nature and not recognized by Ottawa?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I do not think there is anything to add to what the Minister 
of Justice has said. A referendum is always a consultation of the 
people. When there is a referendum, the laws of the country in 
question must be respected, first and foremost. There have been 
two referendums. If there is another, we shall see, but for the 
moment other things are in the works, and I do not know when 
there will be one. When there is, we shall see.
<P>
	For the moment, however, the premier of Quebec says he wants 
an election first and a referendum later, and he is not prepared to 
say much more about it. Nor am I. In due course, however, as I 
have always said, things will have to be made very clear to avoid 
confusion.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, there are many who agree with that, but at least three 
government ministers made statements and comments yesterday on 
the situation. The Prime Minister should turn to his cabinet 
colleagues and tell them ``Ladies and Gentlemen, move on to some 
other topic''. That is what he should do.
<P>
	Meanwhile, since the Minister of Justice, someone who is far 
from being a junior member of this government, has made 
statements of such importance to the future of this issue, how can 
the Prime Minister-I wish to ask the Prime Minister-how can he 
now state that the next referendum will be merely a consultation, 
merely consultative, when he himself, in speaking to the people of 
Quebec right before the last referendum, told them their decision 
would be irreversible? How can he reconcile the two?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the problem was not raised by the ministers. The problem 
was raised by the premier of Quebec this past Sunday, when he 
wanted to change the subject from Bill 101. He raised this 
completely hypothetical question and the minister responded.
<P>
	As for my statement, I have nothing to take back. I have always 
said here, I took a two-week break and then the Bloc leader quit, 
but I always said and I repeat, we will not break up the country with 
a very tight majority vote after a judicial recount.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, we will gladly call it quits on that, but I would appreciate 
it if the Prime Minister would speak to his ministers, in order to 
avoid any ambiguity, and would let us know if he dares deny that, 
after obtaining a mandate from the people of Quebec in a 
referendum, the Government of Quebec can then effect 
sovereignty. Let him say it frankly, and then it will be clear. His 
ministers will stop talking about it and everybody will be happy.
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I prefer to talk about something that is fact. Quebecers 
have twice decided to remain in Canada. That is what we ought to 
talk about.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier-Montcalm, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, up to now, the Prime Minister's approach in constitutional 
matters has been to complicate rather than to simplify. A number of 
influential federalist business people are criticizing his lack of 
vision and his government's lack of planning in this matter. His 
ministers' contradictory statements in this regard bear eloquent 
witness.
<P>
	My question is for the Prime Minister. Whom are we to believe 
in this government between the Minister of Justice, who accords no 
more than a consultative value to referendums, and the 
immigration minister, who claims that, if the rules were clear, the 
referendum would have a real value?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, when we have a referendum, we will ensure the rules are 
clear.
<P>
<B>(1420)</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier-Montcalm, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, and the Prime Minister is still at it. Instead of playing cat 
and mouse with such a weighty matter as constitutional issues, 
could the Prime Minister say clearly, once and for all, whether he 
accords Quebecers the right to decide their future democratically 
themselves? It is simple: yes or no, Mr. Prime Minister.
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am not the one talking about these problems, it is Mr. 
Bouchard. If precisions are needed, it is the people of Quebec who 
need them at this point, because everyone wants a moratorium in 
order to create jobs and revitalize the economy, Montreal's in 
particular.
<P>
	This is what Mr. Bouchard himself has called for. He called for 
an end to discussions on the Constitution and referendums and 
instead the creation of a climate favourable to investment in 
<P>

	<B>Miss Deborah Grey (Beaver River, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
Hamilton <I>Spectator</I> is full of letters from constituents angry and 
embarrassed by the Deputy Prime Minister's inaction.
<P>
	Susan Kalbfleisch writes: ``How can we teach our children that 
honour, integrity and personal responsibility are important when 
one of our leaders sets such a poor example?''
<P>
	Ivy Brittain from Hamilton writes: ``I don't think any of her 
constituents in Hamilton think too much of her right now. She was 
the one who said she would resign if the promise to abolish the 
GST wasn't kept''.
<P>
	My question is for the Deputy Prime Minister. Why will she not 
put personal responsibility and integrity ahead of her political 
career and resign her seat now in the House of Commons?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the acting leader of the third party should concentrate her 
attentions at this moment on the awful statement made by the 
member for Nanaimo-Cowichan. It was just about the worst 
statement we could hear in Canadian society.
<P>
	I am the leader of a political party. In that party are members of 
different colour. There are the members for Nunatsiaq, for Malton, 
for Bruce-Grey, for Etobicoke-Lakeshore. The member for 
Richmond and other members of other minorities are here and I 
will never ask them to go to the back. I am proud of them. They 
will always be in the front row of the Liberal Party.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> I would ask that the questions should be directed 
to the administrative responsibility of a minister or the 
government.
<P>
	<B>Miss Deborah Grey (Beaver River, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I just 
say again that I am committed to the equality of all people in the 
country, and all politicians as well. When one politician breaks a 
promise after that promise has been made with real commitment, 
then it puts all of us to shame.
<P>
	The Toronto <I>Star</I> in its editorial column states that the Deputy 
Prime Minister ``should quit now to help restore public faith in the 
system and face her voters in an immediate byelection''. The 
editorial went on to say: ``Her departure would also help staunch 
the tidal wave of public cynicism that has greeted Liberal 
pronouncements''.
<P>
	I ask the Deputy Prime Minister, not her little answer man, if she 
will restore public faith in the political system, live up to her 
commitments and face the voters of Hamilton East in an immediate 
byelection? Will she do that today?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, she can throw books and show good behaviour like that in 
the House of Commons, but I would like to know if she will ask the 
member for Nanaimo-Cowichan to resign because he made a 
most outrageous statement. We have members of Parliament-one 
in the Bloc and one in the NDP party-who have admitted they are 
homosexual. They have the right to be in this House like anybody 
else.

<B>(1425)</B>
<P>
	To see these people trying to teach me a lesson today on ethics 
when they have colleagues who discriminate against people 
because of colour, language, sexual orientation and sex is 
unacceptable. I will not be put in the corner by the bully from 
Alberta.
<P>
	<B>Miss Deborah Grey (Beaver River, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, again 
we are talking about commitment and a promise that was made 
before the last election. That promise was made several times after 
the election.
<P>
	The editorialist at the <I>Globe and Mail</I> today said that the 
Liberal's shameful performance in the GST affair feeds the very 
disillusionment with politics and politicians that brought these 
people to power in 1993.
<P>
	The article went on to say that if the government truly wants to 
restore honesty and integrity to public life and teach Canadians to 
trust their leaders again, the Deputy Prime Minister must ``do the 
honourable thing and resign''.
<P>
	I ask the Deputy Prime Minister again, will she in the words of 
the <I>Globe and Mail</I> continue to bring ``dishonour on herself, her 
government and-
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> With respect, I remind members that we cannot 
say something using someone else's words what we would not say 
here in the House of Commons. With regard to the word she used,

withdraw that word.

answered, we will hear it.
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, at this moment if I were a member of the Reform Party I 
would be very embarrassed to see the acting leader get up in this

	<B>Mr. Jean-Marc Jacob (Charlesbourg, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the Minister of National Defence.
<P>
	Yesterday the government lawyer objected to the Somalia 
inquiry being able to do its work properly. Today, the government 
must backtrack before the general outcry in reaction to this new 
attempt at a cover-up.
<P>
	Are we to understand that the minister of defence shares fully the 
opinion of the head of the commission that the commission's 
mandate with respect to allegations of cover-up and destruction of 
evidence extends beyond the period initially foreseen and that it 
therefore includes allegations that a cover-up took place and is 
perhaps still taking place under the present government?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney General 
of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I can make clear to the hon. 
member and to the House that the government does not question for 
a moment the right and the jurisdiction of the inquiry to look into 
the whole question of cover-up. That is well within the mandate of 
the commission.
<P>
	The issue that was addressed yesterday was evidentiary in 
nature. Counsel for the government took a position with respect to 
the production of certain tapes and transcripts. That material has 
now been handed over and made available to the commission 
which has made a ruling in respect of it.
<P>
	Last August the commission had occasion to consider the ambit 
of its mandate and in a written ruling released August 3 of last year, 
it expressly found it had the jurisdiction under its mandate to look 
into allegations of cover-up with respect to the incidents in 
Somalia. That is a position with which this government is in full 
agreement. From day to day at the hearing, we co-operate fully in 
assisting the commission to do that job.
<P>

<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean-Marc Jacob (Charlesbourg, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, as 
the Minister of Justice has just said, if the commission's mandate 
consists in getting to the bottom of the allegations of cover-up, as 
well as the disappearance and alteration of documents produced  
under the present government, can the defence minister or the 
justice minister reassure us today that when the inquiry is over, the 
commission will table a complete report on this affair, including 
the names of those responsible and the appropriate sanctions, if 
any?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney General 
of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the commission has its own 
counsel and will do what it is advised in making a report.
<P>
	On behalf of the Government of Canada and the commission, 
particularly in relation to legal representation, we fully agree that 
the commission's mandate includes the right to look at allegations 
of cover-up.
<P>
	We are committed to co-operating with the commission in that 
work. We invite the commission, expressly and implicitly, to make 
whatever finding is appropriate on the facts as it finds them in 
relation to the allegations of cover-up.

yesterday the Deputy Prime Minister tried to use the cost of a 
byelection as an excuse for not fulfilling her solemn, precise and 
calculated promise to electors in Hamilton East in the last election 
to resign if the GST is not scrapped.
<P>

Deputy Prime Minister spends here adds hundreds of thousands of

thing, resign and allow a byelection?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr.

implementing page 22 of the red book. There is nothing to add.
<P>
	We campaigned on page 22 of the red book where we said we 
were to replace this tax with a harmonized tax. The member should 
read the red book and realize that we campaigned on the promise 
that we are fulfilling at this time.

[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stephen Harper (Calgary West, Ref.):</B> I have a 
supplementary question, Mr. Speaker.

	As the Prime Minister knows, the Deputy Prime Minister was 
booed at the Copps Coliseum in Hamilton because of her own 
performance and of the government's performance on the GST.

newspapers: ``Everybody Misunderstood'',  ``GST: the End of a

	Will the Deputy Prime Minister act honourably and resign, as 
she promised during the last election campaign?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
two kinds of questions occur in the House.
<P>
	Very rarely, a member of the opposition will stand up and ask for 
a point of information, genuinely seeking an answer. There are 
other types of questions in which members of the opposition 
engage in political rhetoric, normally with a long preamble. They 
are not seeking information but seeking to make a point.
<P>
	We are used to the second kind of question. Normally when the 
member asks that kind of question, explicit or implicit in the 
preamble is the fact that the opposition wants to attack the 
government on a point of substance.
<P>
	Does the Reform Party support what the government is doing in 
terms of harmonization or not? Does the Reform Party still believe 
as it said it did in the finance committee report: ``We commend the 
government in its attempt to harmonize the tax with the 
provinces''.
<P>
	Does the Reform Party still believe that it is simply unacceptable 
that Canada remain the only country in the world with 10 different

	<B>Mr. Jean-Paul Marchand (Québec-Est, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
according to Statistics Canada, of the 1,000,000 francophones 
outside Quebec who declared French as their mother tongue, only 
640,000 still speak French at home. Despite this very alarming 
situation, the commissioner of official languages has just released 
an annual report claiming, on the contrary, that considerable 
progress has been made in the use of French outside Quebec.

	My question is for the Deputy Prime Minister. How can the 
commissioner of official languages table such a rosy report, when 
for 18 months he has been releasing reports that totally contradict 
what he said today? What extraordinary event has happened since 
then to cause such an about-face on the part of the commissioner?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of 
Canadian Heritage, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, the facts are there. In 
Canadian schools today, 2,135,000 children are studying French as

	<B>Mr. Marchand:</B> My question is this: Why do Statistics Canada's 
figures show that, over the last 20 years, the assimilation rate for 
francophones outside Quebec has risen from 27 to 34 per cent?

who was not appointed by this government but by the previous 
government, released a report and the hon. member across the way 
is now accusing him of distorting the facts. The facts are there.

	The fact that one in four Canadians can speak both languages

<P>
	In August 1994, the Fédération des communautés francophones

Languages Act, said, and I quote: ``Time is running short, as 
statistics on assimilation indicate. At this rate, our communities 
will be nothing more than a shadow of their former selves''. In 
short, it sounded a cry of alarm with the government. The 
government, however, prefers to remain deaf to this sort of appeal

observation was made by counsel that the issue was collateral to 
the events in Somalia, and submissions were made about how far 
the commission should go in examining video tapes.

	However, as I said earlier, apart from this detail the important 
point of principle is that the government is committed to assisting

	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney General 
of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the Minister of National Defence 
and I have exactly the same position. It is the position of 
commission counsel, the position of the counsel who appears for 
the government before the commission. The commission can quite 
properly and should look into any allegations of cover-up.
<P>
	The most important thing of all is to have the Canadian people 
learn the facts and to have the commission's findings on those facts 
so that we can make an evaluation of what happened and what 
should happen, which is exactly the position we take before the 
commission and here today.

<P>
	About a year ago the House unanimously adopted a motion

the Prime Minister and the Minister of National Defence support 
this initiative.

in responding to the proposal of the House to put in place an 
oversight mechanism for the CSE?

welcomes the initiative taken by the hon. member for 
Scarborough-Rouge River and the members on the subcommittee 
on security intelligence of the justice committee.
<P>
	We have been holding discussions with him and other members

	<B>Mr. Antoine Dubé (Lévis, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, my question is for 
the Minister of Transport.
<P>
	This year, the Quebec bridge was designated a historic landmark 
by the federal Department of Canadian Heritage. Yet, the Minister 
of Transport still refuses to share in the costs of the repair work, 
with CN and the Government of Quebec.
<P>
	Does the minister not find it ill advised, to say the least, to grant 
a consortium $41.9 million, indexed annually over a period of 35 
years, for a total of over $2 billion, to fund the construction of a 
bridge between New Brunswick and Prince Edward Island, which 
will be used by 132,000 people, while refusing to give anything to 
preserve the Quebec bridge, which is used by over 600,000 people?
<P>
	<B>Hon. David Anderson (Minister of Transport, Lib.): </B>Mr. 
Speaker, the government is well aware of the importance of the 
Quebec bridge, but it is the responsibility of CN, not the federal 
government, to maintain it.
<P>
	In the case of Prince Edward Island, both the federal and 
provincial governments have constitutional responsibilities. There 
is a big difference, which explains why the federal government is 
involved in the funding of this venture, but not of the Quebec 
bridge, which is CN's responsibility.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Antoine Dubé (Lévis, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, how can the 
minister justify this double talk, since he refuses to fund repair 
work to the Quebec bridge on the grounds that it belongs to a 
private company, while granting $2 billion to a consortium, which 
is also a private company, to build a bridge between Prince Edward 
Island and New Brunswick?
<P>
	<B>Hon. David Anderson (Minister of Transport, Lib.): </B>Mr. 
Speaker, in the case of the bridge to Prince Edward Island, the 
government has a constitutional responsibility. As for the Quebec 
bridge, it was transferred to CN three or four years ago, before this 
government took office. At the time, the federal government gave 
land located next to the bridge and worth some $30 million. We 
expected CN to continue to maintain the bridge, as it is doing.
<P>
	This year, CN will spend $1.5 million on maintenance, and that 
level should remain the same for the next 10 or 20 years. Still, 
responsibility for the bridge rests with CN. If the province of 
Quebec, which, I believe, allocates $25,000 annually for the use of 
the bridge by automobiles, is interested in helping out with the 
maintenance costs, this will be good news.

minister in his wisdom has divided the B.C. small boat fleet into 
three geographic areas.
<P>
	Just to make a living fishermen will be forced to buy a second or 
a third licence. That will probably cost them $13,000 a year, 
$13,000 in additional costs.
<P>
	At a time when fish prices are depressed, the Fraser River is to 
be shutdown for a year and when fishermen are going broke, how 
does the minister dare saddle B.C. fishermen with another $13,000 
a year in additional costs?

	<B>Hon. Fred Mifflin (Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, the hon. member knows the commercial fishery in 
British Columbia is in a very sad state. The stocks are low. The 
fishermen are losing money. They are expected to lose more money 
this year. Something has to be done.
<P>
	A plan was put together which would address the environmental 
sustainability of the industry and its economic viability. Essentially 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2142"> 2142 </A></B>
<P>
it is a plan that would  allow the fish to survive. It is a tough plan. It 
is a plan which has consequences for the people involved.
<P>
	However, these tough measures are necessary. They have to be 
taken if the fish are to survive and if the fishermen are to survive. 
We will move forward with something which has been needed for 
the last 15 years.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Cummins (Delta, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, something has 
to be done, but increasing costs in a time of hardship is not the 
thing to do.
<P>
	The minister knows his policy will do nothing to help small 
fishermen. It will force them out of business. On top of that, the 
policy will force fishermen to increase their catch to pay the extra 
costs.
<P>
	The minister's plan forces fishermen out of the industry, takes 
away their livelihoods and on top of that puts increased pressure on 
salmon stocks. How can he possibly justify punishing British 
Columbians with such a poorly conceived plan?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Fred Mifflin (Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, the plan will not punish British Columbians. The plan 
is tough. The plan has some consequences which will create 
difficulties.
<P>
	Everybody agrees there is an overcapacity in the industry. 
Everybody agrees this has to be reduced. Everybody agrees the 
objectives of sustainability have to be met.
<P>
	We have put forward a plan which will address this tough 
situation. Again, it is a tough plan to address the health of the 
industry.
<P>
	If the hon. member has problems with the plan, I have yet to see 
any plan he may have devised.

<P>

moved out of sight or hidden away because of their race, because of 
a physical disability or because of  some other characteristic that 
has nothing to do with their worth as human beings.

	Canadians believe in a country in which employers cannot fire a 
member of a minority group to accommodate the bigotry of their 
customers, but in a country in which employers speak out against 
such bigotry on behalf of minorities.

my question is for the Minister of Human Resources Development.
<P>
	Last Friday, the minister announced a new manpower training 
program called Experience Canada, with $21 million in funding. 
Far from withdrawing from the training field, as it has committed 
itself to do on many occasions, it is creating new programs in this 
sector.
<P>
<B>(1455)</B>
<P>
	How can the Minister of Human Resources claim, on the one 
hand, to withdraw from trade training, while on the other hand 
creating Experience Canada, which falls directly in an area in 
which Quebec has jurisdiction: trade training?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of Human Resources 
Development, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, on Friday the young people of 
Canada were delighted to learn that the private sector throughout 
the country is prepared to contribute more than $12 million in a 
partnership with the Government of Canada to assist young 
Canadians everywhere in the country. Thus, not only will they be 
learning to work in a sector that is familiar and appropriate to them, 
but they will also have an opportunity to get to know Canada better.
<P>
	Young people in all of the provinces and territories will be able 
to take part in this program, because the private sector has seen fit 
to take part along with the Government of Canada, contributing 
$12.7 million of the $21 million to which the hon. member refers.
<P>
	In my opinion, this is once again a very fine example of how 
Canadians, the Government of Canada, and the private sector can 
all work together for the common good.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stéphan Tremblay (Lac-Saint-Jean):</B> Mr. Speaker, how

	<B>Mr. Solberg:</B> Mr. Speaker, since the government could not wait 
to have taxpayers pay for six byelections for other Liberals, is the 
real reason the Deputy Prime Minister is refusing to resign today 
that her fat patronage job is not quite ready yet?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the other day in an answer to a question from this member, because 
of the unfortunate time restrictions placed on some of my answers, 
I was unable to complete my answer.
<P>
	The member claims to belong to a populist party. The 
Consumers Association of Canada supports what the government 
has done. Does the Reform Party? The Federation of Canadian 
Municipalities supports what the government has done. Does the 
Reform Party?
<P>
	The Tourism Industry Association of Canada supports what the 
government has done. The Canadian Health Care Association, the 
Canadian School Boards Association, national voluntary 
associations and the Canadian people support the government. 
Why can the Reform Party not get with it?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
suggest the finance minister go out and meet the people some time 
and he would find out what they really think. Ask the people at the 
Copps Coliseum what they thought when the Deputy Prime 
Minister was there the other day? They did not think too highly of 
it.

attorneys can thank the Deputy Prime Minister for another made in 
Canada addition to their quiver, the `I was a victim' defence''.

	To the noble drunkenness defence we can now add ``I was only 
running for Parliament''. What a great defence.
<P>
	Since her government's lack of integrity and contempt for 
Canadians is now exposed, since she has compromised herself and 
all parliamentarians with her loose lipped actions, why will the 
Deputy Prime Minister not restore trust in her government by 
keeping her word for once and resign?

<B>(1500 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the member likes to cite quotations. May I just cite Mike Harris on 
June 14, 1994: ``If I want something that works, and I will tell you 
this, if we had one value added tax, one base, one bureaucracy to 
collect it, the manufacturers and the businesses in Ontario would 
save over $1 billion by being able to deduct these costs that you 
cannot deduct today on the sales tax''. Mike Harris said: ``It has 
been one of the areas of major competitive disadvantage that 
Ontario manufacturers have and Ontario businesses have''.
<P>
	I will close by simply saying this is what Mike Harris said. He 
said to stop the rhetoric. He said to stop the politics. He said to stop 
the finger pointing and get on with harmonization. Mike Harris was 
right then and the government is right now.

time and referred to a committee.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> My colleagues, when we broke before question

<P>
	<B>Mr. Geoff Regan (Halifax West, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I want to 
comment on the speech by the hon. member for 
Saskatoon-Humboldt who made a very good presentation.
<P>
	First of all I want to bring to the attention of the House what this 
bill is really about. It says in the preamble that it is about Canadians 
having the right to be free from discrimination in employment and 
in the provision of goods and services. That is what this bill is 
about, nothing more and nothing less. This bill also says that the 
government recognizes and affirms the importance of the family as 
the foundation of Canadian society, that nothing in the act alters its 
fundamental role as a society.
<P>
	Those are very important points to many Canadians. It is 
important that they be in the bill and it is good that they are there. 
But it seems to me it is not enough to simply not discriminate 
ourselves. We must oppose discrimination. We must protect 
against it. That is what this bill is supposed to do and will do. I ask 
the member for Saskatoon-Humboldt to comment.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Sheridan:</B> Mr. Speaker, I underline what my colleague has 
just said. Bill C-33 is about human rights protection from 
discrimination. It is not about destroying the Canadian family.
<P>
	My family values, like those of many Canadians, include the 
values of tolerance, equity, justice and decency. Bill C-33 is not 
about conferring special rights on special groups. Bill C-33 is not 
about promoting lifestyles. It ought to be pointed out that the term 
sexual orientation which is being added to the bill is a neutral term 
that includes both homosexuality and heterosexuality.
<P>
	It is my belief that we are judged as a society not by how we 
enhance the lives of the powerful but rather, how we look out for 
the vulnerable among us. For this reason, I am proud to be judged 
by the protection put in place by Bill C-33, legislation that for 
many Canadians will replace the raised fist with a sheltering arm.

[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, considering what we saw during question period 
and what happened yesterday with the comments by the member 
for Nanaimo-Cowichan, I feel it is important to concentrate on 
the issue of discrimination.
<P>
	Let me quote what has already been quoted by others in this 
House. The member for Nanaimo-Cowichan said that ``everyone 
should be treated fairly and with justice, and we should be just to 
everyone, not just to specific little groups''. That is precisely why 
we are putting the issue of discrimination on the basis of sexual 
orientation into the act. People who are of a different colour, who 
are of a different lifestyle, who are disabled are being discriminated 
against based on those characteristics.
<P>
	In talking about discrimination against various people, I have not 
encountered any in this House. However, being of a colour which is 
different from most people down here, at times there has been some 
discrimination against me based on the fact that I look different. 
People have looked at me and said: ``Oh, a native''. I have an 
example of this.
<P>
	I was driving to the airport one day. I was in a rush because as 
usual, I was late. Two of my kids were with me. Because I was 
going over the speed limit, I was stopped by an RCMP officer. I 
was at the airport and was told to get out of my car. I said I would 
get out but I asked if I could start to unload my stuff. The officer 
said: ``No, just get out''. This was in front of my kids. I said that I 
was not going to run away, but asked if I could start unloading my 
stuff while the officer checked out whether I was driving legally. 
He said no. I hope this does not happen to other people from my 
area.
<P>
	I gave him my driver's licence. I did not happen to have the 
proof of ownership because I was driving the car my wife usually 
drives and she had the proof of ownership. The officer threatened to 
take away my car. He went back to his car and ran a check through 
the computer. Meanwhile, he told me to stay in the car, not to 
unload it. Maybe he thought I was going to run away. About a 
minute later he came back and his demeanour had completely 
changed. I thought: What if I had been an ordinary Inuit from the 
north? I felt sorry then and there for anyone who did not happen to 
have my position as a member of Parliament. His demeanour had 
completely changed.
<P>
<B>(1515 )</B>
<P>
	My problem is what I would I have gone through if I had not 
been a member of Parliament since my wife had the ownership and 
proof of insurance. That is the kind of thing I am talking about on 
this issue of the introduction of the words sexual orientation into 
the Canadian Human Rights Act.
<P>
	One has to feel those things in order to realize how much 
discrimination there is in Canada and elsewhere. Sometimes we 
have to experience these things. If one has  not experienced 
discrimination, they cannot know what people go through, whether 
they are a different colour, religion or sexual orientation than 
others.
<P>
	When I was growing up, I went to a mission school in 
Chesterfield Inlet, N.W.T. Every morning we woke up around 6.30 
or 7 a.m., went to church and had catechism after school. We were 
taught all the things we should be doing as good Christians: to be 
tolerant, to be loving, to be understanding, able to forgive and able 
to treat other people as we would treat ourselves. We grew up 
knowing that we had to treat our fellow human beings in a very 
caring manner and that we should be tolerant.
<P>
	At the same time we were taught these lessons, we were taught 
songs while being unaware of their meanings. One song we used to 
recite to each other was ``eeny, meeny, miny, mo''. If anybody 
knows that song they will know it has some very discriminatory 
words toward black people.
<P>
	At that time there was some conflict between the Inuit, the 
Chippewan and the Cree to the south of us. The teachings were that 
the Indians to the south of us were savages. We believed our 
teachers because they were good Christian missionaries.
<P>
	I should not and cannot brand all Christians the same way, but 
some of the most hypocritical and intolerant people were good 
Christians, or supposedly good Christians. That hurts. We were 
taught all those things by the same people who said that our fellow 
human beings to the south were savages or they taught us a song 
which at the time we did not know was discriminatory. We realized 
this, fortunately, and most of us did not take those teachings along 
with us when we grew up.
<P>
<B>(1520 )</B>
<P>
	The member for Nanaimo-Cowichan said we should all be 
treated equally. How does he reconcile that statement with his 
comment that if a person were of a different sexual orientation than 
everybody else, if he were a homosexual, the hon. member would 
put him at the back of the store? How would he reconcile those two 
views? It is impossible.
<P>
	It seems we have to convince, at least teach the people-

	<B>Mr. Ron MacDonald (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister 
for International Trade, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, this is a debate that 
has waited many years to take place in the Parliament of Canada. 
The input of the speakers in debate will leave a clear impression 
with Canadians about how basic rights have been supported by 
each party. I am sure that during the course of debate some 
members may feel uncomfortable with the positions that have been 
put forward.
<P>

<P>
	The member from the eastern Arctic who just spoke is a 
testament to the fact that in our Canadian political system, in 
particular in our party, we have evolved to understand the 
important role that must be played by people who do belong to 
minority groups.
<P>
	The member from the eastern Arctic epitomizes the fact that 
Parliament is a better place when we are more tolerant. Parliament 
is a better place when we actively pursue and take down barriers to 
participation by individuals who are different from us. By ``us'' I 
mean on average those people of European descent, French and 
English.
<P>
	It is crystal clear that the contributions to debate by this member 
in the seven years I have been in the Chamber have added to the 
sense of understanding that diversity brings to the greatness of this 
country.
<P>
	There may not be a member here who would understand more 
than the hon. member for Nunatsiaq, as he comes from the far 
north, what it must feel like to be viewed as different. It is 
imperative to understand that an individual is judged not by the 
colour of their skin, not by their ethnic heritage, not by their sexual 
orientation but by their worth as an individual.
<P>
	I commend my colleague and my very dear friend for bringing to 
the House that sense of diversity and greatness which must be 
preserved and which in many cases is present in the amendments 
brought forward today.
<P>
	I thank him for his contribution to this debate and encourage him 
to continue to stand up for Canadian rights, minority, majority or 
whatever else they may be.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Anawak:</B> Mr. Speaker, it is always a pleasure to hear other 
members speak about the kind of work we are trying to do. I feel it 
is a privilege and honour to be here. However, just because we are 
here, just because we have been elected, we should not stop trying 
to make the world go right, even if it is a real struggle to do it.
<P>
	At least we are doing our bit by dealing with the amendment to 
the Canadian Human Rights Act on the issue of sexual orientation. 
I will go all out on behalf of those people who are discriminated 
against because of their sexual orientation and will do what I can do 
for them.
<P>
<B>(1525)</B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> Could I ask the hon. member for 
Rimouski-Témiscouata if she is going to share her time with 
someone else? You will be talking for 20 minutes, that is fine.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Témiscouata, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am pleased to take part in the debate on Bill C-33, an act 
to amend the Canadian Human Rights Act. This bill adds a 
fundamental right to the existing list.
<P>
	When the legislation will take effect, it will no longer be 
possible to discriminate against a person on the ground of sexual 
orientation. Should a person be victim of such discrimination, he or 
she could bring a suit under the Canadian Human Rights Act, 
which is amended by the bill.
<P>
	Such action by the government was long overdue. It was time for 
the government to take its responsibilities, given the commitments 
made during the 1993 election campaign. In the famous red book, 
to which the government constantly refers these days, the Liberals 
promised greater recognition and protection of gays and lesbians. 
The leader of the Liberal Party formally pledged, in a letter, to 
recognize sexual orientation as the eleventh prohibited ground of 
discrimination under the Canadian Human Rights Act.
<P>
	The government was, of course, helped by the work done in the 
other place, which passed Bill S-2. One has to wonder whether the 
government would have taken action, had it not been for the 
initiative of the Senate, the other place. The government was 
probably ashamed to see a Conservative senator, and the Senate as 
a whole, go ahead with a bill amending the Canadian Human 
Rights Act. Of course, the legislation passed by the Senate will be 
dropped when the House of Commons passes its own legislation. In 
any case, it was more than urgent to act.
<P>
	Recognizing that a person has a right does not take anything 
away from others. It is about time we recognized that, while we are 
all born equal, some people suffer from discrimination because 
they do not have the same sexual orientation as others.
<P>
	Some believe, and others would want us to believe, that to 
recognize this fundamental right is to promote homosexuality as a 
way of life. It is high time for Canadian society to stop burying its 
head in the sand and to recognize a fact of everyday life in our 
society. Whether we like it or not, there are, in our society, people 
who are homosexuals and people who are heterosexuals. It is 
something we have to live with, and recognizing this right is not the 
end of the world as a number of societies already do so.
<P>
	According to a survey, 70 per cent of Canadians are ready to 
accept, even to support, legislation prohibiting discrimination 
based on sexual orientation. Those opposed go against a vast 
majority in our society, as 70 per cent of Canadians want this 
legislation.
<P>
	The time had come to act as, on March 18, 1994, the Minister of 
Justice said this in response to a question from the hon. member for 
Hochelaga-Maisonneuve, and I quote: ``Speaker, in its campaign 
for office, in its throne speech and in statements made subsequently 
in the House, the government has committed itself to amendments 
to the Human Rights Act which will add sexual orientation as a 
ground on which discrimination is prohibited. We intend to follow 
through on that commitment''.
<P>
<B></B>

<P>
<B>(1530)</B>
<P>
	Although I welcome the introduction of this bill today, I will 
remain apprehensive until we know its effective date, because this 
is not the first time the government has tried to ensure passage of 
legislation in this area. Until the bill receives royal assent and is 
given an effective date, we in the official opposition at least will 
continue to follow its progress very closely so that it is 
implemented as soon as possible.
<P>
	It is, however, unfortunate that, perhaps to arrive at this kind of 
solution, the government announced a few minutes ago its 
intention to move a motion tomorrow to limit the time allocated to 
this debate. In other words, there are among us people of ill will 
who intend to drag out the debate in order to try to stop the 
government from going ahead with this legislation.
<P>
	We are in a situation where we must not only denounce the bad 
faith of some of our colleagues, members of this House, but also an 
all too frequent habit the government has adopted. Three times in 
the last four days the government has passed motions limiting the 
time allowed for debate of fundamental issues such as 
unemployment insurance, the GST and basic rights that we want 
our citizens to have. It is a bit of a disgrace.
<P>
	There is something else, which is also worrisome. In the federal 
act as it stands, which was passed in 1978, I believe-no, it was 
1975-the government did not see fit to mention that it recognized 
the family as the foundation of Canadian society. It is as though 
this was a novel idea.
<P>
	This time, the government thinks it wise to amend the legislation 
by adding a paragraph:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>And whereas the Government recognizes and affirms the importance of 
family as the foundation of Canadian society and that nothing in this Act alters 
its fundamental role in society;</BLOCKQUOTE>
	In itself, this second paragraph adds nothing. I think that in all 
the countries of the world, at least, in all those sharing our form of 
civilization, the family is obviously the basis of society.
<P>
	I do not know what meaning could be attributed to the word 
``family'' by judges if we were to ask a court for an interpretation 
of its meaning today, because the concept itself has evolved 
considerably over the past 20 years. When I think, for example, of 
the family into which I personally was born, that of my great nieces 
and great nephews, in many cases it is not at all the same concept of 
family.
<P>
	So, then, what sort of family do we recognize? Do we recognize 
the single parent family? Do we, in this bill, recognize the 
reconstituted family? Exactly what is this family that we recognize, 
and that now, with the addition of this paragraph, will be the victim 
of discrimination? Who, with the addition of this paragraph, will be 
denied rights? The bill talks about its fundamental role in society.
<P>
	When things are added, I wonder whether the government has 
given sufficient thought to the whole issue and why it has added 
this paragraph, which was not in the original bill 20 years ago.
<P>
	Does the government want to limit the scope of the bill? One 
could well ask. Did the government also want to reassure the 
radical right members of its caucus?
<P>
<B>(1535)</B>
<P>
	It is entirely possible. We know that a number of people are not 
shy about expressing their disagreement with this bill. The Prime 
Minister made it party line. That is fine. We will do the same thing 
on our side, but we wonder really why the government added this 
paragraph. Personally, I do not see what it adds, but I am concerned 
about the possible scope for interpretation before the courts.
<P>
	Now they say it is high time this was done. Quite extraordinarily, 
in 1976, I was a member of a bargaining committee at the 
Université du Québec in Rimouski, and we negotiated the 
following: ``Neither the university nor the union shall directly or 
indirectly threaten, constrain, discriminate against or make unfair 
distinction with respect to a professor for reasons of nationality; 
ethnic, linguistic or racial origin; beliefs; age; sexual practices or 
orientation; sex; physical state; pregnancy; marital status; political 
or other actions or opinions; the exercise of a right provided by the 
agreement''.
<P>
	This was in 1976. So, when I say the government was in a hurry 
to act, it was high time it acted and stopped promising things every 
year and with every campaign in order to get elected, once again 
under false pretences. For once, if the government goes all the way, 
and this bill is given royal assent, we will be able to say that at least 
one promise was kept.
<P>
	It was also high time because each province is responsible for 
the rights and liberties it accords its citizens. The Quebec charter of 
rights included sexual orientation in 1977. Since then, eight 
provinces, with the exception of Alberta and Prince Edward Island 
have changed their own legislation to prohibit sexual orientation as 
a ground for discrimination.
<P>
	In 1978, that is, 18 years ago, the Liberal Party made-perhaps 
there was no red book at the time, perhaps that is why it got lost in 
the meanderings of the government-non discrimination against 
homosexuals an integral part of the Liberal Party program.
<P>
	In 1985, there were unanimous recommendations on this by a 
House subcommittee. In 1993, Mr. Chrétien had made his promise, 
and on October 18, 1994, the Minister of Justice had indicated he 
might present amendments to the Canadian act in the fall of 1994, 
but it came about in spring of 1996. Perhaps when the snow melted 
they found the red book page that referred to the promise to 
introduce this bill.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2148"> 2148 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> Definitely, it was lost in a snow bank.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Tremblay (Rimouski-Témiscouata): </B>There was a bill in 
1992, Bill C-108, that died on the Order Paper. But at that time the 
Ontario Court of Appeal declared, in the Haig case, that the 
Canadian Human Rights Act was to henceforth be interpreted and 
enforced as if sexual orientation were one of the prohibited grounds 
of discrimination set out in the act.
<P>
	In 1993 there was Bill S-15. This time the Senate was not very 
effective, perhaps because of the elections, I do not know, but the 
bill died on the Order Paper. We all know about the Egan and 
Nesbit case, in which the nine Supreme Court judges agreed that 
discrimination based on sexual orientation contravenes the clause 
on equality rights in the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.
<P>
<B>(1540)</B>
<P>
	More recently, we heard about commissioner Yalden's 
recommendation that the government take action in this area. He 
had been repeating the same recommendations for the last nine 
years and the government had still not taken any action in this area. 
He even pointed out that all seven justice ministers he had known 
had backed down when time had come to act.
<P>
	Given your experience, Mr. Speaker, you know even better than I 
do that several justice ministers went on to become prime 
ministers. They could have had this legislation passed when they 
were prime ministers, but did not do so. They made that promise as 
justice ministers because they had to do something in that capacity. 
However, once they became prime ministers, probably under the 
weight of responsibilities, they forgot their promises.
<P>
	In his annual report tabled on March 19, 1996, not so long ago, 
the commissioner had no choice but to recognize the federal 
government's inaction. Unlike the Commissioner of Official 
Languages who describes the kind of hypothetical reality he would 
like to see in Canada, this commissioner is not afraid of reality. The 
human rights commissioner is not afraid to look reality in the face 
and to acknowledge the federal government's inaction. Well, the 
government has finally made a move. This commissioner deserves 
our thanks for his good work.
<P>
	He even accuses the Liberal government of not having the 
courage of its convictions. I have to admit that it finally summoned 
up the courage to take action, with the reservation I made a little 
earlier about the second paragraph he added to the act. The 
commissioner feels that, in the present situation, Canada has no 
lessons to give to other countries.
<P>
	We will not repeat everything the commissioner said. Among the 
many interesting points he made, I would like to quote something 
he said in an interview he gave on March 19, 1996: ``All I am 
saying is that it must be  done. The courts have said so. In some 
countries to which we like to compare ourselves, this has already 
been done. This government and its predecessors have promised to 
do so. What we are saying is that the time has come to act''. I hope 
we will have enough time to see this through, and that is what 
concerns me.
<P>
	For example, if the Prime Minister felt like calling an election, 
this bill would die on the Order Paper. It might get lost on the way 
from this House to the other House. Although the other House has 
passed its own bill in this area, it might take some time before it 
takes action in that regard. The summer break is getting closer and 
leaving a bill pending is always cause for concern.
<P>
	As it did for another bill, the government could also decide to 
refer it to the Supreme Court to see if it is constitutional. One never 
knows; the government has a lot of tricks in its bag when the time 
comes to take definitive action. We still have to see how this will 
go over in the Liberal caucus, how right-wing members of the 
government party will behave.
<P>
	I think this bill is a matter of human dignity, justice, equity and 
tolerance. These are the key values of society in Canada and 
Quebec, and I think we will all be better off when Canadian 
legislation includes provisions to protect all members of our 
society, because we all have equal rights.
<P>
<B>(1545)</B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
human rights amendment under Bill C-33 is a very divisive issue 
among all members of Parliament. It has been described as two 
little words to include sexual orientation in the Canadian Human 
Rights Act as a prohibited ground for discrimination.
<P>
	If it is just two little words, why is there so much acrimony in 
this place? Why is the public reacting so strongly? Why are people 
in this place who were my friends and colleagues no longer 
speaking to me? It is because I have a different position.
<P>
	Why have so many people come to me and accused me of 
discriminating against some group because I have a position? Why 
have so many people demonstrated intolerance toward my position 
when they are trying to promote tolerance?
<P>
	A lot of misinformation has gone into this debate so far today. 
People have said things, using carefully worded statements and 
clichés, that tend to evoke emotion and applause. If it was just two 
little words, if it was simply to incorporate into the Canadian 
Human Rights Act what the courts have already said it interprets as 
being there even though it is not, it is not just two little words. It is 
much more.
<P>
	Policy by its very nature is discriminatory. In Canada, all are 
equal under the law. Over time, policy changes  have created a 
complex network of exceptions that extend special status to certain 
groups or individuals. The extension of any significant special 
status has been a reflection of society's need to ensure its survival 
and positive development.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2149"> 2149 </A></B>
<P>
	To give an example, the laws of Canada discriminate in favour of 
aboriginal people. They discriminate in favour of seniors. They 
discriminate in favour of children and families. They discriminate 
in favour of those who do not make as much money as others by 
our rules.
<P>
	Policy, by its very nature, is discriminatory. This is positive 
discrimination, reflecting certain circumstances. It is not negative 
discrimination. That is the crux of the issue.
<P>
	The traditional family being father, mother and children has been 
the beneficiary of many policy developments over the years. We 
discriminate against all others by policies that declare special 
status for the family, which indeed is part of the preamble of this 
bill. We further extend to family extra benefits not available to 
single Canadians or those living in other than a traditional family 
relationship.
<P>
	Examples of those benefits extended to the family include such 
things as survivor pension benefits. Immigration rules allow 
special treatment for family reunification and sponsoring couples. 
There is a tax credit for a stay at home spouse. There are child tax 
benefits and a child care expense deduction. There are many 
examples of how federal laws discriminate in favour of the family 
or, as others would say, how we discriminate against others on the 
basis of some characteristic.
<P>
	The question of discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation 
continues to be debated. However, in the light of the foregoing, the 
question may be very fundamental. Do we want to continue to 
discriminate in favour of the family? That is the question. Once 
answered, the actions to be taken will come into focus.
<P>
	If society continues to hold the family in high esteem and 
reaffirms its special status, we will choose to continue to 
discriminate in favour of the family. That also means that we 
cannot amend the human rights act to make sexual orientation a 
prohibited ground for discrimination. To do so would deny the 
family its special status by providing a legal basis for others to seek 
and obtain the same special status and benefits extended to the 
traditional family.
<P>
	If, on the other hand, society no longer supports the special 
status for the family and no longer wishes to discriminate in favour 
of the family, there are two options to address the change in our 
societal value. One option would be to eliminate all discriminatory 
benefits extended to the family. This approach effectively would 
seek to put all Canadians on the same footing, regardless  of what 
type of relationship, if any, one might have chosen.
<P>
<B>(1550)</B>
<P>
	We simply would be treated under all the laws of Canada as 
individuals without dependents. Various laws would have to be 
changed and nothing would be relevant beyond the individual and 
their individual rights. The definition of the family would cease to 
have relevance and many Canadians would cease to receive 
discriminatory benefits. The impact on people and the finances of 
the country are obvious.
<P>
	The second option would be to amend the human rights act to 
make sexual orientation a prohibited ground for discrimination. 
This would provide, I believe, the legal basis for challenges to all 
the laws of Canada, particularly as they relate to the special status 
of the family and the special benefits extended to them and denied 
to others. The Supreme Court decision in the Egan case referred to 
the concept as ``permitted discrimination'' but the human rights 
amendment would solve that interpretation.
<P>
	It is also likely that other Canadians who do not share the special 
status of the family will also make challenges to our laws to seek 
the same level and value of benefits. Ultimately, all Canadians will 
be eligible for all benefits now enjoyed by the family and anyone 
else. We would, in fact, be equal under the law and all would 
receive equivalent benefits extended by any and all government 
policies. To do otherwise would discriminate against someone. 
Again, the impact on people and finances would be clear.
<P>
	Discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation is most often 
discussed in a negative context of denying or violating rights. 
Common examples of this discrimination are related to 
accommodation, services, employment or membership in an 
organization. These cases generally refer to matters between an 
individual and a group or other individual. As members know, 
these are all under provincial jurisdiction and are specifically 
covered by the provincial human rights laws.
<P>
	The Canadian Human Rights Act relates to everything under 
federal jurisdiction, including criminal law, pensions, divorce, 
health, immigration and income taxation as well as those 
companies, about 10 per cent, who are covered under the federal 
labour legislation. In the main, discrimination in these areas refers 
to a matter between the individual and the government rather than 
with another individual.
<P>
	We are all equal under the law according to the charter and 
crimes motivated by bias, prejudice or hate already warrant stiffer 
penalties pursuant to Bill C-41. An amendment to the federal act 
which would add sexual orientation as a prohibited ground for 
discrimination would likely require fundamental rethinking of our 
societal values. If we positively discriminate in favour of  the 
family, we must by definition be negatively discriminating against 
all others on the basis of some status or choice of marital status. 
The question ultimately becomes, is it possible to control or limit 
the consequences of making the proposed amendment to the human 
rights act?
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2150"> 2150 </A></B>
<P>
	I would like to refer to a letter received by all members of 
Parliament from the Canadian Conference of Catholic Bishops. In 
it the archbishop indicates the principles and concerns of the 
Conference of Catholic Bishops while supporting the fundamental 
human rights and recognizing that everyone is to be treated with 
dignity and respect. He registers a concern that the proposed 
amendments will facilitate claims for same sex benefits. The 
bishops have asked, can we deal with the same sex benefits issue?
<P>
	The chairman of the Human Rights Commission, Max Yalden, 
said in his March 1996 report that if we give a benefit to a 
heterosexual couple and deny it to a same sex couple, that is 
discrimination. The amendment refers to discrimination. The issue 
of same sex benefits refers to discrimination. There is clearly a 
linkage here which causes me some question, causes me some 
doubt, causes me reasonable doubt.
<P>
	I want to conclude my remarks by speaking directly to the Prime 
Minister. Mr. Prime Minister, can we assure Canadians that those 
people who are presently exposed by not having sexual orientation 
as a prohibited grounds for discrimination that they will be covered 
but it will not extend same sex benefits? Can we tell them that the 
linkages that there appears to be between same sex benefits and 
otherwise will not cause a problem? Can we assure Canadians that 
the family will in fact remain where it is?
<P>
<B>(1555)</B>
<P>
	Mr. Prime Minister, I have questions, I have doubts, I have 
reasonable doubts and in the legal principle of Canada I cannot 
support this legislation, with due respect.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> I am always reluctant to intervene in any debate 
or statement, but with respect I would remind all members that we 
are not allowed to say who is here and who is not and speeches 
should always be directed to your Speaker.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Leon E. Benoit (Vegreville, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the 
hon. member for his comments. I appreciated many of them.
<P>
	I would like the hon. member to answer a question. I believe he 
has in his presentation, but does he believe that this legislation 
would move our society more toward equality or in fact away from 
equality.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Szabo:</B> Mr. Speaker, the member has asked a question that I 
have been asking myself. I am not a lawyer. I do not know how to 
interpret it.
<P>
	I do know, however, that in my opinion the courts have not taken 
a decision on this and refuse to. They want the politicians to do it. 
The politicians also have not made that decision. This has been 
bouncing back and forth for some time. Even in the literature it 
asks: ``Will this amendment lead to same sex benefits'' and the 
answer in the speaking notes is ``no''.
<P>
	Yet the Egan case clearly says, and implies to me in any event, 
that since it was part of the equality provisions, section 15, that 
same sex benefits were not granted to the Egan-Nesbitt relationship 
because this provision was not in the Canadian Human Rights Act. 
To me, therefore, it must mean if this provision is put in, the Egan 
case would have been successful in the Supreme Court and same 
sex benefits would have been extended to that couple and possibly 
opened up all Canadian legislation to the same challenge.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dan McTeague (Ontario, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I was very 
interested to hear my hon. colleague and friend who also represents 
a very heavy urban riding in the Toronto region.
<P>
	I want to find out if the member could substantiate for this House 
some of the rather erroneous information that has been given or 
may very well be given in the short time obviously that has been 
allotted to an issue which the Minister of Justice believes is 100 per 
cent supported by most Canadians, in that some members are 
propagating the myth that the Catholic Conference of Canadian 
Bishops somehow supports this legislation.
<P>
	I would also like, if possible, for the member to comment on 
Max Yalden's remarks when he said that any time this House 
passes sexual orientation in a bill, he will immediately find 
grounds to change all the laws in Canada to reflect same sex 
benefits.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Szabo:</B> Mr. Speaker, I am aware of the position of the head 
of the Canadian Human Rights Commission in regard to this. He 
did say in his opinion, as the chief spokesman, that this would be 
the consequence.
<P>
	This is the consequence that people have this question about, 
possibly a reasonable doubt. I have heard people say in this place 
that pedophilia is not a sexual inclination or a sexual orientation. 
Yet, if it is not, what is it?
<P>
<B>(1600)</B>
<P>
	We could have a situation where someone who has served their 
time for being a pedophile, which is a crime, is out in the 
community. Could it be that a community would be upset that a 
pedophile was living there? I think we only have to read the 
newspapers to recognize there are communities afraid of 
pedophiles being in their community. I think this causes some 
question.
<P>
	I have questions, I have doubt, I have reasonable doubt.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Steckle (Huron-Bruce, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, this 
afternoon I have the distinct pleasure to stand before  you and to 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2151"> 2151 </A></B>
<P>
speak on a subject which has been troublesome for me, as it has 
been for many members in the House.
<P>
	My colleague who just spoke represents an urban riding. I 
represent a rural riding. When we look at the demographics of 
those two communities we find that in part there is not a whole lot 
difference other than the population perhaps.
<P>
	Our role as a member of Parliament is one that expects us to be 
accountable, responsible and to be representative for the majority 
view of our constituents.
<P>
	It has always been my contention that in coming to this place I 
have never engaged in the kind of rhetorical debate we occasionally 
have in the House, something we must almost be ashamed of. I do 
not engage in that kind of debate.
<P>
	I respect my hon. colleagues across the way as I respect all of 
those on this side of the House who at times seem to differ with and 
oppose me in some of the things I have supported in the past.
<P>
	On this issue I felt it important to give support and perhaps even 
give some credence to the notion that some of us in the House, 
while not always supportive of the government view, hold some 
very strong opinions about issues. This is not because they are only 
my views or a particular member's views, but they are views 
shared by a majority of the constituents one represents.
<P>
	The sexual orientation issue has been a very deeply moral issue 
for me and for the majority of my constituents. As a member of 
Parliament it is my moral obligation and my responsibility to 
defend and maintain certain traditional principles, values and the 
dignity of sacred institutions.
<P>
	One of those sacred institutions which I strongly believe in has 
been the foundation and basis on which the country was founded 
and which has brought us to this point in history, the family. This is 
personified in the most basic form, the traditional family unit. In 
Parliament all of us in one way or another represent family.
<P>
	For some of us that has been a very pleasant experience and for 
others there are memories that we would rather forget. There are 
experiences in each one of our families that we sometimes find 
very difficult to deal with.
<P>
	The issue we are talking about today of homosexuality is 
something that is not benign to any one of us. Each one of us here 
probably has someone in our family who falls into that category. I 
am not one who believes in discrimination. I do not believe we 
ought to separate ourselves from people because they happen to be 
different from us.
<P>
	I have an example in my own family. I am proud of my family. A 
number of years ago we adopted a little girl.  She was Jamaican. 
She did not have the same colour skin as I have, but she was our 
daughter for a short time until she was tragically killed in an 
accident. I can appreciate those among us who represent a different 
culture and background, and we have among us on all sides of the 
House various people who represent those kinds of people.
<P>
	I am bothered by the preamble of Bill C-33. It raises some 
questions. If this were properly addressed it could allay some of the 
fears some of us have on this bill. It simply speaks of family and 
the interpretation of that. Perhaps your view of family is different 
from mine and mine might be different from someone else's, but I 
believe it is important that there is an interpretation given of that. I 
believe the best way for us to interpret family is to say that the 
family is represented by a mother and a father, with children in the 
home. That is important.
<P>
<B>(1605)</B>
<P>
	The question has been brought to the forefront by Mr. Justice 
Lamer who, in speaking for the majority of the Supreme Court of 
Canada, stated that if the Canadian Human Rights Act included 
sexual orientation as a prohibited ground of discrimination he 
might well conclude that family status includes homosexual 
couples. The preamble is very vague in its definition of family. 
That is a concern of mine.
<P>
	The traditional Canadian family is steeped in principles and 
values which are universal. They are at the root of every legally 
recognized traditional nuclear family unit. These families are the 
true pioneers of Canada and what is distinctly Canadian.
<P>
	Canadians are concerned about what this amendment will mean 
to the traditional family unit and the definition of marriage and 
spouse. Another extremely sensitive area is the adoption of 
children by homosexual couples.
<P>
	I am a Canadian. I am also a Liberal. I am proud to have raised a 
daughter and two sons who have rewarded their mother and father 
with three beautiful grandchildren. I hold family in high regard.
<P>
	I believe the courts in interpreting legislation have demonstrated 
a willingness to read sexual orientation into it. That interpretation 
concerns Canadians.
<P>
	All Canadians enjoy the same legal protection and basic human 
rights under existing laws. All Canadians, regardless of their 
background or preference, are concerned this amendment will alter 
existing laws to ensure full spousal rights for homosexual couples, 
including same sex marriage, pensions, health insurance, 
inheritance rights, tax privileges and immigration sponsorship. 
These concerns must be addressed specifically.
<P>
	Each member has an obligation to listen to Canadians, to read 
the correspondence we receive in our offices, to  communicate with 
our constituents, to address their concerns, to speak for them and to 
allow them to be heard in the House. Each member of Parliament is 
ultimately responsible and accountable to his or her constituents 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2152"> 2152 </A></B>
<P>
and is a product of the constituents' evaluation of their 
performance, based on the position each of us takes on very 
sensitive issues.
<P>
	The diversity of representation in the House of Commons 
through geography, culture, philosophy and tradition is truly 
characteristic of the Canadian demographic. We must provide 
leadership, even though we sometimes differ on issues, and rise 
above prejudice and the special interests to defend the integrity of 
Parliament.
<P>
	An issue of emotional and/or controversial nature can be 
curtailed by allowing each member the privilege of articulating 
their voice within the scope of Parliament, the ultimate sound 
board of national representation.
<P>
	The government has shown leadership in tackling difficult 
issues. While some may say I have on occasion voted against my 
government on sensitive issues which I felt were issues of 
principle, issues about which my constituents felt very strongly, I 
have also supported my government in almost every initiative it 
has put forward. The government has shown initiative in bringing 
our deficit into a relative state of stability. It has shown initiative in 
dealing with agricultural exports and the depletion of fish stocks. 
All of those issues I have supported, including many of the social 
initiatives which have been put forward through HRD. I supported 
those measures.
<P>
	I am here as a proud Canadian this afternoon. I am not here to 
argue with my colleagues or to debate sensitive issues. I believe we 
can find consensus. I am here this afternoon to help my government 
show leadership in tackling these issues.
<P>
	I am asking that the Prime Minister give consideration to 
allowing those of us in the House who feel inclined not to support 
this legislation, for whatever reason, to vote freely. For me it is a 
very personal moral issue. It is not just an issue of sexual 
orientation or of sexual discrimination. I believe it is in the best 
interests of the party and certainly of Parliament to allow for a free 
vote where members can exercise their democratic rights. I ask the 
House be given that privilege in the vote to come.
<P>
<B>(1610 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ted White (North Vancouver, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I feel for 
the member very much in what he must be going through in having 
to rely on someone else to let him know whether he can vote freely. 
I truly feel for him. I hope he is given permission to vote freely.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Steckle:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for his kind 
sentiments. The Prime Minister has sincerely attempted to find a 
way to allow the House to address this issue. I also believe that 
when the vote is called it is  my hope yet at this time that we will 
have a free vote. I am putting out my comments this afternoon so 
that he may yet hear it one more time before we come to that time.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Maurice Bernier (Mégantic-Compton-Stanstead, 
BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have a clear and simple question. Are we to 
understand from the comments made by the hon. member for 
Huron-Bruce that, should the Prime Minister impose the party 
line, he will vote against the bill?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Steckle:</B> Mr. Speaker, the accepted view of the House is that 
on government measures one would support the government. I 
cannot say what the Prime Minister may do but when that decision 
is made it has to be the decision of the Prime Minister.
<P>
	I have told the House, as I have told the Prime Minister and 
others within the party, that I cannot support this bill. Had there 
been some amendments giving definitions to the term sexual 
orientation or the family perhaps we could have addressed this 
issue differently.
<P>
	There would be no one in the House who would agree there 
should be discrimination based on whatever reason. For those 
reasons and because those amendments will not likely be 
forthcoming I will not be supporting this legislation.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dan McTeague (Ontario, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
congratulate the courage the member for Huron-Bruce has 
demonstrated. It is ironic that the hon. member happens to speak to 
such a wide diversity of truth within Canada.
<P>
	It is being seen that this piece of legislation has the support of 
almost every Canadian because no Canadian wants discrimination 
and our laws protect everybody. However, does the hon. member 
believe the House is not being served properly when we try to ram 
through a bill via a motion to limit debate?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Steckle:</B> Mr. Speaker, I was not in the House when that 
measure was brought forward this afternoon. I believe this matter is 
one that should have been debated at full length. I believe there 
undue hurriedness in the way we are dealing with this bill. I for one 
moment would not ever have members believe this issue is not of 
great concern to many people in the House.
<P>
	However, there are many people across the country who perhaps 
feel differently than the majority of my constituents, but I do not 
recall ever being stopped on the street in my community, whether 
on the back roads or on the streets, where someone has said to me 
we need legislation to address the discrimination against these 
people. Perhaps I do not have many of these people, I do not know, 
but I am not seeing that in my riding.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2153"> 2153 </A></B>
<P>
	I am also hearing this kind of thing from my urban colleagues. 
For some reason it seems to be coming from a small group of 
people, which is really the reason why I have not had to deal with 
this issue in the past. For me it is difficult to believe this is really 
a pressing issue for Canadians today.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, this is a 
very important issue to Canadians across the country, there is no 
question about that.
<P>
<B>(1615)</B>
<P>
	For the last couple of years ever since we have been elected to 
this place, I and certainly all members around the House have 
received all kinds of input from their constituents on this issue. 
People have strong feelings about it.
<P>
	I echo the comments of the member for Huron-Bruce. He said 
people have not been stopping him on the street and asking when 
there will be gay rights legislation in the House. I have not had that. 
I have had lots of people come to me and say something quite the 
opposite: ``When will we start supporting our families in this 
country?'' I have had lots of people come to me and say: ``When 
will we stop pandering to special interests?''
<P>
	I have had that over and over again. This is an issue that deserves 
the close scrutiny of the House over an extended period of time for 
a couple of reasons. The public square, represented certainly by 
this place, is the appropriate way to deal with controversial pieces 
of legislation. This place of all places should be a spot where we 
can debate these issues so that at the end of the day we can make an 
informed decision about where we want to go. Canadians have that 
right as well.
<P>
	We are speaking today to Canadians across the country. They 
deserve to have the benefit of the debate that should take place over 
an extended period of time from all kinds of members representing 
all kinds of points of view. That is very important, especially in the 
House of Commons.
<P>
	I applaud members across the way who are standing up to their 
government and saying ``maybe we do not agree with you, but we 
deserve the right to speak to this issue''. That is very fundamental 
in Parliament, in the House of Commons. That makes eminent 
sense. I want to talk about that a little more later.
<P>
	I want to respond to a couple of challenges the minister laid out 
this morning when he spoke with great conviction. The minister 
spoke with conviction because he truly believes this legislation will 
bring gays and lesbians into the fold, that this will make them equal 
in the country. In his heart that is exactly what he thinks.
<P>
	The minister spoke about his upbringing and about the 
convictions he has tried to pass on to his children such as tolerance. 
That is admirable. He spoke about the Catholic church's catechism 
which teaches we must treat gays and lesbians with respect and 
compassion. Again, that is admirable.
<P>
	I am willing to bet that when we stand in the House every 
morning before the House day begins and say our prayers, 
everyone says their prayers for all Canadians. They do not say ``we 
discriminate against certain groups, we will not pray for them.
<P>
	We can take the word of each person in the House. Knowing 
many of them, we can take it they believe in the equality of all 
Canadians. There is not a person in the House who does not believe 
in the equality of all Canadians.
<P>
	The question I wish I could address to the minister is whether he 
really believes when he said those things that it is the government's 
role to be compassionate to other people. I do not believe it is.
<P>
	The government can grant rights. It can grant privileges but it is 
up to people to be compassionate. The argument for equality is a 
good one. Equality can only ever come from people. Tolerance can 
only ever come from people. The only way to broaden the horizons 
of people is to sit down and have discussions.
<P>
	One of the best arguments I have ever heard for not having laws 
against hate literature came from a gay activist from the United 
States, Jonathan Rauch. He is a gay conservative activist. He said 
he hates some of the language spewed toward him but he also 
knows that sometimes the measures taken to correct wrongs in 
society are actually more damaging than the wrongs themselves. I 
tend to agree. The way to fix these problems is to have a wide 
ranging, wide open debate across the country, not jammed into a 
few days so the government can push through something. That is 
the wrong way to proceed. People get resentful when they see that. 
It actually creates division. Let us have a wide ranging debate. Let 
us listen to the conservative gay activists Jonathan Rauch when he 
says let us have a wide open, wide ranging debate.
<P>
<B>(1620)</B>
<P>
	The minister was wrong to imply the government can somehow 
be compassionate. The real answer is for people to make the 
decision that they want to treat all people with respect. The only 
way that can happen is through debate.
<P>
	The minister's comments remind me of what Jean Jacques 
Rousseau said in his famous tome ``The Social Contract'' in 1762 
about people being forced to be free. His argument was that the 
enlightened few would make the decisions and these would be 
imposed on the French and they would be forced to be free. It is a 
great irony because one cannot be forced to be free.
<P>
	These things have to be settled in the minds and the hearts of 
individual people. They cannot be forced on  people. Equality has 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2154"> 2154 </A></B>
<P>
to come willingly from people. Respect has to come willingly from 
people. It cannot be forced.
<P>
	What should we do about the people who do not go along with 
this argument? What should we do about the people who are truly 
hateful people and they say they hate someone because of whatever 
immutable characteristic? There has to be a way to address that. 
Ninety per cent or ninety-five per cent of people are respectful. The 
question becomes what do we do about the other people. There 
have to be some measures in place so that we can deal with those 
things.
<P>
	In the past we have had measures to deal with those things. I do 
not think it is a stretch at all to say some of the best government we 
had and probably the government which most reflected the wishes 
of Canadians were governments that used to use their legislatures 
as opposed to writing into a constitution the values of the people. I 
refer to the old bill of rights which was a statute law. It was part of 
the long tradition of parliaments that we have had in this country 
and also the mother Parliament in England where we have the right 
as a legislature to overturn previous decisions so that we can better 
reflect the wishes of the people we purport to represent.
<P>
	Why not go back to that way of doing things? It worked well. It 
allowed us to have the power to reflect the views of Canadians 
from across the country.
<P>
	In our haste to fix this problem people have taken what appears 
to be the easiest route. They say let us write it into law. One of the 
things that happens when we start writing it into the charter and 
ultimately into the Canadian Human Rights Act and so on, and we 
forget this, is that when we grant someone a particular right that 
means we are taking away a bit of a right from somebody else. 
Rights are nothing but power. Power is something that is a zero 
sum. There is only so much power out there. As one famous 
Supreme Court justice in the United States once said, my right to 
throw a punch is limited by the proximity of your chin. That is dead 
on.
<P>
	One of the things we have to ask is who is the power coming 
from. When we grant someone a right under the charter and then it 
finds its way through the human rights act and so on, where is the 
parallel right coming from? Where is that power coming from?
<P>
	Many members have mentioned they have a concern about the 
family. I believe some of the rights we are talking about are being 
taken from families. I will talk about that for a moment.
<P>
	The minister challenged us to follow the logic through. That is a 
good challenge and I will try to meet it. He said we need not be 
afraid of the implications of this legislation. Follow the logic 
through. I want to do that right now.
<P>
	The minister is saying this legislation will protect gays and 
lesbians from discrimination in the workplace. If that logic applies, 
what about the arguments that gays and lesbians make about the 
discrimination that is shown to them with respect to marriage and 
adoption? If these arguments to put protection for gays and lesbians 
in the Human Rights Act are valid, then they are also by extension 
valid with respect to benefits, adoption and marriage.
<P>
<B>(1625)</B>
<P>
	The same logic applies; this cold, hard logic that has no respect 
for custom, tradition, which is named rationalism. It is the type of 
logic that, although we do not necessarily see the outcome in this 
piece of legislation, at the end of the day Canadians will be very 
surprised to find that they do not like because it certainly could 
have implications well beyond what it does today.
<P>
	I think the minister really challenged us to follow the logic 
through. If we follow the logic through it goes where most 
Canadians do not want it to go.
<P>
	The head of EGALE, the organization for gays and lesbians, 
pointed out this is a first step. The hon. member for 
Burnaby-Kingsway, a gay activist and a member of this place, 
pointed out that this is a first step. In other words, it is one more 
brick in the edifice to building a new set of rights and privileges for 
gays and lesbians across the country. There have been many 
previous decisions which have moved them toward their ultimate 
goal.
<P>
	The minister is naive to suggest his words will not carry some 
weight in other legislatures, in public debate and in the courts 
across the land with respect of future decisions. He is the justice 
minister of Canada. This will undoubtedly become a law of 
Parliament especially if the government forces through a party vote 
and brings down the hard whips of discipline.
<P>
	If the justice minister's words carry some weight, and I suspect 
they do, undoubtedly they will influence other legislatures around 
the country and certainly the courts. They will add weight and give 
confidence and support to those people who want to pursue a more 
radical agenda. It is important to point that out.
<P>
	I want talk for a moment now about families overall, how they 
came to be so important in society. Over several millennia, across 
many cultures and many nations we have had different cultures, 
people who decided in many ways through trial and error that the 
traditional family as we have come to know it in this country is the 
best possible family for the rearing of children. The family is so 
important that it has been afforded many prescriptive rights over 
thousands of years. By prescriptive rights I mean by custom it has 
been granted special status in law, in custom, across many lands 
over these many years.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2155"> 2155 </A></B>
<P>
	It is important to recognize this because the argument the 
minister and some hon. members are making are outside the 
context of custom and tradition. They are assuming the cold, hard 
logic of the minister is the only thing that is important. They say 
that reason is all powerful and they have deified reason.
<P>
	I think reason is important, but we have to make our reasoned 
discussions within the context of custom and tradition and values 
and religion, et cetera. I know those things are very important to 
people across the country. I have talked to hundreds of people in 
my riding and I know how important they are.
<P>
<B>(1630 )</B>
<P>
	I would go further and say that reason alone can never establish 
values. We have to refer to custom, religion and tradition in order 
to establish values. The arguments being made today are outside 
the context of that long tradition in western civilization. That is 
extremely dangerous because there is not a single act of any kind 
that cannot be justified through pure cold hard logic and reason. If 
my self-gratification is all that is important and the common good 
does not matter a whit, then I can use reason to justify just about 
any act.
<P>
	I say to members across the way, let us have this debate about 
reason but let us put it in the context of the long tradition of western 
civilization where certain prescriptive rights have been granted to 
the family and have put it above everything else because it does so 
much good in society as a whole. We must recognize that over 
thousands of years these cultures have granted us all kinds of things 
that we treasure and hold dear, including culture and art. These are 
things we would not necessarily get from this rationalistic society 
that is being built through the use of pure cold hard logic alone.
<P>
	I point again to the great debate in Europe over 220 years ago 
during the French revolution. Rousseau asserted prior to the 
revolution: ``You will be forced to be free''. That is the direction 
members across the way, perhaps unwittingly, are going. Many of 
these things cannot be justified when they are put in the context and 
long tradition of history and culture in western civilization.
<P>
	Finally I want to say a few words about the need to have a public 
debate on this, a real debate, where members are allowed to vote 
freely and represent their constituents. I know what constituents in 
my riding think. I have asked them time and time again. People 
have said that they believe legislation like this will begin to erode 
the ability to stand up for the family.
<P>
	People ask: If the government is pursuing measures to strengthen 
the family, then why is it not changing the tax laws which penalize 
families? Why is the government not doing things for families such 
as taking the money it would send to day cares and giving it to 
people so they  can remain at home to raise their children? Those 
are the kinds of questions I get back home.
<P>
	We certainly do not get questions as to why we are not writing 
new legislation to protect gays and lesbians. People are not asking 
for that. Some groups are asking for it, but people in general are not 
asking for it. Not at all. We need to hear from all those people who 
are hearing the same message back home.
<P>
	The chief government whip is here and the government is going 
to bring down the whip pretty soon and say that we are not allowed 
to speak. We know the member from Ontario would love to speak 
to this motion but he will not be allowed to speak, which is a crime. 
The hon. member for York South-Weston was thrown out of the 
party. He was muted because he wanted to speak for his 
constituents. For crying out loud, if we cannot speak in this place 
where in this country are we free to have the debate?
<P>
	I challenge the chief government whip, I challenge members 
across the way to say it is time to let Canadians have their voices 
heard on this issue through their members of Parliament. I urge the 
chief government whip and members across the way to push their 
Prime Minister to allow a free vote on the issue of the inclusion of 
sexual orientation in the human rights act.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Don Boudria (Glengarry-Prescott-Russell, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the hon. member across the way has urged me to make an 
intervention.
<P>
	I am probably as old fashioned as they get around this place and I 
will gladly admit that. As old fashioned as I am, today we are 
discussing, to use words from the preamble of the bill, the dignity 
and worth of all individuals. On a day when we are discussing that, 
a member of this House made a statement which affects the dignity 
of all individuals, of all Canadians and even of this House. At the 
same time we as legislators are raking over the coals another 
member of the House before a parliamentary committee for 
inappropriate behaviour.
<P>
<B>(1635)</B>
<P>
	Why is it that the hon. member opposite failed to mention what 
his position was on the comments which were made by another 
member on this very day? Those remarks were attributed to him by 
the press. He never once raised the issue in terms of the dignity of 
the individual.
<P>
	It is fine for the member opposite to pontificate and ask if the 
chief government whip will allow his colleagues a free vote. That is 
fair game. However, there are things in the House which are not fair 
game. Yes, we do have freedom of speech. However, we have 
responsibility for our words.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	And that responsibility means that we must stand up and say 
what we have to say. Earlier today, a member  made comments that 
do not befit this place and he has not been seen since. Why did we 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2156"> 2156 </A></B>
<P>
not hear anything? Not even one member of his party dissociated 
himself or herself from these unacceptable comments.
<P>
	I ask the hon. member if, after making his comments and 
admonishing the other parliamentarians in this House, he will have 
the courage to rise and to dissociate himself from the comments 
attributed to his colleague?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Solberg:</B> Mr. Speaker, I appreciated and expected the hon. 
member's intervention. It was not a surprise.
<P>
	The member is saying that another member of my caucus 
allegedly said something and therefore I am guilty by implication. 
He is doing exactly what he claims the legislation before the House 
is protecting against. He is trying to paint me and other members of 
my party with the same brush because of something a member of 
our party allegedly said. That is absolutely ridiculous.
<P>
	Let me say for the record that we believe in the equality of all 
Canadians. That is not an issue. The issue is: How do we address it? 
That is the question.
<P>
	For the member to turn around and say that somehow I am not 
committed to the equality of all Canadians is utter balderdash and 
he knows it. He was using trickery in his rhetoric. He was trying to 
paint all of us with the same brush because of something which a 
member of my party allegedly said. That is wrong.
<P>
	I would ask a question of him. How does the hon. member square 
his own rhetoric on these issues with the employment equity 
legislation, which he and his government support, which actually 
grants special rights to certain individuals? Of course it is entirely 
possible that gays and lesbians will be granted special rights in 
employment equity legislation down the road. Therefore, people 
would be required to hire a certain percentage of them to fulfil a 
quota. How does he square his alleged love of equality with his 
government's own legislation?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Audrey McLaughlin (Yukon, NDP):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
previous speaker talked a lot about the family. Of course in the 
preamble the bill talks about the family as the foundation of 
society.
<P>
	Would the hon. member for Medicine Hat not agree that the 
definition by the hon. member for Huron-Bruce that a family is 
only a mother, a father and children leaves out childless couples, 
single parents and people like myself who consider our 
grandchildren and children to be our families? We know that not all 
families are perfect. Regrettably, sexual, physical and emotional 
abuse does occur within families. Would the member not agree that 
a better definition might be that loving and caring relationships 
provide a real foundation for our society?
<P>
<B>(1640 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Solberg:</B> Mr. Speaker, I would disagree with the hon. 
member for Yukon.
<P>
	First, who is going to determine what are loving and caring 
relationships? Second, I again point to some of the remarks I made 
in my speech. For over 3,000 years it has been made very clear that 
society believes and has offered prescriptive rights to an 
arrangement which includes a man and a woman, their offspring if 
any, and should somebody die or in the case of divorce, the 
remnants of that particular arrangement.
<P>
	What society wants is really what is important, not what the 
member for Yukon or some other members want. It is that long 
tradition not only in this country but in western civilization, I 
would argue the entire world, where we have afforded special 
attention and special rights in law and in custom to the arrangement 
I have just mentioned.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gordon Kirkby (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Justice and Attorney General of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
earlier there were some words attributed to the hon. member for 
Nanaimo-Cowichan. I would like to bring them forward. He 
indicated that if he had a business and a homosexual was working 
for him and was responsible for losing business that he would 
indeed think of letting him go just as he would think of letting 
anyone else go who was losing business for him.
<P>
	The member was further asked what he would do if he were a 
shop owner and a black employee was driving away racist 
customers. He indicated that he did not know but he thought that an 
employer should have that sort of freedom, that if someone was 
working for him and was responsible for his business failing he 
should be able to say: ``Hey, I do not need you in my employ. I am 
going to switch you to the back of the shop''.
<P>
	The hon. member for Nanaimo-Cowichan, a 67-year old 
former senior military officer, was asked a second time if a black 
employee would be fired at a retail establishment because racist 
customers did not want to shop there. He said: ``That one would be 
a tough one, it would, but I would have to put a black person in the 
same category I would put a gay or any other minority''.
<P>
	You indicate that members of this party are attempting to paint 
all members of your party with the same brush. Do you agree-
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Order. Before I let the hon. 
parliamentary secretary complete his question, I would urge him 
and all other members of the House to direct their interventions 
through the Chair, not directly across the floor.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Kirkby:</B> Does the hon. member agree or disagree with the 
statements put forward by his colleague, the member for 
Nanaimo-Cowichan?
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2157"> 2157 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Solberg:</B> Mr. Speaker, those are his alleged comments. Let 
me address this in two ways.
<P>
	First, I believe people should be hired and fired on their merits, 
on their ability to do the job. That is the only criteria upon which 
people should be hired and fired.
<P>
	There is a black gentleman who works for me. It is entirely 
inappropriate to suggest that our party would somehow 
discriminate against somebody because of their skin colour. That is 
ridiculous. The proof of the pudding is in the eating of it.
<P>
	That is why I believe the hon. member across the way and the 
chief government whip are not being genuine in asking these 
questions. They are simply trying to throw mud because of what 
was allegedly said. They are trying to smear members who have 
never ever in their lives done anything to indicate that they are in 
any way racist or have shown any other kind of bias toward 
anybody. It is not very genuine of the hon. member to do that. 
Frankly, the proof of the pudding is in the eating of it.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul DeVillers (Parliamentary Secretary to President of 
the Queen's Privy Council for Canada and Minister of 
Intergovernmental Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise today to 
comment on the bill to amend the Canadian Human Rights Act, 
which in my opinion will benefit all of Canadian society.
<P>
<B>(1645)</B>
<P>
	First of all, I would like to congratulate the government on its 
consistency in delivering on its election promises by introducing its 
bill to amend the Canadian Human Rights Act.
<P>
	It is vital that the consequences of amending the act be presented 
to this House, and accordingly to Canadians. There are too many 
lies, myths and half truths that have crept into the debate on this 
amendment.
<P>
	Some say that the inclusion of sexual orientation as a prohibited 
ground of discrimination will have the effect of sanctioning crimes 
such as pedophilia. This is absurd. The proposed amendment in no 
way sanctions such crimes. Furthermore they are formally 
prohibited under the Criminal Code and carry various sentences.
<P>
	I would also like to point out that the Supreme Court of Canada, 
as well as the Federal Court, have already had an opportunity to 
rule on the scope of the words ``sexual orientation'', and that at no 
time was there any question of broadening the scope of these words 
to sanction behaviour that is already expressly prohibited by law.
<P>
	One myth having to do with special rights is also unfortunately 
raging among opponents to the amendment. In fact, quite the 
opposite is true, for the purpose of this amendment is to introduce 
sexual orientation as a prohibited ground of discrimination,  which 
will protect, of course, gays and lesbians, but also any 
heterosexual, against discrimination based on sexual orientation.
<P>
	The amendment is in no way intended to confer special rights on 
a particular category of Canadian citizen. The principal purpose of 
this amendment is only to protect against any discrimination in the 
workplace. It is quite simply not a question of this amendment 
conferring special privileges, such as the adoption of children, 
which in any event is a provincial matter, or the possibility of 
granting benefits to same sex partners.
<P>
	I come from a so-called traditional, Christian family, and I 
assure you that the present amendment in no way infringes on 
family values. Furthermore, the recognition and the support of the 
government are explicitly set forth in the preamble to the bill to 
amend the Canadian Human Rights Act, which reads in part as 
follow:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>-whereas the Government recognizes and affirms the importance of family 
as the foundation of Canadian society and that nothing in this Act alters its 
fundamental role in society-</BLOCKQUOTE>
The wording of the amendment is explicit in this regard and 
confirms that the purpose of the amendment is not to take away 
from the family as the social unit in Canada.
<P>
	To those who say that this amendment should not be adopted by 
this House because it is a question of sanctioning an immoral 
measure, I reply that, on the contrary, it is a question of human 
rights. The Parliament of Canada has a responsibility to recognize 
all human rights, including the right not to be discriminated against 
on the grounds of sexual orientation.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The all-party parliamentary committee on equality rights tabled 
a report in the House in 1985 unanimously recommending that ``the 
Canadian Human Rights Act be amended to add sexual orientation 
as a prohibited ground for discrimination to the other grounds''.
<P>
	Although the Tory government at that time pledged to follow 
through on this recommendation, no action was ever taken. This 
amendment was promised by the Prime Minister in the last federal 
election and reiterated by members of the government numerous 
times since the election.
<P>
	Many recent court decisions have supported the need to amend 
the Canadian Human Rights Act. In a landmark decision, Haig and 
Birch <I>v.</I> Canada, the Ontario Court of Appeal held that lesbians and 
gays have historically been subjected to unjustifiable prejudice and 
disadvantage, and that the failure of the Canadian Human Rights 
Act to provide lesbians and gays with any protection against 
discrimination violates the equality guarantees of the charter of 
rights.
<P>
<B>(1650)</B>
<P>
	The Canadian government has spent many millions of dollars 
defending challenges of laws and regulations that discriminate 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2158"> 2158 </A></B>
<P>
against lesbians and gays. During recent years, it has become 
evident that the courts are forcing changes to end this 
discrimination.
<P>
	With every court case the government loses, our justice system is 
telling it that the equality rights for gays and lesbians are 
fundamental and that these rights must be respected. The 
government can either voluntarily amend laws that discriminate 
against lesbians and gays or be forced to do so by the courts, case 
by case, paying the associated legal costs.
<P>
	It should not be left to the courts to make policy or to rewrite 
statutes. Admittedly, this amendment has its limitations. It is a 
federal statute and therefore limited to matters of federal 
jurisdiction. It does not apply to areas of provincial jurisdiction, for 
example, religion, education or culture.
<P>
	Churches, religious organizations and schools are not under 
federal jurisdiction. They will not be affected in the way that they 
operate. Matters such as adoption fall primarily under provincial 
jurisdiction and will not be affected by this amendment.
<P>
	It does not change the definition of marriage, family or spouse. It 
does not condone or condemn heterosexuality or homosexuality. 
The amendment deals with discrimination in employment, 
accommodation and provision of services.
<P>
	In a 1994 Angus Reid survey, a large majority of Canadians, 81 
per cent, believe that homosexuals in this country experience 
discrimination at their place of work. Only 9 per cent of Canadians 
felt that there was no discrimination of homosexuals in the 
workplace.
<P>
	The Canadian Human Rights Act applies to the federal 
government as well as to institutions that are under federal 
jurisdiction such as banks, railway companies and airlines. 
Approximately 10 per cent of Canadians work for these employers. 
That 10 per cent has a right to equal protection of the Canadian 
Human Rights Act.
<P>
	Some people have asked that I vote according to the Christian 
point of view. Even if it was appropriate for me as a member of 
Parliament and for the House of Commons, Canada's legislature, to 
make laws on the basis of religious conviction, this would prove to 
be very difficult since there is no consensus among Christian 
denominations on the gay and lesbian rights issue. Although a 
number of clergy are speaking out against equal rights for gays and 
lesbians, many clergy are actively advocating these changes.
<P>
	For example, more than 125 priests from the Anglican diocese of 
Toronto signed a letter stating that sexual orientation should no 
longer be a cause of discrimination in society, especially in the 
church, that the church should bless relationships between gay and 
lesbian couples and that the church allow gay and lesbian priests to 
have the same rights as their heterosexual colleagues to  be in a 
committed, loving relationship, including the sexual expression of 
that love.
<P>
	Similarly, Canadian Friends Service Committee, a committee of 
the religious Society of Friends, Quakers in Canada, wrote to the 
Minister of Justice requesting legislation to prohibit discrimination 
based on sexual orientation, inclusion of sexual orientation in hate 
crime legislation and the entrenchment of the principle of 
recognition of same sex relationships everywhere in the law.
<P>
	In addition, during the debate of Bill 167 in the Ontario 
provincial legislature, more than 400 clergy from 135 communities 
representing 11 denominations signed a petition calling for the 
extension of the same benefits and rights to heterosexual couples to 
persons in same sex relationships.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	In conclusion, I repeat that the inclusion of sexual orientation is 
not some abstract addition for the sole benefit of the gay and 
lesbian community, some distant and isolated group on the fringe 
of Canadian society.
<P>
<B>(1655)</B>
<P>
	Gays and lesbians are members of our families. They are our 
brothers, our sisters, our mothers, our fathers, our relatives and our 
neighbours. Would we want to see these people discriminated 
against on the basis of any sort of ground having to do with their 
very being? No. I am certain that the answer of any reasonable 
Canadian to this question will be a resounding no.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Maurice Bernier (Mégantic-Compton-Stanstead, 
BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like to begin by congratulating my 
colleague from Simcoe North for his words, and to comment on 
how refreshing it is to hear something like this. For the last several 
hours I have had the impression that we were being treated to 
speeches from each and every member of the reform wing of the 
Liberal Party, because we were hearing nothing but the opposite 
views.
<P>
	I will ask a question of my hon. colleague, but I wish to start by 
focussing on a comment he made. I wanted to do so a while ago, 
but the time allowed for comments was up. When his colleague for 
Mississauga South was making the connection between pedophilia 
and homosexuality, I felt this was what would have been called 
``gay bashing'' in any other circumstances.
<P>
	Why link the two? Is it with the most explicit intention of having 
the public believe that pedophiles are only found in the homosexual 
population? The reality is totally the opposite. Looking at the 
international sex trade, in Asia, or in areas on which there have 
been reports just recently, Santo Domingo, the Philippines, I would 
say that, more often than not, those who are involved in pedophilia 
in those countries, and who come from abroad, are heterosexuals.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2159"> 2159 </A></B>
<P>
	People are entitled to be opposed to this bill-in my opinion 
this is a fundamental right-but I would like to hear them state 
their case clearly and particularly to explain their reasons for 
doing so. When reference is made to this bill's conferring 
particular rights concerning job equity, I think people are mixing 
up two pieces of legislation with totally different objectives.
<P>
	In the case of Bill C-33, the intent is to protect the rights of the 
individual, all Canadian individuals, regardless of colour, race, or 
any of the eleven grounds for discrimination. As for the 
employment equity legislation, it is groups that are being 
promoted. This is completely different, with completely different 
objectives, and I would like our hon. colleague for Simcoe North to 
comment on this.
<P>
	<B>Mr. DeVillers:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank my hon. colleague for his 
comments and his question, even if it is not exactly a question. I 
thank him nevertheless. I think a lot of people fail to understand the 
issue with this bill. Many people, perhaps with all goodwill, are 
concerned and think we are trying to give special rights to people 
whose way of life they do not share. But, this is not the case at all, 
as the hon. member pointed out.
<P>
	We are trying to ensure there is no discrimination against 
persons whose sexual orientation is not the same as other people's. 
This bill applies as much to heterosexuals as to gays and lesbians.
<P>
<B>(1700)</B>
<P>
	This is a point many people often forget. They think the bill 
exists only to protect the rights of gays and lesbians, and that is not 
the case.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dan McTeague (Ontario, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I listened 
carefully to my colleague for Simcoe North.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	I was very interested to hear what the hon. member had to say 
about the rather unusual turn of events by which this act has 
suddenly become the most pressing issue in the land today. This is 
certainly a pressing issue in the hon. member's riding, as it was in 
1993, which is one of the reasons that we as a party did not put it in 
the red book.
<P>
	There seems to be some confusion in the House and across the 
country as to the human rights act applying only to the provision of 
goods and services. Would the hon. member not agree that the CPP, 
spousal benefits, child tax credits, employment equity and the 
Divorce Act could be technically ruled on not by the House but by 
the Supreme Court of Canada or, even better, by Mr. Max Yalden, 
the commissioner of human rights? Would he agree that at some 
point down the road these items could well be included under this 
act?
<P>
	The hon. member raised a couple of constitutional issues which 
were brought before the Supreme Court, one of them being the 
Mossop case. The court held that  once Parliament passed a bill 
dealing with sexual orientation it would affect same sex marriages. 
Could the hon. member comment on that.
<P>
	<B>Mr. DeVillers:</B> Mr. Speaker, with respect to the last part of the 
question on same sex marriages, my understanding is that marriage 
is within provincial jurisdiction. I am not familiar with the case 
cited by my hon. colleague. I am not sure at what level it was, if it 
had been appealed and so on. I am satisfied and confident that the 
amendments to the Canadian Human Rights Act to include sexual 
orientation will not affect marriages.
<P>
	I am not saying that some day same sex marriages will not be 
recognized. I am not saying whether they should or should not be. 
That is not before the House at this time. I am dealing with what we 
have in front of us.
<P>
	The hon. member also mentioned the red book. I do not know 
why things were not included in the red book. I was not an author of 
the red book. I was a member of the party and attended party policy 
meetings. This measure has been part of Liberal Party policy since 
1978. It was voted in by the grassroots levels of the party. As 
recently as last weekend the Ontario wing of the Liberal Party of 
Canada passed a motion with a large majority that this measure 
should be carried out.
<P>
	The member has indicated this is an issue in my riding. I have 
had a few calls from people who in good faith have very real 
concerns. A lot of those concerns are based on inaccuracies; they 
are concerns that will not follow from these amendments.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley East, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
would like to ask for unanimous consent to split my 20 minutes 
with the member for Ontario.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> By way of information for 
the House, the reason the member for Fraser Valley East is making 
this request is that in this case our standing orders do not provide 
for members to share time without unanimous consent.
<P>
	The House has heard the terms of the request from the hon. 
member for Fraser Valley East. Is there unanimous consent?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> No.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Strahl:</B> Mr. Speaker, I guess that is the politics of inclusion. 
If you do as the big boys say, you will get to speak. If you do not, 
you take a seat at the back of the bus. That appears to be what is 
happening here.
<P>
<B>(1705 )</B>
<P>
	In addressing the inclusion of sexual orientation in the human 
rights act, I want to first assure homosexuals that I bear no ill 
against them. They are already equal to every Canadian. It has 
already been established by the courts and I affirm that existing 
equality. I oppose their political purpose, which I think this bill is 
really meant to address, to shape political institutions to reflect 
their values.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2160"> 2160 </A></B>
<P>
	I bear no ill will toward the justice minister. I think he honestly 
believes that he is doing the right thing by introducing this bill. 
When I listen to him, and I have at length, he speaks with a tender 
conscience. He really believes this is necessary, but he is sorely 
misinformed. I will discuss my reasons for believing this.
<P>
	The inclusion of sexual orientation in any human rights act in 
Canada is not really about discrimination but about special rights. 
In 1994 in anticipation of this bill I wrote to every provincial 
human rights commission. I asked them for their evidence in 
support of the inclusion of sexual orientation in their legislation. 
Why did they do it?
<P>
	Not one provincial government offered an explanation and some 
said clearly that it was just a political decision following a political 
appeal. There were a few submissions to provincial parliaments by 
gay rights groups which inevitably told anecdotal stories about 
violence against gay men, something which no human rights code 
in the country has the power to touch. Acts of violence are already 
covered under the Criminal Code, as they should be.
<P>
	I encourage all police departments in the country to actively 
pursue any allegations of violence against or between 
homosexuals. Absolutely. If people commit those crimes they 
should be prosecuted, which is what the Criminal Code is for. 
Violence is really a red herring in this argument. It is not what the 
human rights act is meant to address.
<P>
	This bill is about special rights. As an example of the road it is 
heading down, I quote from debate on a private member's bill 
brought forward by the member for Burnaby-Kingsway on April 
16. This is what he would like us to eventually get to: ``It is not a 
discriminatory practice for a person to adopt or carry out a special 
program, plan or arrangement designed to prevent, eliminate or 
reduce disadvantages that are suffered by any group of individuals 
based on sexual orientation''.
<P>
	In other words, the member's written purpose is that he wants 
special status given to people based on sexual orientation in hiring 
and promotion. He wants it added to the employment equity bill.
<P>
	Last night during a press conference this same member made a 
very significant statement: ``This bill is one step on the road to 
equality''. It is only one step. If this bill passes I believe 
homosexuals will use it to demand the courts to include them as a 
designated group in the federal Employment Equity Act. It does not 
matter that the section about special plans I have just read is not 
contained in the legislation before us today. It will be demanded 
from and given by the courts.
<P>
	Inclusion as a designated group in the Employment Equity Act 
will give gays access to preferential hiring in the federal public 
service and crown corporations. Just as the government recently 
announced set asides on  government procurements for aboriginals, 
so gay-run businesses may one day ask for and possibly receive 
special procurement handouts from the federal government, all 
enforced by the courts and backed by this legislation.
<P>
	This group already enjoys above average education and income 
in Canada, so the bill is not in essence about discrimination. The 
courts have already declared that they are protected. This bill is all 
about special rights, about power, privilege and money. It is about a 
tiny group in our society manipulating politicians, manipulating 
public institutions to serve their own interests.
<P>
	What should we do if we do not want this to happen? We should 
stop the process right here and now. To vote for the legislation is to 
entrench the process which makes it inevitable. That is one part of 
this legislation I think many Canadians have difficulty with, but 
there is a greater issue.
<P>
	An understanding of the political process in Canada is vital to 
the complete understanding of what is happening today with this 
bill. Canada's political process is above all, if nothing else, 
incremental. Step by step, bit by bit, little by little victories are won 
until the political purpose is achieved.
<P>
	Pick an issue, nearly any issue. Take free trade. It takes a century 
to get free trade. Take abolition of capital punishment. It took a 
long time. The abortion rights movement started in the sixties and 
was not really achieved until the nineties. That is the way it 
happens. It is political incrementalism which also applies to 
changing the attitudes of North Americans toward sexuality.
<P>
<B>(1710)</B>
<P>
	Western culture used to have many sexual taboos, some good, 
some bad. The struggle has gone on now for some time, accelerated 
by the mass media and compliant politicians. The struggle is to 
eliminate the moral taboos of right and wrong as they apply to sex. 
Some taboos in our society linger but they are falling bit by bit. 
They can talk about this in the preamble, but even marriage is not 
immune to the attacks of incrementalism.
<P>
	The supreme court decided in May of last year that unmarried 
couples should be regarded as a historically disadvantaged group. 
In other words, they are disadvantaged and we should have 
programs to make sure they are looked after properly. In other 
words, married people do not get treated as well before the 
government as unmarried people.
<P>
	In the same way homosexuality used to be a taboo, but along 
with other sexual activities the discriminating labels of right and 
wrong have been removed and now only a few taboos remain.
<P>
	Last night when the member for Burnaby-Kingsway said that 
this bill is one step on the road to equality, he  gave a very concise 
and accurate summary of what I have been saying. First, the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2161"> 2161 </A></B>
<P>
amendment is just a small step toward the eventual goal. The 
member said this amendment will not achieve his goal.
<P>
	Second, his goal on this road is equality. What sort of equality 
was he talking about? The member was talking about equal access 
to housing, equal access to employment. However, these two are 
just steps toward what I think is his eventual goal.
<P>
	He is really talking about equality in all areas between 
homosexuals and heterosexuals. This logically requires that 
homosexuals receive all the recognition, all the the benefits, all the 
social endorsements which currently belong to marriage 
relationships.
<P>
	The few outspoken gay members of Parliament will never rest, I 
believe, until they have achieved the rest of the marriage package, 
including adoption, and every other benefit available now to the 
traditional heterosexual family unit.
<P>
	Last year we voted down the package on same sex benefits. The 
cabinet voted against it, but it did not matter because Treasury 
Board has moved ahead and given those benefits as the next step of 
this incremental giveaway plan.
<P>
	The process does not end there, to the more. If I can call them 
traditional homosexuals, if they can be called traditional, I 
sincerely believe they think this incrementalism will stop once they 
get a package. That package includes, marriage, benefits and a few 
things like that. However, I think they are mistaken, which is where 
the term sexual orientation is significantly different from the word 
homosexual.
<P>
	The minister did not bring forward an amendment that 
mentioned homosexuals. He brought in sexual orientation, which I 
believe will open up a can of worms, and we have yet to know 
where that may lead us.
<P>
	If we think about it, 20 years ago homosexuals were radicals who 
would not propose some of the things they are asking for today. 
However, their political dreams are coming to fruition with this 
addition of sexual orientation to the human rights act.
<P>
	Who are today's radicals? Who are the ones who are pushing the 
envelope today? They are people like lesbians from Buddies in Bad 
Times Theatre in Toronto. The <I>Globe and Mail</I>, a constant advocate 
of gay rights, said the company performed what it called an 
enticing play this last week. Yet Buddies in Bad Times Theatre is a 
group which advocates sado-masochism and rape play. Its 
members are bullies who advocate violent sex and physically 
intimidate anybody who dares to publicly disagree with them.
<P>
	Today's radicals are people like Gerald Hannon, the prostitute 
professor from Ryerson University in Toronto, who says he sees 
sex between men and boys as the  equivalent of a hockey game. 
How is he different from yesterday's radical? He is different only in 
that he takes that process one step further. In his mind the process 
of sexual equalization has simply gone one step further than the 
others on the road to the idea of equality.
<P>
	The final logical goal which will be carried forward by 
successive radicals until it is achieved is equality of all sexual 
forms. Here I quote from the statement of principles of the 
Vancouver gay and lesbian newspaper called <I>ANGLES</I>. It is a 
mainstream gay newspaper. Their statement of principles says:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>ANGLES' commitment to the goals of bisexual, lesbian and gay liberation 
includes a commitment to-the right of all people regardless of age, ethnicity, 
class, physical appearance or ability to full and equal participation in all aspects, 
including sexual, of the gay, lesbian and bisexual communities without 
exploitation.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>(1715)</B>
<P>
	To the radicals of today, every age group should have the right to 
consensual sex. Sex without age boundaries is another step in the 
movement of these radicals toward the equalization of all sexual 
behaviour. This legislation, with undefined sexual orientation, is an 
open door to that end.
<P>
	Even after that is accomplished the road does not end. It 
continues and the landscape becomes pretty bizarre, so much so 
that I will not mention some of the wilder sex acts which the fringe 
groups might currently be promoting. As fringe groups, they will 
be constantly chipping away, asking for the recognition and 
acceptance of their particular style.
<P>
	Today many of the speakers are talking about homosexuality. 
That is not what the bill says. The bill says sexual orientation. 
Tomorrow we may face a question about sex between adults and 
children, about incest and about negative forms of sexual 
expression. It is hard to say what may happen down the road. The 
undefined term sexual orientation is being placed into the hands of 
radicals. They could drive a legal truck through it.
<P>
	Witness after witness who appeared before the Standing 
Committee on Justice and Legal Affairs confirmed that the 
definition could easily cover any sexual orientation. The Minister 
of Justice denies this.
<P>
	I am not being an alarmist. These are the words of John Conroy 
of the Canadian Bar Association when he was asked about the 
definition of sexual orientation: ``It could be any kind of sexual 
orientation, and it could be something that, as you say, is illegal''.
<P>
	Here is what the director of the Ottawa region of the Criminal 
Lawyers Association said to the justice committee: ``Sexual 
orientation is a crucial factor of pedophilia; a fundamental 
component of a true pedophile is his or her sexual orientation. 
Certainly sexual orientation is a key and fundamental component 
of pedophilia''.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2162"> 2162 </A></B>
<P>
	I know that many of the speeches have been about 
homosexuality. Members may not realize that sexual orientation 
does not deal only with homosexuality, it also deals with a whole 
area of unknown sexual orientation which we will not see until 
the courts have made their interpretations.
<P>
	What do we do if we are travelling the wrong way down a road 
which has a dead end that we do not want to reach? It is simple. We 
stop. If we want to stop the concept that all forms of sexual 
orientation are equal, we must stop the process by voting against 
this bill now.
<P>
	There is another problem with the bill. Many people would say it 
is a question of conscience or a moral problem. I believe the 
government will be introducing a grave contradiction in the human 
rights act by including sexual orientation alongside religion. The 
truth is, as has been noted by previous speakers, that every major 
religion from ancient times has attached some quality of morality 
to sexual activity. There may be differences but there has always 
been some kind of moral quality attached to it.
<P>
	In the eyes of millions of Canadians, myself among them, who 
hold to the fixed belief that sexual questions are questions of 
morality, the government will now grant preferential rights to 
people specifically because of their sexual activity. The 
government is attempting to push through the bill with a soft sell 
approach. It gives warm assurances that inclusion will not lead to 
family benefits, broad definitions of sexual orientation or 
affirmative action. It is only talking about access to housing and to 
jobs. That is untrue.
<P>
	The government is trying to slide this bill through Parliament on 
a bed of smooth words. After that we will have to live with the 
consequences of those words.
<P>
	Because of this amendment, religion and sexual orientation will 
come into conflict, as homosexuals and other groups demand that 
their definition of morality be included in every aspect of life. The 
rights of religious groups and individuals and the freedom of 
federal structures to be guided by traditional moral values will be 
eroded. I am talking about everything from taxation to government 
programs to our system of marriage and family law.
<P>
	Whose rights will suffer when these two opposing world views 
come into conflict? What will happen when a preacher says on the 
radio that homosexuality is wrong, that it is immoral. Will he be 
taken before the CRTC and told to stop preaching because it is 
wrong? Such accusations have already been brought and will be 
brought again.
<P>
<B>(1720)</B>
<P>
	What will happen when a Christian television station is denied a 
licence because of its belief about homosexuality? What if 
someone just says it is wrong? This is a matter of freedom between 
the two opposing  views. Regardless of which side we take, 
someone will have to decide. The courts will have to pick a winner 
out of that situation.
<P>
	When that happens I wonder to whom the religious groups will 
appeal when they are denied a right to their own beliefs. Whether 
one agrees with them or not, what will happen? Will they appeal to 
the Canadian Human Rights Commission? I do not think so 
because the Canadian Human Rights Commission will say that 
there is a contradiction here and that it is going to have to choose 
between the two.
<P>
	It has already happened where people are afraid to take action 
and say things that they would otherwise say because of fear of 
reprisal, of people using the weapon of the Canadian Human Rights 
Commission. Because of court cases and so on, people are already 
wondering if it is all right to say what they really believe in their 
hearts or do they have to couch it through the filter of the Canadian 
Human Rights Commission.
<P>
	Those who push for inclusion use two great weapons in their 
battle. The first one they use is scorn by saying: ``What can it hurt 
to give me this little freedom? What are you afraid of? What is the 
matter with you?'' This is their first weapon.
<P>
	The second weapon they use is trying to impugn shame by 
saying that you are guilty of wrongful discrimination. In other 
words they are saying: ``How can you call my behaviour wrong? 
You are arbitrarily discriminating against my choices''. Implicit in 
those accusations is that everything is equal under the sun and all 
people will do whatever is right and have a good day doing it.
<P>
	However, I will not be scorned in pointing toward the end of the 
road that I believe this government is taking us. I am not ashamed 
to say that I do not believe that all sexual behaviours are equal. I 
think many people on both sides of the House today have already 
explained their concerns. They do not want persecution of 
homosexuals, nor do they want some kind of a witch hunt against 
people. They are saying that they have concerns about the 
traditional family unit and about the shrinking batch of benefits, 
the declining amount of money that is available for benefits that 
will be spread out to a greater number of people.
<P>
	People have legitimate concerns and for that reason, and this is 
certainly the place to bring it up, I believe that not all sexual 
behaviours are equal, certainly when it comes to benefits and so on.
<P>
	The concept that has built this nation is the traditional family 
unit. I believe the member for Yukon said that was not true and that 
what we should say is that loving, human relationships are the 
founding unit of society. I disagree. I say it is the structure of the 
family where a monogamous husband and wife have children 
together and provide a loving and caring place of nurture for  those 
children. That provides the best basis for society to have children 
who are well-adjusted and can take their proper place in society.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2163"> 2163 </A></B>
<P>
	Obviously this system breaks down but it is not wrong to say that 
is the ideal we should be trying for. In that sense the nuclear family 
has been tried and tested for years and years.
<P>
	As I said at the start of my presentation, I believe that the justice 
minister has a tender heart on this issue. If I truly believed that this 
amendment was merely about discriminatory hiring practices in the 
federal government, something for which there is no rampant 
evidence, I would support it. However, this bill is all about special 
privileges. It is about taking one more step down a dark, uncharted 
path toward the acceptance of all behaviour. It is about removing 
the freedom to publicly promote matters of religious conscience 
without fear of reprisal.
<P>
<B>(1725 )</B>
<P>
	It was once said that the government has no place in the 
bedrooms of the nation, but there are groups that have worked hard 
to force this issue on to the political agenda. I would tell them that 
their bedrooms have no place in the government of this nation.
<P>
	I urge all hon. members to think twice before supporting this bill. 
The rights that have been talked about here are not a small, narrow 
door. They are a broad door that leads us to an unknown path.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Sue Barnes (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
National Revenue, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have listened and I am 
trying to understand because the hon. member who has just spoken 
is an honourable man. I have had conversations with him many 
times over the last two and a half years and I know that to be the 
case.
<P>
	What troubles me in this debate is that situations will arise for 
real people. Those real people will be our brothers and sisters, our 
children, our friends and our co-workers. We know that most 
people feel that in the workplace there should not be 
discrimination.
<P>
	I am aware that one of the other hon. colleagues talked about it 
being okay to discriminate in the workplace based on somebody's 
sexual orientation. I ask my hon. friend this question. If it was your 
child who faced this discrimination, where would you tell them to 
go? What would you do?
<P>
	If you cannot look to the law of the land, where would you go-
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Please, while I am on my 
feet, let me take the opportunity-I do not get much exercise-to 
tell the hon. parliamentary secretary that interventions have to be 
made through the Speaker. It comes to light particularly when we 
discuss matters about which members hold very strong 
convictions. By their nature, they can be very controversial. I 
encourage members to make their interventions through the Chair.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Barnes:</B> I apologize. I will do that. It is as you have stated. 
I would ask my hon. colleague to tell me what he would do if he did 
not have this non-discriminatory law as the law of the country.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Strahl:</B> Mr. Speaker, I already mentioned at two or three 
places in my speech because I wanted to be very clear, that I do not 
believe that Canadians, certainly not myself and certainly not our 
party, will accept discrimination against people who have a job, 
wherever that job might be. They could be sales clerks or whoever.
<P>
	We say that the hiring and firing of people should be based on 
merit. If they can do the job, then that should be the criteria. We 
have said that consistently. Any statements to the contrary are 
simply untrue.
<P>
	When it is a statement of intent for what we would like to see for 
Canada, on everything from immigration to hiring practices to 
policies of the federal government Reformers believe that it should 
be racially neutral, colour blind and gender blind. It should assume 
that all people are equal before the law.
<P>
	When they are not treated equally then they should have the 
opportunity, and they do, to take the matter to a court and say: ``I 
have been discriminated against based on my gender, my 
colour-'', or whatever, and, ``They would not rent me an 
apartment because I am black''.
<P>
	When that happens, I say throw the book at them. They cannot be 
discriminated against. That is something that we have been 
consistent about.
<P>
	One has to use these words carefully because maybe they have 
been overused. How many of us, I would think probably on both 
sides of the House, have used the words of Martin Luther King, Jr. 
who said: ``I dream of a day when the sons of former slaves and the 
sons of former slave owners can sit down together at the table. I 
dream of a day when my son will be judged, not on the colour of his 
skin but on the content of his character''.
<P>
	Let us move away from the idea of grouping people, selecting 
them out and categorizing them, putting them in slots, in pigeon 
holes and designing programs based on something that cannot be 
changed. If we were to treat one another equally, we would be far 
ahead of what we have here before us today. I urge all members to 
think in terms of the equality of all Canadians, not in terms of 
dividing up people in groups.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> It being 5.30 p.m., the House 
will now proceed to the consideration of Private Members' 
Business as listed on today's Order Paper.

	<B>Mr. Alex Shepherd (Durham, Lib.)</B> moved that Bill C-215, an 
act to appoint a taxation ombudsman and to amend the Income Tax 
Act to establish certain rights of taxpayers, be read a second time 
and referred to a committee.
<P>
	He said: Mr. Speaker, it is a great pleasure today to finally have a 
private member's bill brought before the House. I regret it is not a 
votable bill but that is the way of this place.
<P>
	This bill originally was part of a larger package of the general 
concept of tax reform. Another private member's bill which is also 
in the hopper talks about changing the accountability of 
government legislation and how we cost government programs 
coming before the House. Another portion of the bill was to deal 
with the capacity of individuals in this country to sustain tax 
increases, in other words, to put an upper limit on the amount of tax 
to be extracted from people.
<P>
	I do not think I have to tell the House that Canada has one of the 
highest taxation administrations in the world. I think it is second 
only to France in the western world. This is causing a great strain 
on our economy. It is causing a significant reduction in disposable 
income and the ability of people to purchase and create a robust 
economy.
<P>
	My background is in accounting. I am a chartered accountant 
and practised in the taxation area for 25 years. I advised clients and 
dealt with their tax matters with Revenue Canada. My father and 
many of his associates also worked for Revenue Canada and were 
tax auditors. I have an understanding of how the taxation system 
works and how the administration of Revenue Canada operates.
<P>
	The Canadian Taxpayers Federation, which represents taxpayers 
throughout Canada, has said that it would be well served to have 
this kind of legislation outlining the basic rights of taxpayers. 
There is a wide base of support for this kind of legislation.
<P>
	We were debating in the House today a Canadian human rights 
amendment which is to prevent discrimination against certain 
groups in our society. It is surprising that we have not taken the 
time to consider a significant minority group in this country, the 
taxpayers. There are over 13 million taxpayers in Canada. 
Surprisingly they have very few fundamental rights. In its guide, 
Revenue Canada has about 240 words on the rights that taxpayers 
have. They are mainly platitudes and there is not a lot about how 
one gets restitution if the system does not work.
<P>
	The people at Revenue Canada are basically fair minded. As a 
general principle I have found them to be concerned about the 
issues of Canadian dignity and so forth. Having said that, the 
reality is our tax collection system has been pushed to where it is 
trying to extract the maximum amount of money it can within its 
constitutional parameters. From time to time people in the 
department cross the line. In their desire to extract money from 
people they infringe on the individual rights of people.
<P>
<B>(1735 )</B>
<P>
	I call it Caesar. As a matter of fact those people watching out 
there are going to see the hand of Caesar in the House today. We 
can actually see the hand of Caesar represented in some hon. 
members who are going to speak against it. I respect the rights of 
my colleagues but it is surprising that a number of people will 
defend that Revenue Canada considers some of the concerns of 
private individuals.
<P>
	The United States already has a taxpayers bill of rights. Senator 
Pryor brought forward legislation in 1988. It has now been 
amended a second time in the United States.
<P>
	The United Kingdom has a taxpayers ombudsman as does New 
Zealand and many Scandinavian countries. You can see this is not a 
novel concept. In fact it has been accepted in most other tax 
jurisdictions except Canada. Do we need this kind of legislation? 
Do we need to protect taxpayers? I will give some examples of 
what I am talking about.
<P>
	In my riding there is a woman named Cheryl Sassville who is a 
single mom. She was dinged for not paying tax on her child support 
payments, a common problem with many single mothers. She came 
to an arrangement with Revenue Canada that she would pay it off 
over a prescribed period of time. This lasted about two or three 
years. She went through one collection officer and everything was 
great. She went through another collection officer and that was 
fine. She was paying as agreed.
<P>
	Then she got a collection officer who said that it was not fine. He 
was trying to make waves for himself in Revenue Canada. This 
sometimes happens. Her whole life was in balance and what 
Revenue Canada did was it seized her bank account and got $94. 
This woman had a heart attack over it and she lost two weeks of 
work. It cost her $700 and Revenue Canada never said it was sorry. 
It did not even give her the $94 back.
<P>
	Another incident which occurred recently is the change to the 
Canada-U.S. tax treaty. What has happened there is we have taxed 
seniors in this country, people who are receiving social security 
payments on American income. That might seem novel and not a 
big problem, but there are 81,000 seniors in Canada who have been 
affected by that legislation. Many of these people are low income 
seniors.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2165"> 2165 </A></B>
<P>
	There is the example of Elen Mowat, a woman who was earning 
$14,000 in total retirement income. About $10,000 is social 
security she gets from the United States. She was hit for 25 per 
cent in tax, $2,500 from somebody who is only making $14,000 
a year. What did Revenue Canada tell her to do? It told her to 
go and lobby Washington. Her own government told her to go and 
lobby Washington.
<P>
	A letter just came in today from a Mrs. Leona Jeremy of 
Middleton, Nova Scotia. Because our government does not take 
into account the fact that this tax occurred, her guaranteed income 
supplement is reduced.
<P>
	These people are living below the poverty line. Do we need 
somebody to take care of this problem? Can these people afford tax 
lawyers and accountants to appeal their cases? No they cannot and 
that is why I am here today.
<P>
	Another incident concerns medical exemptions. In 1991 
Revenue Canada decided it wanted to change how it was going to 
calculate the medical exemptions. The only problem is it was not 
widely distributed in the population. People continued claiming 
under the old system. In 1994 it decided to get tough with these 
people.
<P>
	Mr. Roberts in my riding had no idea that the legislation had 
changed. Revenue Canada turned around and simply reassessed 
him for $1,000 and told him to pay right now. Mr. Roberts earns 
less than $12,000 a year. He cannot afford to pay the money. There 
does not seem to be anyone who wants to listen to his problems.
<P>
	The <I>Financial Post</I> has done lots of polls on people's attitudes 
toward the taxation system. Poll after poll has said that people want 
to be part of the process. They want to have something to say and 
they want protection from some of these problems.
<P>
	These are some of the features of my legislation. I talk about 
legislated standards for audit completion. What do I mean by that? 
It means if an audit is started on a small or medium size business it 
has to be finished some day. I have seen it happen time and time 
again where an audit is started and goes on and on for years, 
sometimes two years. It ties up the whole business operation. 
People's lives are put in limbo while they are going through the 
audit process.
<P>
<B>(1740 )</B>
<P>
	My legislation also says it is up to that taxpayer who has made a 
mistake that they can avoid the six month period. The reality is it is 
up to Revenue Canada to execute its mandate within a reasonable 
time frame and to give proper notice prior to seizures.
<P>
	I have seen time and time again that small and medium sized 
businesses have had their bank accounts seized. It could be an 
error. They are not even given notice. The money is just taken out 
of their bank accounts and then Revenue Canada says it made a 
mistake. It can affect  their credit ratings. I am suggesting that the 
legislative powers of Revenue Canada need to be used moderately.
<P>
	Another aspect of my bill would give people an understanding of 
the Income Tax Act. We are constantly changing the taxation 
system somewhat randomly. My legislation says that no change in 
any one year should affect more than 1 per cent of the taxpayers 
and no cumulative changes should affect more than 3 per cent and 
that major tax changes which affect the lifestyle of people will only 
occur every 10 years.
<P>
	If this legislation were in place, people would have a greater 
understanding of the taxation system. They would learn to 
understand it and possibly even learn to respect it.
<P>
	The other thing is to prevent arbitrary cancellation of payment 
agreements. I was just talking about people over 60 being forced 
from their homes. How could anybody in the House argue against 
that? If people over 60 years of age for whatever reason, possibly 
the death of a spouse, trigger the tax liability, Revenue Canada can 
force them to sell their house. I am suggesting that the house be 
mortgaged and wait until the demise of the sole spouse, but do not 
force people from their homes. This is only reasonable in our 
society.
<P>
	Finally, I come to the issue of an ombudsman, to which some 
other speakers will probably object because the hand of Caesar 
does not want to be questioned.
<P>
	Revenue Canada has 38,500 employees which is equal to 60 per 
cent of the entire armed forces of the country, and a budget of over 
$2 billion. Within that framework 10 or 20 employees could be 
found to create an office of an ombudsman to protect 13 million 
people from the random and arbitrary nature which sometimes 
occurs at Revenue Canada. Some will say it is impossible, that it 
cannot be done. However, Revenue Canada is hiring all kinds of 
people to deal with the enforcement of the GST. Money can be 
found to do that but we cannot find money to protect the people of 
Canada.
<P>
	The House and the committee just went through the whole 
process of looking at the concept of an ombudsman for our 
financial institutions. Why? We thought that people were being 
taken advantage of by their financial institutions, by banks. The 
banks have set up their own ombudsman. As a government we 
forced them to have a national ombudsman to protect the rights of 
people. Why is it that we are not prepared to protect the same rights 
of people within our own government structure yet we will force 
the banks in the private sector to carry on with that legislative 
agenda?
<P>
	I talked earlier about the United Kingdom model. When we 
talked with the banks about the provision of an ombudsman, I had 
an opportunity to talk to the ombudsman from the United 
Kingdom. He told me the system worked very well.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2166"> 2166 </A></B>
<P>
	Some of my colleagues would suggest if we have an 
ombudsman everyone will appeal their case and the whole system 
will fall apart. There could be a screening device and we could 
monitor for clearly spurious cases where people were simply 
trying to delay paying taxes.
<P>
	The ombudsman system in the United Kingdom is a bit odd 
because it actually thinks that members of Parliament have some 
power. Complaints are put through members of Parliament who in 
turn make decisions as to whether or not there is a valid complaint. 
I am not suggesting that for us. I am just illustrating how other 
jurisdictions such as the United Kingdom and New Zealand have 
dealt with the problem.
<P>
<B>(1745 )</B>
<P>
	What we are asking for is a very simple and efficient dispute 
settlement mechanism. Some of my colleagues will suggest that 
Revenue Canada can do it all by itself. I would like to suggest that 
it has not done it by itself. As a matter of fact, a recent Supreme 
Court of Canada decision recognized that Revenue Canada had 
changed its attitude in an audit situation. It was forcing people to 
pay money which they did not owe. The court actually made a 
decision to tell these people to sit down and talk calmly to each 
other. Imagine that. I think that clearly indicates a need. The 
Supreme Court of Canada is telling us there is a need for some form 
of ombudsman.
<P>
	We have developed a litigation system in Canada. The way 
individuals solve their taxation problems is to get a lawyer. The 
people I just talked about cannot afford a lawyer. They cannot 
afford to go to Washington to protest. They cannot afford the 
$1,000 that Revenue Canada is randomly extracting from them. 
There is no place for them to go.
<P>
	Some people would say they should go through the political 
system, that they should go through the minister. Revenue Canada 
does not want that kind of intervention. It does not want to be 
monitored. It wants to have a free rein and not to be held in check.
<P>
	I feel we have to temper the hand of Caesar. It has happened in 
all civilizations. It is interesting to note a book on the history of 
taxation of the world. This book is about people who have dealt 
with this in earlier days. This is from the theodecian code of laws 
under Constantine. It states: ``If any person shall complain in court 
that payment has been unduly exacted of him, or that he has 
sustained any arrogance, and if he should be able to prove this fact, 
a severe sentence shall be pronounced against such tax collector''. 
We do not have that legislation today. The Romans addressed the 
problem and understood that people were to be treated with dignity 
and respect.
<P>
	I am not suggesting that the system is out of order and that it runs 
rampant over the rights of people as a general course of action. 
However, I have witnessed situations where it has. My legislation 
would address that. It would  give people the ability to go to an 
ombudsman to get restitution, such as Mrs. Sassville. That poor 
woman never got her $700 back. She is entitled to her $700. I 
remember that woman coming into my office in December. She 
said: ``I cannot buy groceries for my kids. I cannot buy a Christmas 
turkey''. I had to send her to the food bank. That woman's dignity 
was broken and she is owed an apology. That apology never came, 
even though I asked for one.
<P>
	This legislation would add a certain degree of dignity and 
respect to the system. People would have more respect for the 
system in the way it dealt with them. Through that process they 
would understand and believe that the system was fair and they 
would be happier about paying their taxes.
<P>
	This is only one part of a long process which I have in line. It is 
very hard to introduce major legislation to change the income tax 
system through private members' bills, but I will continue on that 
course.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. René Laurin (Joliette, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the bill before us 
today reflects the best intentions in the world to protect taxpayers.
<P>
<B>(1750)</B>
<P>
	Low income taxpayers, who, we are told, often feel singled out 
by mean taxation officials, might be looking forward to this bill, 
Bill C-215, with great hope and confidence.
<P>
	In my opinion, however, Bill C-215, which was introduced by 
my colleague, the hon. member for Durham, opens the door to too 
much abuse. This bill calls for two types of measures, both aimed 
at reducing Revenue Canada's powers and reinforcing taxpayers' 
rights against taxation authorities.
<P>
	Of course, one might think that Revenue Canada already has far 
too much power, that its powers must be reduced, while vulnerable 
taxpayers need more protection. In principle, this is true. In 
practice, however, there are ways to protect taxpayers better 
without leaving the door open to even greater inequities.
<P>
	As it stands, this bill could lead to some inequities. It would be 
dangerous to aggravate tax inequities because those who would 
benefit the most still pay taxes. The worst off are not low income 
taxpayers who can barely pay their taxes, but those who enjoy good 
incomes, who already pay a lot of taxes, who would have more 
opportunities to avoid paying taxes, to circumvent their obligation 
to pay taxes.
<P>
	We in Canada have a voluntary taxation system, in that taxpayers 
voluntarily agree to report their income at the end of every year and 
to send Revenue Canada their fair and equitable share of taxes. 
Taxpayers must calculate how much they owe by gathering the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2167"> 2167 </A></B>
<P>
information required in accordance with the law, report all their  
income, and send the government their share of taxes on this 
income. Unfortunately, the bill before us would not allow us to 
adhere to this great principle of fairness for all taxpayers.
<P>
	I am referring to clauses 2 to 7. These clauses call for the 
establishment of a taxation ombudsman. This ombudsman would 
be appointed by the cabinet for a term of seven years and might be 
appointed for another seven-year term. If we had to appoint an 
ombudsman for all the departments now in Ottawa, we would be 
faced with an army of public servants and perhaps even greater 
injustice than we are already experiencing.
<P>
	In my opinion, there are other measures that would cost less. The 
taxation ombudsman suggested here would soon, in my opinion, be 
swamped with work and complaints, because who would not be 
tempted, faced with a ruling from the department of revenue, to 
turn to an ombudsman? There would be no end of claims, 
complaints lodged with the ombudsman, who, in turn, would have 
to hire another army of public servants to look into each of the 
complaints, many of which involve small amounts.
<P>
	Current procedures allow taxpayers a means of defence. First, 
there is the initial notice of appeal. If the reassessment, as it is 
called, is not satisfactory, the taxpayer may appeal to the Tax Court 
of Canada, which itself suggests two mechanisms for handling 
complaints: one of a general nature for cases involving large 
amounts of money, and an informal mechanism for complaints of 
$12,000 or less. And it costs taxpayers nothing to defend 
themselves before this court. They can represent themselves, 
without having to pay a lawyer to do so.
<P>
	What is needed, in order to meet the hon. member's objectives, 
is for the public servants now handling our tax problems to take a 
more humane approach. Most of them are excellent people, who 
want to perform their duty, to assume their responsibilities. And at 
a time when jobs are scarce, in their day to day duties these public 
servants want to acquit themselves properly of their duties.
<P>
<B>(1755)</B>
<P>
	So, when the Minister of Revenue tells them: ``Dear employees, 
this year your task is to get as much money as possible back from 
the taxpayer'', you can imagine that they do not want to lose their 
jobs. They take their jobs seriously and they harass and squeeze the 
taxpayer to get the last drop possible out of them. Then they report 
to their superiors: ``Today, my esteemed superior, I have bagged 
five taxpayers. Two of them burst into tears, one felt he was having 
his throat cut, the other, I have his shirt here, and the last has 
vanished. So, dear boss, I did my best to bag them today. The state 
is the winner today, because I got many hundreds of dollars from 
the pockets of those poor taxpayers''. But that is not, I think, the 
object of the exercise.
<P>
	Sometimes I see taxpayers in my office. For example, I have a 
man who owed $800 in taxes. Being a small time taxpayer with a 
low salary, he reaches an agreement with a taxation employee to 
pay $50 a month until the taxes owing are all paid. Revenue Canada 
accepts the agreement.
<P>
	A few months later, Revenue Canada learns that the indebted 
taxpayer has filed his income tax and is expecting $200 back. So 
the Department of Revenue goes into hunting mode and tries to 
stop the $200 refund in order to claim it for itself, on the pretext 
that the taxpayer owed money to the tax people, despite the 
agreement that had already been reached. We tend to feel there is 
abuse in cases such as this on the part of tax officials, and rightly 
so, no doubt.
<P>
	What we need, instead of a bill that opens wide the doors to other 
abuses, is a minister who will direct his officials to use judgement 
and to treat each case of unpaid taxes a little more humanely, with a 
little more thought for the taxpayer. When a taxpayer has made an 
agreement with the department of revenue, the agreement is 
usually kept. If the department of revenue wants to make sure that 
more money is coming in, it should first go after those who have 
the means to avoid paying taxes, to have a host of experts to advise 
them on how to make use of tax shelters. These are the people they 
should go after.
<P>
	I regret having to speak against this bill whose intention is 
nevertheless, I repeat, excellent and highly laudable. But to support 
it reminds me of when we were children playing cat and mouse. I 
do not know whether you remember the game. You stood in a 
circle, boys and girls together, and held hands. When the mouse 
was in the middle, you linked arms and bent over to keep the cat 
from getting in and jumping on the mouse.
<P>
	Today, the bill lets the cat and the mouse out at the same time. So 
when the cat and the mouse are left to themselves, the department 
of revenue goes after the smallest, and you can be sure it catches its 
prey. What needs to be done is this: rather than pass legislation that 
will result in further abuse, we should make relations between 
taxation officials and the taxpayer more humanitarian so that they 
are more humane, more civilized and more at the level of the 
ordinary taxpayer.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Silye (Calgary Centre, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would 
like to compliment the member for Durham for putting forward his 
private member's bill. Also I would like to compliment him on the 
style in which he delivered his ideas. The arguments and passion 
which he used were very persuasive. It is always nice to hear 
somebody speaking from the heart and with conviction rather than 
reading a canned speech from one of his staff members preaching 
the party line, which happens in all parties. Having worked with the 
hon. member in the Standing Committee on Finance, I believe he is 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2168"> 2168 </A></B>
<P>
a Liberal who does  care about the issues and who matches that 
caring with positive and concrete ideas.
<P>
<B>(1800)</B>
<P>
	He said some things today which I definitely support and agree 
with. He talked about the audit process which sometimes goes on 
forever. When auditors come into an office, they will there for one 
or two days or one or two weeks. If they are there for very long, 
they have to start justifying their time by squeezing out every 
dollar they can. Heaven forbid they audit one place for five days 
and leave saying that this company has a clean bill of health. 
Because there is a cost to the department, the auditor has to get a 
pound of flesh. The member's concept that those audits which go 
on endlessly and which become almost a persecution should have a 
beginning and an end is an excellent idea and one I support.
<P>
	Another excellent idea is the example of proper notice. Revenue 
Canada should not be able to seize one's funds or garnishee one's 
accounts without giving notice. It is embarrassing. Most times 
there is not even the courtesy of a phone call. This is still another 
excellent suggestion to look into.
<P>
	I really liked the analogy to banks. The hon. member indicated 
that the House has passed legislation to force financial institutions 
to have an ombudsman, yet the government does not want anyone 
to check into what it does.
<P>
	The Prime Minister knows that integrity, honesty and respect for 
politicians are at an all-time low. He knew that when he sat on this 
side of the House. He promised to appoint an ethics commissioner 
to monitor any potential wrongdoing.
<P>
	Now this member has made the suggestion that we should have 
an ombudsman who would look at and review what happens at 
Revenue Canada. In that way the taxpayers, the people who pay the 
bills, who sometimes make mistakes and sometimes do not, would 
have someone to go to and actually lodge a complaint about their 
concerns.
<P>
	I know the member for Durham has had complaints and phone 
calls from his constituency and so have I from mine. I sit there and 
am helpless. I cannot do anything. I try to go through the minister 
to get an answer. A file is created and the best that I can do after a 
period of time, two or three or four months, is to get a response on 
why the decision or the actions of the department are consistent 
with the intentions and the objectives of the department and 
therefore there is not much one can do.
<P>
	I really feel that some of the points made by the member are 
excellent. These examples are worth remembering because I feel 
that we do need to look at the Department of National Revenue and 
at taxation. We need to dispel that myth and make it more taxpayer 
friendly.
<P>
	I have my way of doing it, which is a flat tax, but another way to 
make taxation and taxes taxpayer friendly is to reduce the friction 
between the taxpayer and the tax collector. Right now the only 
appeal and the only court of appeal that a taxpayer has is to hire a 
lawyer at a cost which most of the ones who are picked on cannot 
afford, to file an appeal and perhaps lose. It is a shame.
<P>
	The examples that the member for Durham pointed out, of those 
people who need help, the seniors, the individuals with low 
income, cannot get help. They are the very people who need help.
<P>
	I said earlier that this is a Liberal member who really cares. He 
has suggestions to show how he cares rather than the general rank 
and file of Liberals who say they care and just dish out the money. 
Even if it is people making $25,000 they get it, they do not care, 
they feel good, they have thrown out the money. This member 
wants the money to go to those people who need it and I 
compliment and applaud him for that effort.
<P>
	Pushing taxpayer's rights is an excellent concept. Taxpayers 
need a taxpayers' protection act, anything along those lines are 
worthwhile pursuing. I like his idea, as well, of a six-month process 
from beginning to end or Revenue Canada loses its claim.
<P>
<B>(1805)</B>
<P>
	I have some concerns, however, and I would like to point those 
out. The member from the Bloc Quebecois has touched on some of 
them. The work overload for an ombudsman in this bill, as it 
stands, could be enormous. This person would have to hire a lot 
more people quickly because there is a backlog of high level 
appeals and complaints already at Revenue Canada. People have to 
wait.
<P>
	Having another department will create work overload. That is a 
concern. It creates another level of bureaucracy. There is nothing in 
this bill that outlines how the member perceives the cost, the size of 
the department, how it would relate and put a number to it. This 
kind of activity, this recourse would probably cost the taxpayers <I>x</I> 
but the benefit to the taxpayers would be <I>y</I>.
<P>
	Looking at clause 4(2), it is perhaps giving the ombudsman a 
little too much power. He can examine any person under oath. 
These are concerns I am pointing out. Perhaps after discussion or 
constructive discussion, these things can be improved upon.
<P>
	Given the limited time for debate on this issue, the member has 
put two significant topics on the plate. It is much like the gun 
control bill. All Canadians are in favour of gun control but when it 
is lumped with firearms registration, it is an omnibus bill and two 
separate issues. We have gun control, the FAC. That has been in 
place along with firearms certificates. To introduce firearms 
registration was a a whole separate issue. It got into a whole big 
field. 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2169"> 2169 </A></B>
<P>
That was a sizeable  debate that took over a year. The justice 
minister got the legislation passed because of the issue.
<P>
	Gun control and the criminal misuse of firearms was never an 
issue. Everybody, including the Reform Party, supported that part. 
It is an omnibus bill that has two elements. Each element is 
important. Each element deserves separate debate and separate 
consideration.
<P>
	There is not time enough to cover everything when the two are 
lumped together. It is complicated to debate anything fully in an 
hour. I am glad the member had 20 minutes to explain the purpose 
and the objectives of his bill.
<P>
	As the member from the official opposition said, he commends 
the purpose and objectives of the bill but he cannot support it 
because of a number of reasons. I have some concerns with it. I 
understand the intent of the member. I agree with his intent. I agree 
with his passion. I agree that there is a need to look at how Revenue 
Canada operates.
<P>
	The officials in that department have been given too much 
power. Some of them have used the power, although not many. 
Very few do but all it takes is a few to wreck it. One rotten apple 
spoils the bunch.
<P>
	It is important to look at this. I am definitely interested in 
taxpayers' protection acts, taxpayers' rights, taxpayers' issues. The 
member knows that. I would undertake, in whatever time is left in 
this Parliament, to work with the member to come up with a joint 
bill or motion.
<P>
	In that way we could show this is a non-partisan issue. It is of 
benefit to all Canadians, all taxpayers. It would not be Liberal 
versus Reform but something that we could lobby at the committee 
that evaluates private members' bills. We should get it to be a 
votable motion and give it three hours.
<P>
	Whether it is a motion or a bill, we should have something in 
place that is for the benefit of Canadians along the lines of what the 
member wants. In some areas, I agree with him wholeheartedly. All 
that is needed is to work out the details.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Before resuming debate, I 
want to explain to hon. members my dilemma. There is only one 
hour to present this debate and there are indications of more 
members than I could hope to accommodate wanting to speak.
<P>
<B>(1810 )</B>
<P>
	I am going to rely on my instincts and consider another issue of 
debate and that is people speaking for and speaking against. It is 
just my instinct. I do not know what you are going to say before 
you speak. I am going to turn to the Parliamentary Secretary to the 
Minister of National Revenue and then I am going to come back to 
the seconder of the motion to close the debate. If there is still time 
left, I will recognize other members.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Sue Barnes (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
National Revenue, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise to speak on Bill 
C-215 introduced by the hon. member for Durham.
<P>
	This bill has many purposes, including the establishment of a 
taxation ombudsperson to protect taxpayers' rights, the repeal of 
the general anti-avoidance rules in the Income Tax Act, restrictions 
on the time allowed for Revenue Canada to complete its audits and 
limitations on the types of new taxation measures that could be 
introduced by the Minister of Finance.
<P>
	I submit that Revenue Canada has a wide array of programs in 
place right now to protect the rights of Canadians. My remarks will 
address the issue of the taxation ombudsperson since this is of the 
greatest concern to me.
<P>
	In order to assess the need for the new bureaucracy which this 
bill proposes I would like to review the mechanisms that we have 
currently in place. Revenue Canada has at least five major safety 
nets to ensure that its clients' rights are respected, to deal with 
complaints and to provide appropriate ways of resolution of 
problems.
<P>
	These include the general inquiries program; the problem 
resolution program; the service enhancement program; fairness 
legislation; and the objection process. In addition to these 
programs taxpayers can appeal their tax assessments to the tax 
courts for a final decision on any issue.
<P>
	The Department of National Revenue's commitments to its 
clients is articulated already in the declaration of taxpayers' rights 
which was published in 1985. The declaration gives taxpayers: the 
right to a fair hearing; courteous treatment; fair handling of any 
complaints; complete and accurate information about their rights 
and obligations under the Income Tax Act; an impartial application 
of the law; a presumption that the taxpayer is honest; service also in 
both official languages; and a very important thing, privacy and 
confidentiality.
<P>
	The declaration of taxpayers' rights confirms that everyone is 
entitled to arrange their personal affairs or their corporate affairs to 
pay the least amount of tax that the law allows. Clients who dispute 
assessments are entitled to withhold payment of the amount in 
dispute until a court decides the issue in essence.
<P>
	The problem resolution program started around 1986 and it 
handles problems which require special attention. The program 
budget is about $3.5 million annually. It employs 94 full time 
persons across Canada and it deals with cases which cannot be 
resolved through normal channels.
<P>
	Program co-ordinators analyse, trace problems to their source 
and determine whether each case is isolated or if it is part of a 
larger trend that needs attention. Co-ordinators under the program 
are hand picked for  personal suitability to be sensitive to clients' 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2170"> 2170 </A></B>
<P>
concerns and they can cross functional and hierarchical lines within 
Revenue Canada to solve problems. They stay with the case until it 
is solved.
<P>
	How does the problem resolution operate? Clients are 
encouraged to contact local client services staff if they have a tax 
related problem. Last year, this is an amazing figure to me, general 
inquiries answered over 24 million inquiries from business and 
individual clients. Two hundred and ninety-nine out of every 300 
inquiries were answered to the satisfaction of the caller. For the one 
out of 300 callers who still needed help they were put in touch with 
a problem resolution co-ordinator and the co-ordinator acted as the 
caller's advocate within the department to ensure full, fair, quick, 
friendly resolution of a problem, mostly without the services of a 
lawyer.
<P>
	Problems which have national implications are referred to 
Ottawa where the service enhancement committee develops and 
implements action plans to prevent the same or similar problems 
from happening again. We do not want irritants in the system.
<P>
	How is this problem resolution promoted? It is found in the blue 
pages of the phone book. It is found on the reverse side of the 
notices of assessments. The problem resolution co-ordinators work 
with individual members of Parliament to resolve constituents' tax 
problems. Within the department the front line employees are 
encouraged to identify and solve clients' problems on the spot if 
possible and to refer problems that they cannot solve to the 
problem resolution program staff. There is regular analysis of 
client problems to provide information about problems in the 
system and the service irritants we know will affect client 
satisfaction. We think this is important. We are a service bureau as 
well as a revenue collection agency.
<P>
<B>(1815)</B>
<P>
	Revenue Canada has another fast track program, the service 
enhancement program. It is used where staff finds its ability to 
provide the best service possible is hindered by an internal process 
within Revenue Canada. This program places responsibility, 
authority and accountability for service at all levels of the 
organization and it provides the mechanism by which field 
personnel, senior management and the deputy minister level are 
kept informed about situations which could result in a loss of 
public confidence in the department.
<P>
	How does it work? The mandate of the service enhancement 
program has been kept deliberately broad. It focuses on preventing 
conditions and problems and on improving the process within 
Revenue Canada, the largest government department.
<P>
	The program provides frontline staff with a way to cut through 
red tape, to the person who can come up with a proposed action 
plan outside the normal administrative procedures. The program is 
designed to prevent issues  from being side tracked or left 
unresolved. Each issue has an action plan to remedy the situation. 
Weekly reports are distributed to senior department officials as 
well as the deputy minister.
<P>
	I will now discuss fairness legislation. In 1991 legislative 
amendments known as the fairness legislation were enacted to 
assist clients of Revenue Canada with problems which arise 
through no fault of their own, which does happen in our system. It 
allows for a common sense approach in dealing with those who, 
because of circumstances totally beyond their own control, are 
unable to meet the department's guidelines or comply with its 
rules.
<P>
	The fairness legislation consists of the many provisions which 
make the tax system simpler, easier and fairer. Further legislative 
amendments were made in 1992 and 1993 with respect to customs 
and GST components of Revenue Canada besides the personal and 
corporate tax provisions. Further harmonization of fairness 
legislation is in process now for all business lines and business 
numbers.
<P>
	Prior to fairness legislation, Revenue Canada was unable to grant 
refunds to individuals beyond the three-year normal reassessment 
period. Now Revenue Canada can make such refunds after 
verifying the claim.
<P>
	Prior to the enactment of the fairness legislation, the department 
had little or no discretion to cancel or waive penalties and interest 
no matter what the client's circumstances or how the charges arose. 
The fairness legislation now enables the department to respond 
more flexibly to a client's circumstances where there is a 
reasonable cause to cancel or waive penalty and interest.
<P>
	Generally, the department will consider waiving or cancelling 
penalty and interest when circumstances beyond a client's control 
prevent timely payment or other compliance. In addition the 
department may consider waiving or cancelling interest and 
penalty in circumstances where there is an inability to pay. The 
intent of providing such relief in such circumstances is to allow a 
means of easing the burden on clients who want to comply but who 
simply cannot do so, through no fault of their own.
<P>
	We also have the objection process for clients who are not 
satisfied after discussions with officials in their tax services office. 
They would file a notice of objection with officials in a different 
branch of Revenue Canada which deals exclusively with objections 
and appeals. When this is done, an appeals officer would conduct 
an impartial review of the case in a friendly and hopefully very 
courteous manner, then contact the client to discuss the issue.
<P>
	Except for large corporations, collection of the income taxes in 
dispute can be deferred until 90 days after the department mails its 
decision. The appeals process is involved when clients are still not 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2171"> 2171 </A></B>
<P>
satisfied with the  outcome of their problem. They can also file an 
appeal to the Tax Court of Canada. This tax court hears appeals under 
two distinct procedures, an informal and a more formalized one.
<P>
	Under a new Revenue Canada commission which was 
announced by the Minister of Finance in this year's budget, 
taxation officials will have even more administrative and financial 
flexibility to deal with problems.
<P>
	It is my view that the creation of another layer of bureaucracy 
such as an office of the tax ombudsperson with the costs, the 
complexity and the personnel would be a step backwards, not 
forward. It would diminish the incentive for the department to 
resolve problems in a timely, cost effective manner as is the case 
today.
<P>
<B>(1820 )</B>
<P>
	Accordingly, I cannot support the hon. member's bill but I do 
understand the honest belief, the hopefulness and the direction he 
was attempting to put forward in this bill. I thank him for that 
energy and commitment.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Dianne Brushett (Cumberland-Colchester, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it is a pleasure to stand and support Bill C-215, an act to 
appoint a taxation ombudsman and to amend the Income Tax Act to 
establish certain rights of taxpayers. It is very appropriate to speak 
on this bill tonight as millions of taxpayers are working diligently 
to get their taxes in by midnight.
<P>
	Our hon. colleague from Durham has spent a great deal of time 
and research on this matter in the interest of ordinary citizens, 
ordinary taxpayers across this country.
<P>
	In the past two days we have debated victims rights, gay and 
lesbian rights, but tonight I want to speak for all people on the issue 
of taxpayer rights.
<P>
	I get dozens of letters a week from my constituents who feel they 
have no rights when it comes to Revenue Canada. These 
constituents tell me they are helpless to protect their income and 
assets from Revenue Canada. They tell me they often feel 
intimidated by the bureaucracy and the collection tactics of 
Revenue Canada.
<P>
	Between individual personal tax filers, corporations, importers 
and exporters, small and medium size business, Revenue Canada 
serves close to 140 million customers. In 1996-97 Revenue Canada 
will process 23.1 million income tax returns, 36.6 million child tax 
benefit payments and 32.4 million GST credit payments. Revenue 
Canada audited over 70,000 individuals and corporations during 
1994-95. With such a tremendous mandate this department needs 
to be much more accountable to the Canadian taxpayers. Bill C-215 
will ensure that accountability.
<P>
	This bill will enact the taxpayers bill of rights. We presently 
have a declaration of taxpayers rights but it is one page and eight 
paragraphs of absolute vagueness.  The taxpayers bill of rights in 
Bill C-215 is in part based on the American example of taxpayers 
rights from the United States senate in 1988.
<P>
	The taxpayers bill of rights put forward by the member for 
Durham will allow Revenue Canada to enter into instalment 
agreements and restrict the department's right to cancel such 
agreements.
<P>
	The bill will provide taxpayers the right of consistency. Major 
changes to a taxation system may only occur once in every 10 
years. Any single change to the taxation system would not affect 
more than 1 per cent of taxpayers. Cumulative changes for a whole 
year would not affect more than 3 per cent of total taxpayers. 
Taxpayers will also have the right to be protected from retroactive 
legislation.
<P>
	The taxpayers bill of rights will establish an ombudsman who 
will act as an intermediary between taxpayers and Revenue Canada 
in settling accounts and enforcement of the bill. As we heard 
earlier, perhaps this is a step that cannot be integrated into the bill 
of rights because of an additional layer of bureaucracy or extra 
costs.
<P>
	However, I am the ombudsman for taxpayers in 
Cumberland-Colchester. I see so many people in my office 
regarding Revenue Canada issues. I intervene on their behalf, I 
write letters, I make telephone calls and I go to appeal courts. I am 
the ombudsman. Is that the role of a member of Parliament? 
Perhaps it is, but somehow I think there is a better way when we 
have a department that is as large as Revenue Canada. There should 
be more accountability in the tax system.
<P>
	Where it is clear that enforcement of standing orders would 
result in bankruptcy, the ombudsman would be able to negotiate a 
settlement based on an assessment of the remaining assets to be 
paid on an instalment basis. The ombudsman again would be 
required to prepare an annual report and submit it to both the 
Senate and the House of Commons.
<P>
	Many countries have such an ombudsman. The United Kingdom 
has had one since 1974. The system has been a great success in the 
U.K. Between 1974 and March 1987 the English commission 
received more than 30,000 properly referred complaints and the 
Welsh commission received over 2,500.
<P>
<B>(1825)</B>
<P>
	I believe this bill is good for the taxpayers of Canada or I would 
not be standing here speaking on it tonight. Taxpayers have the 
right to be treated with respect and to know their rights.
<P>
	It is my hope that all hon. members will give this bill serious 
consideration and that their full support will come forward not 
tonight but at another time when we have the opportunity, as the 
hon. member for Calgary Centre has proposed, for parties through-
<P>

<B><A NAME="2172"> 2172 </A></B>
<P>
out the House to  bring together collectively a private member's 
bill that can be votable and enacted as legislation.
<P>
	It is imperative for the citizens of Canada. With the tax rate 
which we have in this country, the bureaucracy administering that 
tax rate should be held more accountable. We in this House must 
take swift action to ensure that we give Canadians a bill of rights 
which provides a sense of respect, fairness, appeal and the many 
mechanisms which the United States Senate has brought forward in 
its bill. I believe it could be somewhat reflected and copied in part.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Roy Cullen (Etobicoke North, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I will 
limit my remarks given the time available. I am very pleased to 
speak today on the hon. member's bill and his proposal to improve 
taxpayers rights. As much as I would like to support the bill, I find I 
am unable to because I do not believe it makes good public policy.
<P>
	Who can argue with the broad principles that are articulated in 
the bill as they relate to taxpayers rights in their dealings with 
Revenue Canada? Like the hon. member who brought the bill 
forward, I too am a chartered accountant. I believe I understand 
some of the challenges and issues associated with tax law and tax 
administration. I suppose my experience working as a chartered 
accountant in Bermuda which is a known tax haven has perhaps 
influenced my view of the bill.
<P>
	All taxpayers clearly have the right to be treated fairly and 
courteously when they interact with Revenue Canada, whether they 
are requesting information, arranging an audit, an interview or 
whatever. However, how many Canadians would support the 
creation of a new federal bureaucracy at a time of fiscal restraint, in 
particular when remedies are already available, as the hon. member 
for London West has described, through Canada's declaration of 
taxpayer rights and other mechanisms?
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The department was one of the first organizations to inform 
taxpayers of their rights by preparing a declaration of taxpayer 
rights, which was published in 1985.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	I will not go into the features of the declaration of taxpayer 
rights. However, it includes things such as the right to be presumed 
honest until proven otherwise, the right to appeal a decision, the 
right to privacy and confidentiality, and the right to an impartial 
review. There are softer provisions as well in the declaration of 
taxpayer rights, such as the right to courteous and considerate 
treatment, the right to be serviced in the official language of 
choice, the right to impartial application of the law and the right to 
complete and accurate information about the Income Tax Act.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	These rights helped establish a balance between legality and 
practice. This is an important part of customer services as practiced 
by a number of private and public institutions.
<P>

<P>
	Canada should be proud of the declaration of taxpayer rights. I 
am advised that since introducing the declaration in 1985 a number 
of other tax administrations have contacted Revenue Canada as 
they have developed their own declarations.
<P>
	The creation of a taxation ombudsman would transfer the 
responsibility of taxpayer rights from the administration and its 
employees to an outside agent. What message would this send to all 
law-abiding taxpaying citizens? To those who are paying their fair 
share of taxes, would it be seen as further protection for those who 
evade tax and by doing so, place an unfair burden on those in our 
society who are paying their way?
<P>
	While I recognize and respect the concerns of the hon. member 
for Durham, I believe that with Revenue Canada's declaration of 
taxpayer rights and the other quality service initiatives of the 
department we have achieved the appropriate balance between the 
rights of taxpayers and the rights of taxation administrators in 
Canada. For these reasons I will vote against Bill C-215.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Earlier before we began the 
debate on this private member's bill, the mover of the motion, the 
hon. member for Durham, asked under right of reply if he could 
have two minutes. I want the House to understand that no one will 
speak after him. This will close the debate and he will not take any 
longer than two minutes under right of reply.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Alex Shepherd (Durham, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, we have 
heard a wide range of thought processes here. I thank those people 
who entered into the debate. It is very useful. We should be doing 
more of that in this country.
<P>
	This is something that affects almost everyone in the nation. We 
have over 13 million taxpayers. In some ways it is something that 
unites us, although it seems like a strange thing to say. A lot of 
people tonight are struggling with the concept of filing their tax 
returns. It is something that unites us in the sense that tax filing is 
consistent across the country.
<P>
	We talked about all the reasons why we cannot have a taxpayers 
ombudsman. There are all kinds of reasons. I can show the House 
this very interesting book. It basically studies taxation and tax 
administration back through the time of Egypt and up to modern 
times. Every administration said the same thing, we cannot do this, 
we cannot tame the hand of Caesar.
<P>

<P>
	The bottom line is that we can do that. It is very important that 
we do it if we want to command respect for Revenue Canada and 
for our tax collection agencies. This is a process that people feel 
comfortable with.
<P>
	Today that process does not exist. With the great 
pronouncements of all the things we could have done to make the 
system better, why have we not done them? As I suggested, there is 
a tax case where the Supreme Court of Canada had to actually tell 
two parties to sit down and talk to each other. There is something 
wrong with the system.
<P>
	Most people in Revenue Canada carry out their job with 
diligence and with respect. I have met many of these people 
throughout my career. I found them generally hard working, 
concerned about their job and concerned about presenting the 
department's attitudes fairly and honestly in the community. There 
are those odd people in the system. We are all human beings and we 
make mistakes. When one makes a mistake at that level people 
draw back and say it did not happen.
<P>
	For those people who are filing their tax returns tonight, we need 
a process where they feel more comfortable with the system.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> I want to join in thanking all 
the members who participated. I would add to that also the member 
for Hastings-Frontenac-Lennox and Addington, who rose on 
several occasions trying to catch my eye and he did, but I thank him 
for his patience.
<P>
	The time provided for the consideration of Private Members' 
Business has now expired and the order is dropped from the Order 
Paper.
<P>
	It being 6.33 p.m., the House stands adjourned until tomorrow at 
2 p.m., pursuant to Standing Order 24.
<P>
	(The House adjourned at 6.33 p.m.)
