	<B>Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (President of the Treasury Board 
and Minister responsible for Infrastructure, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, today I presented the 1995-96 main estimates for the 
Government of Canada.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	They are the second main estimates of the 35th Parliament 
containing the expenditure plans of the government for the next 
fiscal year.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	They reflect the government's commitment, as the Minister of 
Finance outlines in the budget, to restrain spending, streamline 
operations and change fundamentally what government does 
and how its programs and services are delivered.
<P>
<B>(1010 ) </B>
<P>
	The main estimates lay out details of $164.2 billion in total 
planned budgetary expenditures for the next fiscal year. This 
includes $116.2 billion stemming from existing legislation and 
$48 billion in expenditures for which we are seeking 
parliamentary authority.
<P>
	The main estimates are the first step in carrying out the 
expenditure plan set out in the budget.
<P>
	Yesterday we heard the Minister of Finance announce an 
expenditure plan amounting to $163.5 billion in 1995-96. As I 
mentioned, the main estimates that I have tabled today total 
$164.2 billion for 1995-96.
<P>
	The difference between these two figures is explained by the 
fact that the main estimates do not include the impact of the 
proposed legislation that is needed to implement some of the 
budget expenditure cuts that the Minister of Finance talked 
about yesterday, nor do they include some other technical 
adjustments which are set out in part I of the estimates.
<P>
	Program spending in the budget which excludes the cost of 
interest on the public debt will decline to $114 billion in 
1995-96. It will go down to $107.9 billion in 1996-97, down 
10.8 per cent from $120.9 billion in 1994-95. This is as a result 
of the program review and previous budget measures.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10108"> 10108 </A></B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The budget cuts spending. It demonstrates that we will 
continue to reduce the deficit and continue to meet our fiscal 
targets.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The budget focuses on the need to cut government spending 
and to improve the economic climate so that job creation can 
flourish. The program review is a central part of the budget and a 
key element in our jobs and growth agenda. The government 
launched the review to pinpoint the programs and services that 
are no longer useful or that could be delivered more efficiently 
or effectively by others.
<P>
	We have seen the results in the budget reducing the federal 
role in some areas and highlighting the programs and services 
that other levels of government or the private sector could 
provide.
<P>
	By 1997-98, and this is important, departmental spending 
subject to the program review will decline by some 19 per cent 
relevant to 1994-95 which is very key in our meeting our deficit 
target of 3 per cent of GDP in three years and of course going 
beyond that.
<P>
	I will give some examples of how the government is 
implementing the program review in an environment of 
declining resources. First, the government will focus on its 
essential responsibilities. For example, Transport Canada will 
concentrate on developing policy and legislation and setting and 
enforcing standards for safety and security. As a result some of 
the department's activities such as its air navigation services 
will be commercialized. In addition, transportation subsidies 
will be reduced or eliminated and the remaining operations will 
be made more efficient.
<P>
	Second, the government is reducing federal and provincial 
overlap. For instance, Fisheries and Oceans Canada will 
negotiate the transfer of its freshwater programs with the 
provinces and concentrate on conservation and the sustainable 
use of the fisheries and oceans and other resources.
<P>
	Third, the government will use new technology to become 
more efficient. As an example, Environment Canada will 
automate its atmospheric environment services. The department 
will also be looking into providing weather services in a more 
effective and efficient fashion.
<P>
	Fourth, we are promoting self-reliance by shifting away from 
direct subsidies to business. The regional agencies will move 
from direct subsidies to providing loans with more emphasis of 
course on small and medium size enterprises.
<P>
	Fifth, the government will recover its costs by charging or 
increasing service fees to those who benefit directly from them, 
a move that is fair to taxpayers in general. Such charges include 
fees for immigration, agricultural inspection, drug testing and 
drug certification.
<P>
	Sixth, we will merge similar programs for more efficiency. 
For instance, Fisheries and Oceans Canada and Transport 
Canada will take steps to integrate the coast guard and fisheries 
surveillance fleets.
<P>
	What I have just outlined shows that we did not shy away from 
tough decisions. We are focusing on the key functions of the 
federal government and we are going to get them right.
<P>
<B>(1015) </B>
<P>
	Inevitably the transition from trying to be all things to all 
people to offering Canadians fewer but high value programs and 
services will mean a smaller federal workforce. As a result of 
reshaping the government and the transfer of some functions to 
other sectors, the government will reduce the public sector 
workforce by as many as 45,000 jobs over the next three years. 
That is the largest workforce reduction by the federal 
government since it returned to peacetime operations after the 
second world war.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	I have announced a program of options that will help 
employees to move successfully to new lives outside the Public 
Service. This program, which is comparable to private sector 
plans, will be fair to employees as well as fair to the taxpayer.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	It will allow us to make the program changes and meet the 
fiscal targets in the budget. For the remaining programs and 
services the government will provide services that balance the 
interests of taxpayers with those of the clients who are receiving 
them. It will seek cost effective ways to deliver quality 
programs and services that improve service and efficiency 
where it can.
<P>
	Across the government, departments and agencies are 
responding to the challenge of innovation. The results of the 
program review and the initiatives I mentioned demonstrate that 
government is intent on being more efficient and focusing its 
energies and resources where they are most needed while living 
within its means, and that means what Canadians can afford. We 
have a very dedicated professional public service I know can 
deliver those services.
<P>
	The government is committed to fiscal responsibility. We will 
continue to manage changing priorities by reallocating 
resources. The overhaul of the expenditure management system 
that I announced recently will help departments adjust their 
programs to operate with their reduced resources. It will also 
provide parliamentary committees with the information that 
they require to carry out their mandate to examine the future 
year expenditure plans and priorities of the various departments 
and agencies.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10109"> 10109 </A></B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Our ultimate objective is to deliver quality programs and 
services with the resources Canada can afford. These Estimates 
are evidence that we are on the right track.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Richard Bélisle (La Prairie, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
minister has just tabled the 1995-96 Main Estimates. The Main 
Estimates represent a total of $164.2 billion in expenditures. 
The minister explained that program spending in the Budget will 
decline from $120.9 billion in 1994-95 to $114 billion in 
1995-96 and $107.9 billion in 1996-97, a reduction of 10.8 per 
cent.
<P>
	Where will the $13 billion in program spending saved over a 
two-year period be applied? It will be used mainly to finance 
rising debt charges which during the same two years will 
increase by nearly $9 billion, assuming that the economy is in 
good shape, inflation is practically zero and interest rates 
remain at reasonable levels. What we have is an increase of 20.7 
per cent in debt charges over the next two years, almost twice the 
reduction in program spending announced by the minister.
<P>
	Nearly 75 per cent of all these efforts, of all these program 
cuts will merely go towards servicing the debt, which will cost 
us more than $50 billion in charges in 1996-97.
<P>
	In 1994-95, debt charges represent 33.6 per cent of budgetary 
revenues. In 1996-97, these debt charges will represent 36.6 per 
cent of budgetary revenues. Make no mistake, despite program 
review and previous budgetary measures, the debt marches on.
<P>
	Program review merely transfers billions of dollars from 
Canadian citizens to investors who finance a debt that is 
increasing steadily.
<P>
<B>(1020) </B>
<P>
	The minister also said that by 1997-98, departmental 
spending subject to the program review will decline by 19 per 
cent relative to 1994-95. What the government did not say is 
that most of the money saved will be used to finance the cost of 
servicing the debt, as I said earlier.
<P>
	The government keeps telling us it is reducing overlap 
between federal and provincial levels. In fact, the government is 
transferring the debt and the bills without transferring the 
corresponding authorities and tax points.
<P>
	For instance, the Department of Fisheries and Oceans will 
divest itself of its inland waters programs. In fact, this has been 
going on for some time in Eastern Canada. Why not transfer 
authority over the fisheries outright, as requested by the 
provinces concerned?
<P>
	The government has not withdrawn from areas under 
provincial jurisdiction or transferred the corresponding tax 
room to the provinces. There are still two departments of Health 
and two departments of Human Resources Development 
responsible for social programs in each province.
<P>
	If the government had withdrawn from areas under provincial 
jurisdiction, it could have saved billions of dollars more on its 
operating expenditures, while at the same time eliminating 
costly overlap on the federal side.
<P>
	The government wants to promote autonomy by eliminating 
direct subsidies to business. These subsidies, which total $3.8 
billion today, will still add up to $1.5 billion in three years' time. 
Why not get rid of them now, since the business community and 
business groups, including the Conseil du Patronat du Québec, 
have been asking the government to abolish them outright?
<P>
	The government also intends to charge fees for a number of 
government services. On paper this sounds great, but will 
charging every adult who applies for immigration to Canada a 
fee of $975 really reduce the deficit? Charging people this 
amount when they come here seeking a better life strikes us as 
mercenary, to say the least.
<P>
	The budget proposes a 30 per cent reduction in dairy subsidies 
over the next two years. Quebec, which receives 50 per cent of 
these direct subsidies, will bear the brunt of this measure. 
Farmers in Western Canada whose subsidies are cut will receive 
compensation but not in Quebec.
<P>
	We are also told that 45,000 positions in the public service 
will be cut in the next three years and yet this is barely enough to 
slow down the debt rate. The government says it is determined to 
be fiscally responsible, but the debt keeps growing as it did 
under Wilson and Mazankowski.
<P>
	Why were positions not targeted for cuts in departments and 
organizations where there is an overlap with the provinces? A 
significant proportion of staff cuts will, in fact, be made in 
departments like National Defence and Transport, where there is 
no overlap with the provinces.
<P>
	If the government was really serious about flexible 
federalism, it should have demonstrated its intention, when 
tabling the budget, to withdraw from areas of provincial 
jurisdiction. By remaining in these areas, it retains the right to 
impose its standards and its regulations.
<P>
	Much greater cuts should have been made now, but more 
judiciously, so that less would have to be cut in the future and the 
deficit could be eliminated completely by 1997-98. This way, 
the cost of the public debt would not represent nearly 50 per cent 
of program expenditures as it will in 1996-97. The cuts planned 
for next year in transfers to the provinces and the cuts that will 
have to be made to programs in two years' time will hurt, but, 
unfortunately, they will serve only to maintain the cost of the 
public debt below $50 or $55 billion dollars at that time. 
Difficult decisions are always put off until later.
<P>
	The main estimates for the Office of the Auditor General are 
down by 5.2 million dollars, a little over 10 per cent. The bulk of 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10110"> 10110 </A></B>
<P>
this reduction, $4.4 million, results from the review of 
government programs, whereas  program review is one of the 
cornerstones of government operations. Is this not somewhat 
paradoxical?
<P>
	The budget of the Auditor General is cut when the role of this 
department is expanding, and the government is telling us that 
the Auditor General will publish as many as five reports a year. 
The existing legislation will have to be amended, in any case. It 
provides that the Auditor General may publish one annual report 
and three supplementary reports. Let us give the Auditor 
General the funds he needs to do his job, instead of cutting his 
budget as his role expands.
<P>
<B>(1025) </B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Williams (St. Albert, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I noted in 
the statement by the President of the Treasury Board that he 
says: ``What I have just said shows that we didn't shy away from 
tough decisions'' and ``this government is committed to fiscal 
responsibility''.
<P>
	The government thinks it is just a case of more taxes, more 
taxes, more taxes. Then it says: ``We're going to do some cutting 
all across the board''. However, on looking at the estimates we 
find the spending of the government is going up again for the 
second year in a row. Of course the previous government did it 
every year before that.
<P>
	Every year spending goes up. The government says it is 
cutting. It is cutting the programs it delivers to the people of 
Canada because the amount of interest paid on the national debt 
is getting out of control. That is why when we add the two 
together, spending goes up.
<P>
	Let us get the job done. Let us get the budget balanced and let 
us stop the growth of interest during the first three years of this 
Liberal government. It is going to cut services to Canadians 
from $120 billion down to $108 billion. However the interest on 
the debt will go from $38 billion to $51 billion, which more than 
offsets all the cuts that are going to be made. That situation is 
going to continue. Spending will go up and services to 
Canadians will go down.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Silye:</B> In their last year they will spend more money than 
in their first year: 158.7 to 158.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Williams:</B> Mr. Speaker, we also find out about the great 
commitment for looking after social programs. The government 
is going to cut social spending by 7.3 per cent. If we look at the 
cultural programs, it is going to cut them by 6.9 per cent.
<P>
	Let us get the priorities straight here. Surely we should be 
protecting the core of social programs and the cultural programs 
should be set aside until we get the deficit under control. Surely 
these are the types of things that a prudent manager would be 
focusing on in a government that is trying to do the difficult job 
of balancing the budget.
<P>
	I noticed the Auditor General's budget is going to get cut by 
10 per cent. He manages his department responsibly. He says he 
can do with 10 per cent less. He is the one that points out all the 
waste and mismanagement right across government. Surely if he 
can cut by 10 per cent, every other department could get cut by 
10 per cent.
<P>
	That is what the Reform Party has been saying all along. 
There are cuts; there is waste; there is mismanagement that can 
be done away with in departments without cutting social 
programs.
<P>
	We find there are some increases however. It is not just cut, 
cut, cut all the way. Enterprise Cape Breton Corporation in 
eastern Canada gets an increase of 69 per cent, from $10 million 
to $17 million. It seems a little difficult to explain why one 
particular area, one particular minister in one particular 
department can receive an increase of 69 per cent when 
everybody else has to do with a little less.
<P>
	The minister tells us he is going to transfer the freshwater 
management of fish to the provinces. We thought: ``This is 
going to be great. Now we are going to see some downsizing in 
the department''. However, in the Department of Fisheries and 
Oceans, spending goes up from $775 million to $896 million, an 
increase of $121 million in spending as it divests itself of its 
responsibilities.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hermanson:</B> There are no fish.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Williams:</B> And there are no fish. However we do have 
123 executives in that department. As we transfer and divest the 
responsibilities, the proposal does not call for any decrease in 
the number of executives. We have to get this straight. We start 
cutting at the top before we get down to the bottom.
<P>
	We have talked about the other place that spends a lot of 
money. I see the estimates are going to give them even more 
money this coming year. It is a small increase but nonetheless it 
intends to spend more money in that other place. We have said to 
start at the top. Start with MPs' pensions. Start with the House of 
Commons, the Senate and so on.
<P>
<B>(1030) </B>
<P>
	There are a lot of unemployed people in this country. We need 
to help people create jobs and we find that $427 million is going 
to be spent on our Canadian identity. We would much rather 
spend this kind of money creating private sector jobs and 
reducing taxes than spending it to protect our Canadian identity 
that in many cases has withered away through the multicultural 
programs that we spend hundreds of millions of dollars on.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10111"> 10111 </A></B>
<P>
	Last fall the President of the Treasury Board said that we 
would have to wait until the budget was announced before he 
would give us a report on the money we spend on special interest 
groups. I did not hear anything in the budget yesterday about 
special interest groups. Another half a billion dollars of 
government money is being wasted. We could have cut in that 
area rather than cutting back on the core social programs.
<P>
	We have a bad record on megaprojects. The Lloydminister 
heavy oil upgrader cost over $500 million and was supposed to 
be a great deal. We bailed out of that a couple of months ago and 
sold our $500 million interest for $42 million. Not good 
business. With the Regina heavy oil upgrader we walked away 
from our loan guarantee at a cost of $125 million. Hibernia, the 
biggest one, is now going to cost $5.8 billion. This government 
is going to put in $3.6 billion, 62 per cent of the cost and we are 
going to have 8.5 per cent of the equity.
<P>
	We have major problems in the way this government runs the 
finances of this country. When we go through these estimates we 
are going to find many things. We are going to tell Canadians 
about the waste, the mismanagement, the protection of jobs at 
the top and the elimination of jobs at the bottom. We have to tell 
Canadians what this government is doing. Over the next few 
months we will be raising these questions at committee.

	<B>Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay East, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is my 
pleasure to present to this House a petition containing 
approximately 3,900 signatures.
<P>
	The petition is almost presented late because the petitioners

	It is interesting that out of an area population in the town of 
Golden which only has 2,371 households, four women went

petition. There was a tremendous amount of pressure on the

unfortunately, although the tax increases were limited, they 
were nonetheless there.

	The first petition asks that Parliament support laws that will 
severely punish all violent criminals who use weapons in the

	<B>Mr. Jean-Paul Marchand (Québec-Est, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
I rise on a point of order with respect to Question No. 93, which I 
tabled in this House on October 19. There are two parts to this 
question. Not only did it take three months to get a response, but, 
when I finally got it, last Friday, it was only half an answer. I am 
still awaiting the other half.
<P>
	What I got was a short paragraph of two lines telling me to go 
and find it myself. The response was: ``Look it up yourself''. I 
went, in fact, to see for myself. What is in the library is a sort of 
dog's breakfast. Moreover, it is not even up to date. My question 
concerned federal government properties in Quebec in 1994, 
and the information I had to look for dated back a number of 
years.
<P>
<B>(1045) </B>
<P>
	I wonder how such flagrant disregard for the rules of this 
House is tolerated. How is it such long delays are permitted? 
How is it possible to provide incomplete answers and abuse 
members' privileges? Is this the result of budget cuts or is this 
another attempt to deny us access to information? Is silence the 
watchword?
<P>
	I want information and I cannot get it.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Peter Milliken (Parliamentary Secretary to Leader of 
the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the hon. member for Québec-Est has raised this 
question on several occasions, too often, I must say.
<P>
	He got a good answer. On Friday, I tabled in the House a 1,450 
page answer to his question. Apparently, he has not read it all.
<P>
	As for the second part of his question, those 1,450 pages 
contained the answer. It is as follows: ``The Minister of Public 
Works and Government Services has not identified any riding in 
particular. However we have a copy of the 1992 real property 
holdings directory, which includes a list of federal real property 
in the province of Quebec and the rest of Canada and can be 
obtained from the Library of Parliament or through a member of 
Parliament''.
<P>
	This information is available to anyone. It can be obtained 
from the Library of Parliament. There is no need to prepare an 
answer to be tabled here in the House when a copy of the same 
information is available at the Library just down the hall.
<P>
	The hon. member can go there himself; there is no need to 
table such a document here in the House given the expense 
entailed in making copies.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Loubier:</B> Oh, oh.

member for Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot should bear in mind the

	<B>Mr. Peter Milliken (Parliamentary Secretary to Leader of 
the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):</B> I am 
informed as follows:
<P>
	(a) The Departments of Fisheries and Oceans, Environment 
and Transport have no information on this subject.
<P>
	The financial information requested is privy to the company, 
Seaconsult Marine Research Limited, and the parties contracted 
by them, and therefore the company or Dr. LeBlond should be 
approached directly for any clarification of these details.
<P>
	(b), (c) and (d) The information requested can be found in the 
answer to Question No. 85 tabled February 24, 1995.
<P>
	Please note that Dr. LeBlond has also assisted Natural 
Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada 
(NSERC) staff to provide input into a Department of Fisheries 
and Oceans survey on the use of research platforms by co-ordi-

nating input from the university research community. These 
activities were not remunerated; they were done voluntarily.
<P>
	(e) The director's advisory board for the fisheries and oceans 
Institute of Ocean Sciences (IOS) was established in 1991, at 
which time David Brander-Smith was appointed chairperson. 
The board has conducted an extensive review of IOS programs, 
defined core programs, and assisted the director with 
prioritization of the program and development of information 
exchange with stakeholders. Recently, the board has been active 
in providing advice on coping with program reduction strategies 
and budget reductions. The board is composed of individuals 
from commercial, recreational and native fishing interests, 
university, other government, environmental and oil and gas 
sector representatives. The objective of this board is to provide a 
vehicle for allowing stakeholders an opportunity to input to the 
development and direction of the department's ocean science 
program. During the time that Dr. Brander-Smith was 
chairperson, November 1991 to November 1994, the board 
provided advice in the following key areas:
<P>
	Program priority determination for the institute stressing the 
identification of scientific excellence and productivity, 
separating core activities from other activities, as well as how 
well programs address key priorities;
<P>
	Development of a strategy and implementation of a critical 
program review (peer review/client review) of IOS;
<P>
	The need for an external scientific review of programs;
<P>
	Identification of key IOS clients and contacts and intensified 
consultation with those clients seeking feedback on client 
perceptions and needs, and identifying ways of improving 
service and developing more formal information sharing 
arrangements;
<P>
	Development of a communications program aimed at sharing 
information on program activities with clients, the public and 
within and between government departments;
<P>
	Strengthening IOS use of partnerships and networks for 
co-operation, information sharing and communication; and
<P>
	Placing high priority on initiatives to encourage efficiency 
and effectiveness, as well as developing innovative sources of 
funding.

<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="FINANCIALSTATEMENTOFTHEMINISTEROFFINANCE">FINANCIAL STATEMENT OF THE MINISTER OF FINANCE</A></H4>
	The House resumed from February 27 consideration of the 
motion that this House approves in general the budgetary policy 
of the government.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am pleased to rise again today, the day after the 
budget, to state the official opposition's views on the budget 
brought down yesterday by the Canadian Minister of Finance.
<P>
	The budget before us consists of the usual downloading of the 
deficit by the federal government onto the provinces, which 
harms not only the very poor, persons on social assistance, the 
unemployed, students and senior citizens but also, as of next 
year, will also harm all Quebec and Canadian taxpayers, all the 
while- and this is the most unacceptable part-sparing big 
business, banks which are given a further reprieve, 
notwithstanding a minimal increase in the taxes they must pay 
this year.
<P>
	Businesses and banks benefit from federal tax breaks as well 
as from the government's subsidies while everyone everywhere, 
the provinces, the most destitute people, taxpayers, as of 1996, 
will pay more and more for the laxness and incompetence of this 
government.
<P>
<B>(1050) </B>
<P>
	This budget entails first of all a decentralization of the federal 
deficit, a decentralization of the federal bill starting with cuts in 
federal transfers for post-secondary education, health and 
welfare.
<P>
	This government is definitely proceeding in an underhanded, 
harmful way in 1995. There will be no cuts in 1995. It is easy to 
see why, this is the referendum year. There will be no cuts so 
Quebecers will be led to believe that this government is doing a 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10116"> 10116 </A></B>
<P>
fine job. Because it is the referendum year, the true picture is not 
being given; they hide the extent of this government's failure in 
1995. But as of 1996, look out, then we will feel it, then it will 
start to hurt. The Minister of Finance is asking us to go above 
and beyond tightening our belts, he is asking us to tighten them 
to the last notch and to avoid taking deep breaths.
<P>
	In 1995, the federal axe is going to lop $2.5 billion off of 
federal transfer payments to the provinces; in this year, Quebec 
alone will be hit by a drop of over $700 million in transfer 
payments. Worse yet, with the referendum campaign safely 
behind them, the federal government will cut $4.5 billion in 
transfer payments in 1997; for Quebec alone this will mean a 
drop of approximately $1 billion.
<P>
	Where are we going to get the money to make up this 
shortfall? There is only one taxpayer in Canada and Quebec, and 
he or she will have to absorb this shortfall. The tax hikes in this 
budget which purportedly contains no tax hikes are hidden, 
deferred and devious. And the provinces are forced to swallow 
the bitter pill.
<P>
	The Minister of Finance does not talk about what will happen 
after 1997-98. But we know what he has up his sleeve, because 
year after year-and he is carefully hiding this from Quebecers 
in this referendum year-his government will remain as 
voracious, as money hungry and spendthrift when it comes to 
public funds as it is at present in a structure that is out of sync 
with Quebec's and Canada's socio-economic realities. Time and 
time again, taxpayers end up footing the bill for the Minister of 
Finance's lax approach and downloading to the provinces.
<P>
	Quebecers will ultimately pay and will continue to pay 
because, what is left unsaid, what the federal government does 
not want to advertise, is that, although it downloads $7 billion in 
transfer payments up-front, the federal machine remains the 
same.
<P>
	Have any departments been abolished? No. We will still be 
stuck with the Department of Health, the Department of Human 
Resources Development and all other departments that cause 
duplication and overlap, for which the Minister of Finance is 
proposing to stiff the provinces with the bill. The tax bill that 
Quebecers and Canadians will have to pay in the next few years 
will actually increase, despite the downloading of part of the 
deficit onto the provinces. Quebecers, Ontarians and everyone 
in the country will pay more because the federal government has 
given up some of its financial responsibilities.
<P>
	What this amounts to is that, as of next year, Quebec 
taxpayers-because I am addressing them in particular 
today-will pay dearly in the year following the referendum. 
They will pay dearly if they do not create a real country, a 
normal country, a country which will assume total control for its 
public finances and will take the measures needed for recovery, 
a country totally committed to the plan, instead of a government 
that slowly demolishes its plan by arbitrary decisions, such as 
arbitrary cuts to transfer payments.
<P>
	Quebecers will pay dearly if they do not make the choice this 
year that is in their best interests, which is sovereignty, a choice 
in favour of efficient budgeting and resource allocation. The 
situation is being hidden from them.
<P>
<B>(1055) </B>
<P>
	Nor are they being told that in 1997-98, despite all of their 
sacrifices and all of the tax hikes they were subjected to at the 
hands of the Quebec or federal government, the federal debt will 
still be $625 billion. Moody's has the federal government's 
rating under review because of the size of the debt in the 
mid-term and the government's lack of control over the 
situation.
<P>
	The decision Quebecers must make is becoming increasingly 
clear, and became even clearer yesterday. Staying within the 
federal fold in the years to come pretty much boils down to this: 
fewer and fewer federal services and benefits; more and more 
offloading of deficit problems onto the provinces, which will 
ultimately result in tax hikes, because it is the same taxpayer; 
more bad news year after year; a reduction in the Quebec 
government's ability to do something about job creation, to put 
in place a plan to revitalize the economy, bring about more jobs 
and growth in all regions of Quebec, because we do not know 
what will hit us next with federal decisions. This is the scenario 
in 1996 if we stick with the status quo and stay in the federal 
fold.
<P>
	Quebecers have a choice to make, a choice that will be 
instrumental in encouraging economic growth and employment 
and putting an end to the slump for which the federal 
government is to blame.
<P>
	Not only is the Minister of Finance offloading his 
responsibilities onto the provinces, but he is still taking aim at 
his favourite targets in a feeble attempt to improve the state of 
Canada's finances. These targets are students, those on social 
assistance, the ill and the unemployed. He is still targetting the 
unemployed, as if they had not already paid enough since this 
government came to power, since this government broke its 
promise to help them and create jobs.
<P>
	Already this year the Minister of Finance planned to cut 
unemployment insurance by $2.4 billion. Next year, he was 
going to cut another $2.4 billion, and now he has added a further 
10 per cent cut, to the tune of $1.5 billion, on top of the billions 
in cuts already announced. Is this a pro-employment position? 
Is this the concern for the neediest members of our society that 
the red book promised? The famous red book that we heard 
about for months on end and that they have now forgotten.
<P>
	All the talk about creating jobs does not square with what we 
see in this budget. As far as job creation is concerned, the only 
program set up resulted in precious few jobs, 45,000 temporary 
jobs was the figure mentioned, and yesterday the Minister of 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10117"> 10117 </A></B>
<P>
Finance decided to cut the $200 million remaining in the 
program. Jobs, jobs, jobs-is this what they meant?
<P>
	My colleague from Rosemont pointed out to me this morning 
that the government's forecasts show unemployment in Canada 
holding steady at about 9.5 per cent over the next few years. The 
government has deliberately, for these forecasts are produced by 
the government, forgotten all about job creation. It even goes so 
far as to predict that unemployment will settle at around 9.5 per 
cent over the next few years. Do you know what that means for 
Quebec? It means an unemployment rate of 11 per cent that will 
not change as long as we stay with the status quo.
<P>
	We went over the budget carefully and found a lot of things, 
one of the more astonishing being that this record 
unemployment rate will be achieved and maintained without 
any increase in productivity. And a good thing, or maybe not. If 
there had been an increase in the productivity forecast for the 
next few years, the unemployment rate would probably climb to 
13 or 14 per cent in Quebec and in Canada.
<P>
<B>(1100) </B>
<P>
	At the same time, we must be increasingly productive, 
improve our performance, for with the globalization of trade, 
the new GATT agreement and the World Trade Organization, 
this will be essential if we want to hold our own and capture a 
greater share of international markets. But the Minister of 
Finance does not forecast any increases in productivity.
<P>
	This budget is already bad news in terms of employment, 
especially since the Minister of Finance tells us in his 
projections that in the next three years and even after that-his 
projections stop after a while because he is certain that we will 
realize how bad things are in Canada-, the unemployment rate 
in Canada will stay 4 per cent higher than in the U.S.
<P>
	By conscientiously basing his projections on such data and 
turning his back on measures to promote long term jobs, the 
minister spells disaster. While the minister picks on the 
provinces by shifting onto them the burden of these odious large 
scale tax reforms, while he picks on students, welfare recipients, 
sick people and perhaps seniors-he is now putting in place a 
committee to review all old age security programs-, this 
government is maintaining undue privileges for big business 
and the very wealthy.
<P>
	As far as business is concerned, the Minister of Finance took 
the trouble to denounce business subsidies in one paragraph, 
saying that these subsidies distort competition and that they no 
longer have their place in the new international order, that they 
result in unfair competition among nearby businesses, or at least 
among Canadian businesses. He strongly denounces these 
subsidies and then what does he do? He cuts these subsidies by 
60 per cent over three years when, in the opinion of the Quebec 
employers council, headed by Ghislain Dufour, who is certainly 
no lefty, he should have eliminated these subsidies completely 
and quickly. Although he agrees with this analysis, the Minister 
of  Finance will maintain $1.5 billion's worth of direct business 
subsidies in 1997.
<P>
	By then, the government will have cut social housing by more 
than $307 million. What compassion, what social conscience 
from this government, which talks about jobs, jobs, jobs, about 
the most disadvantaged, whose rhetoric is worthy of that of the 
NDP in its good years, but which, in fact, is worse than the 
Tories, if not very close to the Reform Party.
<P>
	If at least the Minister of Finance and his government had 
been smart enough to slash half of the $3.8 billion in subsidies 
now available to business and redistribute this amount equitably 
among R&amp;D efforts in Canada to improve business 
competitiveness and social housing, we would have understood 
and applauded this better distribution of resources. Instead, not 
only does he maintain large direct subsidies, but he also slashes 
social housing and pursues the shameful reforms he started last 
year.
<P>
	The same goes for tax reform; preferential treatment is left 
untouched. In 1991, several thousands of big businesses did not 
pay a single cent in tax to the federal government, thus depriving 
the federal treasury of hundreds of millions, if not billions of 
dollars in lost revenue. These thousands of big businesses, 
which still make profits despite the downturns in the economy 
since 1990, will continue to avoid paying their fair share of 
taxes. There is nothing in this budget which resembles a 
minimum tax, precisely so that these large businesses can still 
enjoy all kinds of roundabout ways to avoid paying their fair 
share.
<P>
	As far as tax agreements are concerned, as the Auditor 
General himself pointed out and as we have been saying for a 
year and a half, there are now 16 countries considered to be tax 
havens, which help those businesses refusing to do their 
corporate duty and pay their fair share to the federal treasury. 
These tax havens help such businesses divert hundreds of 
millions of dollars by reporting fictitious losses by phoney 
businesses and deducting them from revenues, thus diverting 
money from the federal treasury.
<P>
<B>(1105) </B>
<P>
	No changes were made to those tax havens. Quebecers and 
Canadians are asked to tighten their belts to the last notch, but 
nothing is done about such outrageous things. Do you not find 
anything wrong with that picture? I know you cannot answer, 
Mr. Speaker, but there is something wrong.
<P>
	Yesterday, the finance minister-I do not know whether he 
had a horn to honk but he should have had one on hand-said 
that businesses, big businesses in particular, were contributing 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10118"> 10118 </A></B>
<P>
more in terms of taxation and that banks were finally going to be 
paying taxes to the federal government.
<P>
	As regards banks, the poor banks, over the next two years, the 
minister plans to impose a temporary tax, not a permanent one, 
on them to appease public pressure. Because the public was 
saying: ``We pay. Since 1984, that is all we have been doing: 
pay, pay, pay. We undergo cut after cut, while banks make 
profits and pay no taxes''.
<P>
	To respond to this public pressure and give the impression that 
social justice matters to him, the Minister of Finance plans, over 
the next two years, to collect a whopping $100 million from 
them. One hundred million dollars from all Canadian banks. Just 
to give you an idea of the order of magnitude here, the Royal 
Bank of Canada, this small bank, generated a record $1.2 billion 
profit this year. How much we will collect from this bank over 
two years? No wonder that interest rates went down slightly 
today. You scratch my back and I will scratch yours.
<P>
	Where businesses in general are concerned, the Minister of 
Finance said that they will be contributing to put our public 
finances on a healthy footing. See how they will do so. Through 
a 1.5 per cent tax increase. Since businesses already pay $18 
billion to the federal taxman, this will bring their contribution to 
approximately 17 or 18 per cent of the tax pie. The money filling 
the federal coffers really comes from the taxpayers.
<P>
	The business sector will pay an additional $260 million in 
1995-96, $270 million in 1996-97 and $280 million in 1997-98. 
The amount was indexed to give the impression that it had 
actually increased. Did you know that not only this effort 
represents a 1.5 per cent increase in the ``tax burden'' because 
businesses may seek ways to avoid paying it, but it is ten times 
less than the effort asked from the unemployed this year. Ten 
times less. And they tell us it is fair. There is something very 
wrong with this government. It is not the first time I tell you this, 
but I do think it is profoundly unfortunate. It makes me very 
uneasy.
<P>
	The same deceitful practice, or just about, was applied to tax 
treaties. The Minister of Finance said he was acting on a request 
from the official opposition. Yesterday, the finance minister 
literally laughed in our faces. He laughed in our faces because he 
is not planning to eliminate the unjustified privileges enjoyed by 
the wealthiest of Canadian families-I am referring to family 
trusts-until 1999.
<P>
	This reminds me of the story of the police officer who gives 
thieves two hours notice that he will be coming over to arrest 
them. By 1999, some family trusts, not all, because we never 
said all family trusts were bad, but those used as powerful tax 
planning instruments by wealthy Canadian families, will have 
been transferred in other instruments, instruments that the 
minister has left untouched in this budget. Any tax that should 
have been recovered on the capital gains made on these trusts 
every year will be lost. In coming up with such things, the 
minister is laughing in our faces.
<P>
<B>(1110) </B>
<P>
	As for duplication and squandering, it will continue. It will 
continue because the federal government is not withdrawing 
from areas of provincial responsibility. The Minister of 
Intergovernmental Affairs himself indicated that the federal 
government would continue to have its say in all areas of 
provincial jurisdiction. It will continue to pry into these areas, 
while at the same time contributing less and less.
<P>
	Duplication and overlap will continue because, as I 
mentioned earlier, those federal departments where there is a 
problem will remain. When has a department ever been 
dismantled? Never. How can one say that duplication and 
jurisdictional overlap will be reduced and that the federal 
system is undergoing a major overhaul when nothing has 
changed?
<P>
	This brings me to these wild layoffs in the Public Service. 
There are two ways to trim an organization that is too fat, which 
is what the federal public service is, in the opinion of the official 
opposition. There are two ways to streamline: the good one and 
the bad one.
<P>
	This government is going about it all wrong. I can still see the 
Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs-I could have cried when 
I saw him-sitting comfortably at his desk, typing away on his 
computer, deciding how many jobs to cut in each federal 
department and crown corporation. Not for a moment did he did 
think of going to talk with those concerned. Not for a moment 
did the minister think that behind these figures on his computers 
there were real people. Not for a moment did he stop and think 
that these people have duly elected union reps, representatives 
from the Public Service Alliance of Canada, with whom he 
could have got together to discuss his plans.
<P>
	It is obvious that the public service needs to be restructured. It 
is obvious that it is too large. It is obvious that manpower 
reductions are required, but there is no need to make wild, 
inhumane cuts, as contemplated by the Minister of 
Intergovernmental Affairs, and without any guarantees. There 
are no guarantees.
<P>
	Who says that laying off 45,000 people will result in gains, in 
terms of effectiveness? Who says that the low morale in the 
organization will not affect services to the public? What 
guarantee do we have, and this is important, that the Liberals 
across the floor, who are prone to patronage appointments, will 
not favour their friends by contracting work out to them? This 
happened in the past. Yet, there is no guarantee that it will not 
happen again. There is only a risk that the indiscriminate 
lay-offs which are 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10119"> 10119 </A></B>
<P>
taking place will result in a need to contract work out and that, 
instead of saving money, the federal government will end up 
spending more than ever before. That is also something which 
happened in the past.
<P>
	We always forget that, within the public service, there are 
competent and experienced people who do a good job. If you 
contract the work out, it often ends up costing you more because 
you deal with businesses whose only objective is to make a 
quick profit at the expense of Canadian taxpayers. Let us not 
forget that.
<P>
	As I have said several times, when the official opposition 
talks about trimming the fat in the federal administration, when 
it says that Canada is overgoverned, it does mean that the public 
service is too large and that there are too many public servants. 
However, there is a proper way to deal with that. We do not 
endorse indiscriminate layoffs. Even the Public Service 
Alliance of Canada told us that it was prepared to discuss 
restructuring, provided it was properly thought out, did not 
merely mean cuts which will end up costing taxpayers more for 
fewer services provided by disheartened public servants. This is 
a difficult situation.
<P>
	I do hope that the government will again meet with PSAC 
officials to discuss that issue, something which it has not done 
since it came to office. The first thing the government did when 
it took office was to stop discussing, even though it had 
criticized the breakdown in discussions between the previous 
Conservative government and the unions representing public 
servants. This government should sit down with the PSAC. 
These people have suggestions to save money. They have ideas 
as to how the federal administration can be streamlined in an 
intelligent way. The government should rely on their expertise.
<P>
	As regards agriculture, yesterday the minister avoided the 
real issues. He did not want to stir up old controversies.
<P>
<B>(1115) </B>
<P>
	I remember one such controversy in 1982, when there was talk 
of amending the Crow's Nest Pass agreement. Back then, I noted 
that there was a very real conflict between the interests of 
western cattlemen or beef producers, which even differed from 
those of their fellow grain producers, but which were mainly at 
odds with those of easterners, particularly Quebecers.
<P>
	In his budget, the minister eliminates the $560-million 
subsidy for grain transportation to railroads in the Prairies. 
However, to make up for that loss, the minister will give western 
producers, based on their cultivated acreage, $1.6 billion to 
compensate the alleged loss of land value in the West. However, 
the Minister of Finance and the Minister of Agriculture both 
forgot that the Crow's Nest subsidy created a healthy balance in 
Canadian agricultural production. Indeed, while western 
farmers concentrated on grain production and enjoyed 
subsidized transportation of their products, livestock breeding 
developed in the East, particularly the dairy and pork industries.
<P>
	If you break that balance by eliminating the Crow's Nest 
subsidy, and if you give compensation for the alleged loss of 
value of western lands, you overlook an important element, 
namely the impact of such a measure on eastern producers.
<P>
	Nowhere in the budget speech is there any mention of 
compensation for eastern producers, particularly Quebec 
producers, who will also suffer. Doubly so. Indeed, not only will 
western producers get a $1.6-billion subsidy to adjust, but they 
will also be able to use that federal money, 25 per cent of which 
comes from Quebec, to compete with Quebec livestock 
breeders. Is that the federal government's idea of fairness? Is 
that the nice balance between the East and the West? Things do 
not work that way.
<P>
	Moreover, western producers will get a loan guarantee of one 
billion dollars, plus $300 million to adjust to the new situation. 
They will receive $3 billion to make up for the loss of the 
$560-million Crow's Nest subsidy. There is something very 
wrong right there. It is unfair to use federal moneys, 25 per cent 
of which is comes from Quebec, to support the competition from 
out west on our own markets.
<P>
	While the West will get $3 billion, Quebec will lose $30 
million because the Budget provides for a 30 per cent reduction 
in dairy subsidies to eastern producers, which will affect 
industrial milk, cheese, yogurt, ice cream and the rest. Fifty per 
cent of the dairy products we consume are produced in Quebec. 
So the government gives $3 billion to the West and takes $30 
million away from dairy producers in Quebec. Is that fair? Is 
that how the government wants farmers in Eastern and Western 
Canada to help put public finances back on track?
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, fair is certainly not the word here. As for dairy 
producers, this merely adds to existing pressures, because we 
should remember that during the past two years, under the new 
World Trade Organization agreements, dairy producers in 
Canada and Quebec have had to face increased competition. 
They lost one of the basic pillars of the dairy production system, 
referred to as Article XI. Since that time, competition has 
increased steadily, as the tariffs that replace protection at the 
border under Article XI go down and foreign products are 
allowed to compete with Quebec and Canadian dairy products.
<P>
	And now, the government is asking them to tighten their belts 
even more. Yesterday, Laurent Pellerin, president of the UPA, 
said that farm producers were prepared to do their fair share, but 
this was too much. This was absurd.
<P>
	I would also like to comment briefly on the international 
assistance envelope.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10120"> 10120 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1120) </B>
<P>
	Time and time again, when the members of this government 
were in the official opposition, they condemned the 
Conservative position on international assistance. Time and 
time again, the Minister of Finance-who was not Minister of 
Finance at the time-and the present Prime Minister expressed 
their outrage because the Conservatives were cutting 
international aid. What they are doing is far worse.
<P>
	The Budget brought down yesterday by the Minister of 
Finance provides cuts totalling $532 million in international 
assistance, thus exacerbating a situation where Canada is 
already reluctant to reach a helping hand out to the neediest 
international communities. When we talk about the neediest, we 
are talking about millions of children who are dying every day.
<P>
	It exacerbates a situation that was already criticized under the 
Conservatives, and the cuts in international assistance continue. 
Not only is this government utterly lacking in compassion for 
the neediest in Canada and Quebec, it is even more so in the case 
of children who are dying daily throughout the world.
<P>
	And now for National Defence. Another area where everyone 
has to do his fair share. The minister says the government will 
close the base at Saint-Hubert, in Quebec, and will cut back staff 
and reduce infrastructures in Bagotville, also in Quebec. His 
own analyst at National Defence believes that, in Quebec, the 
expenditures by the Department are short by some $650 million, 
on average. Six hundred and fifty million dollars. This is the 
minimum figure.
<P>
	Year in and year out, despite the size of the population in 
Quebec and the significance of tax contributions-Quebecers 
pay $30 billion in income and other taxes into the federal 
coffers, we are not talking about gifts here-despite all that, 
defence department spending in Quebec is short annually by a 
minimum of $650 million.
<P>
	In addition, even though Quebec has roughly 24 per cent of 
the population and contributes 23.5 or 24 per cent of the federal 
tax base, only 15 per cent of national defence infrastructures are 
located there. A highly disproportionate amount compared to 
the demographic weight and the tax contributions of Quebecers.
<P>
	Despite all of this, we are told that everyone has to make an 
effort. We have been streamlining for years, we have been 
paying for it for years. In Quebec, we have had our fill of paying 
for it. When they say that everyone has to pay for it, they should 
have a look and see what we have already paid without getting 
our share in Quebec of the annual expenditures and investments 
by the Department of National Defence. They should have 
thought twice before they did it. Quebecers will remember 
because we will constantly remind them of it.
<P>
	This budget is hypocritical, as I have already pointed out, 
because the truth has been kept from senior citizens. They have 
been told that things are fine and that nothing will change within 
the federal plan, just when a committee is being set up-and the 
Leader of the Opposition raised the problem yesterday-to 
examine the whole problem of pensions and old age security 
next year. As the Leader of the Opposition and member for 
Lac-Saint-Jean put it so well yesterday, committees are not set 
up to increase pensions.
<P>
	However, in 1995, a referendum year, the federalists, and the 
Liberal Party in particular, would lose a major argument if they 
tackled the seniors now-the argument that seniors' pensions 
would decrease if they changed governments. They did not want 
to do this before the referendum. They are keeping the truth 
from Quebec seniors just the way they are keeping it from all of 
the people of Quebec. And the truth is that there is no more 
money in the till.
<P>
	The finance minister has found a way to betray the Prime 
Minister's promise not to raise taxes during the first two years of 
his mandate. Last year, his strategy of cutting the age tax credit 
for senior citizens brought in $500 million in extra revenues. 
This year, taxes on gasoline and tobacco will bring in a total of 
some $800 to $900 million.
<P>
<B>(1125) </B>
<P>
	This budget does not address the real problems or respond to 
people's real needs. Maybe the federal government will get 
away with it this time. Maybe the bond rating agencies will 
allow its credit rating to stand if the government appears to have 
public finances in hand. But these agencies will most surely 
have their eye on the provinces since the federal government has 
offloaded all of its financial problems onto the provincial 
governments. So regardless of whose credit rating is dropped, 
there will be an increase in interest rates when the time comes to 
refinance the debt, whether the federal debt or the provincial 
debt or Quebec's debt, the burden will still fall onto the same 
taxpayer.
<P>
	This situation, this observation is deceptive. My Reform 
colleagues would do well to bear this in mind. Nor does this 
budget in any sense set a strong, solid course in regard to the 
accumulated national debt in the medium term, something 
which Moody's bond rating service has clearly pointed out. It is 
precisely the magnitude of the national debt which worries 
investors and has a major impact on interest rates, the lack of 
investments, the lack of significant job creation to recover from 
an unemployment rate hovering around 10 per cent. As of 1997, 
and I am warning my fellow Quebecers, more sacrifices will be 
imposed on them. The federal government will continue cutting 
and offloading, leaving the Quebec government the hateful task 
of increasing taxes or cutting spending on essential services.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10121"> 10121 </A></B>
<P>
	But that will not be the end of it since this budget has 
resolved nothing. We will always face a monstrous debt if we 
do not take steps of some sort toward renewal, true structural 
renewal, to create a new country and breathe new life into 
Quebec. If this is not done, we will pay for it and go on paying.
<P>
	In Quebec we have the chance to start afresh, to create our 
own social plan, to make an honest general effort not to be at the 
mercy of this government's arbitrary measures year after year 
which result in higher taxes any way you look at it. We can 
decide to extricate ourselves from this system or to keep sinking 
with the big federal machine.
<P>
	I think that Quebecers will choose to change governments, 
they will opt for renewal instead of the doldrums year in, year 
out, with no real social plan, without hope for job creation, 
without hope for enrichment, other than the enrichment of the 
federal debt.
<P>
	I would like to suggest the following amendment to the 
Minister of Finance's budget speech; I move:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That the motion be amended by striking out all the words after the word ``That'' 
and substituting the following:</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>``the House of Commons reject the government's budget which systematically 
offloads the federal government's financial problems onto the provinces; makes no 
provision whatsoever to ease the tax burden of the middle class while preserving tax 
loopholes for wealthy Canadians and large corporations; and completely disregards 
the pressing needs of the unemployed and the most disadvantaged who will bear the 
full brunt of additional cuts to social programs''. brev</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>(1130) </B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I rise to address the budgetary policy of the 
government as contained in the budget presented to the House 
yesterday. In doing so I wish to approach the budget not so much 
from the perspective of an opposition party, but more from the 
perspective of the people whose personal and collective 
interests are affected by the budget.
<P>
	On behalf of Canadians, Reformers will be subjecting the 
budget to four major tests. The first is the employment test. 
Does the budget address the needs of the unemployed or 
underemployed in the country? The second is the social security 
test. Does the budget address the needs of the recipients of 
government services, in particular, social services? The third is 
the fiscal test. Does the budget meet the fiscal expectations of 
those putting up the money, the lenders that are being asked to 
put up over $30 billion to cover the government's overdraft and 
the long-suffering taxpayers who are asked to put up almost 
$120 billion a year? Finally there is a character test. Does the 
budget demonstrate the qualities of honesty, courage, fairness, 
leadership and integrity which Canadians have a right to expect 
from their government?
<P>
	My colleagues will be applying these tests to the budget in 
greater detail than I, but let me give a summary of the results.
<P>
	The finance minister says the budget meets the partisan goals 
of the Liberal red book and its timid fiscal target of getting the 
deficit down toward $25 billion by the year 1997. While a few 
observers and commentators may be gullible enough to accept 
the red book and the 3 per cent goal as acceptable measuring 
sticks, at the end of the day the vast majority of Canadians will 
not.
<P>
	If this budget is measured against the interests of the 
unemployed and underemployed Canadians who want real jobs, 
it betrays those interests because it contains no real long term 
stimulus to private sector job creation.
<P>
	If this budget is measured against the interests of the 
recipients of government services who desire real social 
security, it betrays those interests because it does nothing to halt 
the diversion of funds away from social programs into massive 
interest payments on a growing federal debt.
<P>
	If this budget is measured against the interests of Canadians 
who want a solid plan for deficit elimination, it betrays those 
interests because it only plans to get the deficit to $24 billion by 
the year 1997.
<P>
	If this budget is measured against the interests of the 
long-suffering taxpayer who wants no tax increases and 
spending reductions which lead to tax relief, it betrays those 
interests because it takes over $1 billion more per year out of the 
pockets of taxpayers and lays the foundations for future tax 
increases.
<P>
	In short, when this budget is measured against the public's 
interests; the interests of workers, the interests of those who 
depend on social services, the interests of investors, lenders and 
taxpayers, it betrays those interests at every turn. It is a betrayal 
of trust of the same order as the Mulroney and Wilson budgets of 
1984-85 which missed the narrow window of opportunity to 
balance the budget, which comes only once to a new 
government, never to return again.
<P>
	In delivering this sad commentary, I do not wish to be unfair 
to the Minister of Finance, nor overly disparage his efforts to 
bring in a better and more honest budget. If the Minister of 
Finance and his department had been given more freedom and 
support by the Prime Minister, they might have come clean with 
Canadians on what deficit spending is doing to destroy social 
programs. They would have made the target of the budget deficit 
elimination, not merely deficit reduction. However, the Prime 
Minister discouraged such frankness and directness and the 
minister acquiesced.
<P>
	I believe that if the Minister of Human Resources 
Development had not utterly failed to provide a blueprint for 
reforming social spending, the finance minister might have 
presented the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10122"> 10122 </A></B>
<P>
combination of real social reforms and spending reductions. The 
Minister of Human Resources Development both undermined 
and failed the Minister of Finance.
<P>
<B>(1135) </B>
<P>
	I believe that if the Liberal caucus did not contain so many 
members that cling to obsolete notions, such as the idea that 
government spending is stimulative, such as the idea that 
Canada has a revenue problem, not a spending problem; if the 
finance minister did not have these living millstones around his 
neck he might have done better.
<P>
	To be fair we do not lay the blame for this budgetary betrayal 
of the public interest entirely on the Minister of Finance. We 
believe the blame should rest even more heavily on the Minister 
of Human Resources Development, on the soft-headed wing of 
the Liberal caucus and on the Prime Minister.
<P>
	As a constructive contribution to this debate, my colleagues 
will be applying the other tests of the budget which I have 
already mentioned. For example, they will apply an employment 
test to the budget to show how it hurts, not helps, one million 
unemployed and over two million underemployed in the 
country. As a constructive alternative they will also offer 
Reform's 5-R jobs program which relies on deficit elimination 
and tax relief to stimulate long term private sector job creation.
<P>
	The 5-R jobs program is based on the premise that a dollar left 
in the hands of a taxpayer or a consumer or an investor or a 
business person creates more jobs than that dollar in the hands of 
a bureaucrat, a lobbyist or a politician.
<P>
	My colleagues will apply a social security test to the budget to 
show the damage it does, especially in the long run, to those 
dependent on the big federal social security programs: OAS, UI, 
established programs funding and the Canada assistance plan. 
As a constructive alternative we will offer Reform's vision of a 
more secure society through the empowerment of individuals 
and communities and the decentralization of social program 
delivery to the levels of government closest to the people.
<P>
	My colleagues will show how by applying these principles we 
can get more social security for more Canadians out of $140 
billion in combined federal and provincial social spending than 
the current government is going to get out of $155 billion in 
combined social spending. The Reform alternative to the 
welfare state is based on the premise that a dollar left in the 
hands of a mother, a father, a family, a student, a senior, a front 
line care worker is more productive, more conducive to social 
security than that dollar in the hands of a distant federal 
government.
<P>
	Finally, my colleagues will apply fiscal tests to the budget to 
show how it undermines the confidence of taxpayers and 
lenders. As a constructive alternative they will put forward the 
premises and calculations of our taxpayers' budget presented on 
February 21 which achieves deficit elimination in three years 
through spending cuts alone without tax increases.
<P>
	While we are extremely critical of both the character and 
content of the budget, in the name of workers, recipients of 
services, taxpayers and citizens, unlike the Bloc and others, we 
have a constructive alternative to offer. All of those are 
contained in the taxpayers' budget which we invite the media, 
the public and members of the House to compare and contrast 
with the Liberal budget.
<P>
	Today I again repeat my challenge to the Prime Minister and 
the Minister of Finance. We want a fair, no holds barred, two on 
two debate; the government's budget versus the taxpayers' 
budget. Let us pick a night sometime in the next week or 10 
days-to save money let us have it in this Chamber-but let us 
leave our cheering sections at home, just five people on the 
floor; the Prime Minister, the finance minister, myself and one 
of our finance critics and yourself, Mr. Speaker. Let us have only 
two documents on the table; the Liberal budget and the 
taxpayers' budget. Let the TV cameras roll and let our members, 
the media and the public view the exchange. Let us have a real 
debate and a cross-examination of the fundamental assumptions 
behind these two budgetary alternatives and the directions in 
which they lead. The issue to be decided is nothing less than 
which course of action will get the fiscal affairs of the federal 
government in order for the 21st century.
<P>
<B>(1140) </B>
<P>
	As I said at the beginning, one supreme test must be applied to 
this budget above all others. That is the character test. Does the 
budget demonstrate the qualities of honesty, courage, fairness, 
leadership and integrity which Canadians have a right to expect 
from their government? Again, sad to say this budget fails the 
character test.
<P>
	In the red book the government ignored and downplayed the 
damage that the deficit and the debt are doing to private sector 
job creation and continued to insist for months that government 
overspending, such as through the infrastructure program, was 
the key to job creation. It simply lacked the courage and honesty 
to tell Canadians that it was high deficit, debt and tax levels 
which were undermining the private sector's ability to create 
jobs for hundreds of thousands of unemployed Canadians.
<P>
	Now in the budget the government continues down the same 
path. It ignores, downplays, even attempts to deny and cover up 
the irreparable damage that government overspending, the debt 
and the deficit, are doing to social security programs on which 
so many Canadians depend.
<P>
	Under the budget plan the government will add over $100 
billion to the federal debt. Interest payments on the federal debt 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10123"> 10123 </A></B>
<P>
will rise to over $50 billion a year, or almost one-third of the 
federal budget by the end of this Parliament.
<P>
	Diverting taxpayers' dollars into paying $50 billion a year in 
interest diverts billions of dollars directly away from spending 
on all other government programs, in particular social spending, 
since social spending is the largest part of the federal spending 
program.
<P>
	In other words, the greatest and most real threat to social 
programs in Canada is not supposed and imaginary attacks by 
fiscal reformers, it is the chronic, unrelenting, systematic 
failure of a Liberal government to get the deficit to zero as 
quickly as possible.
<P>
	Until I see an addendum to the budget that clearly projects the 
impact of rising debt and interest costs on social spending, the 
impact on seniors, on people on social assistance, on people 
dependent on the federal government for health care, the budget 
is lacking in honesty and courage. It is a cowardly and dishonest 
budget that fails the character test at the point where it is most 
needed.
<P>
	This brings me to the equally important character traits of 
fairness and leadership. The finance minister calls for 
Canadians to make sacrifices in order to reduce overspending 
and the deficit. The budget signals future cuts, for example, in 
unemployment benefits, seniors' benefits, and cuts to social 
transfers to the provinces. He insists that the spending cuts and 
tax increases he will impose are guided by fairness.
<P>
	As the minister has said, however, the devil is in the details. 
Fairness and leadership call for those at the top of the 
government to make the first and most visible sacrifice. For this 
Parliament and this government that means relinquishing the 
gold plated MPs' pension plan which so many Canadians find 
obscene and which they regard as the cardinal example of 
excessive spending at the top of government.
<P>
	What does the government do? A few days before the budget 
it brings out a slightly modified MP pension plan-we call it 
trough light-which still offers MPs the most generous pension 
plan in the country. It contains an opting out clause directed to 
first time MPs, but it offers millions and millions of dollars in 
pension benefits to senior ministers and senior backbenchers 
beyond the wildest dreams of ordinary Canadians. It declares 
this is pension reform. It declares this is equity and fairness. It 
declares this is real cost cutting when in fact it is not.
<P>
	This failure to practice with respect to the MPs' pension plan 
the principles that the government espouses in the budget points 
to a flaw in the character of the government.
<P>
<B>(1145 ) </B>
<P>
	There is no way in which a government member can vote for 
the budget with its spending reductions and tax increases and 
vote for the gold plated MP pension plan at the same time, 
without undermining the integrity of the government itself. So 
what will it be?
<P>
	It is the intention of Reform MPs to opt out of the MP pension 
plan. We call upon every other member of the House to do 
likewise. ``Opt out or get out'' will be the cry in the 
constituencies. It is a cry which must be respected if fairness and 
leadership by example and integrity are to be restored to 
Parliament and any budget it endorses.
<P>
	In conclusion, some observers of the budget will say that it 
brings Canada one step closer to hitting the wall, one step closer 
to a crisis of confidence on the part of lenders that will drive the 
dollar through the floor, the interest rates through the roof, grind 
the economic recovery to a halt and begin the complete 
unravelling of the social safety net.
<P>
	Some will say that the failure of the government to eliminate 
the deficit now, when the economy is in relatively good shape, 
will leave Canadians virtually defenceless in the face of an 
economic downturn.
<P>
	Some will say that the cuts necessary to balance the budget, 
when they inevitably come, will now be much deeper and much 
more destructive because the government lacked the courage to 
act now. Only time will tell.
<P>
	However, on behalf of Canadians everywhere-taxpayers, 
employers, employees, consumers, recipients of services and 
citizens-I say to the Prime Minister, to the Minister of Finance, 
to every member of the Liberal cabinet, to every member of the 
Liberal caucus and to every senior civil servant who had 
anything to do with the preparation of the budget: If the country 
hits the wall, if the country's social programs hit the wall 
because of what the budget failed to do, they will be held 
personally, professionally and politically accountable for the 
consequences come hell or high water.
<P>
	I move:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That the amendment be amended by striking out all the words after the word 
``budget'' and adding thereafter the following words:</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>``for its failure to eliminate the deficit quickly and decisively within the life of this 
Parliament and by asking future generations to bear the cost of fiscal 
irresponsibility''.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Elwin Hermanson (Kindersley-Lloydminster, Ref.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I enjoyed listening to the address by my leader, the 
hon. member for Calgary Southwest. It is the only address I have 
heard on the budget to this point in the House that actually made 
any sense.
<P>
<B>(1150) </B>
<P>
	We saw a budget tabled yesterday that had some tax increases 
and some spending cuts. However the problem I find is that our 
total national debt, the GDP ratio, remains unchanged. It is still 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10124"> 10124 </A></B>
<P>
around 73 to 75 per cent, which means that we are not gaining 
any ground.
<P>
	Yes, we are experiencing some pain as taxpayers. We are 
going to pay more to put gas in our cars. We are going to pay 
higher taxes and, yes, we are going to see some reduction in 
services. We are going to see it at the bottom. We are going to 
see 45,000 people cut from the civil service and very little 
cutting at the top. That means services to Canadians are going to 
be reduced.
<P>
	We are going to see some pain. We are going to see some 
additional costs but we are not going to see any gain. We are not 
going to see any better future for our children in the long term.
<P>
	Would the hon. member talk about the positive aspect of the 
Reform taxpayers' budget in that respect in light of the budget 
tabled by the minister yesterday?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Manning:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the member for his 
intervention. He puts his finger on the core problem that has to 
be resolved in the House, I would hope in the course of the 
budget debate.
<P>
	After the spending cuts that have been proposed by the 
minister the sad problem is that we still end up running a $25 
billion deficit at the end of 1997. The federal debt is over $600 
billion and the interest payments on that debt are over $50 
billion.
<P>
	If members would work through the consequences of those 
higher interest costs on the rest of the social spending, 
particularly the social programs, they would find that does more 
damage to the social services network than virtually anything 
that has ever been proposed by anybody in terms of spending 
reductions.
<P>
	The taxpayers' budget we presented endeavoured to get the 
deficit down more quickly so that the debt stops growing and 
this bleeding off of social program spending through interest 
payments ceases.
<P>
	I honestly submit to the House that if people would compare 
those two, the pain of the cuts to get the deficit down more 
quickly versus the pain that will come if nothing is done and 
those programs are all eroded by higher interest costs, they 
would find it would be more advisable, more saleable to the 
electorate and more acceptable to Canadians to hit the Reform 
target of deficit elimination in three years rather than the 
minister's target of cut the deficit in half by 1997.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dennis J. Mills (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister 
of Industry, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, when the member for Calgary 
Southwest rose to his feet today he said that he would not be 
approaching the debate in a partisan way. Therefore I was rather 
surprised the leader of the Reform Party did not acknowledge 
the fact that there were no personal tax increases in the budget.
<P>
	I read the Reform Party's budget. I realize that I cannot show 
it here because it is inappropriate. It would propose a flat tax 
idea. As members will know, this is something I personally 
believed in although I call it the single tax and it has a much 
more progressive design than the member is proposing.
<P>
	In the proposal of the leader of the Reform Party for a flat tax 
it is absolutely inevitable under that system that many 
Canadians would pay more personal income tax. How does the 
leader of the Reform Party square that flat tax idea with his 
statement that there should be no more money taken out of the 
personal income tax envelope?
<P>
<B>(1155 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Manning:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the member for his 
question and I will respond to it in two parts.
<P>
	First, he implied that we should be thankful for the minister 
not increasing personal income tax. I remind the member of the 
fact he knows well that all these taxes come out of the pocket of 
the same taxpayer. Automobiles do not pay this fuel increase of 
1.5 cents a litre on gasoline; people pay it. The tax increases of 
over a $1 billion a year in the budget are going to be paid by real 
people. Ordinary taxpayers do not care much about where it is 
coming from. They end up having to pay it.
<P>
	With respect to the member's second question on the 
implications of flat tax on the budgetary situation and the impact 
on taxpayers, I say it comes back to the concern about the total 
tax load. If we could get spending capped and then down to the 
point where we could offer tax relief, which is the whole aim of 
the taxpayers' budget, the total tax load on Canadians under a 
flat tax system or any other system would be lower than it is 
under the current system.
<P>
	Our aim is to deliver genuine tax relief second through tax 
reform but first through getting the spending down, which is the 
root cause of high taxes.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Roger Pomerleau (Anjou-Rivière-des-Prairies, 
BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have only a brief comment and a question 
for the leader of the Reform Party. Among the measures 
affecting farmers in the east contained in this budget, there is a 
cut of $32 million in funding for Quebec. Of course, the 
government has also made cuts affecting farmers in the west, for 
example the Crow rate, but it will also compensate farmers of 
that region to the tune of $2.9 billion.
<P>
	This measure typifies what Quebec has a problem with in this 
country. Money is taken from some areas and given to others, 
and Quebec gets none of it. Before asking my question, I cite the 
energy sector in Canada and Quebec as an example of this. We 
have three kinds of energy: petrochemical, nuclear and electric. 
The government made massive investments, billions of dollars 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10125"> 10125 </A></B>
<P>
worth, in petrochemical energy. Hibernia is an example of this. 
The federal government made massive investments in CANDU 
reactors. The federal  government's cumulative investment in 
this project is $12 billion, of which Quebec paid 25 per cent. 
Nothing was ever invested in electricity in Quebec.
<P>
	This is what we say. I think that what my hon. colleague meant 
when he said: ``We're going to hit the wall quite soon'', and I 
fully agree with him, is that he admonishes that we are on the 
verge of an apocalypse, and we Quebecers say that our personal 
apocalypse would be to stay in this system.
<P>
	Can my hon. colleague tell us his point of view on the 
differences between how the west and Quebec are being treated?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Manning:</B> Mr. Speaker, I could respond to a number of 
points. I thank the member for his intervention. I remind him 
that Quebec Hydro has paid no income taxes. Nor was Quebec 
Hydro ever been subject to a raid by the federal government the 
equivalent of the national energy program, which is one of the 
differences between how energy has been treated in the west and 
how it has been treated in Quebec.
<P>
	With respect to the agricultural impacts of the budget, I have 
heard other comments by the member's colleagues implying 
that there is some unfairness in the government cancelling the 
Crow rate and compensating western farmers to the tune of $1.6 
billion and the 30 per cent reduction on subsidies to the dairy 
industry, a large portion of which is in Quebec.
<P>
	I remind the member that the dairy industry gets its subsidies 
from two sources. One is directly from the government but the 
other is from the high level of protection that supply 
management is offered. That subsidy comes directly out of the 
pockets of the consumer and not from the government. If we add 
the levels of subsidy we find the subsidization of supply 
managed industries in Quebec is as high or higher than the more 
free market grain trade and livestock trade in the west.
<P>
	It is for members from the province of Quebec to consider that 
if Quebec is an independent country the capacity of Quebec to 
subsidize and protect to the degree it has in the past is gone and 
those farmers would be hurt infinitely more than they would be 
by any measure under the budget.
<P>
<B>(1200 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. David Walker (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I want to say to the leader of the 
third party with humour, not anything else, that if he wants to 
speak without props I suggest he look around here, then look 
around behind himself where he came to this debate fully 
propped for his presentation.
<P>
	It gives me a great pleasure to join in the debate today, which 
perhaps is one of the most important times of our history, the 
discussion of the 1995 budget presented yesterday here in the 
House by the Minister of Finance.
<P>
	I do not have to tell the House that it not only deals with the 
questions of cutbacks, with the question of some of the nitty 
gritty and the program review. In a fundamental way the 
Minister of Finance has laid out for this government and for the 
people of Canada how we are going to go about getting 
government right.
<P>
	This philosophy is clear. In order to fulfil the ambitions of this 
government-I hope of the whole House-our job here is to 
provide an environment for economic growth, for creating jobs 
for Canadians and to see that there will be new economic wealth 
shared by all Canadians. In this context that we have set out the 
first step we must take is to make sure we get government right 
and we do things properly here in Ottawa.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	This budget will result in considerable savings so that we can 
meet our red book commitment to reduce the deficit. 
Furthermore, if the economy does better than forecast in our 
extremely prudent estimates, the deficit could go down even 
faster.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	This will pay off not only this year, not only next year, but 
because we are getting it right this time, it will pay off long into 
the future.
<P>
	As an aside, everyone in this House should be heartened by 
the tremendous positive reaction. This budget has been accepted 
by Canadians from coast to coast, by people who are concerned 
about our deficit but on the other hand wanted to be given hope 
that the government was not going to hurt their lives 
unnecessarily. Yes, the price is being paid by many people in 
many ways in many walks of life. On the other hand, it is also 
gratifying that Canadians have come to a point in this 
development where they can say this is the right step, that we are 
doing the right things for Canada. International observers who 
do have an influence on our success have also seen that the 
Minister of Finance has taken the right steps and is going about 
putting our house in order.
<P>
	This budget is different, very different from the previous Tory 
budgets. People ask me that question all the time. We are not just 
making rhetorical flourishes. We are doing very precise things. 
We are going to be successful. It is not a budget of promises. It is 
a budget of commitment. We proved last year that we can fulfil 
our commitments. We will prove it next year, the year after and 
the year after that.
<P>
	Most important for people on this side of the House, this is not 
a Conservative budget in a fundamental way. It adheres to the 
Liberal legacy of nation building. It is clearly rooted in the 
principles of economic leadership, compassion and increased 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10126"> 10126 </A></B>
<P>
fairness. We will not leave  Canadians with another decade of 
disappointments in the development of the budget and the 
development of their government.
<P>
	Today's budget is a call for action. It is a time for opportunity 
and challenge. As our Prime Minister has said on many 
occasions, if we have to make cutbacks in government, make 
them while the economy is growing. The economy is growing 
now and now is the time for firm action.
<P>
	We have seen in the past year, not because of our actions but 
because of the collective wisdom of Canadians and their 
increased confidence, over 443,000 permanent jobs created in 
this economy. We have seen a growth rate that far outstrips all of 
our fellow countries in the G-7. We have shown the way among 
western industrial nations about how to grow an economy.
<P>
	We do not take credit for that. We understand that it is not us 
but we hope that we are helping to provide the environment 
which makes businesses and individuals confident of the future 
because that is the way that this economy will continue to grow.
<P>
<B>(1205) </B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	We also have an opportunity at the political level. Canadians 
clearly indicated that they wanted vigorous measures to reduce 
the public debt so that we can get rid of the crushing burden of 
high taxes and resulting interest rates.
<P>
	The challenge we face is just as clear. Canada's economic 
future is in real danger because of the $500 billion debt which 
makes us extremely vulnerable to the brutal impact of interest 
rates.
<P>
	These interest rates have continued to rise under pressure 
from the U.S. and Canada. Since October, short-term rates have 
risen by about 2.5 percentage points.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	It is very important to emphasize this point. I want to say to all 
parliamentarians here today that sometimes during the course of 
our committee work we wonder if it has an influence, do the 
ministers listen, does the Prime Minister listen, do opposition 
members have an influence. I think the finance committee 
stands out in its work as a great example of how 
parliamentarians contribute to the development of policy.
<P>
	We went through long hearings. We heard from over 650 
witnesses in the fall. We came to the conclusion that the 
government must be prudent, that the government must pay 
attention to increasing interest rates, that we must take dramatic 
and deliberate actions to reduce the deficit. The Minister of 
Finance heeded those words.
<P>
	Although we seemed to be on the drastic side when we made 
our recommendations our warnings bore out the truth, that 
interest rates have gone up and made the job of this government 
much more difficult.
<P>
	To the credit of the Prime Minister and the Minister of 
Finance and other colleagues in the ministry, they responded 
and produced a budget which showed our own willingness to 
reach our targets. This caution will be what propels this 
government to do the right thing in the years to come.
<P>
	Let us stop and think. What would have happened if we had 
done nothing? There are voices in the country and voices on the 
lawn in front of Parliament which say this is really an okay 
situation, all this talk about deficits is some right wing plot to 
destroy our social programs. If we had not done anything we 
would have been $5 billion higher in our deficit this year and we 
would have missed the mark by $10.6 billion next year. In other 
words, we would be further behind than when we formed the 
government on the commitment to reduce the deficit to 3 per 
cent of GDP. The actions are necessary and we are in the process 
now of taking the necessary steps to rectify the situation.
<P>
	In order to reach our budget targets as the Minister of Finance 
explained yesterday we are implementing cumulative savings 
over the next two years of $15.6 billion. Over $13 billion of 
these savings will be in spending cuts and there will be no 
increase in personal income tax rates.
<P>
	As the leader of the third party said a few minutes ago, this is 
great news for Canada. We have to realize that we have attacked 
the problem of government debt while at the same time 
recognizing the legitimacy of middle class families, that the tax 
burden has shifted over the past 15 years far to much to them and 
therefore to their children and their ability to have economic 
security.
<P>
	This government has listened to that message and listened 
very carefully and responded with prudence, responded in such a 
way that Canadians understand that we are putting this 
government in order and are calling upon them as a last resort to 
lend assistance.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	We are also taking firm action to make the tax system fairer, 
close loopholes and increase the contribution of big business to 
the fight against the deficit.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Taking the next three years together, the budget delivers 
almost $7 in spending cuts for every $1 in revenues. These 
actions are changing the size and shape of the government by 
hard choices on priorities. By 1996-97 program spending will 
fall from $120 billion down to $108 billion. This is the most 
dramatic action seen in any government for decades.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10127"> 10127 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1210) </B>
<P>
	The most important point of all, in 1996-97 the debt will no 
longer be growing faster than the economy. When the Minister 
of Finance says on public occasions that we are going to break 
the back of this, we are going to get off this treadmill, this is the 
key point. The debt to GDP ratio will begin to decline. That is 
the key for the fiscal sustainability and that will put us on a 
permanent downward track.
<P>
	There are going to be payoffs. We want Canadians to 
appreciate this. This is the first step. Budgets are not made or 
broken on one night's announcement, they are made by 
Canadians adjusting themselves and departments adjusting 
themselves. There will be a payoff. The payoff is that we will 
make sure we reach our targets.
<P>
	We set up substantial contingency funds: $2.5 billion this 
year, $3 billion the year after. Even if interest rates go another 
full percentage point higher we will still be able to reach our 
targets.
<P>
	It is this type of caution in the pasture which has caused us to 
reach our target, to do better than we told Canadians we were 
doing, and that is what is contributing to the confidence of 
Canadians in their national government. We are saying things 
that we can do. We are not setting targets five years down the 
line or ten years down the line so that when a crisis occurs like 
Mexico everybody says do not worry about this particular short 
term problem, we can put it off and look after it in the future.
<P>
	What we are saying in this House is that as a crisis occurs we 
adjust, we reduce our spending, we reach our target year after 
year. That is the confidence builder, not having some vague 
target in the future which says we can reduce the deficit to zero 
in three or four years. That does not help anybody. That just 
frustrates people. That leaves a bad taste in the mouths of the 
politicians who are over promising.
<P>
	It is very important that every member in this House 
understand the responsibility that we have in the debate, that 
Canadians understand that we are going to reach targets and that 
those targets will be reached in such a way that it is done fairly 
and consistently. When people look back at the period of the 
mid-nineties it will not be like it was in the mid-eighties, there 
will be real accomplishment by their national government.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Our contingency reserves could play a dual role in the future. 
Not only will they ensure that we will meet our objectives, but, 
if they are not needed they will not be spent and will allow us to 
further reduce the deficit.
<P>
	This is yet another dividend to be reaped through prudent 
economic forecasting.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	If interest rates and growth do better than our forecast and 
conform to the private sector average the 1996-97 deficit could 
drop dramatically. It could be much less than projected in the 
budget. We could have a deficit under 2.5 per cent instead of 3 
per cent of GDP.
<P>
	The government is being very careful on this point. We want 
people to understand that our targets are realistic and if we do 
better it is through good luck. We are being prudent in each of 
our particular projections because we do not want to fall short. 
We think that the credibility, not of this government but of the 
nation, is based on targets reached year after year.
<P>
	The heart of the process to achieve these goals was not done in 
the hurried up fashion of a Minister of Finance sitting around a 
table with a few officials. In my first year the minister would 
call me in from time to time and we were trying to figure out 
what could be done. We had only been in office for a few months 
and it was very much a learning process.
<P>
	What the minister decided quite appropriately, which was 
supported by his cabinet colleagues, was to have a program 
review which in some respects sounds esoteric. A program 
review gave a group of ministers an opportunity to talk with 
each other about what they wanted to see reshaped in 
government, a new strategy within government. It was not to 
throw around programs and say, cut here and cut there. It was to 
say department by department, what is it that we have to get out 
of and what is it that we have to emphasize? How do we 
redevelop an industrial strategy? My colleague from Don Mills 
is involved with that. How do we develop a strategy on science? 
How do we reduce subsidies in the agricultural field? How do we 
make the transportation system more effective? These are not 
catch as catch can questions, these are hard to answer; nor are 
our answers this year the final answers.
<P>
<B>(1215 ) </B>
<P>
	We will find this will be a progression of innovation. We will 
be back again and again suggesting new ways to do things. This 
budget is going to energize our colleagues on this side to do the 
right thing and to find new ways for the government to operate. I 
hope the opposition parties will make suggestions that we can 
incorporate so that we can develop a stronger and stronger 
national government.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Of course, we did not wait for the budget to take concrete 
action. Our review of agencies, offices, councils, boards and 
commissions-which ended in early February-will lead to the 
abolition of 73 of these 120 organizations. The 47 remaining 
entities will be restructured and rationalized. This will allow us 
to eliminate 665 positions held by governor-in-council 
appointees and save $10 million a year.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10128"> 10128 </A></B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	We could mention a lot of examples that have proven to be 
really fruitful in this process. Spending by fisheries and oceans 
will fall $210 million over three years. We have found that there 
are more officials than there are active fishers. Transport will 
move from being an operator of the transport system to a role of 
regulator and policy maker.
<P>
	There has been a large question raised in the minds of the 
public about subsidies to business.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	In fact, business subsidies will be cut in every department.	 The reduction will affect agricultural and transportation subsidies that were established decades ago.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Overall the budget will cut subsidies in half, from $3.8 billion 
to $1.5 billion by 1997-98.
<P>
	We will also do other measures on cost recovery, for example 
in dealing with immigration issues.
<P>
	On the question of provincial transfers, we are taking action 
to reform the provincial transfer system. We think that our 
innovations will create a system that is more sustainable and 
more responsive to community needs.
<P>
	In the last budget, to set the stage to show ourselves to be 
supportive of each of the provinces, we renewed equalization for 
five years. There is no change in that commitment in this budget.
<P>
	For 1996-97, the other major programs, established programs 
financing for health and education and the Canada assistance 
plan, will be converted into a single, consolidated block transfer 
called the Canada social transfer.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	It is a matter of converting the Canada Assistance Plan to the 
block funding system already used for EPF, thus allowing the 
provinces to innovate according to their priorities.
<P>
	However, the budget also makes it clear that the principles in 
the Canada Health Act must be adhered to. And there is no 
change to the principle that the provinces must provide social 
assistance services without minimum residency requirements.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The introduction of the CST will see total provincial transfers 
reduced by $2.5 billion next year and the year after that by $4.5 
billion. This means that the total of all major transfers to 
provinces in cash and tax points will be 4.4 per cent lower next 
year than it is today.
<P>
	By comparison, the drop in federal spending will be 7.3 per 
cent. To put it in another perspective, the reduction by the 
second year will equal only about 3 per cent of all provincial 
aggregate revenues. We have hit ourselves harder than we are 
hitting anybody else.
<P>
	There are two other issues which are still outstanding: 
unemployment insurance and support for the elderly. I will 
touch on them very briefly.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Sometime this year, the Minister of Human Resources 
Development will be tabling legislative proposals to put in 
place, based on the best features of the UI program, a reformed 
program the emphasis of which will be on assistance rather than 
dependence.
<P>
<B>(1220) </B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	This reform will take place in 1996 and will reduce the size of 
the program by a minimum of 10 per cent. For 1996-97 this 
means the reform will secure savings of $700 million. I will 
choose another time to speak about the payments to the elderly.
<P>
	This may be a difficult budget in some ways but the optimism 
with which Canadians received it last night and today shows that 
we are on the right track and that we have the support of the 
country.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean-Paul Marchand (Québec-Est, BQ):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I listened with interest as my hon. colleague sang the 
praises of the latest budget, saying that this may be the 
opportunity we were looking for to act aggressively to put our 
fiscal house in order. But would he agree with me that this 
budget did not come down very hard on the banks and family 
trusts?
<P>
	All banks are asked to pay over the next two years is about 
$100 million. This is really not very much when you think that 
banks are the businesses that have turned the largest profits over 
the past five to ten years. Last year alone, the Royal Bank's net 
profit was $1.2 billion. And this is just one bank.
<P>
	In addition, by deferring changes regarding family trusts to 
1999, or five years down the road, the wealthiest segment of our 
society will have ample time to find another place where to put 
their money away to avoid any form of taxation. Considering 
that the government could have brought in perhaps as much as 
$1 billion from these trusts alone, does the hon. member really 
think that his government took firm and fair action?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Walker:</B> Madam Speaker, the hon. member raised two 
issues on which I would like to comment. First, with respect to 
family trusts, we have removed all tax advantages related to 
these trusts and reduced the allowed deferral under the 21-year 
rule. We are beginning immediately to take action on family 
trusts.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10129"> 10129 </A></B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	There are two questions under family trusts. One is the 
question of income dispersed to beneficiaries which is going to 
be changed immediately. The other is the question of the capital 
tax. The 21-year rule is effective in 1999 which is the time it 
takes given the fact that the Conservative government 
eliminated the rule. There had to be a few years to allow for 
adjustment. On the income issue we will begin immediately; on 
the capital issue we begin.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	On the other issue, the bank issue, we are raising a special tax 
on banks, which will bring in $60 million just this year.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	We think this is a great step forward. It will begin to deal with 
the banks on several issues we think they should be addressing 
immediately.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Pierre Brien (Témiscamingue, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, 
the hon. member referred to the transfers to provinces and said 
that, in his opinion, provinces would not be really affected, 
considering the cuts involved. This raises the whole issue of 
national standards. What will happen to standards?
<P>
	The budget makes several mentions to such standards, but 
they are not very clear. I wonder if the hon. member could give 
us his own view on that issue. In his speech, the Minister of 
Finance said, and I quote: ``Provinces will now be able to design 
more innovative social programs- programs that respond to the 
needs of people today rather than to inflexible rules''.
<P>
	Thus, and that is a step in the right direction, the minister does 
confirm that, in the past, there were some inflexible rules. But 
the sentence which follows is the one for which I would 
appreciate an explanation. It reads: ``However, flexibility does 
not mean a free-for-all''. That sentence appears in italics in the 
budget speech. What does the minister mean when he says: 
``flexibility does not mean free-for-all''?
<P>
	It means that the federal government will continue to exert 
some control. Yesterday, the Minister of Human Resources 
Development, who was participating in a radio show with me, 
said that before the government had no control over funds but 
that would now change because the federal government would 
define standards, in co-operation with the provinces.
<P>
<B>(1225) </B>
<P>
	We all know what joint standards mean. Therefore, I wonder 
if the hon. member could explain the statement to the effect that 
flexibility does not mean free-for-all.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Walker:</B> Madam Speaker, I thank the member for his 
question. This area is both old and new in Canadian politics, that 
is to say, how do we transfer money to the provinces?
<P>
	Essentially the federal government's strategy since the 
mid-1960s has been to have a program called the Canada 
assistance plan. It allows the provinces to access money freely if 
they fulfil certain federal conditions. In the 1977 EPF program, 
we said to the provinces that they would have block funding for 
post-secondary education and health as long as they conformed 
to the Canada Health Act.
<P>
	In several discussions going back to the early 1980s the 
provinces have been asking for greater flexibility in the Canada 
assistance plan to enable them to design more innovative social 
programs. At the same time there is the feeling at the national 
level by many national interest groups that as one moves about 
the country support for post-secondary education is varied. The 
types of services available under the Canada assistance plan are 
varied.
<P>
	We have said to let us go back to the first principles. Let us 
move toward a way in which we can give the provinces a wider 
range of flexibility through social transfers. At the same time, as 
a national government we have to make sure we are true to the 
principles we want as a Liberal government. Through the budget 
consultations which normally take place when the budget laws 
are introduced, we will have an opportunity to discuss it. I am 
sure the ministers of finance and social policy as well as the 
prime minister will want to talk about it.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Jane Stewart (Brant, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, I would 
like to congratulate the parliamentary secretary on his speech 
and tell him how much I enjoyed working with him on the 
Standing Committee on Finance.
<P>
	He made reference to the fact that the work of the committee 
had a big impact on the minister and the results of his budget. I 
agree that I could see a direct reflection in the budget of the 
recommendations made by the committee and the details 
provided to us by individual Canadians. The committee 
provided an important venue for Canadians to participate in the 
debate on the budget which is so important to them.
<P>
	Does the parliamentary secretary expect that the Minister of 
Finance will continue this participative process with the 
Canadian public? Will the minister ask the committee yet again 
to be involved in the process as we prepare for our next budget?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Walker:</B> Madam Speaker, it is going to be a much more 
elaborate process next year, in a good sense of the word 
elaborate. We all learned something last year. I think we would 
like to start a little earlier.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10130"> 10130 </A></B>
<P>
	The consultations by the finance committee is a House order. 
We are mandated by the House to do these consultations. We 
will continue with them.
<P>
	I can also point out that the government itself has changed the 
way that departments produce their budgets. Each committee is 
now going to be involved with the budget preparation. We are 
going to build upon last year's success. We are going to have a 
very strong process. The finance committee will be the centre of 
it, but unlike this year, we will not be the only participants. I 
welcome the work of other committees to make sure we improve 
the budget on an annual basis.

<P>
	<B>Mr. Ghislain Lebel (Chambly, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I want 
to ask the parliamentary secretary if he shares my impression to 
the effect that there is very little in terms of job creation 
programs. The Minister of Finance is somewhat like a 
discouraged unemployed worker who sells his tool box because 
he feels he will never find another job.
<P>
	I do not see any job creation initiatives in this budget. Rather, 
I am under the impression that the minister is selling his wood to 
pay for his stove. There is something wrong in all of this.
<P>
	Can the parliamentary secretary tell us what miraculous 
solutions he sees to promote job creation?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Walker:</B> Madam Speaker, last year we announced our 
infrastructure program. That program enabled us to create many 
jobs and implement many projects.
<P>
<B>(1230) </B>
<P>
	This budget will allow us to pursue our job creation efforts 
right across the country. I am convinced that our strategy will be 
successful.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> I have the honour of 
welcoming the Leader of the Opposition among us, once again.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> 
Madam Speaker, 16 months after the October 1993 election, the 
government just made a very sharp turn. Indeed, the government 
has now stopped claiming, as it did for most of 1994, that there 
was no real fiscal crisis in Ottawa and that it could just surf on 
the wave of economic recovery, a wave which largely came from 
south of the border.
<P>
	When a country with a debt as huge as ours anticipates, as the 
federal government did in its February 1994 budget, a reduction 
of its deficit based on totally extravagant assumptions regarding 
interest rates, that does not reassure anyone, let alone creditors, 
whether in Canada or abroad. Because of the irresponsible 
action of the federal government, these creditors have become 
the true masters and judges of Canada's fiscal position. Since 
the Canadian government needs foreign lenders, the latter have 
had ample opportunity, in recent months, to signal the end of the 
party. A weak dollar and high  interest rates are two phenomena 
that have become inseparable. At this very moment, real interest 
rates are among the highest we have ever known. The cause is as 
straightforward as it is shocking: by March 31, 1995, the federal 
debt will be $546 billion or 73.2 per cent of GDP. If we add to 
this what the provincial debt will be on the same date, $210 
billion, the total equals 102 per cent of GDP.
<P>
	This means that a country as rich as Canada has practically 
lost its monetary and budgetary autonomy. One third of federal 
revenues, $42 billion, will be spent this year on servicing the 
debt.
<P>
	Perhaps I may digress at this point because there is a comment 
I would like to make. Two billion more or less may not be that 
important, but I was nevertheless surprised when in his speech 
on October 18, 1994 before the Standing Committee on Finance, 
the Minister of Finance evaluated debt charges for 1994-95 at 
$44.3 billion, and then reduced this to $42 billion in his budget 
yesterday, although interest rates had gone up considerably 
since October 1994, something no one could have foreseen. This 
is rather interesting, and I have a distinct impression that the 
Minister of Finance occasionally lets politics, with a small p, 
play a part in his financial forecast. Yesterday's budget is 
certainly no exception. So much for that.
<P>
	Our creditors snapped their fingers and, lo and behold, the 
little red book drafted by the same Minister of Finance went up 
in smoke. Cuts in social programs, providing for a surplus in the 
UI account that will be allowed to rise above $5 billion, the 
savage downsizing of cash transfers to the provinces: none of 
this was on the red book's agenda.
<P>
	On this side of the House, we talked about cutting the fat in the 
federal apparatus, a possible reduction in the defence budget, 
and getting rid of tax shelters and duplication of services by the 
federal government and the provinces. On the other side of the 
House, they just laughed and said somewhat condescendingly: 
Sure, we know the Bloc wants to dismantle the federal 
government. You want to cut $6 billion from the government's 
operating budget, plus 2 billion from the defence budget, while 
Canada spends less on defence than any other NATO country. 
Now be sensible! That is what they told us not so long ago.
<P>
	Yesterday, the Minister of Finance told us we were right. In 
three years, non statutory spending by federal departments will 
be cut by $9.8 billion, in real dollars. Better late than never, 
although the many targets of the government's program review 
do not necessarily deserve the kind of treatment they get in the 
budget, a budget that takes a hard line on social programs and 
tries to manipulate the public.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10131"> 10131 </A></B>

[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Listening yesterday to the Minister of Finance I was reminded 
of a song by Dinah Washington at the end of the fifties. Some 
members may remember <I>What a difference a day makes</I>, a nice 
soft ballad. Yesterday's budget could have been subtitled: 
``What a difference a year makes''.
<P>
<B>(1235) </B>
<P>
	Remember last year. Who was talking about the debt crisis, 
the fat in the federal government, the wasteful overlapping 
between federal and provincial governments, and so on? Was it 
the Liberals? Of course not. They were all or almost all singing 
together from their bible, the red book. The Prime Minister was 
saying: ``What debt crisis? Canada is okay''. A year later, 
sobered by the money markets which are now calling the 
shots-he who lends to the piper calls the tune-the same 
Liberals are cutting with a vengeance.
<P>
	The objective of a 3 per cent deficit to GDP ratio, the alpha 
and the omega of budget discipline in the red book, has become a 
simple marker on the way to a balanced budget. No date has been 
set aside for this new objective, but one senses that the Minister 
of Finance would like to get there as soon as possible and, I 
would add, at almost any cost.
<P>
	For example, he becomes lyrical on the possibility that the 
deficit could be below $19 billion in the 1996-97 fiscal year. I 
would like to sound a note of caution here for two different 
reasons.
<P>
	The first one refers to that inscrutable thing we call the future. 
The future has a way of messing things up. The Minister of 
Finance knows this very well. Just last year his interest rate 
forecasts were solidly off base barely two months after the 
budget was brought down in the House. Who predicted the 
Mexican crisis which began last December 21? Nobody, 
publicly anyway. On December 20, if we believed the pundits, 
Mexico was doing fine.
<P>
	I am told that economists like many other respected 
professionals tend to follow the herd. This explains, at least in 
part, why their forecasts are very often interchangeable and 
consistently miss the turning points. All recessions have been 
predicted after the fact. To be more precise, one can feel 
uncomfortable with the budget assumption about real GDP 
growth. Last year the GDP growth assumptions for 1994 and 
1995 were 3 per cent and 3.8 per cent. The first one 
underestimated it by a wide margin for it finally was 4.3 per 
cent, thanks in part to the strength of the American economy.
<P>
	This year the assumption for 1995 is the same as last year, 3.8 
per cent. This sounds a little strange in view of the fact that 
interest rates are projected to be so much higher this year than 
was anticipated last year. Already there are signs that high 
interest rates are biting into consumer demand. We certainly 
cannot exclude the possibility of 2.5 per cent real growth this 
year. In such a case the Minister of Finance's plan will be set 
back.
<P>
	But there is another reason for our caution. Real expenditure 
cuts are one thing and the program review is supposed to deliver 
them. However there are other cuts in the budget which rather fit 
in the smoke and mirrors category.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The budget stresses the importance of a second set of 
reductions involving cuts in transfers to the provinces. Transfer 
payments basically cover three different programs: the Canada 
Assistance Plan, Established Programs Financing, which 
includes health care and post-secondary education, and 
equalization. Their treatment is not necessarily the same. The 
federal government's calculation of these payments not only 
includes cash payments but also the revenue yielded by tax 
points transferred to the provinces under cost-sharing 
agreements. This makes the federal government look good. 
However, it has no control over what the provinces make of 
these tax points and can certainly not take them back: there was 
never any question of its doing so. What the federal government 
controls are cash transfers, and how they change is the true 
measure of federal fairness.
<P>
	Here is where the federal government strikes a real blow. 
Convinced that, and I quote from the budget speech: ``At 
present, transfers under the Canada assistance plan come with a 
lot of unnecessary strings attached, which limit the flexibility of 
the provinces to innovate'', the federal government decided to 
combine them with the established programs financing into a 
single program, as of 1996-97, to be known as the Canada social 
transfer.
<P>
<B>(1240) </B>
<P>
	This program will continue to include, in federal accounting, 
both tax points and cash transfers. And, for the federal 
government, this is the beauty of the thing. For three reasons.
<P>
	The first reason is that this arrangement means a significant 
reduction in cash transfers, which are the only real expenditure 
for the federal government, and it means the government can 
show financial markets a more impressive record in deficit 
terms, while presenting a different image to Canadian public 
opinion, and this is the second advantage, thanks to the tax point 
transfer being included in the calculation.
<P>
	Also according to the budget speech, and I quote: ``This 
means that the total of all major federal transfers to the 
provinces in 1996-97 will be 4.4 per cent lower than they are 
today. That compares favourably with the reduction in spending 
in our 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10132"> 10132 </A></B>
<P>
own backyard-that is, everything except transfers to the 
provinces-which will be down 7.3 per cent by that same year''.
<P>
	The third advantage of launching the Canada social transfer 
lies in the date of ignition: not this year, but early in 1996-97, in 
other words, after the referendum. This point is revealing, 
unintentionally, of course, but revealing nonetheless. If this new 
program were so beneficial to the provinces, including Quebec, 
and if it really demonstrated the flexibility of Canadian 
federalism, should it not be operational by the start of the new 
fiscal year, that is by April 1? This way, Quebecers could 
examine the quality of the merchandise with their own eyes 
before making their historical choice in the referendum. In 
actual fact, there is no chance in the world this will happen. We 
will see why. All provinces are concerned.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	All provinces are directly concerned about the impact of the 
new Canada social transfer. If one looks at the cash transfers that 
come with it on page 33 of the budget speech, one sees the 
unvarnished truth.
<P>
	From 1994-95 to 1996-97 cash transfers from this program 
will fall from $17.3 billion to $12.9 billion, a $4.4 billion drop. 
One needs to take into account equalization grants, which 
increase from year to year, to obtain the global picture for 
transfer payments to provinces. When one does so there is still a 
drop of $3.6 billion in federal transfers to provinces over a 
two-year period. As a matter of fact this represents a real 14 per 
cent decline, not the theoretical 4.4 per cent the Minister of 
Finance would like us to believe, hence a more drastic decline 
than the one experienced by total federal program spending.
<P>
	Who is going to be fooled by the pretence of such a program to 
define a more decentralized federal system when its sole motive 
is to cut federal spending? A last proof, if need be, that this is not 
a one-shot program but rather a constantly vanishing one. The 
global sum-fiscal and cash transfers-is available for the 
Canada transfer program in 1997-98 but not the cash transfer 
separately.
<P>
	However, having both fiscal and cash transfers separately for 
each year from 1994-95 to 1996-97 makes it quite easy to 
produce a good estimate for the cash transfers part in 1997-98. 
It amounts to about $10.3 billion or $2.5 billion less than in 
1996-97. Flexible federalism, maybe, but for whom?
<P>
	This cut in the Canadian social transfer to the provinces 
represents more than 40 per cent of the reduction in federal 
program spending between 1994-95 and 1996-97. It allows the 
federal government to trumpet the achievement of a less than 
$25 billion deficit in that last year. It may or may not raise 
eyebrows in the money markets, but it is almost certain that 
many provinces will have to accept higher deficits in order to 
cope with the cold wind blowing from Ottawa.
<P>
<B>(1245) </B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	For Quebec, there is more to come and there is worse still. 
Information on cash transfers both before and on 
implementation of the Canadian social transfer shows that 
Quebec will suffer a net loss of nearly $700 million in 1996-97 
alone. For 1997-98, the loss will amount to nearly $2 billion. In 
view of this, the budget speech is rather comic if not somewhat 
ludicrous. I wondered how the finance minister could have kept 
from laughing when reading to this House the part of his speech 
praising the innovative approach the provinces could take from 
now on in managing their social programs.
<P>
	His composure and self-control must have been seriously 
tested when he read the following passage, and I quote: ``With 
the Canadian social transfer, provinces will now be able to 
design more innovative social programs-programs that 
respond to the needs of people today rather than to inflexible 
rules''. And he continued, deadpan as ever, and I quote again: 
``However, flexibility does not mean a free-for-all''. The 
federal government is creating a program which will take $2.5 
billion from Quebec over three years, but wait, that is not all. 
There are still standards to be met. Big Brother is cutting and 
keeps on cutting, but is still issuing orders. Is this stupidity or 
sheer arrogance?
<P>
	It takes a lot of nerve to speak to the provinces in such a tone, 
just before tying them up in a financial straitjacket. Good news, 
the minister tells them, I am cutting $7 billion but at the same 
time I am letting you use your imagination. The budget and the 
minister do not say so, but we know very well how provincial 
leaders will have to use their creativity. They will have to be 
creative in devising new cuts to services and racking their brains 
to prevent their deficits from ballooning out of control.
<P>
	This will be a merciless process, with a domino effect causing 
one level of government to fall after another. But in the end, the 
taxpayer will bear the brunt of it all. For the unemployed, the 
poor, the sick, the minister's skilful manipulation of figures and 
evasion of responsibility will result in awfully concrete 
realities: a reduction in unemployment insurance benefits, the 
elimination of assistance programs, reduced health insurance 
coverage. That is without counting seniors, who will be 
informed of the results of the minister's review of their old age 
pensions next year, after the referendum. At the very least, 
seniors must be thinking that when a Minister of Finance 
reviews a social program, it is not to see whether he can increase 
funding.
<P>
	Then, there is the more specific issue of fairness toward 
Quebec in the implementation of certain programs. I am 
thinking in particular about the farming sector. Quebec's dairy 
farmers have been hard hit by a 30 per cent cut in dairy 
subsidies. No compensation.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10133"> 10133 </A></B>
<P>
	Farmers from the west are faced with the elimination of the 
Crow rate, a grain transportation subsidy. However, they are 
being very generously compensated by non-taxable cash 
payments. Double standard. Regrettably, there is another case. 
We will talk more about the other cases in the next few days. 
In the defence sector, for example, a recent study found that 
Quebec is getting $600 million less per year than the share of 
military contracts and spending it would get if its share were 
weighted according to its population.
<P>
	Six hundred million dollars per year, and to top it off, Quebec 
does not have its quota of Canadian military bases. Already, it is 
getting short shrifted out of defence spending, should it not get 
its fair share of military bases? So what does the budget say? 
Another Quebec military base, Saint-Hubert, will be closed and 
staff at another, in Bagotville, will be cut. You may reply that 
there will also be cuts in the rest of Canada. No. Of course there 
will be cuts elsewhere, the scale is already off kilter. The latest 
decisions only tip the scale more in their favour. Even if we take 
transfer payments into account in comparing the current 
situation with the situation that will be created once the new 
transfer payment arrangements are implemented, we must draw 
the same conclusion.
<P>
<B>(1250) </B>
<P>
	In Quebec, federal transfers are going to shrink away: $7.4 
billion today; in three years, $6 billion. Another paragraph from 
the budget seems to predict even darker hours: ``So we are 
prepared to address those issues by funding CAP in a similar 
way as we fund the existing EPF transfers for health and 
post-secondary education''. This statement is very ambiguous. 
Quebec receives approximately 35 per cent of CAP's funds and 
some 25 per cent of EPF transfers. But if demographic 
considerations take precedence over those of real need in 
calculating the Canada social transfer, the result will of course 
be an additional shortfall of several hundreds of millions of 
dollars for Quebec.
<P>
	One paragraph in the budget plan suggests that such a 
reorientation is not beyond the realm of possibility. One of the 
justifications given for the new Canada social transfer is as 
follows, and I quote: ``Federal expenditures will no longer be 
driven by provincial decisions on how, and to whom, to provide 
social assistance and social services''. This looks very much 
like a pulling back from a more socially oriented approach.
<P>
	And what better time to point out the very real asymmetry of 
Canadian federalism? If the federal government does not like 
the provinces forcing its hand, it could draw a line and withdraw 
beyond it. But for decades the provinces, particularly Quebec, 
have had to bow to the wishes of the federal government, with no 
power to keep it from interfering. It is probably in the field of 
health that this relative powerlessness of the provinces is the 
most in evidence. The budget states in no uncertain terms that 
the federal government will make increasingly smaller 
payments for health costs, while ordering the provinces, who 
already carry the bulk of the financial burden, to meet the 
standards set out in the Canada Health Act.
<P>
	Less for health, less for social assistance, less for the 
unemployed. When we know that the elderly now account for 40 
per cent of all health care needs, and that this proportion will 
continue to grow, we can only conclude that this budget marks a 
change of direction in social policy that could indeed be 
described as harsh and insensitive. Is Canada so poor, is social 
solidarity so fragile that the poorest and most helpless in our 
society must bear the brunt of the necessary fight against public 
waste?
<P>
	However, this change in social policy will not take effect 
tomorrow but only a year from now. The government is trying 
not only to impress the financial community but also to 
influence the results of the referendum by postponing until after 
the Quebec referendum all projects it is about to cut and slash. 
When will it clear-cut transfer payments to the provinces? In 
one year. New UI restrictions? They will be discussed in the fall 
and start in July 1996. What about the debate on income security 
for seniors? In the fall, with major changes already proposed for 
implementation at the beginning of 1997, particularly for the old

	One does not need to be a rocket scientist to realize that the 
federal government is playing the waiting game. It would dearly 
love to see the referendum take place tomorrow. But how could 
anybody decide now between two fundamental options when the 
federal side does not want to clarify its position on all those 
dossiers that it is keeping in its bosom? Does it think Quebecers 
have forgotten about May 1980? The trap was sprung once. It 
will not happen a second time. I say to those in front of me: 
``Clear the air. Show us what you have up your sleeve. The 
people want to know what you are going to offer them''.
<P>
	One thing at least is clear. All the hoopla about the budget led 
some to believe it could rekindle the flame of a new federalism 
where the federal government would retire from provincial 
jurisdictions and send the appropriate fiscal resources to the 
provinces. For many people the deception must be all the more 
cruel. The idea of a dominant central government and of 10 
``infeodated'' provinces is as present as ever.
<P>
<B>(1255) </B>

[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Canadian federalism encompasses financial and regulatory 
powers. For a long time, the federal government enjoyed both 
types of powers. Today, because of its meddling, it lacks 
financial power. That is why it holds on to regulatory powers in 
the name of a certain conception of the Canadian ``nation'' that 
the people of Quebec have always rejected. If the federal 
government manages to shift a significant part of its  deficit to 
the provinces, it will clean up its finances, at others' expense, of 
course. It is already thinking about it, as the budget clearly 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10134"> 10134 </A></B>
<P>
shows. Many observers feel that there is an automatic link 
between the federal debt and the distribution of powers. Things 
are not so simple. Reducing the size of government is one thing, 
but a genuine decentralization is something else. Clearly, the 
federal strategy is to do the former without a serious 
commitment to decentralize and therefore without a coherent 
vision of the future relationship between Quebec and the rest of 
Canada. That is the budget's main lesson. It is probably a history 
lesson but for reasons that are the opposite of those put forward 
by the author.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ronald J. Duhamel (Parliamentary Secretary to 
President of the Treasury Board, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, I am 
pleased to rise today to speak to the budget.
<P>
	Our position is very clear. International markets have reacted 
favourably to this budget. Of course, the Reform Party feels that 
the cuts do not go deep enough. They wanted the government to 
slash more deeply. We remember the so-called budget they 
tabled a few days ago-I say so-called budget because it did not 
generate any positive comments. They tabled this document to 
convince Canadians that they were competent enough to bring 
down a budget. All this so-called budget did was to propose 
deeper cuts across the country.
<P>
	And then this morning, the Bloc, the official opposition, said 
that we cut too much or not enough. I listened to their speeches 
with a great deal of attention and I am not sure that I know what 
they want. What do they want: more cuts, fewer cuts, different 
cuts? I do not know.
<P>
	I have just heard a comment to the effect that the Bloc's 
suggestion that the size of government should be reduced was 
held holding to ridicule by the Liberals, and now we are told that 
we have finally realized that there was some fat to trim after all 
and made cuts. Is there not a glaring contradiction between these 
statements?
<P>
	It seems to me that there is a glaring contradiction. If I am 
wrong, my hon. colleagues will no doubt ask questions and 
clarify their position. I would be only too happy. We find 
ourselves today stuck between the far right and the left-I would 
even say the far left at times. This is not a bad position at all.
<P>
	What do the people of Manitoba have to say about this 
budget? I thought my hon. colleagues from both opposition 
parties might like to know. One paper ran the headline:``Grits 
Axe Spending''. Another headline reads: ``Western 
Diversification to Get New Look''; this is positive feedback. 
This one says: ``Social Safety Net Rescued'', a quote from the 
Minister of Human Resources Development.
<P>
<B>(1300) </B>
<P>
	And it goes on. ``Tough Plan Boosts Buck, Raises Hopes''. 
These words were not written by Liberals, I assure you. Also, 
``Federal Budget Turning the Corner''. And this one, from 
Manitoba: ``Budget Draws Applause''. So, the response is 
generally positive in Manitoba. I can see my colleagues from the 
Bloc Quebecois are just thrilled by this positive response. I will 
list more positive responses in a moment.
<P>
	I know how appreciative my colleagues from the Bloc 
Quebecois are when I mention them in my remarks, pointing out 
their glaring contradictions, demonstrating that the whole 
country, except for the official opposition party, can see some 
good in the budget just tabled. It is not just good, it is beyond 
being plain good.
<P>
	As you know, this is a tough but fair budget. Not one region or 
group of individuals is affected unfairly. Many people are 
affected, but can you say they are treated unfairly? If so, please 
let me know.
<P>
	The Minister of Finance made a special effort to distribute 
budget cuts equitably amongst the various regions. I must add 
that this budget takes necessary steps, and I stress the word 
necessary, to bring the deficit under control. These are the most 
severe budget measures taken by the federal government in fifty 
years. This will ensure that the deficit is going to be brought 
back to 3 per cent of the GDP by 1996-97.
<P>
	Consequently, the budget exceeded the expectations of 
international traders. I should add that this is not the budget of a 
Conservative government. This budget does not make 
indiscriminate cuts: it redefines the role of the government, so 
that every department can concentrate on the priorities of 
Canadians. This is something important. We are going to do 
what we have to do.
<P>
	I do hope that Bloc members will be pleased to see that, 
following the implementation of the measures announced in the 
budget, overlap and duplication will be reduced. Bloc members 
will surely be pleased to hear that, since they talk so much about 
that issue.
<P>
	Moreover, unlike the previous Conservative budgets, we did 
not target the poor, absolutely not. The Liberal Party of Canada 
made a commitment regarding social programs.
<P>
	Later this year, the Minister of Human Resources 
Development will table a bill on a significantly revamped UI 
program designed to better meet the needs of all Canadians.
<P>
	Our government is also determined to provide fair, financial 
protection to our seniors, who have made such an important 
contribution to this country's development.
<P>
	There is more. As I mentioned earlier, this is a tough budget 
but, according to most observers, it is also fair. To reach our 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10135"> 10135 </A></B>
<P>
objective of deficit reduction, the following measures take 
effect immediately. That is very important.
<P>
	First, the tax rate for large corporations goes up from 0.2 per 
cent to 0.225 per cent. As well, the surtax rate for companies 
increases from 3 to 4 per cent. Together, these two measures will 
generate additional revenues of $260 million annually. All large 
companies with capital assets exceeding $10 million will be 
affected by this tax rate increase.
<P>
	The budget also provides for a temporary increase of the 
capital tax for banks and other large deposit institutions 
mentioned in Part VI of the Income Tax Act. That additional tax 
will bring in $100 million over a period of 20 months.
<P>
<B>(1305) </B>
<P>
	Another issue often discussed here in this House was that of 
family trusts. They were decried, but we are dealing with this 
problem. Family trusts will be eliminated as of January 1, 1999. 
The choice allowing one to postpone capital gains taxes 
according to the 21-year rule will be abolished.
<P>
	The cancellation of that choice given the preferred 
beneficiaries will prevent people from using the trusts as an 
income splitting tool, a most profitable procedure.
<P>
	My friends from the other side will no doubt be happy with 
these very progressive and, above all, fair measures. I can see it 
in their smiles. This is a measure they will applaud and praise.
<P>
	There is no provision for income tax increases in this budget. I 
am surprised my colleagues have not commended on that. I am 
surprised they only pick out items that, according to them, will 
embarrass government.
<P>
	I am also surprised that my colleagues from the other side 
have not mentioned that for each tax dollar, government 
programs will be reduced by $7. I am enormously surprised they 
have not mentioned one outstanding and very important point, 
which is fundamental to the process launched by the 
government, the fact that we ensure a simple and reasonable 
financing which will allow us to meet the needs of Canadians 
while cutting programs that are not absolutely essential.
<P>
	I am also surprised they did not talk about RRSPs, an issue 
where we certainly found a reasonable solution. As you know, 
there were people on both sides: those who did not want any cuts 
and those who wanted RRSPs to be practically eliminated. What 
did the government do? It cut a little; they will be frozen and 
increased by 1,000 $ every year. Well-off people will be those 
mostly affected. I would have thought that my friends of the 
Bloc would have at least indicated that this was a step forward. 
Perhaps they will do so later on.
<P>
	No taxation of dental and medical health programs. As you 
know, we all received letters from citizens throughout the 
country who did not want these programs to be taxed, and they 
were not. I would have thought that my colleagues across the 
way would have had  something nice to say about that. Perhaps 
they forgot. It is quite likely that they will mention that very 
soon.
<P>
	This morning I read various press clippings from everywhere 
in the country. I would like to quote some of them so that 
Canadians know about the feelings of people who are not in 
politics, who do not belong to any political party in the 
opposition, who are looking at it in a rational way in order to 
give Canadians some advice.
<P>
	Here is from <I>The Gazette</I>: ``Belt-tightening Impresses 
Markets''. How interesting. And ``Ottawa aims to shrink deficit. 
Big spending cuts, modest tax hikes will be used to save $13.6 
billion''.
<P>
	There are others, and I know that my colleagues really 
appreciate the fact that I am sharing with them a rational point of 
view. The <I>Globe and Mail</I> says: ``Family Trust to Lose 
Deferment''. And it goes on, Mr. Speaker. ``Department 
Spending Reduced by 19 Per Cent'', <I>Le Devoir</I>, February 28. 
How interesting.
<P>
	Then, a headline in <I>The Globe and Mail</I> says: ``Ottawa Axes 
Business Handouts. Subsidies Being Cut by Nearly $2.3 Billion 
over Three Years''.
<P>
<B>(1310) </B>
<P>
	Here, on the same page: ``Women's Programs Dodge cuts''. 
Surely, my colleagues are going to rise in favour of that 
measure. Let me go on. In today's edition of the <I>Ottawa Citizen</I>, 
one can read: ``Environment Groups Offer Rare Praise to 
Government''. How interesting.
<P>
	Let me continue: ``Average Consumer Escapes Brunt of 
Budget''. That can be found in today's <I>Gazette</I>. The <I>Toronto Star</I> 
says: ``Liberals Cut Where Tories Didn't Dare''. How 
interesting, Mr. Speaker.
<P>
	Let me continue further. Jeffrey Simpson writes, in <I>The Globe 
and Mail</I>: ``A Fine Start in Attempting to Escape the 
Deficit/Debt Trap''.
<P>
	And on the other side of the page, still in the <I>Gazette</I>: 
``Historic Budget Slays the Herd of Sacred Cows''. Then in 
today's edition of <I>La Presse</I>, one can read: ``L'économie peut de 
nouveau respirer''. That means that the economy can breathe 
again. ``Martin Budget Good First Step, but Canadians Still 
Face Tough Decisions''. It is true, indeed. But it is a step in the 
right direction.
<P>
	Finally, and this is quite interesting, in a press release, 
chartered accountants say that they give 4 out of 5 to the federal 
budget. Four out of five!
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10136"> 10136 </A></B>
<P>
	This morning, opposition party members were giving us 
perhaps 1 or 2 out of 5. I am surprised that they did not find 
anything good about the budget. It is beyond me. I know that 
some people would like to find us to identify issues close to 
their hearts and would like to make recommendations to 
improve the situation with regard to those issues. I understand 
that and I respect that. That is the role of the opposition. 
However, I do not understand why they cannot find anything 
positive in the whole budget. It is beyond me.
<P>
	One thing that also surprises me about the Bloc is that they 
think that there is a federalist hiding behind each reduction and 
each operation. They say that it must be a prereferendum 
strategy, that, yes, there is something there, that there has to be 
something there. They think that even if there seems to be 
nothing, there is surely something. They imagine that there is a 
federalist lurking behing each comma, each period, each word, 
each sentence.
<P>
	The budget is reasonable, fair and tough and it is also 
sensitive to regions. When you take the position of the far 
right-
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	That is the Reform Party. I talk about the extreme right, the 
Reform Party. The Reform Party came forward with ``a budget''. 
Of course I did not see one positive comment from any 
responsible journalist across the country on it. The fact that it is 
going to sit here and criticize this budget perhaps lacks some 
substance in credibility.
<P>
	Again I would invite its members if I am wrong to correct me. 
I would invite them as well to suggest how this document can be 
improved. That is the challenge I offer my colleagues from both 
opposition parties, the official opposition as well as the third 
party.
<P>
	Do not just stand there and shoot at this budget. Stand up and 
make sound recommendations so that it can be improved for the 
benefit of this nation and for the benefit of all Canadians. That is 
the challenge.
<P>
	I spent some time in opposition. I rather enjoyed it I must 
confess because one has a responsibility obviously to critique 
that which comes forward. That is fair. Surely the responsibility 
goes beyond simply taking particular issues where one feels that 
the government might be vulnerable or where one feels one 
might have a political advantage. I accept that. However, it goes 
beyond that and one has a responsibility to make concrete 
suggestions.
<P>
<B>(1315) </B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	To my friends from both parties on the other side of this 
House, I would like to offer this challenge. We have a number of 
days to debate this budget and make progress. Criticize all you 
want in a constructive manner but please, make suggestions that 
will improve what has been proposed. Make suggestions which 
will meet the  needs of Canadians everywhere and allow us to be 
much more sensitive than we might have been if we had not had 
a chance to share your ideas and your political wisdom had you 
chosen to use those qualities for something else than attacking 
this budget. I underline that it has been well accepted up until 
now throughout the country, but even more important, on 
international markets.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier-Montcalm, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I would like to say to the hon. member for 
Saint-Boniface that if we were smiling on this side, it is simply 
because we are always astonished to see how a government 
member can turn a deaf ear to politics with a small ``p'', as the 
Leader of the Opposition said earlier.
<P>
	When the hon. member says that we have found no positive 
elements in the budget, it is not true. I wish he had understood or 
listened completely to the speech that the leader of the Official 
Opposition gave earlier. My friend would have seen that the hon. 
member for Lac-Saint-Jean referred to some positive things. 
However, this budget does not go far enough. It contains 
inequities, and I will mention only three to the hon. member for 
Saint-Boniface because my time is limited.
<P>
	The member for St. Boniface says he saw nothing unequitable 
or unfair in this budget. First, does he think it is fair to cut $32 
million from subsidies paid to Quebec farmers and dairy 
farmers and to give western farmers $2.9 billion to compensate 
them for cuts that are, relatively speaking, identical? Does he 
think such a cut is fair? He also mentioned family trusts. Is it fair 
to wait until 1999 to take action in this area?
<P>
	By 1999, there will be no more money in family trusts. Those 
persons will have found other tax shelters to protect themselves. 
The budget should have addressed this issue immediately.
<P>
	Finally, does the member think it is normal that banks, among 
others, be taxed a mere hundred million dollars when a single 
bank, the Royal Bank, made more than $1.2 billion in profits last 
year? Is it normal? Is it fair? I would like to hear what the 
member for St. Boniface has to say on those issues.
<P>
	By the way, the member for St. Boniface quoted headlines 
from some newspapers in his riding. I suppose he should have, 
as a French speaking member, chosen at least a few headlines 
from French newspapers in his riding. I do not know. Maybe 
francophones are less well served in his province than in 
Quebec.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Duhamel:</B> Mr. Speaker, I will start with the last 
comment. No French papers were published last night or this 
morning. That is why I did not quote any.
<P>
	As for French speaking citizens of my province, yes, indeed 
there have been very positive improvements. I do believe that 
the constituents in my riding are well served by their federal 
member and their provincial member, as well as their municipal 
councillor, since we are all French speaking. We will see. 
Eventually we will have to go back before the electorate. I was 
elected in 1988, and again in  1993, and I might get elected again 
in 1997 or 1998. We shall see. I will let my constituents pass 
judgment, rather than my friend from the Bloc Quebecois.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10137"> 10137 </A></B>
<P>
	I might add, however, that I thought it was a bit mean on his 
part to argue that I only quoted English newspapers from 
Manitoba. I repeat that none in French were published this 
morning.
<P>
	When I went through the press clippings, I quoted some in 
French which praised the government for the budget. I took what 
I could find. I will find some more and I will pass them on to 
you, so you can read them and perhaps change your opinion.
<P>
<B>(1320) </B>
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> I hesitate to interrupt the 
hon. member for St. Boniface, but I want to make sure that all 
comments are made through the Chair, and that hon. members 
do not use ``you'', or ``vous'' in French. Hon. members must 
address the Chair.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Duhamel:</B> As for the three specific questions on cuts in 
the west versus those in the east, you know, Mr. Speaker, the 
people from the west-Mr. Speaker, I thank you for having 
reminded me to address my comments to the Chair because it is 
my intention to do so.
<P>
	That is the problem with Bloc members. They are like that 
sometimes. It is sad because there are people, men and women, 
who are very broad-minded when they want to- Here is what 
Westeners are saying: We had a 100 per cent cut, while in the 
east they suffered a cut of only 30 per cent.
<P>
	This is how people think. One member said that they would 
receive compensation. Of course, but if their subsidies are 
totally eliminated, perhaps it is only right for them to be 
compensated.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, they do not want to consider this: compensation 
for having lost 100 per cent of their subsidies. But a 30 per cent 
reduction is not fair. Members should think about it.
<P>
	As for family trusts, we are the first government to act on the 
issue.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bellehumeur:</B> Are you?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Duhamel:</B> Patience. You see, Mr. Speaker, they want us 
to do everything today, even when they are not ready. In fact, 
this government will ensure that it is done, but without being 
unreasonable. When we decided to cut transfers, we did not say 
right now, as of midnight tonight. We are giving people time to 
adjust to the change. It is the sensible way to go about it. We did 
not smash everything at once with the government's big 
hammer. We are kind. We are giving them time to adjust.
<P>
	As far as banks are concerned, $100 million is a lot more than 
what I have presently in my bank account. It might be a 
significant percentage of their revenues. Could it be higher? Of 
course, it could. What will the impact be? If we were to increase 
it a lot more, will it have a negative impact on job creation? The 
problem is  that they refuse to look at all the other sides of the 
medal. They only look at one. They keep on referring to 
something people dislike, such as the banks' huge profits, and 
they try to exploit it. I do not find this very honest on their part.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ray Speaker (Lethbridge, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the hon. 
member for St. Boniface read from a number of newspaper 
articles and quoted a variety of sources that commended 
somewhat the budget but not in a conclusive way. It was said that 
it is a good first step but Canada faces challenges.
<P>
	One of the major challenges that Canada and individual 
citizens face is the fact that the government, in its first period of 
administration, by 1996-97 will have placed in the laps of 
Canadians another $100 billion in debt without any plan, 
without any indication that there is finality or an appointed time 
at which that debt will stop accumulating and growing. There is 
not one mention or indication at all to Canadians that it is going 
to stop.
<P>
	Does the hon. member after all of his fine pronouncements 
have the answer to the question when the deficits will stop 
accumulating on the debt? Then Canadians will know the finite 
sum of our debt, at which point we will have to deal with it.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Duhamel:</B> Mr. Speaker, I welcome the question. First, I 
am delighted that my colleague acknowledges there have been a 
number of newspaper articles-I remind myself I am not 
supposed to use those as props-that have seen the budget rather 
favourably. They said not only is it a good first step but that it is 
going in the right direction and that we are going to get there.
<P>
	There is supposedly no plan. That is not accurate. I know my 
colleague is a honourable person and he is not trying to suggest 
anything Machiavellian. There is plan. We have indicated in the 
red book that 3 per cent of GDP was our objective. Once we have 
attained that then we are going to eliminate the deficit and start 
attacking the debt. My colleague knows that.
<P>
<B>(1325) </B>
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, you know that this other Mr. Speaker is aware of 
that which I speak. There is a plan. It is as plain as one's nose on 
one's face, and particularly plain when I talk of myself in that 
way. There is a plan. We will reach that objective. Subsequent to 
reaching that objective we will eliminate the deficit, attack the 
debt, and the country will be on a sound footing.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. René Canuel (Matapédia-Matane, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
a brief comment. This budget is a little bit like venom to which 
sugar has been added to make it easier to swallow. Why is it that 
measures dealing with family trusts have been delayed until 
1999, and that nothing is said about measures aimed at senior 
citizens?
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10138"> 10138 </A></B>
<P>
	If transfers to the provinces are cut, and this is my question 
for the member for St. Boniface, how could it not affect the 
least fortunate, the poorest members of society? Back home, 
farmers are going to suffer a great deal. The 15 per cent cut 
this year added to the 15 per cent cut next year is going to hurt 
them tremendously. Some of them told me this morning that 
they could hardly manage as it was, and that with these new 
cuts, it was going to be hell. How can you claim that this is 
not like venom?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Duhamel: </B>Mr. Speaker, I wish to thank the hon. member 
for his question. Of course, the budget will hurt some 
Canadians. Let me repeat that this budget is tough, but fair. I do 
not think that it is harder on any particular group.
<P>
	There is another consideration. If I am wrong, what can we do 
collectively to try and counteract this? Now that a decision has 
been made, what can we do? Asking the reasons for a delay 
serves no purpose. We all know that, often, consultations must 
be held. We cannot simply say: ``There, it is done.'' In other 
cases, time must be given to adjust to new measures. This is, in 
my opinion, a reasonable approach.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Before the hon. member 
begins, in the last intervention we heard from the parliamentary 
secretary. He referred to the hon. member for Lethbridge by his 
name. Of course we know that is not a practice which is 
customary. However, I know full well that when I am in the chair 
and he refers to Mr. Speaker he is not speaking to himself.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ray Speaker (Lethbridge, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, in my 
former life as a member of the Alberta legislature I ran into the 
same sort of circumstance. I appreciate being recognized in the 
House and having the opportunity to enter the budget debate 
today.
<P>
	Yesterday I listened very carefully and considered what the 
Minister of Finance presented as the government's plan for 
Canadians. We heard in the last election about the plan that was 
going to change everything for Canadians and fix all the 
problems. During that campaign we were presented with the red 
book that supposedly had all the answers to all the questions. 
The problem is that red book is now out of date and does not 
answer the questions. The red book principles were applied to 
the budget plan that was presented to us yesterday. It is not good 
enough for Canadians.
<P>
	Why is it not good enough? First, if I had to define the budget 
and describe it, I would say that it is a budget without any 
conclusion, without any direction and without any real 
resolution of the major problem that Canadians are facing, a 
major problem that is only being enhanced and encouraged by 
the government.
<P>
<B>(1330) </B>
<P>
	When I say that there is no conclusion, I think of the Minister 
of Finance in his former responsibility in his private life where 
he had a fleet of boats on the Great Lakes. The hon. member 
would never have put a boat on the lake and said: ``It sits there. I 
do not know where it is going and I have no conclusion as to the 
destiny of that boat''. He would not do that. Nor would anybody 
tell a story without having a conclusion to that story so that we 
understood where the story was leading us as it was being told to 
us. This budget does not have its conclusion.
<P>
	What was the conclusion that we were waiting for as 
Canadians? I heard it through the media. The member for St. 
Boniface has said to us as he quoted a number of articles about 
the budget that people were responding in a certain way.
<P>
	In the last week to 10 days Canadians, people in the 
investment community and the media had one question that was 
paramount in their minds: when will the deficit be eliminated? 
When will that deficit come to zero?
<P>
	The answer to that question was not in this budget. That has 
had a devastating effect in my mind on the confidence of 
Canadians investing in this country. We do not know where 
interest rates are going to go, what the value of the dollar will be. 
We do not know the type of revenue growth that we are going to 
have because there is a lack of confidence. This government did 
not have the will nor the courage to put its administration on the 
line and set up a plan that would reach a proper conclusion, one 
that must be dealt with in this country.
<P>
	What did we get out of that budget? As I said a few moments 
ago as I raised a question in this House, we are left with $100 
billion of added debt to the current debt in this country.
<P>
	In three years of administration of this government by the 
time we get to 1996-97, $100 billion will be added to the debt. 
Interest payments from 1994-95 to 1995-96 have gone from $42 
billion up to $49.7 billion, over $6 billion in one year of 
additional cost in terms of our interest.
<P>
	The following year, in 1996-97, are those interest costs going 
down? No, they are not. They will be $50.7 billion. We can 
imagine what that does to the budget, how that affects social 
programs, how that affects other priorities, how that is going to 
affect this government in its decision making in terms of 
expenditure reduction, of reducing the services of the federal 
government to the Canadian people.
<P>
	The interest cost is out of hand and is going to continue 
because there is no plan, there is no conclusion in this budget. 
What happens after 1996-97? That is a serious question. This 
government does not know what is going to happen.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10139"> 10139 </A></B>
<P>
	It says that maybe in 1996-97 the deficit can go down to $19 
billion, that the 3 per cent target is $25 billion. If we get there 
then we are okay in Canada. That is not true. All we need is 
a bit of a recession and the $25 billion deficit will start to 
balloon again up to $25 billion, $30 billion, $40 billion, $50 
billion. What is the consequence?
<P>
	The consequence is that we could add another $100 billion 
very quickly to the accumulated debt of this country. It will not 
only be in 1996-97, $603 billion as the Minister of Finance told 
us yesterday. Most likely by 1998-99 it could be $700 billion. 
Where then is our interest cost and where is the economy of 
Canada? We are in a disastrous position.
<P>
<B>(1335) </B>
<P>
	This governments says do not worry, it is going to be okay, 
that it is going to come up with a plan to deal with it, it has two 
years of administration to do something. It has not done 
anything. In this House we wasted the fiscal year 1994-95 by a 
do nothing budget. This budget is not much better when we clear 
away some of the rhetoric that we heard. Do we know what the 
real expenditure reductions are-$4.1 billion of expenditure 
reduction. It is heralding it as a great success.
<P>
	By the time we reach the conclusion of this Parliament or the 
fiscal year 1996-97, that is not much of a start in dealing with 
the deficit. We are going to pay the consequences. The softer we 
are, the liberal approach that we are using is not going to work 
very well and Canadians are going to pay.
<P>
	I want to make one more point in my last two minutes. Who 
pays for this? We are laying on our children and on the future 
generations of this country at least another $100 billion in debt. 
That is a crime.
<P>
	This government stands up here and says in this budget that it 
did not increase personal income tax. Think of the increase in 
personal income tax on our next generation. That is only a few 
years down the road. It will have to pay to pick up this 
accumulated debt. Think of the imposition that this government 
has laid on its shoulders, another $100 billion which is its 
responsibility; not the Conservatives, which was the last 
government, it is its responsibility.
<P>
	Think of the increase in personal income tax that is going to 
happen. Think of the corporations that will have to flee this 
country because they cannot pay the amount of taxes that will be 
imposed on them by, who knows, the next Liberal government or 
another government that has to come in and deal with the 
circumstances.
<P>
	That is the crime in this budget. That is the absolute crime. 
Like never before we need a Reform budget, the taxpayers' 
budget, which said very clearly to Canadians that taxes should 
not be increased at this time. That is number one. Number two, 
we must reduce the expenditures so that the deficit is brought to 
zero within a three-year period.
<P>
	This is the responsibility that we should be taking in this 
House, not this soft hand approach that has been used and one 
that is leading us into terrible circumstances for the future 
generations of this country.
<P>
	I think that has to be taken into consideration. If the 
government does not, it has to live with the crime. Its members 
have been the cowards not to deal with the problems that face 
them, and future generations will look back at this very difficult 
time that was not dealt with in a responsible way by this 
government.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Julian Reed (Halton-Peel, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
very curious to know what kind of discombobulated crystal ball 
my friend had that he looks into and is able to predict the future 
four or five years down the road.
<P>
	I expect he predicted the decline of the Mexican peso. I 
suspect four years ago he predicted an anticipation of feared 
inflation in the United States which would raise interest rates.
<P>
	I expect he must know the answer to when the budget will be 
balanced ultimately. The minister has taken a position, right or 
wrong, that he wanted to do it in two-year leaps, in two-year 
packages, for the simple reason that he had a better chance of 
predicting what was going to happen in that time.
<P>
	As we all know, they did not all pan out the way they had been 
originally predicted. By what curious vision does my hon. friend 
express the question or bring the challenge to the government 
that somehow we should be able to say in <I>x</I> number of months or 
<I>x</I> number of years the budget will be ultimately balanced? My 
friend may be surprised that it may end up being balanced before 
both he and I expect.
<P>
<B>(1340) </B>
<P>
	I would like to know how he projects into the future in the way 
he seems to be doing.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Speaker (Lethbridge):</B> Mr. Speaker, in all of the 
presentations we make, whether it is policy or pronouncements 
in this House, our whole objective is to look forward, not 
backward. Perhaps that is the difference between the Liberals 
and the Reform Party.
<P>
	We all know that when we do forecasts there is a certain 
amount of risk. When we have the responsibility of government 
we have to make the best possible projects as we can.
<P>
	It is obvious that this government is going to reach its 3 per 
cent of GDP and leave us with a $25 billion deficit in 1996-97. 
That is obvious. I think it is going to do that. That is not a tough 
target. That is number one.
<P>
	Number two is at that period of time we will have added, as I 
said, $100 billion more to the accumulated debt. That is obvious 
and predictable.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10140"> 10140 </A></B>
<P>
	Number three, after following that, has this government the 
will to make some kind of projection so that it brings the deficit 
down to zero? Does it have confidence in itself that it will bring 
the $25 billion in 1996-97 down to a zero base within the next 
two years? If the government thinks it can, why does it not say 
it?
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> The member is splitting 
his time with his colleague from Capilano-Howe Sound. I give 
an undertaking to the member of the official opposition seeking 
the floor on a question or comment that if he should so choose on 
the next intervention I will recognize him.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Herb Grubel (Capilano-Howe Sound, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I think that without malice it is useful on the occasion 
of this budget to recall what Liberals used to say on such 
occasions: ``The budget cuts of $6 billion out of general 
government programs are slash and burn. They will lower the 
quality of government services that Canadians expect from their 
federal government as a matter of sacred trust. The firing of 
42,000 civil servants is heartless and without compassion''. The 
Liberals would have said it destroys forever the sanctity of 
labour contracts, it is equivalent to union bashing.
<P>
	The biggest indignation Liberals in opposition would have 
reserved would be for the close to $4 billion cuts in transfer 
payments. They would have said: ``It will make it impossible to 
enforce national standards on health and higher education and; 
heartless and without compassion on welfare. This is the 
proverbial slippery slope where Ottawa and the upholders of 
standards of compassion will lose their grip. The country will 
fall apart. It will become just like the United States. Oh, my god. 
There will be beggars on the street. The poor will have to 
commit crime. People no longer feel like Canadians because 
when they move from one province to another they will get 
lower welfare rates, can you imagine that, inferior universities 
and different health standards''.
<P>
	They would say the deficit problem is being solved on the 
backs of the poor, those least able to defend themselves. The 
Liberals in opposition would have said the gasoline tax increase 
is a tax grab and regressive because of all those with lower and 
middle incomes who have to use their cars to go to work. Worse, 
the tax measures did not tax the allegedly obscene profits of 
banks. They did not raise the tax on the rich or expropriate 
wealth by an inheritance tax.
<P>
	The finance minister when he was in opposition used daily 
question period to ask the government to lower interest rates. He 
now refuses to. He did not order the governor of the Bank of 
Canada to lower interest rates and the debt burden. What is 
wrong?
<P>
<B>(1345) </B>
<P>
	I am sure the Liberals when in opposition would have used 
this opportunity to remind the government of broken election 
promises. The regressive, expensive, annoyingly complicated 
GST is still there and will be used to grab another $2 billion from 
Canadians, many of  whom are poor. There is still no new day 
care facility. NAFTA is sucking jobs to Mexico.
<P>
	The rat pack would have hurled the ultimate insult at the 
opposition. They would have said: ``They are slowly eating their 
red book''. For a summary indictment, these Liberals would 
have used: ``This budget sounds like the agenda of right-wing 
think tanks and horror or horrors, like the program of the Reform 
Party''. We proudly say that this is so.
<P>
	I am not a Liberal and I will not use these slogans to criticize 
this budget. Its shortcomings are fundamental and frightening 
for anyone familiar with history and the power of compound 
interest.
<P>
	During the 1980s my economist colleagues and I would sit at 
the lunch table at Simon Fraser University. We discussed the 
successive budgets of Michael Wilson, who sounded just like 
Paul Martin-like the present Minister of Finance. I apologize, 
Mr. Speaker.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> I would like to remind 
members to not refer to one another by name, but by riding or 
ministry.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Grubel:</B> Mr. Wilson would say: ``We had to face financial 
reality. We had to take tough measures that will transform the 
way the Government of Canada works. In doing so we have 
turned the corner. We have stabilized the debt to GDP ratio. The 
next budget will bring it down. We are well on the road to fiscal 
sustainability''.
<P>
	I will never forget how we all agreed that the stabilization of 
this ratio during prosperity was not enough. Spending and tax 
measures to achieve this objective during prosperity will result 
in deficits once a recession hits again. We were right at that 
time, not as a matter of ideology, but of simple economic 
principle.
<P>
	This budget is déjà vu all over again, except this time there are 
absolute spending cuts rather than Wilson's magic reductions in 
previously inflated plans for spending increases. These cuts 
represent a truly major achievement for which most of the credit 
must go to the Minister of Finance and some of his colleagues.
<P>
	The tragedy is that these cuts are too little and too late. With a 
debt of $550 billion these absolute cuts achieve the same 
objective as did Wilson's phantom cuts when the debt was half 
that size.
<P>
	The cuts of $10 billion in program spending just about match 
the $9 billion in higher debt service charges on the planned debt 
level over the life of this budget. The expected increases in 
revenue due to prosperity and tax measures amount to a 
staggering $12.7 billion. Yet, these revenue increases only keep 
constant the debt to GDP ratio.
<P>
	These facts represent the key to understanding my negative 
views of this budget. Let me repeat them.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10141"> 10141 </A></B>
<P>
	The cuts of $10 billion, however wrenching they may have 
been, just about match the required increases in debt payment 
of $9 billion on the planned increased debt over this period. The 
expected increases in revenue due to prosperity and tax 
measures amount to a staggering $12.7 billion. Yet, these 
revenue increases only keep constant the debt to GDP ratio.
<P>
<B>(1350) </B>
<P>
	The reason for this bottom line is that the biggest spending 
category in the budget, transfers to persons, which amounts to 
$37 billion is to remain unchanged. The debt to GDP ratio will 
never be lowered during prosperity unless this spending 
category is made to contribute its share to the solution of the 
country's crisis.
<P>
	Investors who determine the fate of the dollar and the 
Canadian interest rate will look at the bottom lines that loom 
behind the rhetoric and brave actual cuts. They will ask why 
transfers to persons are unchanged. They will remember the 
traditional Liberal slogans recalled above and will connect the 
two. They will not be assured.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, I hope for the sake of Canada and my children 
and yours that my diagnosis is wrong and that Reform will never 
be able to say we told you so.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean-Paul Marchand (Québec-Est, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
in listening to my hon. friend I do not know whether he is going 
forward or backward. He does give me the impression that he is 
definitely going backward.
<P>
	Unfortunately there are some things I have to agree with. He 
does speak to the fact that this government has not really been 
firm enough in reducing the deficit which is already 
astronomical. It does not take a rocket scientist to recognize that 
the longer we delay in resolving the issue, the more pressure we 
are putting on future generations.
<P>
	It is the youth of this country who will have to pay. We are 
being nice to ourselves by not really being more firm but that is 
where I do not agree with this hon. member. I do not share his 
lack of feeling and lack of compassion toward people who are 
getting the screw when there is latitude to demand for example 
that the banks contribute a bit more.
<P>
	Would my hon. friend agree with me that it is unfair to ask that 
banks in Canada contribute $100 million over the next couple of 
years when we know they have been making incredible profits 
over the past few years? The Royal Bank last year made $1.2 
billion net profit. We are asking these banks to contribute only 
$100 million and we are cutting and slashing social programs. 
Does he think that is fair?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Grubel:</B> Mr. Speaker, I believe on economic policy one 
has to take the longer run view. It does not do to penalize success 
like the banks have had now for a year or so after having 
absorbed huge losses for many years. If we do this kind of thing, 
we will drive out investment in Canada.
<P>
	Investment in Canada is the source of our prosperity. It is the 
only source that will raise our living standards by increasing 
productivity. Without it, it is not possible. Even new technology 
needs investment to be introduced.
<P>
	I do not share the judgment that it is wise for the longer run 
fortune of this country to say to anyone, be it a bank, a 
corporation, a professional, a gambler, anybody who has had 
success: ``You are not allowed to keep it because there are some 
people out there who did not invest, who did not have luck, who 
did not work as hard. They have to get their money from us''.
<P>
	This is not what has made this country great and it is not what 
will keep this country prosperous. The Reform Party and 
certainly I will forever defend the system that has gotten us to 
the standard of living to which we have proudly become 
accustomed.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dennis J. Mills (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister 
of Industry, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I listened to the member's 
remarks and noticed that he wanted to make some serious cuts to 
the social security program spending.
<P>
<B>(1355 ) </B>
<P>
	I have always believed that our responsibility in this Chamber 
is not to spend all of our time focused on those who are 
advantaged but to primarily make sure that governance always 
has a focus on those in our community who are disadvantaged.
<P>
	I want to read directly from the taxpayers' budget in brief. 
Under unemployment insurance cuts which is currently $15.6 
billion the member is proposing a cut of $3.4 billion by the end 
of the third year.
<P>
	Does the member honestly feel that it is good public policy 
when people are in such a very difficult circumstance of not 
having a job to take almost a 22 per cent decrease-those are the 
member's own calculations-from those people who are going 
through a very difficult period, specifically being unemployed? 
Is that good public policy?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Grubel:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the member for raising this 
important point. The OECD issued a report in which it said that 
Canada's unemployment insurance system is an outstanding 
example of excessive generosity. The Auditor General has a 
graph which I recommend to the hon. member. It documents this 
generosity.
<P>
	If someone in the United States earns $100 and goes on 
unemployment, he gets $20. In Europe if he earns $100 and goes 
on unemployment, he gets $30. Does the hon. member know 
what a person gets in Canada according to the Auditor General? 
He gets $60, twice the European amount. Is there any 
heartlessness in taking on the suggestions by the OECD and the 
Auditor General to reduce this excessive generosity a little bit?
<P>

	<B>Mr. Ron MacDonald (Dartmouth, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, today 
marks the last day of Black History Month.
<P>
	As the member of Parliament for Dartmouth I am proud to say 
that I represent the largest indigenous black communities in 
Canada, in Preston, North Preston, Cherrybrook and Lake Loon. 
The Preston communities have a rich and compelling history. It 
has contributed greatly to the culture of Nova Scotia and indeed 
all of Canada. Unfortunately for the rest of the country, much of 
this cultural heritage has been unwritten, instead being passed 
on from generation to generation by word of mouth.
<P>
	Students of Cole Harbour High have sought to change this by 
using modern communications technologies. As a project for 
Black History Month students have created a site on the 
Internet's world wide web to give millions of computer users 
across Canada and around the world a glimpse of this rich 
heritage.
<P>
	I ask the House to join with me in congratulating the students 
involved in this project for their tremendous efforts to bring 
Nova Scotia's black history to the world.

	<B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup, BQ.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, we cannot accept that, in his budget, the Minister 
of Finance is once again attacking the poor while leaving 
untouched the tax privileges enjoyed by the rich in our society.
<P>
	That approach, which proposes no tax reform, perpetuates 
inequities. There is nothing in this budget to eliminate the tax 
treaties signed with countries considered tax havens, thus 
allowing large corporations to avoid taxes. There is nothing as 
well about flags of convenience used by Canadian shipowners 
and the government itself so that they can employ foreign sailors 
who pay no taxes to Canada.
<P>
	To top it all off, the Minister proposes to tackle family trusts 
only in 1999, while rich families use this loophole to avoid 
paying their fair share to the government. As radio anchorman 
Joël le Bigot said, if you hit the humble, you are ready for the 
federal government.

	<B>Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
yesterday the finance minister delivered his budget and in so 
doing missed a glorious opportunity.
<P>
	Canadians want hope. They want truth. They want leadership. 
But where is the hope when we discover that the compound 
interest on the deficit the finance minister is projecting, on top 
of our already huge debt, will cancel out the savings from the 
cuts announced by the minister? The minister could not even 
muster the strength to tell us when we will have a balanced 
budget.
<P>
	Canadians want the truth. They want to know what will 
happen to their social programs as compound interest continues 
to eat up an ever larger share of their tax dollars simply because 
the government could not make the hard decisions in the budget. 
On this issue the minister is silent.
<P>
	Finally, they want leadership. They want a government that 
will make personal sacrifices. Canadians resent a government 
that cuts the public service, ups taxes and allows overspending 
to jeopardize old age security but does not have the character to 
give up what is the richest, most extravagant pension plan that 
taxpayers' money can buy.

<P>
	<B>Mr. Solomon:</B> Mr. Speaker, this budget leaves farmers 
reeling in western Canada. It has the effect of a hurricane on 
agriculture. It will leave a trail of destruction and devastation 
throughout rural Canada.
<P>
	It will cost rural families one-third of their net income and 
one-third the value of their land. Farmers work hard to put food 
on our tables and only ask to be treated fairly. The Liberal 
government responds by attacking farmers with ruthless cuts.
<P>
	The minister of agriculture has betrayed rural Canadians by 
taking away the Crow benefit, reducing dairy subsidies by 30 
per cent and abandoning more rail lines.

	Farmers are now trapped between dwindling incomes and 
little prospect of selling their farms. The treatment the 
government has shown to rural Canada is unforgivable and will

Mr. Speaker, Guelph-Wellington residents wanted responsible 
deficit reduction and spending cuts and the Minister of Finance

<P>
	They know it is easy to cry for cuts but more difficult to 
ensure that any deficit reduction is fair and equitable. The 
budget ensures fairness. They know it is easy to criticize, but 
more difficult to make the good and necessary decisions which 
the government has made. They know that it is easy to release 
figures and offer ideas based on principle rather than reality. 
Yesterday's budget recognizes that deficit reduction will affect 
the lives of real people.
<P>
	The people of Guelph-Wellington are not looking for the 
easy solutions found in 1-900 numbers and cable programs. 
They believe in this country and our ability to overcome our

	<B>Mrs. Madeleine Dalphond-Guiral (Laval-Centre, BQ):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, yesterday, the Chrétien government announced in 
its budget that it intends to cut pensions-
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> Dear colleague, please do not use the name of 
the hon. member.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Dalphond-Guiral:</B> Yesterday, the Liberal government 
announced in its budget that it intends to cut old age pensions as 
early as 1997. The budget tabled yesterday is proof positive that 
the biggest threat to old age pensions and social programs comes 
from the federal government, not the Quebec government.
<P>
	Judging by the government's actions, this direct attack on the 
elderly, the unemployed and welfare recipients is only just 
beginning. The chairman of the no side, Michel Bélanger, who 
has been trying to scare people by saying that the nasty 
separatists want to cut old age pensions, must truly be 
disheartened.
<P>
	We are anxious to hear his perceptive analysis of the federal 
budget.

	<B>Mr. John Duncan (North Island-Powell River, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the Auditor General recently stated some program 
spending of the department of Indian affairs fails to meet 
strategy objectives, exhibits management inadequacies, lacks 
appropriate performance and evaluation information and thus 
impedes accountability.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10144"> 10144 </A></B>
<P>
	In addition, the department has not published an annual report 
since 1992. This deprives us of an opportunity to properly 
scrutinize efficiency of program delivery.
<P>
	The federal budget calls for spending reductions in all federal 
departments except for Indian affairs. The government is asking 
Canadians to share in deficit reduction yet is increasing 
spending by 12 per cent over three years for Indian affairs. Much 
of Indian affairs' program spending is outside of constitutional, 
legal or policy commitments.
<P>
	Given these concerns, the budgeted increase in Indian affairs 
funding is unacceptable and unfair.

	<B>Mr. Harold Culbert (Carleton-Charlotte, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the Minister of Finance tabled the government's 
budget yesterday. This budget, along with the one tabled in 
1994, established the challenge and goal of the government: to 
bring the deficit and debt under control.
<P>
	Canadians have requested and supported a combination of 
cuts in government spending and the continuation of our agenda 
of jobs and growth: growth that has led the G-7 countries over 
the past year and growth that will continue as a result of this 
strong budget.
<P>
	The measures taken in the budget ensure we will reach our 
deficit target of 3 per cent of gross domestic product that was 
outlined last year.
<P>
	The minister has produced a fair and equitable budget to 
provide social programs for Canadians' needs and the spending 
reductions they require.
<P>
	Congratulations to the Minister of Finance for his dedication 
to controlling the deficit and debt and building the confidence of 
all Canadians.

Speaker, this has been a tough budget but it had to be done. And 
true to our commitment it has been done fairly.
<P>
	The best time to make cuts is during periods of growth. In the 
agricultural sector, prices are increasing, export markets are 
expanding and producers are in an excellent position to adapt to 
change.
<P>
	The buyout of the Western Grain Transportation Act, the 
WGTA, with tax benefits, will put $2.2 billion in the hands of 
prairie farmers this year. We will ensure those dollars are paid 
out in a fair and equitable way.
<P>
	I am confident that the men and women of Canadian 
agriculture will continue their proven track record of adapting to 
the constant changes of their industry to ensure that Canada 
remains a world leader in agricultural production.

want to congratulate the Minister of Finance for the excellent 
budget he tabled yesterday. It seems that the money markets 
were pleased with the resolve the minister showed in his fight 
against the deficit and their reaction was quick.
<P>
	Indeed, the Bank of Montreal, the Laurentian Bank and the 
mouvement des caisses populaires Desjardins have already 
announced a reduction in their prime rate. In light of this initial 
reaction we can expect a drop in mortgage rates in the short 
term, which will contribute to a much needed recovery in the 
construction industry.
<P>
	Such good news should reassure Canadian consumers and 
sustain our present economic growth. Congratulations to our 
Minister of Finance and to our government for sticking to their 
commitments.

	<B>Mr. Roger Pomerleau (Anjou-Rivière-des-Prairies,

Ottawa in this referendum year.
<P>
	Far from proposing a decentralisation of powers, yesterday's 
budget shows that Ottawa still refuses to retreat from areas of 
provincial jurisdiction. In fact, Ottawa seems determined to step 
up its interventions, particularly in the area of job training.
<P>
	The only thing the federal government has transferred to the 
provinces is the deficit. With yesterday's budget the federal 
government has tried to shift the burden of the deficit to the 
provinces: $2.5 billion next year, $4.5 billion the year after.
<P>
	The federal government wants to delay until after the Quebec 
referendum the bulk of the cuts in transfers to the provinces and 
in federal services to the public. That would be the real cost of a 
``no'' in the referendum, the real cost of the status quo.

	<B>Mr. Leon E. Benoit (Vegreville, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
Reformers have always recognized the need to cut government 
spending and the need to empower people to take care of 
themselves when they are able to do so. Reformers also believe 
that before cuts are made, barriers should be decreased and 
flexibility increased so that people are able to do well in a freer 
market setting. Farmers share this vision.
<P>
	Yesterday Department of Agriculture spending was cut 
substantially. Farmers and industry leaders say these cuts will 
be difficult but recognize they are necessary.
<P>
	I am concerned however that in moving toward a more market 
driven system, the government has not removed regulatory 
barriers and has not allowed for increased efficiencies. Without 
these changes farmers and industry will be crippled instead of 
strengthened by these funding cuts.
<P>
	In order for farmers to adapt to new fiscal realities they need 
stability, predictability and certainty. Farmers need the freedom 
to recoup some of the losses incurred by this budget. The 
government has failed to deliver.

<H2 ALIGN="CENTER">ORAL QUESTION PERIOD</H2>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="THEBUDGET">THE BUDGET</A></H3>
	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, in its prebudget marketing blitz, the government 
announced that it would table a budget for a new Canada. The 
Minister of Foreign Affairs even went as far as to say, with a 
reformist zeal very uncharacteristic of him, that the status quo 
would no longer be an issue after the budget. However, what the 
promised decentralization really boils down to is Ottawa 
continuing to withdraw its funding for health, post-secondary 
education and welfare.
<P>
	My question is for the Prime Minister. Where is this new 
Canada that was announced with great fanfare when all the 
government did yesterday was to offload $7 billion or so more 
onto the provinces?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, in the budget tabled yesterday, we decided to give 
provinces much more flexibility in the administration of their 
programs and we are trying to improve the situation for 
everybody. It will be easier for provinces to establish their 
programs themselves, provided they respect the aspirations of 
all Canadians, that is that there be minimum programs for all 
Canadians so that the dignity of persons will be respected across 
Canada. I think this budget reflects the willingness and capacity 
of this government to propose changes.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition, BQ.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, how can the Prime Minister have the audacity to 
claim that while depriving provinces of $7 billion he gives them 
more flexibility and more capacity to innovate in social 
programs, when provinces already have an extremely difficult 
time dealing with their growing expenses in the areas of health, 
social assistance and education?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, provinces had been asking us for a very long time to 
remove certain conditions which applied to the administration 
of social assistance programs, and that is what we are now 
proposing.
<P>
	As for health care services and the five conditions set in the 
federal Health Act, everybody in Canada agrees that they should 
be maintained because they are the very essence of our society 
and they give people access to the same health care system, 
regardless of one's financial circumstances.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10146"> 10146 </A></B>
<P>
	In any case, we had to be fair in our budget. We could not 
cut federal government's operating expenditures systematically 
and not cut transfer payments to provinces. It is only a matter 
of treating all government programs fairly.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, the Prime Minister said he tried to be fair in his 
budget. I wonder if he was thinking of Quebec when he said that, 
because criteria in documents of the Department of Human 
Resources Development already indicate that Quebec will bear 
the brunt of transfer payments reductions, with 41,7 per cent. Is 
that fair? Quebec is being taken to the cleaners.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Loubier:</B> Yes, 41 per cent. Some fairness. Talk about 
fairness.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bouchard:</B> How can the government display that kind of 
arrogance, given the duplicity of its present attitude, on the one 
hand, proclaiming its determination to maintain the principles 
of universality and accessibility, and on the other, drastically 
cutting its contribution to programs?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, program spending is being reduced at all government 
levels. Last December, if I am not mistaken, members of the 
present Quebec government, the opposition leader's friends, cut 
$600 million from health programs. We are doing the same, 
because cuts are necessary and all levels of government must 
benefit from those cuts.
<P>
<B>(1420) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, in his budget, the finance minister announced that all 
transfer payments to provinces would be rolled into a single 
comprehensive transfer called the Canada social transfer. He set 
at $7 billion the amount of additional cuts in transfer payments 
in the next three years, but he did not specify how those 
payments would be distributed in 1997 and subsequent years.
<P>
	How can the finance minister decide on such drastic cuts in 
transfers and casually postpone discussions with provinces?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional 
Development-Quebec, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, it is not a question 
of putting off the discussions. We are willing to initiate them 
tomorrow if the provinces are ready. This is quite clear. In fact, 
we said so during our meeting with the finance ministers. I 
invited the provincial finance ministers to join me immediately 
after the budget speech, and I am ready to meet them anytime 
they want. There is no question of postponing the discussions.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, by postponing, as the minister says in the budget, the 
negotiations with the provinces on the distribution of transfer 
payments, is the Minister of Finance trying to conceal from 
Quebecers before the  referendum the negative impact of the 
new Canada social transfer because it is Quebec which will lose 
the most, 41 percent of the transfer payment cuts in 1997?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional 
Development-Quebec, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, to begin with, the 
figures mentioned by the member are totally false.
<P>
	Second, if you want to know, the cuts in Quebec, in 1994-95 
and 1996-97, will amount to $350 million. These are not 
ridiculous figures like the ones mentioned by the member.
<P>
	As for the discussions and the fact that he believes we will 
postpone them until after the referendum, we said in the last 
budget that we would inform them instead of surprising them 
like the former government did.
<P>
	Is the member suggesting that we should proceed 
immediately? I believe Mr. Campeau will not be very satisfied 
with that.
<P>
	Third, tell us when the referendum will be held, let us hold it 
and then we will be able to solve our problems.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, in yesterday's budget the Minister of Finance pledged 
to get the federal deficit down to $24.3 billion by 1997.
<P>
	Meanwhile officials of the Department of Finance have been 
predicting to reporters and the financial markets that the deficit 
will then be reduced to zero by the year 2000.
<P>
	However, yesterday's budget was silent on the all important 
question of how the minister proposes to get from a deficit of 
$24 billion to zero in three years.
<P>
	Will the minister tell Canadians and tell the House today how 
he plans to get the deficit from $24 billion a year to zero: by 
increased taxes, by cuts to social programs or by both?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional 
Development-Quebec, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have said 
countless times in this House that in terms of government by far 
the best way of hitting targets is through a series of short term 
targets that keep government's feet to the fire.
<P>
	That is by far the best kind of spending control that any 
government can have. It is the reason that we hit our target this 
year. It is the reason that we are going to hit our target next year 
and it is the reason that we are going to hit our target the year 
after.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10147"> 10147 </A></B>
<P>
	I will tell members what this government does not want to 
do, and that is bring in a budget like the Reform Party did based 
on phoney assumptions and false input which does not attain 
its objectives.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the fundamental flaw in the minister's answer is the 
same fundamental flaw that was in his budget yesterday.
<P>
	It does not come clean about the imminent threat to Canada's 
social programs from rising interest payments. Under the 
minister's budget plan program spending will be reduced by $12 
billion over three years, yet the interest on our debt will grow by 
$13 billion to $51 billion a year in 1997. The reality is that the 
interest payments are growing faster than the ability to either cut 
or raise revenue.
<P>
<B>(1425 ) </B>
<P>
	My question to the finance minister, and this is just looking 
for a straight figure, is can he tell Canadians how many billions 
of dollars per year they will be paying in interest in the year that 
the budget is finally valid?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional 
Development-Quebec, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the member 
opposite knows that his question is nonsense. We have said that 
we are going to get to a balanced budget through a series of short 
term targets and therefore obviously we are looking at the 
ultimate thing.
<P>
	I cannot believe that once again this party stands up and talks 
about preserving social programs when last week it brought 
down a budget which said that the ultimate purpose of it was to 
make sure that every poor Canadian stays poor and that the 
middle class becomes poor.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the minister claims that his budget protects social 
programs from unfair unnecessary cuts, but the real social cut is 
lurking in the massive unnecessary interest charges that this 
government is irresponsibly building by not attacking the deficit 
more quickly.
<P>
	This means that when Liberal social cuts come, as they will, 
they will be bigger and more desperate and more destructive 
than Canadians could imagine.
<P>
	Will the finance minister honestly admit to Canadians that he 
has put social programs in the gravest of jeopardy by failing to 
balance the budget more quickly when he had the chance?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional 
Development-Quebec, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the way to clean 
up this nation's finances is to bring in a budget that brings 
federal spending down from $120 billion in 1993-94 to $108 
billion by 1996-97.
<P>
	The way to deal with the nation's finances is to have program 
spending at 13 per cent of the total, which is the lowest number 
since 1951. The way to preserve social programs is to make sure 
that the party which said it would claw back the old age pension 
from people on the guaranteed income supplement never takes 
power.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Pierre Brien (Témiscamingue, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is directed to the Minister of Finance.
<P>
	The budget tabled yesterday provides for additional cuts of $7 
billion in payments to the provinces over the next three years. 
By transferring an additional $7 billion shortfall to the 
provinces, Ottawa is again downloading part of its deficit.
<P>
	Would the Minister of Finance agree that the additional cuts 
his government has ordered in transfer payments to the 
provinces will inevitably cause either a reduction in services to 
the public or an increase in provincial taxes or a combination of 
both?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional 
Development-Quebec, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, not at all. At our 
meeting with the finance ministers, they asked us, first, to give 
them at least one year's notice: no surprises. And we did that.
<P>
	Second, they asked us to cut our own spending first and to cut 
more than we would cut in payments to them. In 1996, for 
instance, there will be a 7.3 per cent cut in federal spending and 
only a 4.3 to 4.4 per cent cut in payments to the provinces. If we 
consider the province of Quebec, it is only $350 million 
compared with this year. So these cuts are less than 3 per cent of 
provincial revenues, and I think that is reasonable.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Pierre Brien (Témiscamingue, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
minister's figures are wrong. He is looking at total transfers, and 
he knows perfectly well he is only cutting cash transfers.
<P>
	Would the Minister of Finance confirm that the cuts in 
transfer payments to the provinces he ordered yesterday will 
result in a shortfall of over $2.5 billion for Quebecers, three 
years from now?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional 
Development-Quebec, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, compared with 
this year, it is $350 million.
<P>
<B>(1430 ) </B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Herb Grubel (Capilano-Howe Sound, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, during the 1980s Michael Wilson used to deliver 
budgets that contained the same rhetoric and projections of 
stable debt to GDP ratios as did the budget tabled yesterday. As 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10148"> 10148 </A></B>
<P>
analysts said then and are saying now, planning for stable debt to 
GDP ratios during prosperity is not sufficient.
<P>
	Why would not the next inevitable economic downturn again 
increase the deficit and once again put the country on the 
unsustainable path of a growing debt to GDP ratio?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional 
Development-Quebec, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the hon. member's 
premise is wrong. First, when Michael Wilson brought down his 
budget his cuts were not real. As the member knows, they were 
simply cuts from rising reference levels.
<P>
	Second, Michael Wilson did not do it according to any kind of 
vision of the country or sense of priorities. They were simply 
blind cuts across the board.
<P>
	Third, Michael Wilson never hit his targets and we have.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Herb Grubel (Capilano-Howe Sound, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, Michael Wilson was also in the very fortunate position 
of having had a debt of only $250 billion rather than $550 
billion.
<P>
	The absolute spending cuts of $10 billion in the budget just 
about match the expected increases of $9 billion in the cost of 
servicing the debt over the projected budget period. The 
expected revenue increases due to prosperity and tax increases 
amount to a staggering $12.7 billion.
<P>
	Does the minister expect similar spending cuts and revenue 
increases in the next budget to simply maintain the debt to GDP 
ratio?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional 
Development-Quebec, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, as the hon. 
member knows, in 1996-97 the debt to GDP ratio will not only 
stabilize but it will commence a downward track which, may I 
assure the member, is going to be permanent.
<P>
	The member has raised a very important question. The debt to 
GDP ratio is a very important target. It is one that we are very 
conscious of and we will keep it down.
<P>
	The member refers to the level of debt that I have to deal with 
compared to Michael Wilson. There is another difference 
between Michael Wilson and me. Michael Wilson had the good 
fortune to take over after a Liberal government. I had to take 
over after the Tories.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
government did not dare reveal in its budget its real intentions 
with regard to old age pension reform, preferring to put off yet 
again a study that was to be published last year.
<P>
	Would the Minister of Finance confirm that his government 
intends to reduce old age pension benefits for thousands of 
Canadians and in fact limit access to the plan for thousands of 
seniors?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional 
Development-Quebec, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, not at all. The 
answer is a definite ``no''. What we do intend to do is study the 
Canada Pension Plan fund with the provinces, and, at the same 
time I am sure, they will look at the Quebec Pension Plan fund, 
because it is this fall that the necessary revision will have to be 
made. It is perfectly natural to look at them all together, with the 
provinces.
<P>
<B>(1435) </B>
<P>
	I can assure you and I can assure the hon. member that we 
intend to protect those who are most vulnerable in our society, 
our senior citizens.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, you 
understand how surprising it would be if the Minister of Finance 
were to set up a committee to raise old age pensions. I would be 
very surprised.
<P>
	Will the Minister of Finance acknowledge that if he is not 
revealing the terms of his proposed old age security reform right 
now, it is because he does not want seniors to know his 
intentions until after the referendum in QQuebec?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional 
Development-Quebec, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, legislation has for 
a long time included a schedule to review the Canada Pension 
Plan fund and the Quebec Pension Plan fund every five years. 
We were not the ones who established the schedule. I repeat 
again, tell us when you will have the courage to hold the 
referendum; we will resolve the problem, and then we can go on 
with building the country.
<P>
	As you know, there are many issues to be resolved in Canada. 
The economy has to be managed, and perhaps I should ask the 
question once again. The great thinker of the great separatist 
movement, Richard Le Hir, stated that he was not ready to meet 
Quebec's liabilities as far as the debt is concerned. Is that the 
position of the Bloc Quebecois? Is there still a difference of 
opinion?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary North, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
Canadians were promised a plan by the government to preserve 
and protect our future social security while dealing with fiscal 
reality. They never received such a plan. Yesterday the budget 
promised yet another discussion paper from the Minister of 
Human Resources Development.

<P>
	My question is for the finance minister. Why should 
Canadians entrust social program reform a second time to a 
process and a minister who have done nothing but fail them in 
the past?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Human Resources 
Development and Minister of Western Economic 
Diversification, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the hon. member, once 
again with the hope of trying to obtain some kind of rhetorical 
response, does not know what she is talking about. I regret it 
because we are dealing with very serious matters.
<P>
	As the budget clearly outlined yesterday, we have clear plans 
and initiatives on social reform. There will be major legislation 
this fall on unemployment insurance. We established a new 
human resources investment fund in yesterday's budget that will 
give us the flexibility to begin initiating now many of the 
reforms that were proposed.
<P>
	We have already begun reorganizing the Department of 
Human Resources Development to begin to decentralize its 
delivery in a very different way so that we can begin to end 
duplication and overlap. We have initiated a new transfer 
program that will again eliminate duplication and overlap with 
the provinces.
<P>
	It seems to me that is an awfully good start at social reform, 
much better than anything the Reform Party has offered.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary North, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
did not realize the minister expected the Reform Party to do his 
job for him.
<P>
	Speaking of serious matters, the minister knows that every 
dollar borrowed today means two dollars in cuts tomorrow. 
Worried Canadians are asking: ``What will this do to our social 
programs?'' What answer does the finance minister have to give 
them?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional 
Development-Quebec, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is very clear. 
The major difference between the Reform Party and ourselves is 
our deep belief in the social fabric of the country.
<P>
<B>(1440 ) </B>
<P>
	There are those in the House who simply feel that cutting is an 
accounting trick, balancing the books and not balancing the 
needs of a nation. That is not the view of the government.
<P>
	The government is cutting the deficit, not because we think 
people should be without but because we want to preserve social 
programs and the legacy of the Liberal Party.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, after 
making cuts to unemployment insurance of $5.5 billion over 
three years in his first budget-and the unemployed have not yet 
fully felt the effect of these cuts-the Minister of Finance is not 
letting up, cutting an  additional 10 per cent from the 
unemployment insurance budget for next year.
<P>
	Does the finance minister realize that these additional cuts he 
has announced for unemployment insurance will deprive the 
unemployed of at least $700 million more in 1996-97?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Human Resources 
Development and Minister of Western Economic 
Diversification, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the hon. member should 
first look closely at what was in the budget papers and at the 
kinds of initiatives we have talked about in reforming 
unemployment insurance.
<P>
	The reform of unemployment insurance is a way of trying to 
change a system to help people get back to work, to take away 
many of the disincentives in the system, and to give people real 
resources to get good training, good counselling and good 
programs. To do that we can use the money from the savings we 
are about to introduce as part of the legislation.
<P>
	The hon. member is totally wrong. The fact of the matter is 
that we want to convert unemployment insurance into an 
employment insurance fund to give people new hope, new jobs 
and new opportunities. That is what the reform is all about.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, while 
the Human Resources Development Committtee was travelling, 
we were told repeatedly that it was not merely a question of 
training but of jobs, real jobs. And yet this budget contains 
nothing about employment.
<P>
	How does the finance minister dare demand an additional 
sacrifice from the unemployed, to the tune of at least $700 
million, when he has imposed a temporary tax of $100 million 
over two years on banks and financial institutions although we 
know that the Royal Bank alone recorded profits of $1.2 billion 
last year?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional 
Development-Quebec, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, as the minister 
just said, the best way to create jobs in Canada is to move away 
from passive support toward active assistance to give workers 
the tools they need.
<P>
	The best way to achieve this is to reduce unemployment 
insurance premiums so that small and medium size businesses 
can afford to hire new employees. Thirdly, the best way to 
achieve this is to keep economic recovery rolling. We created 
433,000 jobs last year, and this year, we will match that number.

	<B>Mr. Peter Adams (Peterborough, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of 
Industry.
<P>
	Yesterday's budget established a path for solid economic 
growth. It lived up to the commitments that were made in the 
election. One of those commitments was job creation through 
small and medium size businesses.
<P>
	Would the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Industry 
expand on what the budget does to address the concerns of small 
and medium size business?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dennis J. Mills (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister 
of Industry, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the greatest hope we have for 
putting Canadians back to work rests with small and medium 
size businessmen and women in the one million enterprises that 
employ close to 70 per cent of the nation.
<P>
	In the budget the Minister of Finance did three very specific 
things for small business. First, the small business corporate tax 
rate was not touched. Second, the $500,000 capital exemption 
was not touched. Third and most important, the Minister of 
Finance announced last night that the chartered banks of the 
country would be brought to task for their relationship with 
small and medium size business.
<P>
<B>(1445 ) </B>
<P>
	Today the chairman of the Standing Committee on Industry 
announced that within the next two and a half weeks the 
presidents of all the financial institutions in this country will 
come to the committee to report on what they are doing for small 
business.
<P>
	That is how we will create jobs.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay East, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, hidden 
in the bowels of this Liberal budget are gas taxes, a 2 per cent 
interest increase on penalties, UI premium surplus revenues, 
and elimination of PUITTA transfers just to name a few. Does 
the minister admit that he is digging deeper and deeper into the 
pockets of middle income Canadians?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional 
Development-Quebec, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, we have just spent 
a year and have finally quite satisfactorily solved alternative 
fuels in terms of ethanol.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Martin (LaSalle-Émard):</B> Mr. Speaker, I wish I had 
never started on this. I am being sandbagged.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> We have bowels on one side and bags on the 
other.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay East, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, on a 
more serious note, the minister prides himself on being open. He 
does talk about a 1.5 cent per litre gasoline tax but surprise, 
surprise, there is a tax on this tax: the GST. Would he agree that 
this might be a tactic which would be considered deceitful by 
some Canadians?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional 
Development-Quebec, Lib.):</B> No, Mr. Speaker, clearly not. 
Canadians understand quite well those areas in which the GST is 
applied. With the budget now behind us, we look forward to 
dealing with the GST question this year.

<P>
	<B>Mrs. Pierrette Venne (Saint-Hubert, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the Minister of Finance.
<P>
	Faced with new spending cuts, the Minister of National 
Defence announced yesterday that the headquarters of the land 
component of the armed forces and the facilities at Saint-Hubert 
would be closed. According to the newspaper <I>La Presse</I>, 
because of this decision, 400 people will lose their jobs, half of 
those civilians.
<P>
	After closing the Saint-Jean military college last year, how 
can the Minister of Finance justify the decision to shut down 
these facilities and the base at Saint-Hubert, while we know that 
Quebec is under-represented when it comes to armed forces 
facilities and spending, and is getting at least $650 million less 
per year in this area than it should?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of National Defence 
and Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
House of Commons and Senate special joint committee on 
defence recommended that to save money we eliminate one 
command structure within the armed forces. In yesterday's 
budget we did that by closing air command in Winnipeg, 
maritime command in Halifax, and land forces command at 
Saint Hubert.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Pierrette Venne (Saint-Hubert, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
will the Minister of Finance commit to rapidly announcing 
adjustment measures to help these civilians find new jobs?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of National Defence 
and Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, in last 
year's budget we announced the elimination of 16,500 people 
from national defence. Yesterday it was just under 12,000. That 
is nearly 30,000 people. All of these people will be eligible for 
the force reduction plan covering the uniformed personnel and 
the civilian reduction plan covering the civil servants.
<P>

<P>
<HR>

<P>
	There has been a 73 per cent take up with an average payout 
of $53,000 for those people announced last year. We envisage 
that these people will be dealt with fairly and humanely and

<P>
	<B>Mr. John Williams (St. Albert, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
according to the budget estimates tabled this morning, 
Enterprise Cape Breton Corporation has a budget increase of 
69.3 per cent. That is right, an increase of 69.3 per cent over last 
year. I thought the Minister of Finance stated yesterday that he 
was going to cut spending.
<P>
	How can the Minister of Public Works and Government 
Services possibly justify this increase in spending in his own 
riding? Justify that to Canadians in the rest of the country.
<P>
	<B>Hon. David Dingwall (Minister of Public Works and 
Government Services and Minister for the Atlantic Canada 
Opportunities Agency, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. 
member for his question.
<P>
	He should be aware that the cutbacks to ACOA and Enterprise 
Cape Breton come to a total of $173.5 million over a three-year 
period. The reductions with regard to Enterprise Cape Breton 
are in excess of $2.5 million, with a 24 per cent reduction in 
personnel in that particular office.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Williams (St. Albert, Ref.):</B> I thought I said it was 
an increase of 69 per cent, Mr. Speaker.
<P>
	I also noticed in the estimates that the Department of 
Canadian Heritage will be spending $1.8 million on a golf 
course in Cape Breton.
<P>
	Yesterday, the Minister of Finance said: ``Cut spending''. He 
also said that the second principle of the government is that 
priorities must reflect the needs of the people and that the third 
principle is frugality, that every dollar counts.
<P>
	Does the Minister of Public Works and Government Services 
not understand what the Minister of Finance said, or does he 
refuse to give up this pork barrel way of spending?
<P>
	<B>Hon. David Dingwall (Minister of Public Works and 
Government Services and Minister for the Atlantic Canada 
Opportunities Agency, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, again I want to 
thank the hon. member for his question.
<P>
	He should be aware that regional development agencies have 
been cut in excess of $550 million by the Minister of Finance. 
All ministers of the crown and every agency of the Government 
of Canada has been looked at under program review. Each and 
every one has had to sustain a reduction.
<P>
	ACOA amounts to $173.5 million over a three year period. In 
that category 50 full time positions will have to be removed 
from the books.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Andy Scott (Fredericton-York-Sunbury, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, my question is for the Secretary of State for Science, 
Research and Development.
<P>
	Yesterday's budget reflected the very serious fiscal situation 
we face as a government and as a nation. It is important in 
coming to terms with our deficit that we also continue to build 
the framework for future economic growth.
<P>
	With that in mind, could the secretary of state advise the 
House how the budget affects science and technology funding 
and its future?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Jon Gerrard (Secretary of State (Science, Research 
and Development), Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, science and technology 
was given priority treatment in the budget.
<P>
	For example, while the budget of the Department of Industry 
Canada was cut by some 43 per cent, the cuts to the two granting 
councils which fall within the Industry Canada portfolio, 
NSERC and SSHRC, are only 14 per cent over the next three 
years. The cut to the National Research Council is only 15 per 
cent over the next three years.
<P>
	Thus the budget is tough but fair. It has given priority 
treatment to science and technology which is important for our 
future.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Audrey McLaughlin (Yukon, NDP):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the Minister of Finance.
<P>
	The minister has stated that a cornerstone for his budget is 
regional fairness. Yet today if you are a farmer, a fisher, a small 
business person in a rural community or a miner, this has not just 
been a tough budget, it has been devastating.
<P>
	Will the minister agree that it is small town and rural Canada 
that have been held hostage by Wall Street in this budget?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional 
Development-Quebec, Lib.):</B> No, not at all, Mr. Speaker.
<P>
	The hon. member knows we have a debt and deficit problem. 
Canadians wanted us to face up to it. This action has been 
delayed for virtually a decade. In fact it was the very industries 
the member refers to and small town and rural Canada that were 
suffering because the Canadian standard of living was declining, 
not because of this budget but because governments had refused 
to face up to it.
<P>
	In facing up to this issue we have provided rural and small 
town Canada with an enormous amount of hope. The hope is that 
now our social programs will be preserved, that the basic 
industries will be preserved and that Canadians will continue to 
create jobs. That is really what we have done in this. This is a 
budget for Canadians.

<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> The hon. member for Sherbrooke.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Charest:</B> Mr. Speaker, this is the longest question I have 
had in a long time. My question for the Prime Minister concerns 
page 58 of the budget plan and the granny tax.
<P>
	On pension reform, the government announces it will include 
in its changes the provision of OAS benefits on the basis of 
family income. That would mean that women who are 65 and 
over receiving OAS would lose their OAS based on their 
spouse's income. Will the Prime Minister confirm this to the 
House of Commons?
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, my answer is that the hon. member's claim will not 
come true. At this point, we want to ensure that the pension plan 
is reviewed. We are required, under legislation enacted by 
Parliament, to meet with the provinces every five years. We 
must meet them this year to discuss that issue. We must ensure 
that Canada's pension plans can continue to exist for 
generations to come, as the Minister of Finance indicated in his 
budget yesterday.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean-Guy Chrétien (Frontenac, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the Minister of Finance. Yesterday, the minister 
announced that the grain transportation subsidies would be 
eliminated, adding that a generous compensation of close to $3 
billion, which includes direct subsidies, would be given to 
western producers. The minister also reduced by 30 per cent the 
subsidies to dairy producers, who are not so lucky since they 
will not be getting any compensation.
<P>
	How can the Minister of Finance justify such an unfair double 
standard: dairy producers, most of whom are in Quebec, will not 
get any financial compensation, while western grain producers 
will?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional 
Development-Quebec, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, first, there is a 
fundamental difference between the two. Clearly, we just 
eliminated the Crow benefit. However, as regards subsidies to 
the dairy industry, the Minister of Agriculture is in Quebec City 
today to meet with association officials. We did not abolish that 
subsidy: we reduced it by 30 per cent. I have some problem with 
the member's point of view, but I do understand it. We have to be 
consistent. We did reduce the subsidy by 30 per cent. May I 
quote the Leader of the Opposition when he took part in a debate 
with Joe Clark? Mr. Clark said:
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	``We have substantial subsidies of industrial milk production. 
As you are going to try to make an independent Quebec more 
competitive, would you drop those subsidies, Lucien?''
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	And the leader of the Opposition replied, and I quote:
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	``If you ask me yes. Yes, we should stop doing that''.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Silye (Calgary Centre, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the Minister of Finance.
<P>
	While normal Canadians are taking a hit in this budget, this 
year's spending estimates reveal that the budgets for running the 
Senate and ministerial offices have been increased.
<P>
	Why is it that senators and politicians continue to ride the 
gravy train on planet Ottawa while overtaxed Canadians have to 
tighten their belts?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (President of the Treasury Board 
and Minister responsible for Infrastructure, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I believe the Senate line in the main estimates shows a 
$1,000 increase.
<P>
	I understand that the members of the other house are still 
looking at possible cuts, as has the House of Commons. The 
chief government whip announced just last week that cuts are 
being made in the budget of the House of Commons. Not to 
mention that yesterday in the budget the Minister of Finance 
announced 19 per cent cuts over three years. These are the most 
massive cuts which have been made in government expenditure 
in modern times. In addition to that 19 per cent, a 33 per cent 
reduction in the MPs pension plan has been made in one year.

	The House resumed consideration of the motion that this 
House approves in general the budgetary policy of the 
government; the amendment, and the amendment to the 
amendment.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Harvard (Winnipeg St. James, Lib.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I want to offer my congratulations to the Minister of 
Finance on his presentation of yesterday's budget, a budget in 
my opinion that was fair and balanced. I think it meets the first 
test that was put down by all Canadians, that it had to be fair and 
balanced, fair to all Canadians, all individuals and all regions. 
The finance minister has succeeded in doing that, at the same 
time making a major effort in bringing down the deficit and the 
debt and getting government right for the first time in a good 
many years.
<P>
	I rise in the House today not only to address the budget which 
was introduced yesterday but also to comment on a disease 
which I see gripping Canada, a disease which becomes more 
visible and widespread during events like this budget debate. It 
is a disease born from a lack of understanding, compassion and 
acceptance. It is a disease which focuses on self. It is a disease 
perpetuated by individuals, businesses, media types and hon. 
members alike. I am referring to what I call the culture of 
victimization.
<P>
	This culture is both painted and exacerbated with brushes 
almost exclusively from the political right. I believe that in the 
last 10 years there has been an alarming increase in the 
perception that we, each and everyone of us, is a victim. 
Canadians are victims. We live in fear of further victimization. 
In truth, I believe that this paranoia has created a society in 
which we are all victims of something out of necessity.
<P>
	We are victims of crime. We are victims of taxes. We are 
victims of government. We are victims of big corporations. We 
are victims of interest groups. We are victims as westerners. We 
are victims as Quebecers. We are victims as easterners. We are 
victims if we speak English. We are victims if we speak French. 
We are rarely just people who share a single common bond. 
However, we do have that common bond. We all are Canadians. 
It is this undeniable fact that we are all Canadians upon which 
the Minister of Finance has based his budget.
<P>
<B>(1505) </B>
<P>
	The $7 expenditure reduction for every dollar in new tax 
revenue is not a burden attributable to one type of Canadian but 
to all Canadians. If we are all affected, can we possibly all be 
victims? As I listened to some hon.  members opposite I hear 
those ominous words reinforcing the notion that we are victims.
<P>
	Some interest groups and even provinces which did not get 
what they wanted from this budget have said that this 
government has not been straight with them. Like spoiled 
children, our critics demand more for themselves with little or 
no regard for others. At the same time they demand greater 
fiscal restraint and usually expect someone else to shoulder their 
burden.
<P>
	They tell Canadians to believe, really to expect that it is the 
government's responsibility to make things better for 
themselves. It is the government's job to make life happier: ``If 
life is not the way I think it should be it is because that big, mean 
government machine will not let me succeed, for I am a victim''. 
We have all in some way contributed to the creation of this 
culture in which we perceive ourselves as helpless victims.
<P>
	For example, economic indicators suggest that Canadians are 
recovering from the recession of the early 1990s. Yet a certain 
trauma lingers. The Minister of Finance surpassed his 1994 cost 
cutting goals and yet the opposition howls. Program spending 
will be reduced by about $10 billion and that is a benefit to all 
Canadians. The opposition howls again: ``What about me?''.
<P>
	In many ways, and thanks to the critics, Canadians have 
become more dependent on government. Government is 
expected to ensure that we all have jobs and also accommodate 
our every whim. Government is even expected to bandage our 
scratches. We have become less reliant on ourselves and on our 
own abilities. Thus we have let ourselves become victims. We 
cannot think only of ourselves. Nor can we accept this 
characterization that we live in a culture of victimization.
<P>
	Kennedy was right when he said our privileges can be no 
greater than our obligations. The protection of our rights can 
endure no longer than the performance of our responsibilities.
<P>
	Reformers would have us slash and burn programs and 
services to all Canadians; let us cut deeper and indiscriminately. 
The political right in this country would never have conceived 
the notion of compassion and human understanding as 
demonstrated by the introduction of the new Canada social 
transfer to the provinces.
<P>
	It is true that money to the provinces will be reduced as a 
means of getting our financial house in order. This action cannot 
and should not be viewed as an indirect means of attacking 
individuals. Rather, such action demonstrates our commitment 
to getting government right by reducing overlap and 
duplication.
<P>
	Canadians are being presented with the opportunity to help 
create and develop a more mature fiscal federalism. Through 
initiatives like the Canada social transfer the government has 
met the requirements needed to accommodate citizens' con-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10154"> 10154 </A></B>
<P>
cerns for more sustainable programs and provinces' concerns 
for greater flexibility.
<P>
	Keep in mind that the Minister of Finance has taken into 
account that change requires a period of adjustment. This 
government has not lost sight of the individual faces which will 
be affected in this budget. This government does not intend to 
perpetuate the notion that we live in a culture in which we are 
victims.
<P>
	Reformers in their budget played on the fears of those who see 
themselves as victims. Some members opposite would have us 
believe that if we simply cut, cut, cut then everything will be 
better. At the same time Reformers will not commit to one 
course of action. If you do not like where we have made cuts, 
then the response is simple: make your own cuts. They had 
better add up to the bottom line. Such a nonchalant, bottom line 
approach implies that wherever the greatest burden exists 
according to your own criteria, cut that. Just make sure you meet 
the bottom line.
<P>
	It is that kind of naive analysis which perpetuates our cultural 
victimization. It would be wonderful to look at our own personal 
budgets and cut those items which seem to cost the most. Why 
worry about food, clothing and shelter? According to some 
members it is only the bottom line that counts. Why concern 
yourself with being human? We simply must balance the budget 
regardless of the social cost.
<P>
<B>(1510) </B>
<P>
	These types of cuts to food, clothing and shelter are 
unrealistic on a personal level and are unacceptable at a federal 
level. We must evaluate what is important to us and from there 
determine where we can reduce expenditures. That is the 
approach taken by this government and by this finance minister.
<P>
	Simply cutting to meet a bottom line would make us even 
greater victims. Sound reasoning and methodology were used to 
determine areas of waste, areas of duplication and areas lacking 
profitability. Through this realistic evaluation of Canada's 
economic house, the Minister of Finance has introduced an 
approach for fiscal responsibility which affirms the notion of 
cultural success. The government is not contributing to the 
disease of cultural victimization.
<P>
	Essentially the third party would leave us to our own greed: ``I 
live in the west, so I will cut services in the east''. Let us be 
honest. Society cannot survive if we are enthnocentric. This 
type of self-absorbed regional attitude creates a slippery slope; 
we pick at the cultural threads of the Canadian fabric in a futile 
attempt to hang on.
<P>
	What happens is that the fabric becomes warn and ripped. We 
must not continue to think we live in a cultural environment as 
victims. We must not succumb to the notion that in order to 
survive we must be the strongest or the most resourceful.
<P>
	Reformers would have us all fall prey to this logic, a logic 
which would throw out the social fabric and not repair it. If use 
of this type of logic has as its only goal the elimination of the 
debt, then what this approach does is forget that each and every 
one of us, regardless of our province or country of origin, 
whether from Manitoba or Prince Edward Island, whether 
Yukon or Nunavut, new Canadian or native Canadian, is still a 
member of a community.
<P>
	We cannot survive if we focus on only my needs or my wants. 
By virtue of our tendency as human beings to exist in groups 
because we are social creatures we must look beyond our own 
shadows.
<P>
	Canadians wanted and deserved a budget which espoused the 
virtues of fairness and equity. The minister has accomplished 
that goal. Both corporations and individuals are equal partners 
in the fight to save Canada.
<P>
	We know that the Minister of Finance is serious. That is why 
both individuals and corporations have been brought into 
alignment. Through improvements to the tax system, for 
example, requiring professional and other unincorporated 
business to pay taxes on income in the year in which it is earned, 
just like wage earners do, this budget has actively removed 
barriers which have contributed to the culture of victimization.
<P>
	We are fortunate that we live in a society that enables us to 
exist as a synergistic entity where the whole is greater than the 
sum of its parts or members. I will not deny that each of us has 
problems, some unique to a few individuals, some to a particular 
region of Canada, which affect all of us.
<P>
	We must be able to stretch out our arms further and run faster 
so that we are not borne ceaselessly into the past. We must 
accept our responsibilities first as Canadians. We must also 
realize that change is not inherently bad or negative. We must 
realize that we are not victims but victors.
<P>
	At this point I want to congratulate the Minister for Human 
Resources Development and fellow federal Manitoba Liberal 
caucus members for their hard work and commitment with 
regard to this budget.
<P>
	Two months ago the prospect of losing air command became a 
horrible possibility. However, after yesterday's budget the 
reality for Manitobans is less severe. Only about 350 to 375 jobs 
will be affected as a result of air command's closure. This is a 
significant difference from the anticipated number of jobs 
which would have been lost. Although loss of air command will 
be difficult for Manitobans, I am confident that once the 
government's reasons are understood, Manitobans will be able 
to accept this change.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10155"> 10155 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1515) </B>
<P>
	Acceptance will result from a sense of fair play because it was 
not only air command that was closed, but naval command in the 
Atlantic region and army command in Quebec were also closed.
<P>
	I can tell members there were people in Winnipeg who 
thought that we would not be fair, that we might close air 
command but we certainly would not close army command in 
Quebec. It was done because the minister and the government 
believe in fairness.
<P>
	Manitobans will be able to appreciate that we were not singled 
out for cuts. All regions have been affected. We cannot forget 
that these closures are significant to their respective regions but 
we will not lose sight of the fact that an entire level of 
management has been removed at considerable saving to all 
Canadian taxpayers.
<P>
	The budget introduced yesterday redefines Canada and its 
relationship with the provinces. Canadians are entering a new 
era, a significant step has been taken toward eliminating the 
culture of victimization which we have created. At long last, 
government has sought to ensure that fundamental values are 
preserved while appreciating the inherent differences among 
provinces. Through the decentralization of airports in Canada, 
for example, the government is preserving its role of guardian 
but accepts the realization that people in Winnipeg, Toronto and 
Barrie, Ontario are able to oversee the successful operation of 
their local airports.
<P>
	These efforts not only remove layers of bureaucracy but also 
serve as positive motivation for all Canadians who are able to 
function within a federation and not be victims of our regional 
identities.
<P>
	There is more to government than just cutting. There is smart 
government which appreciates the social, cultural and moral 
obligations. Perhaps now we can move beyond an attitude that 
asks: What do you expect in a regional country? Of course we 
are going to complain. Perhaps the Leader of the Opposition will 
come to appreciate the notion of fair play and understand that 
Quebec may receive $2 billion less in transfer payments but that 
all the provinces will experience the same kind of reductions.
<P>
	Perhaps members opposite will learn something of fair play 
and refrain from trying to manipulate reality to suit a limited 
agenda. I am referring to comments made that immigrants living 
in Quebec should not be allowed to vote in a referendum, the 
question evolving to include the notion of who is a real 
Quebecer and who is not. We must work from our most common 
denominator. We are all Canadians and we should all be entitled 
to the pain and to the glory.
<P>
	Ironically, most times, leadership is equated to economic 
performance. President Clinton is doing the very same thing 
across the border as we are doing here. He is trimming the 
bureaucracy and reducing the debt. Despite President Clinton's 
efforts the economic outlook is not nearly as positive as it is in 
Canada. Yet Americans  seem to believe in themselves and in 
their ability to overcome any adversity.
<P>
	In Canada, however, we are being convinced how bad it really 
is. We listen to the leader of the third party, who when talking 
with the media uses words like dishonest, cowardly and 
hypocritical. I wonder how we can forget that ever-ominous 
threat that the chickens will come home to roost. I suspect that 
the grassroots are having their gooses cooked. The political 
right would have issues decided by polls. It would be democracy 
by telephone. There would be no consultation, no research, no 
compromise or leadership. Opinion would reign supreme.
<P>
	I suspect that the Reform leader would soon find out that 
burdening every Canadian with every decision would have a 
number of disastrous results, much like a grassroots guru 
attempting to split atoms like he splits economic hairs.
<P>
	This may come as a surprise to members opposite but the 
reason behind democracy and having an elected representative 
is the notion of efficiency and leadership. To govern is to 
choose.
<P>
<B>(1520 ) </B>
<P>
	If we are to survive we must learn to believe in ourselves and 
in this great country. We must accept the economic and social 
realities and strive for tomorrow. Some would suggest that 
things can only get better, but I submit to the House that it is a 
subjective goal.
<P>
	In the eyes of the United Nations, Canadians live in the best 
country in the world. In a recent Swiss survey four Canadian 
cities were considered among the 12 best places in the world to 
live. Other nations and other cultures believe in and envy the 
Canadian reality. The question now is: Why are Canadians so 
cranky? Why is it that the majority of Canadians feel victimized 
in one way or another?
<P>
	Our challenge is to create a culture not of victims but of 
victors. We must nurture the creation of a culture in which we 
act out of compassion for others, not necessarily only for 
monetary compensation. Success should be measured by the 
results, not by the amount of money spent. Let me repeat, 
success should be measured on the basis of results. These results 
must be evaluated both according to economic criteria and 
social criteria. That is what members opposite fail to appreciate 
about the minister's budget of yesterday.
<P>
	When has a Reformer asked us to think of others before 
thinking of our own individual interests? When has the Leader 
of the Opposition considered the wants of Quebecers when he 
muses about postponing the referendum date so as to be able to 
manipulate the results? This is not democracy. When will 
Canadians be allowed to seek appreciation and elevate their 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10156"> 10156 </A></B>
<P>
self-esteem, receiving joy from the notion that the receiving is 
in the giving?
<P>
	This is a budget debate, but there is more to a budget than 
numbers. There are the people who are affected by change.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Roger Pomerleau (Anjou-Rivière-des-Prairies, 
BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, the hon. member used the word 
manipulating several times, as in manipulating facts and figures 
in our analysis of the budget that has just been brought down, 
and as in political manipulating with respect to the referendum. 
I may remind the hon. member that in Canada, political 
manipulation is what happened in 1982 when the Canadian 
Constitution was patriated against the will of a unanimous 
National Assembly in Quebec. The terms of the contract that 
binds us were changed. That is political manipulation.
<P>
	I would like to ask the hon. member, since we have nothing to 
gain by staying in Confederation and, eventually, we will have a 
referendum, whether he thinks the budget that was brought 
down yesterday is likely to help matters?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Harvard:</B> Madam Speaker, there is a body of opinion in 
the province of Quebec that says we are committed to the 
so-called status quo, that the choice in the coming referendum 
will be between the status quo and sovereignty.
<P>
	I submit there is another choice. It has to do with a progressive 
federalism, a federalism that is alive, a federalism that grows 
and evolves. Looking at the budget you can see how the 
federalism we have is flexible and how it can grow. The changes 
recommended under the Canada national transfer program give 
more flexibility to the provinces, which is something they have 
wanted for a long time.
<P>
	We in the federal government want national standards and 
national principles and we will have them. The budget shows 
that federalism, as we know it, is a living thing. It is a living 
organism. It changes with the times. It adapts to new 
circumstances. It adapts to new conditions.
<P>
<B>(1525 ) </B>
<P>
	I know this will come as a great disappointment to the 
sovereignists that go around telling their friends that our kind of 
federalism is carved in stone or frozen in ice. Nothing could be 
farther from the truth.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Roger Pomerleau (Anjou-Rivière-des-Prairies, 
BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, there is a lot of talk about flexible 
federalism. In 1980, Quebecers said no to sovereignty for 
Quebec, one of the main reasons being that we were told if we 
voted for sovereignty, we would have a terrific problem with 
debt, unemployment, the deficit and taxes. Of course we said no.
<P>
	In 1980, Canada's debt was $80 billion, and now, 15 years 
later, it is $550 billion. Is that progressive federalism, is that 
flexible federalism? Would the hon. member not agree that this 
much vaunted federalism is ``broke''?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Harvard:</B> Madam Speaker, when we came to power in the 
fall of 1993 after nine years of Conservative rule our fiscal 
house was in shambles. It was not in order. It has taken us a 
number of months to get to where we are today. However, this 
budget is going to get our fiscal house in order.
<P>
	If there is disenchantment in the province of Quebec or 
anywhere in the country, it is because we had a federal 
government for nine years that simply would not address the 
nation's finances, that would not address our national problems.
<P>
	This government will address those problems. The deficit and 
debt will be reduced systematically and methodically. In the not 
too distant future we will be in a situation where there will be no 
deficit whatsoever.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. André Caron (Jonquière, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
welcome this opportunity to speak to the budget brought down 
yesterday by the Minister of Finance. I want to take this 
opportunity to inform the public that although the Minister of 
Finance promised to do something about the debt and tax reform 
when he brought down this budget, he failed to keep his promise.
<P>
	Yesterday, the Minister of Finance started his budget speech 
by identifying Canada's two major problems. First, the Quebec 
referendum and second, the debt. Upon reading the budget I 
have to conclude that the Minister of Finance is only 
considering Canada's problems. Of course Quebec seems to be a 
problem for Canada. What is the Minister of Finance doing and 
what has the federal government been doing for the past 20 or 25 
years? The federal government considered the problem, looked 
at it, examined it, thought about it, but did nothing to resolve it.
<P>
	This is somewhat the case with the debt as well. For 25 years, 
finance ministers have been looking at the debt. Both Liberal 
and Conservative ministers, including Mr. Lalonde, Mr. Wilson 
and Mr. McEachen have had a look at it. Each one has said, ``It is 
really too bad, we spend more in Canada than what we earn. It is 
too bad. We should reduce the deficit. We must reduce the 
debt''. And if we take a look at the tables, we see that Canada's 
debt has been growing for the past 20 to 25 years. We looked at 
the tables produced by the Minister of Finance following his 
budget, and the debt continues to grow.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10157"> 10157 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1530) </B>
<P>
	So Canada is looking at its debt problem as it is looking at the 
problem of Quebec, at what for it is the problem of Quebec. I 
think that one of Canada's greatest weaknesses is that it looks at 
its problems, but never resolves them.
<P>
	There is another problem in Canada as well, which the 
minister has failed to identify. It is a problem he raised in many 
speeches during the elections-the problem of jobs, the problem 
of unemployment. During the elections, Liberal Party material 
spoke of jobs, jobs, jobs. Today, there is no more talk of jobs, the 
word is debt, debt, debt and cut, cut, cut. The problem of the 
unemployed is far from the mind of the Minister of Finance.
<P>
	Looking at my own region, my city, my riding, an industrial 
area which has been under direct attack for about ten years, all 
the restructuring, modernization of businesses, new technology, 
have left unemployed people who had worked for big business 
for years, earning average or even above average salaries. These 
people have been unemployed for a year for a lack of specific 
policies to help them get retrained. Now they are turning to 
welfare.
<P>
	This budget contains nothing for the unemployed. It contains 
absolutely nothing to give them hope for the future. There is 
indeed talk of possibly reforming unemployment insurance 
while at the same time cutting the program by 10 per cent. There 
is also talk of reform providing for the unemployed to train for 
new jobs.
<P>
	This seems to be a roundabout way of presenting minister 
Axworthy's famous unemployment insurance reform, a 
two-tiered unemployment insurance system, what someone in 
my region described as generous UIC and miserly UIC. Some 
people in Canada will have to make do with the miserly version 
of UIC. When I look at the finance minister's budget, it is these 
people I think of. What is new in this budget for the unemployed, 
persons on welfare, fully trained young people trying to find 
jobs?
<P>
	Training is not the issue for young people. For young people, 
it is a point of fact: they are trained in leading edge technologies. 
Take the young people trained in technical fields at the 
Jonquière CEGEP, for example, they have been trained in every 
advanced technical area. These people should not have any 
trouble finding jobs because they are competent and have all the 
necessary training. But they cannot find jobs. Why not? Because 
there are no jobs.
<P>
	There is no work for people looking for it. Even to restore 
employment to levels we had before the economic crisis, we 
would have to create 400,000 jobs in Canada. With those jobs, 
we will find ourselves where we were three years ago, and 
furthermore, this does not include newcomers on the job market.
<P>
	I was surprised when the Minister of Finance said that 
Canada's two biggest problems were Quebec and the debt and 
that he did not mention unemployment.
<P>
	Now to the budget: what is the verdict? This morning's papers 
ran stories on people who are happy and who say the economy 
will finally have room to breathe. That was the title of an 
editorial from <I>La Presse</I>. Before the budget, people were saying 
that these were hard times, that Canada was on the road to 
bankruptcy and that its credit rating was going to be 
downgraded. After the budget, people are now saying that things 
have improved, and accounting associations have given the 
Minister of Finance a mark of 80 per cent. Therefore, all is well. 
But who is telling us that this is because of the budget?
<P>
<B>(1535) </B>
<P>
	Big business, banks and brokerage houses that sell Canadian 
bonds, in fact, all of the people who gain from the system. They 
are well paid and work in a sector where the economy is well 
developed: the financial sector. While this sector often does not 
generate much wealth, it plays with it, taking a cut from it in 
passing. Those people are happy.
<P>
	Two insights into this comment. Firstly, these people are 
happy because they see that the budget contains a solution to the 
debt problem. Curiously, a budget that appears to close certain 
debt-related gaps is enough to make the other problem-that 
Quebec is one of Canada's major problems and may scare off 
potential investors-disappear. They are not saying that Canada 
has succeeded in solving the Quebec problem, but that Quebec is 
simply no longer a problem. That is something I have noted.
<P>
	What do ordinary taxpayers think about the budget? I have the 
impression that they simply feel relieved because they avoided 
major cuts this time. Of course, they will pay a little more for 
gas. Dairy producers in Quebec will see their subsidies reduced, 
by $2,000 or $3,000 in some cases. It is still a significant 
amount. Some taxpayers may have to pay a little more in taxes 
but, in general, taxpayers feel that they have avoided the worst.
<P>
	But what about all the others, those who have been forgotten, 
that I mentioned earlier, those looking for jobs or trying to 
improve their socio-economic status in Canada? Those people 
are not praising the budget in newspaper headlines. They are not 
heard. They are silent.
<P>
	In the last few years, Canada's major newspapers, whether in 
Quebec or in English Canada, have been paying significantly 
less attention to those people than they did in the 1970s. 
Probably because owners have succeeded in selling a little more 
their philosophy that the state should intervene less and less and 
let the disadvantaged and less fortunate in society fend for 
themselves.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10158"> 10158 </A></B>
<P>
	This philosophy has spread to the newspapers where 
everyone has good things to say about the budget. Where are 
the budgets that used to take care of the less fortunate without 
excessive spending? This is not done anywhere in this budget.
<P>
	And there are other things that must not be forgotten. We must 
not forget that, according to the Minister of Finance, this budget 
was aimed in a way at restructuring Canada to a certain extent 
through decentralization. They said that Canada was too 
centralized, that it was too costly, that they wanted to shift some 
responsibilities to the provinces.
<P>
	They are transferring certain things to the provinces. In the 
next two years, they will transfer $7 billion to the provinces for 
health, education and social assistance. We note, however, that 
they are not really decentralizing but rather transferring 
problems. This is not a transfer following negotiations in good 
faith on restructuring Canadian federalism.
<P>
	More importantly, this budget will not bring about tax reform. 
RRSP provisions will be tightened a bit. The large corporations 
tax rate will rise from 0.2 per cent to 0.225 per cent, which 
amounts to only $145 million. The surtax on profits will go up 
from 3 per cent to 4 per cent, which represents $350 million over 
three years. There will be a temporary tax on banks.
<P>
<B>(1540) </B>
<P>
	A tax which will raise about $100 million total, from all 
banks, when the Royal Bank of Canada alone turned profits of 
$1.2 billion this past year. What is $100 million as compared to 
the aggregate of all bank profits? Peanuts.
<P>
	Why does the Minister of Finance come up with such a 
measure, a proposal which is almost insulting to those who pay 
taxes? Actually, I think this may well have to do with the public 
perception of a shockingly low level of taxation. Next year, the 
banks will again turn huge profits. Given the current interest 
rates and the streamlining efforts of the past three or four years, 
banks stand to make huge profits. So, you can expect more 
hoopla in the press. What will the Minister of Finance have to 
say? He will be able to say: ``But we did impose a temporary tax 
on them, a special tax to bring in $100 million''. That is one 
hundred million dollars in taxes on profits perhaps as high as 
$10 billion.
<P>
	That is a mere one per cent. It is somewhat insulting to those 
who often have to pay as much as 40 or 50 per cent of their 
incomes in taxes. Of course, they are probably among the 
wealthy.
<P>
	The fact of the matter is that the budget before us has not put 
our fiscal house in order as it should have. The tax shelter issue 
remains unresolved, as do the ones raised on the French 
television network newscast <I>Téléjournal</I>, last week, where the 
situation of two individuals earning $100,000 was compared. 
One hundred thousand dollars is not peanuts. These are wealthy 
people. The salaried worker would pay $40,000 to $43,000 in 
taxes every  year, while the self-employed person earning just 
slightly less, thanks to all kinds of tax loopholes and tricks, and 
with deductions for children, would end up paying $22,000 in 
taxes.
<P>
	When Canadians see things like that-even though they often 
have little sympathy for those who earn $100,000-when they 
compare the two situations, they realize that there is something 
wrong with our tax system.
<P>
	Consequently, we feel that this budget is unacceptable 
because it does not include a major tax reform.
<P>
	Let us now turn to the debt. Again, it would be one thing if 
there were some concrete results, but such results are not 
obvious. The Minister of Finance, who is not making whimsical 
predictions, currently estimates that the debt will be somewhere 
around $500 billion this year, and that it will reach about $603 
billion in three years. Therefore, regardless of what the minister 
does, the debt will increase by another $100 billion. The 
interests on that debt will increase from $42 to $50 billion. As 
well, the deficit will remain around $24 billion in 1996-97.
<P>
	So, the government talks about reducing the debt, but 
Canadians who are watching, and who may be prepared to make 
sacrifices, cannot help but think: ``Sure, but the debt is still 
there. It will still grow. We will still have to pay high interest 
rates on it''. Where is the improvement?
<P>
	Canadian taxpayers will be even more sceptical when they 
find out what these assumptions are based on. These forecasts 
are based on the prediction that the economy will continue to 
grow after 1997. Therefore, the debt will continue to rise even if 
the economy is doing well or continues to do well over the next 
three years.
<P>
	The budget also forecasts interest rates. I am a little surprised 
to see the Minister of Finance forecast interest rates two years in 
advance when he often fails to forecast accurately two months in 
advance. Whatever. Nevertheless, the budget does have to 
contain some numbers to make it look scientific and serious.
<P>
	There is another issue that is probably scandalous and that, in 
my opinion, will floor the average person who ponders the issue 
and that is that they predict a drop in the rate of job creation. 
This year, it will be about three per cent; next year, it will only be 
about two per cent.
<P>
	They forecast an unemployment rate of around 9.4 per cent. 
That is no low rate. In fact, 9.4 per cent represents only the 
unemployed workers who are included in the survey, but many 
of them are not. This means that regions like mine will again 
face real unemployment rates of 15, 16 or 17 per cent.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10159"> 10159 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1545) </B>
<P>
	The budget tabled by the Minister of Finance offers no 
comfort to those who want to work to support themselves and 
their families.
<P>
	I have two last points to make. This budget does not offer 
solutions to the debt problem. Why not? Perhaps because the 
budget is based on a number of assumptions, which do not take 
into account the Bank of Canada's potential influence on the 
monetary policy.
<P>
	Many financial players say that making the monetary policy 
more flexible would stimulate the economy by reducing interest 
rates so that people could invest in and revitalize the business 
sector. In an approach that I would describe as doctrinaire, the 
Minister of Finance refuses to make any change to the monetary 
policy, in spite of the fact that there is no inflation, so to speak, 
in Canada. So, it would be time to cut some slack in that area to 
give the economy a chance.
<P>
	I will conclude on this. I suggest there is another solution that 
we, Quebec sovereignists, could bring about. We think Canada 
is in need of economic restructuring. I think that Quebec's 
achievement of sovereignty, which will no doubt happen within 
a few years, will provide a welcome opportunity to restructure 
the economy, start over based on new presuppositions, review 
our policies and build on new bases.
<P>
	For all the foregoing reasons, I will be voting against the 
budget.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, 
I listened with interest to the member and noted one particular 
aspect. I do have a comment and one specific question for the 
member.
<P>
	He asked about the young people and what is there for them, 
that there are no jobs. There is no question there are still a large 
number of Canadians, particularly young people who do not 
have jobs.
<P>
	Governments in themselves do not create jobs; businesses, 
and particularly small businesses do. Over one million small 
businesses in Canada employ over 70 per cent of Canadians. 
They are the ones who are the engine of this economy. They are 
the ones who are going to help to create jobs. The member well 
knows that over the past year the government has assisted in the 
creation of over 433,000 jobs.
<P>
	I looked at the economic statistics for the last year. The fact is 
our growth rate over the last year was 4.25 per cent, the highest 
in the G-7. According to the OECD, Canada will continue to 
lead the industrialized world in growth for the next two years. 
The unemployment rate has dropped below the 10 per cent level 
and in fact we have virtually no inflation.
<P>
	The member concluded his remarks by getting back to the 
essence of why he is here. It has to do with sovereignty, the 
separatist question and the separation of Quebec.
<P>
	Would the member not admit that the ability of Canada to 
move forward and to achieve economic growth and greater job 
creation depends a great deal on the confidence level of 
investors in Canada and the certainty that people have with 
regard to the affairs of Canada? Would he not agree that once the 
referendum question is dealt with, once this issue which has cost 
Canada so dearly over all these years is finally resolved, 
Canada's economic position will be much stronger?
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Caron:</B> Madam Speaker, I thank the hon. member for his 
comment and question.
<P>
	With respect to his comment, I would just like to say that, 
when the Minister of Finance talks about job creation or when 
the Liberal Party was talking about job creation during the 
election campaign, they never said: ``We will create 400,000 
jobs''. What the Liberal Party said is: ``We will create jobs''. 
And what the Minister of Finance is telling us is: ``We have 
created 450,000 new jobs in Canada''. I suggest he qualify this 
statement by saying ``we contributed to the creation of'', if we 
follow my hon. colleague's reasoning.
<P>
<B>(1550) </B>
<P>
	On the issue of confidence and Quebec, I do not think that 
shoving our problems under the carpet will resolve anything. 
The Quebec issue is that of a people who wants to achieve 
sovereignty. I could tell you a long story, but it would be the 
history of Quebec, to make the point that, for us, this is a 
culmination. And Canada will not make this problem disappear 
by denying this reality. A better way of dealing with this 
problem would be to recognize it and look at the potential 
impact of Quebec's sovereignty on both Canada and Quebec.
<P>
	I have the distinct impression that Canada would survive if 
Quebec were to secede. Why not? I think that those who say that 
people are reluctant to invest because Quebec wants its 
sovereignty are just using this as a scare tactic. Interestingly, 
after the defeat in 1980 and the patriation of the Constitution 
which was supposed to create a new order in Canada, we did not 
experience a major boom in the economy. I remember what 
happened in 1982. There was a serious recession, and that was 
two years after Quebecers said no in the referendum. I do not 
think there is a relationship between the two.
<P>
	But there is something I would like to say to the hon. member 
in closing. As long as the issue of Quebec has not been resolved, 
Canada will always identify this issue as a problem. I do not 
think that holding people against their will, scaring them and 
threatening them will solve the problem. Whether the answer is 
yes or no in the referendum, the problem will still exist and there 
will still be sovereignists in Quebec who will continue to stand 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10160"> 10160 </A></B>
<P>
up for what they believe in because not only is it an  emotional 
issue, but it is also a matter of interest for Quebec.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Philippe Paré (Louis-Hébert, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, 
for many months and in fact for a number of years, federalists 
have claimed that all Canada's economic ills are caused by 
political instability. When in recent months interest rates went 
up and the Canadian dollar went down abruptly, people said: It is 
all because of those nasty separatists.
<P>
	Perhaps the hon. member would care to explain why, the day 
after a budget that was rather well received by the financial 
community, interest rates seem to be going down and the dollar 
seems to be going up? Why, since the Quebec problem still 
exists? How would he explain that?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Caron:</B> I want to thank the hon. member for his question. 
Madam Speaker, I would say that the connection is tenuous and 
as far as I can see, non existent. We heard the same excuse after 
the results of the referendum on the Charlottetown accord in 
1992. I remember seeing certain studies, including one by the 
Royal Bank which said that if Canada said no or Quebec said no, 
that would be the end of Canada, and I remember, this was either 
in the study or maybe it was a political cartoon, there would be 
train loads of Canadians heading for the American border to take 
shelter in our neighbour's economic paradise. In fact, there is no 
connection. If you look at the economic situation and the whole 
issue of Quebec's sovereignty, there is no connection between 
the two. Often, support for sovereignty is strong while the 
economy is weak, but often it is the other way around.
<P>
<B>(1555) </B>
<P>
	Unfortunately, some politicians are using this issue to make 
political gain. I deplore that because politics is a noble art, a 
noble science, a noble calling, and it is the art or the science, if 
you will, of government. It is the art or science of guiding and 
moving societies. When we use all kinds of tricks and excuses to 
try and get at our opponents and even resort to blackmail on 
these issues, I think that in addition to weakening our case, we 
also diminish our performance as a politician.
<P>
	I want to thank the hon. member for Louis-Hébert for giving 
me this opportunity to say that I do think economic issues are 
linked to the question of Quebec sovereignty. I agree, but I do 
not agree that this very fact weakens the Canadian economy. I 
would say that people are waiting. People are waiting, and if we 
manage to reach a decision, I am sure the economy will recover, 
both in Canada and Quebec, and that we will then have the 
resources to restructure our economies and ensure that within 
Canada's present borders there are two countries that are 
comfortable financially and whose citizens will be able to work 
together.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Raymond Bonin (Nickel Belt, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
rise in the House today to express my support for an innovative 
budget that sets the Canadian economy  and Canadian 
federalism on a new course, a budget that at the same time 
remains faithful to the most fundamental Liberal principles. I 
commend the Minister of Finance on presenting a budget that 
strikes a balance between the need for a quick return to fiscal 
responsibility at the federal level and the need to maintain what 
identifies us as a people, the compassion of our social programs.
<P>
	Since the pre-budgetary consultations began, the message 
from my constituents has been clear: we must tackle the deficit, 
but at the same time, we must be fair and equitable.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	My constituents have told me unequivocally that, like each 
household, the government must learn to live within its means. 
It must concentrate on reducing the deficit by significant cuts in 
government spending, not by increasing the burden on the 
middle class.
<P>
	They have also told me that they wish to see increased fairness 
in the taxation system and a continued protection for our most 
vulnerable by way of efficient and modern social programs. 
Those same constituents conveyed to me their belief that our 
social programs are in need of reform to modernize them and 
make them more efficient and pertinent to the realities of the 
1990s.
<P>
	I am pleased to state that I believe this budget to be a 
significant first step in achieving the delicate balance requested 
by my constituents. However, I must say that balance is only 
achievable because Canadians want and are ready to support real 
change, a new policy direction and a new approach to governing 
in Canada.
<P>
	Getting government to live within its means is our first 
challenge. Not unlike a household, a government that lives 
above its means eventually faces hardship.
<P>
	There can be no doubt that the accomplishments of Canada 
and Canadians, a nation with a small population base, are 
unprecedented. Canadians have banded together to build the 
best nation in the world. Our resource base is abundant. Our 
population is well educated and hard working. Our private 
sector is dynamic and entrepreneurial spirit abounds.
<P>
	Last year we led the G-7 in growth. Our inflation is low, 
exports are booming and jobs are being created. Our economy is 
on track. The fundamentals and basic ingredients for guaranteed 
economic success are in place.
<P>
	However, our interest rates and the currency are at the mercy 
of the international financial markets that speculate on our 
ability to control public debt and deficits. Those markets have us 
living under a microscope and any rumour can send our interest 
rates upward and our dollar plummeting. Under those 
conditions, Canadians live under a perpetual cloud of economic 
uncertainty which affects personal financial decisions as well as 
business decisions.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10161"> 10161 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1600 ) </B>
<P>
	Year after year governments have spent more than they have 
taken in. We have borrowed to the point where our ability to 
repay is in doubt. We are now at the mercy of lenders that 
monitor our every move. It can be said that public policy is now 
judged by its impact on Canadians and on our creditors, who are 
more concerned with our ability to repay than our aspirations as 
a people. In a true sense, because of the rising debt and 
persistent deficit we are losing control of the public policy 
agenda.
<P>
	The budget is unprecedented in scope and 
comprehensiveness. It builds on last year's initiatives and sets 
the stage for regaining control of public finances and the public 
policy agenda, signalling the eventual return to our traditional 
focus of building a fair and just society.
<P>
	The budget significantly reduces the deficit. In three years the 
government will have saved $29 billion. We will have reached 
the target of 3 per cent of GDP by 1996-97 and if private sector 
forecasts are correct, we will even surpass it. As the Minister of 
Finance has repeatedly stated, we must meet the deficit 
reduction target or risk remaining vulnerable to the speculation 
of the international financial markets.
<P>
	The budget does more than set out a deficit reduction plan. It 
also defines a new approach to government, a new approach 
more in tune with the needs and challenges of the nineties.
<P>
	When the government accepted the challenge of deficit 
reduction it rejected the slash and burn approach or the notion of 
across the board cuts. Across the board cuts of 20 to 30 per cent 
are not the key to deficit reduction for the simple reason that a 30 
per cent cut in a bad program still leaves 70 per cent waste, 
whereas a 30 per cent cut in a good program just does not make 
sense.
<P>
	A slash and burn approach to deficit reduction may achieve 
results, but more often than not at the expense of those most 
vulnerable. That is not our way. We believe in fiscal 
responsibility. We also believe in fairness. The government 
knows that in addition to deficit reduction, the machinery of 
government has to be renewed to better serve Canadians in a new 
economy.
<P>
	The budget makes the federal government smaller while it 
lays the foundation for a government that is smarter, more 
efficient, more responsive and more focused on renewed 
priorities. That is the essence of a program review. Under 
program review the departments started with a simple question: 
In the nineties, what should a federal government do for the 
people? Those things a federal government should do are being 
analysed to determine the best way to deliver them.
<P>
	The things a federal government should not do were either 
discarded as something that no government at any level should 
do or were determined to be best achieved by a level of 
government closer to the people. The end results are smaller 
departments, $16.9 billion in cuts from program review alone, 
but smarter departments  with renewed mandates, a tighter focus 
and new priorities that will better serve the taxpayers and better 
support an innovative economy.
<P>
	The process of reinventing the role and the machinery of 
government clearly demonstrates that Canadian federalism is 
flexible and continues to evolve to meet the changing needs of 
Canadians and of the new economy. We all know that 
well-publicized constitutional conferences at which little is 
produced but disagreement and divisiveness are not a viable 
source of change.
<P>
	Change in our federation occurs incrementally, through 
discussion, through dialogue and through negotiation on 
practical issues of concern to everyday Canadians. It is at this 
level that Canadian federalism is flexible and responsive to the 
needs of all their citizens.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	As a francophone from northern Ontario, I have witnessed 
this change. It is because of Canadian federalism, flexible 
federalism, that I am able to stand in this House today and speak 
in my mother tongue to talk of my heritage, which I have kept 
and enriched, and of my pride in being a French Canadian.
<P>
<B>(1605) </B>
<P>
	The road has not always been easy, and there have been 
struggles on a number of occasions. However, without Canada, 
without federalism, the battle would have been lost from the 
start.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	A critical component of program review has always been that 
the level of government best positioned to deliver a service 
should do so. Such a bold statement clearly demonstrates that 
the federal government wishes to actively promote the evolution 
of federalism because it is in the best interest of Canadians. 
Federalism in Canada is not about the status quo.
<P>
	That federal wish is inherent in the new transfer system to the 
provinces. The block funding system discards the cost sharing 
roles to give the provinces more flexibility in delivering 
programs funded in part by the federal government. This 
measure acknowledges the need to tailor social programs to 
meet the specific needs of Canadians living in different parts of 
the country. The 4.4 per cent reduction in transfers to the 
provinces is a necessary measure to help the federal government 
meet its deficit reduction target.
<P>
	However, it must be emphasized that in 1996-97 the federal 
government will be transferring to the provinces $35.3 billion. I 
know that the majority of Canadians will agree that transfers in 
the order of $35.3 billion per year confirms the government 
commitment to equalization payments and the support of 
provincially run social programs. In addition, the government is 
always prepared to meet with the provinces to establish prin-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10162"> 10162 </A></B>
<P>
ciples which govern the distribution and the use of those 
transfers.
<P>
	My experience at the local level has clearly demonstrated to 
me that much of the funds targeted for social programs are 
consumed by administration. The money directed to the poor is 
not reaching them because of the high cost of administration. 
With flexibility I am hopeful that the provinces will be in a 
position to lower administrative costs and get more money out 
of the hands of administrators and down to the people who need 
it. If properly managed, savings could even reach the 4.4 per 
cent of reductions in transfers.
<P>
	Some provinces or provincial governments may try to 
characterize the cuts and transfers as a personal attack or 
downloading. I would remind those people that we have three 
levels of government, including the municipalities, but we only 
have one taxpayer. In the end, that one taxpayer does not draw 
any benefit from a provincial budget that is balanced by way of 
transfers from a debt ridden federal government.
<P>
	Deficits and accumulated debts are common problems 
throughout the federation at all levels of government. We must 
learn to work together to solve them in the best interest of that 
one taxpayer.
<P>
	As many of my colleagues have already mentioned, the 
budget is unprecedented in scope and comprehensiveness. It 
puts us on the right track for deficit reduction. For every $1 of 
new revenues the budget will generate, there will be $7 in cuts.
<P>
	No government likes to cut but we were left with limited 
choices. We proceeded in what we believed to be a rational and 
fair way. We did not cut blindly. As I mentioned earlier, we 
began with non-priority areas and also sought to renew the role 
of the machinery of government to bring about significant 
savings of $16.9 billion. We applied the principle of shared 
responsibility to the concept of deficit reduction. To protect the 
more vulnerable, we asked those who could afford it to shoulder 
a larger part of the burden.
<P>
	For example, the budget sets out massive cuts to industrial 
programs, business subsidies, regional development agencies, 
transportation subsidies. There are also significant cuts to 
defence, natural resources and Canadian heritage. All in all, 
there were significant cuts in varying degrees in the vast 
majority of departments.
<P>
	On the revenue side we have moved decisively to introduce 
new fairness into the tax system. We have sent a clear message 
to those able to pay that they will have to shoulder an increased 
responsibility for deficit reduction. For example, we have set 
temporary limits on RRSPs at $13,500, affecting only those who 
earn in excess of $75,000. There will be a new tax on investment 
income of private corporations. We will eliminate deferral of tax 
on business income. We will limit some incentives. We will tax 
family trusts. We have increased tax on large corporations. 
There is a new corporation surtax. We have a new capital tax on 
banks. Finally, there is the gasoline tax.
<P>
<B>(1610) </B>
<P>
	Looking at the overall picture of the revenue side I am sure the 
majority of Canadians will agree that we have met the criteria of 
fairness. I am sure that in the future we will move again to close 
more loopholes.
<P>
	I would like to take a few seconds to tell the House what the 
budget is not about. The government has demonstrated the 
courage to open the budget process to let Canadians in. 
Throughout the process we emphasized that we would use a 
balanced and fair approach.
<P>
	The opposition has used this consultation process to falsely 
suggest that the government would impose additional taxes on 
the middle class. Members said we would overburden the 
middle class with the budget. We have not. They said that there 
would be a health tax. There is none. They said that there would 
be a dental benefit tax. There is none. They said there would be a 
tax on RRSPs. There is none. They said there would be a tax on 
lotteries. There is none. Finally, they said there would be income 
tax increases. There are none. I would also add that there are no 
increases in UI premiums.
<P>
	In the end, I believe we have achieved a fair distribution of 
restraint among all Canadians in all regions of the country.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Madam Speaker, some individuals and groups tell us we have 
gone too far, while others say we have not gone far enough. I 
answer them by saying that we have done what we said we 
would: we have formulated a budget that will meet our 
objectives and targets for deficit reduction.
<P>
	We have chosen the best route. Our budget is carefully 
balanced. It balances the need to control government 
expenditures with the need to provide the protection of social 
programs to our most vulnerable. Cutting too much in order to 
satisfy the financial circles would mean too great a cost to the 
disadvantaged and would weaken Canadian confidence in the 
economy. Cutting too little, on the other hand, would threaten 
our ability to pay our expenditures and make us more vulnerable 
to control by foreign markets.
<P>
	In hard times, the provinces turn to the federal government for 
leadership. Unfortunately, during the last nine years, the 
provinces turned to the federal government for leadership, and 
the Mulroney government failed to provide it.
<P>
	I would like to repeat the quote given by the Minister of 
Finance in his speech: ``Government must not live in the past- 
Every day there are new needs to be met. If inflation is to be 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10163"> 10163 </A></B>
<P>
fought, unemployment countered and something done, and 
soon, to get Canadian prosperity back into its stride, the 
government must begin to plan ahead-not timidly, not 
tentatively-but boldly, imaginatively and courageously''.
<P>
	It is no coincidence that the person with the Prime Minister is 
the son of the individual who made this statement. He is the 
person, the son of Paul Martin, Senior, who will return stability, 
confidence and prosperity to Canada.
<P>
	Furthermore, Canadians may be assured that their federal 
government will provide the leadership sought by the provinces. 
If we are now facing a new opposition consisting of two parties, 
the Reformers and the Bloc Quebecois, it is because the 
Mulroney government did not meet the provinces' call for 
leadership.
<P>
	For this very reason, the Liberal team will respond to this call 
by the provinces and these new parties will inevitably disappear.
<P>
<B>(1615) </B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	In conclusion, I would like to bring to the attention of the 
House another issue in the budget. I would like to offer the 
services of my riding and my region to help the Minister of 
Finance fulfil this commitment. Sudbury and the region of 
Nickel Belt have rich mines, skilled workers and all the skills 
and institutions in place to provide to the Government of Canada 
the new $2 coin that is referred to in the budget. We would be 
pleased to provide that service for the rest of Canada.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Leon E. Benoit (Vegreville, Ref.):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
have heard this member and others before him make the 
comment that we are targeting spending better with this budget.
<P>
	The most substantial spending measure in this budget is as a 
result of what was not done rather than as a result of what was 
done. That is the increase in interest payments on the debt.
<P>
	Does that mean that it is the deliberate intention of this 
government to target spending more to interest payments than in 
the past?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bonin:</B> Madam Speaker, this question has been asked so 
many times in the House. I will attempt to answer it differently 
because it seems that Reform members do not understand.
<P>
	There is a balance to be offered when there is such a huge 
problem as we have in this country. We inherited the problem.
<P>
	I like to compare it with a program I saw on TV. In New York 
City the underground infrastructure of the water system is so old 
and rusty that they cannot check to see if a valve is working. 
There is so much rust that the valve will break if they turn it. I 
like to make that comparison.
<P>
	The people I share this with, the people of my riding and other 
ridings and the people from my party and other parties, except 
for the Reform Party, seem to relate that there is a danger in 
overkill.
<P>
	Definitely, Canadians and the Liberal government would like 
to say let us slash and burn and there is no more debt. The only 
serious difficulty is it would affect human beings. That is the 
part the Reform Party cannot associate with. We include it in our 
answers and try to explain to them that they have to have some 
compassion. That word is used often by a good many members 
in this House but it is never used by members of the Reform 
Party.
<P>
	A society with compassion is often judged by the way it treat 
its seniors. Taking $3 billion out of the seniors' pockets is not 
my idea of compassion. I have answered the question for the 
people who understand. I feel like the minister or the priest who 
preaches to the people who do not practise. They sit there having 
heard the answer so many times and still they do not understand.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Philippe Paré (Louis-Hébert, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
would like above all to respond to the initial remarks made by 
the member for Nickel Belt. He seems to regard it as quite an 
exploit that, thanks to Canadian federalism, he is still able to 
rise in this House and speak in French.
<P>
	I must say, it is very difficult for me to understand how this 
view can be so easily accepted since the opposite would indicate 
assimilation. So he admits that it is exceptional that he has not 
been assimilated.
<P>
	As he comes from a French speaking community, I find it 
rather difficult to understand how someone like him could say 
that; he is aware of the incredible rates of assimilation in 
Canada. In 1971, the rate of assimilation for all English 
speaking provinces was 27 per cent, but by 1991 it had increased 
to 37 per cent.
<P>
<B>(1620) </B>
<P>
	Equally, he is a member of a government whose language 
commissioner recently released a totally shocking report on this 
government's inability to provide francophones in other 
provinces with services in French. He is also a member of this 
government which will make cuts to the CBC, no doubt equally 
in the French and English networks, without realizing that the 
French network has been discriminated against for 20 years, 
although audience ratings are identical and budgets are one third 
higher for the English network, identical ratings and identical 
schedules, unless I can be convinced that the English language 
CBC network is on the air 36 hours a day, which I would find 
very difficult to understand.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10164"> 10164 </A></B>
<P>
	I find it difficult to understand those remarks and I would 
like to know how he can rise in the House and praise a federal 
system which has created these things which are after all 
neither very interesting nor very praiseworthy.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bonin:</B> Madam Speaker, I am surprised to see the 
knowledge that my colleague opposite has cultivated regarding 
the situation of francophones outside of Quebec. When I first 
came to Ottawa, at the same time as he did, his party thought that 
I was one of their own when they heard me talk.
<P>
	Most of these people have never ventured outside of Quebec. 
Most of these separatists were oblivious to the fact that there 
were any francophones outside of Quebec. My riding is 40 per 
cent francophone. I represent such a riding, and our separatist 
colleagues from Quebec do not even know we exist. At the end 
of 1978, René Lévesque came to Laurentian University in my 
riding in Sudbury and said to francophones outside of Quebec 
that Quebec had enough problems and had no time for us. That is 
what he said.
<P>
	My colleagues from the Bloc Quebecois are surprised and 
moved that there are francophones outside of Quebec. I will give 
them a little background on northern Ontario. There were nine 
children in my family, all francophones. I organize family 
picnics for the Lefebvre family in my riding, and we invite all of 
the descendants of my grandmother and grandfather. I recall one 
year where 750 people registered, all francophones. So, come 
out of your shell! Excuse me, Madam Speaker, I meant to tell 
them through you to come out of the shell in which they have 
been hiding.
<P>
	It is never adviseable to propose to separate from something 
you do not know. Go see the rest of Canada. Go see whether it 
exists, get a taste of it and you will conclude that it is worth 
keeping Canada together. Yes, if I rise in this House today and 
am so proud to speak to you in my mother tongue, French, it is 
because I had the opportunity to live it, to be raised in it and to 
speak it at university. My son is registered in a family medicine 
program in French in northern Ontario and my wife teaches at a 
French school.
<P>
	Before being elected, I taught French in a French college; the 
new college is under construction. I was the president of a 
French-English school board, the majority of whose members 
were francophones. So do not try to tell me that francophones 
outside Quebec have no rights and that our rights are being taken 
away from us daily. We had our problems in the past, but we got 
to know one another instead of deciding to separate. We decided 
to sit down together and learn to work with one another.
<P>
	I played hockey with the anglophones and I enjoyed it. They 
are good people. I also played in another league where everyone 
was French and we spoke French on the ice and in the locker 
rooms. We learned to work at overcoming problems, to respect 
one another. The  respect of one person for another is very 
important for a federation.
<P>
	The message is not complicated. For the separatists, if you 
wish to separate, at least know what you are separating from, 
because you run a very great risk of hurting the people you 
represent. This is not right, because the members of the Bloc 
Quebecois in this House do not represent the majority of 
Quebecers. They are playing a dangerous game and those of us 
from northern Ontario know it.
<P>
<B>(1625) </B>
<P>
	With reference to Radio-Canada, I am going to tell you about 
one of the problems we have in northern Ontario, because I think 
something needs to be said. Most of our programming comes 
from the province of Quebec, but we would like more local 
programming. The propaganda we get on the television and the 
radio is driving us to switch to our other francophone stations in 
northern Ontario.
<P>

	<B>Mr. Werner Schmidt (Okanagan Centre, Ref.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I will be dividing my time with my colleague, the hon. 
member for Red Deer.
<P>
	I wish to address this House on the business of the budget 
which was presented yesterday. I want to deal particularly with 
one part of that budget. It has to do with the provisions for 
science and technology. The hon. Minister of Finance said that 
the general objective of federal spending in science and 
technology is to build a stronger science and technology 
capability in Canada.
<P>
	There are two funding councils through which a lot of this 
money goes, the National Sciences and Engineering Research 
Council of Canada and the Social Sciences and Humanities 
Research Council of Canada. Both promote and assist primarily 
university research and graduate education. Their budget was 
reduced proportionately less than those in other areas because, 
as he said, that reflects the importance and priority placement of 
R and D for this government.
<P>
	The same thing happened with the National Research Council. 
It too was reduced, but not in the same proportion as were 
certain other parts. The National Research Council will have to 
eliminate activities of a lower priority.
<P>
	From the above it is pretty clear government has 
demonstrated that science and technology is considered to be a 
strategic asset of government.
<P>
	Let me quote directly from the Minister of Finance's budget 
plan: ``High deficits and debt lead to higher interest rates, higher 
taxes and reduced confidence, which dampen investment and 
growth. The financial requirements flowing from chronic 
deficits, when not matched by increases in private sector 
savings, increase Canada's dependence on foreign borrowing, 
the servic-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10165"> 10165 </A></B>
<P>
ing cost of which is a permanent drain on national income and 
future living standards. The constant financing of  deficits also 
reduces the government's capacity to provide important public 
services and to make adequate investments in the area of 
strategic national importance, such as science and technology.''
<P>
	It should be clear to everyone that this budget, because it does 
not adequately deal with the fiscal problems of this government, 
will make it difficult to develop in precisely those areas upon 
which the future economic development of this country depends 
and which must take place if Canada is to compete in the global 
marketplace.
<P>
	Concerns have also arisen with respect to the treatment of R 
and D expenditures on information technology generally, and in 
particular those incurred by financial institutions. I quote the 
minister again: ``As an interim measure, all information 
technology R and D performed after budget day by financial 
institutions will be excluded from the definition of scientific 
research and experimental development pending the completion 
of the review of information technology R and D''.
<P>
	Is this specific act a discrimination against one of the major 
stakeholders in scientific and technological development? Or is 
it as Peter Cook stated yesterday in his article in the <I>Globe and 
Mail</I>: ``Fairness to the politician does not mean burden sharing. 
It means goring the fewest oxen.'' Since there is not a large 
number of financial institutions and the chartered banks are by 
far the fewest and the largest of those, only very few oxen will be 
gored by this regulation.
<P>
<B>(1630) </B>
<P>
	The question, however, is a larger one. Does this action 
discourage other innovators in the information technology 
field? That is particularly problematic in light of the Auditor 
General's observations that we must recognize the global 
economy is increasingly driven by knowledge based industries 
and that innovation is critical.
<P>
	He goes on to detail some of the characteristics of an 
innovative country. He states among other things that first, 
innovation has become a crucial survival issue. It cannot be 
treated as an option. Second, innovation trends do not arise by 
themselves. It is generated and sustained through the efforts of 
people. Innovation is where the innovative spirit is. It cannot be 
legislated or brought about by edict. It comes from individuals 
and from creative and interactive communities and it thrives in 
an environment of encouragement and support.
<P>
	Three, he says government needs to create an environment 
that is supportive of innovation. If not, innovators will not 
innovate or leave to go to places where there is support for 
innovation. Four, partners in an innovative society include all 
aspects of our communities, all governments, communities, 
individuals, corporations and families. Five, he says Canada has 
the potential to be particularly innovative as a society because of 
the cultural diversity of its people. Canada could become known 
as an innovative country.
<P>
	The Auditor General also observed that within the science and 
technology department there is an absence of strong leadership: 
``The government does not have a clear idea of precisely what it 
is trying to achieve in science and technology''.
<P>
	In response to that observation of the Auditor General, here is 
what the Minister of Finance said in his budget plan:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Industry Canada is developing a federal science and technology strategy. The 
department is drafting a national vision of science and technology through 
external consultations, internal review as well as an independent assessment of 
the national advisory board on science and technology.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Industry Canada, in conjunction with other relevant departments, is also 
working to increase the relevance and economic impact of the government 
science and technology spending; a more businesslike approach is being 
adopted.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	This is a total statement with regard to this matter. It is vague, 
yet it readily admits that knowledge is where the future lies. 
How much money would a private investor place in a vague and 
wishy-washy sense of direction like that?
<P>
	In this case, as in any other pursuit, it is essential that there be 
a clear goal as to where one is going so that one may determine 
the costs and know when the goal has been reached. At the 
moment I am afraid there is much money and a lot of activity 
being thrown in a particular direction but little to show for it. 
When resources are scarce we cannot afford such lack of 
accountability and irresponsible expenditure of public funds.
<P>
	There are some suggestions that I would make that might be of 
assistance in meeting the Auditor General's message. First, in 
this country there are insufficient links between science and 
technology policy on the one hand and economic indicators on 
the other. Do the government policymakers ask themselves what 
economic indicators are being directed toward science and 
technology?
<P>
	Second, science and technology remains internalized. While 
it talks about being innovative, about being an important 
component of economic recovery, it seems to have no idea how 
to activate policy to become that component. The reason for that 
is because any review that has come out of the department of 
science and technology has not had its genesis or relationship 
with the finance department.
<P>
	In many ways science and technology and Industry Canada 
are having an identity crisis. They know what they want to be, an 
engine of fiscal recovery, but they have no idea how to get there.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10166"> 10166 </A></B>
<P>
	We hear much about creating stronger partnerships between 
government and universities, government and industry, 
industry and university. We have not heard a whisper about the 
relationship that is necessary to forge between academic 
scientists and economists.
<P>
<B>(1635 ) </B>
<P>
	Many who comprise and compose the structure of science and 
technology have moved from the ivory tower of the university to 
the ivory tower of government. Neither is a traditional place 
where market value means much to the daily workings of the 
respective institutions.
<P>
	Protected from the real world and from having to generate 
revenues to support their work, their objectives are fuelled by 
the desire to maintain the status quo. Instead they choose to 
believe that the granting system is sacred and necessary, that 
generating revenues is not within the purview of science.
<P>
	However, generating revenues is a principal element in 
becoming an engine that drives economic recovery. We are 
relying on science and technology to produce products, jobs and 
a niche for Canada in the global marketplace. When we are told 
that science and technology can do that we believe it because we 
want it to be so. However, we want it to be happening now.
<P>
	Do we have to wait another 30 years since the last science and 
technology review took place when nothing happened? One year 
from now is too long. It is time to get out of ivory towers and do 
it now.
<P>
	We need to have a different structure, a necessary new 
configuration; one that places more emphasis on each 
knowledge worker and less concentration and centralization of 
services, one that joins Newfoundland to British Columbia by an 
information highway capable of sharing ideas of co-operative 
creation, of production teams equipped with expertise not 
limited to institutions, sectors, regions or governments. That is 
innovation. That will assure Canada's future. That is what we 
must do and we must do it now.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bob Mills (Red Deer, Ref.):</B> Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to give a speech that I sincerely hoped I would not have to give. 
In the fall the Minister of Finance promised he was going to get 
serious about the debt and deficit in his budget and that he 
realized Canadians would not accept any higher taxes.
<P>
	The minister went on to conduct a much touted prebudgetary 
consultation process. The minister claimed again and again that 
he would listen to Canadians. The hopes and wishes of the 
Canadian public have been betrayed. It is absolutely 
unacceptable.
<P>
	I want to talk about the tax grab of the government. Since I 
was elected, one of the most ironclad wishes of my constituents 
and the Canadian public has been that the government put a halt 
to increased taxes. Canadians are already taxed to death. They 
are bled dry by the government.
<P>
	Although the government knew all about the terrible situation 
it is once again sticking its fingers into the wallets of Canadians 
and picking them clean. Only this time, since the part of 
Canadians' wallets that holds the bills is empty thanks to the 
government, the tax man is rifling through the part that holds the 
change, plucking the last few loonies away from the beleaguered 
public.
<P>
	We have a tax on gas, a tax on utilities in Alberta and taxes on 
corporations which get passed on to the public. This is not 
closing loopholes. This is not taxing the rich. These are taxes on 
everyone who uses a light bulb, heats their home, drives a car, 
farmers and consumers in general.
<P>
	This is totally unacceptable. The government has been told 
time and again it does not have a revenue problem, it has a 
spending problem. Last year the government spent its way to a 
record setting deficit. We have now racked up a debt of over 
$550 billion, costing the taxpayer close to $80,000 a minute in 
interest charges.
<P>
	This is unbelievable and this is what we are leaving future 
generations. That is the compassion we have heard some of the 
members talking about. There should be some compassion 
shown for the future. The government seems to think that 
overspending by 24-odd billion dollars by 1997-98 is the 
greatest achievement ever accomplished. Where the 
government gets its priorities is totally beyond me.
<P>
	What did the government not understand about the message of 
the Canadian public which was no new taxes and fix the deficit?
<P>
<B>(1640) </B>
<P>
	Even the Liberal Party's own personal cheering squad, the 
Toronto <I>Star</I> and many others, had come up with front page 
headlines like ``Get a grip on deficit with cuts, MPs told, but 
don't try raising taxes, constituents say''.
<P>
	The government was given this message over and over again 
but it did not listen. I do not doubt the government has a million 
and one justifications for increasing taxes and I am sure the spin 
doctors figure they can manipulate the Canadian public into 
believing these taxes are in the best interests of everyone, but 
they are wrong.
<P>
	We really feel that removing the deficit and putting in place a 
reformed tax system and a long term plan for the reduction of the 
debt will be the only way to save the programs that Canadians 
value.
<P>
	In 1984 our debt was $190 billion. We had a fellow come 
along who said he was going to fix it. By 1988 he said that he was 
going to fix it again and then we were up to $370 billion. In 1993 
we were told that there was such a terrible government and it had 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10167"> 10167 </A></B>
<P>
built up $489 billion by election day. We were again told that it 
was going to be fixed.
<P>
	By 1997 at the next election we will have over $600 billion. 
All this and the government thinks that a $32 billion deficit next 
year is a great achievement. I am sorry, I do not think that is 
good enough.
<P>
	In the past the government has always figured that it could 
formulate policy and then bring it down from on high. The 
government thought it knew what was best for Canadians and 
imposed this on the public.
<P>
	The last government was particularly good at this trick but we 
know what happened to it. As much as the government does not 
want to hear this piece of news, the days when Ottawa told 
Canadians what to do and how to live are over. It is time for the 
Canadian grassroots to tell the politicians in Ottawa what to do, 
and they better do it.
<P>
	For months now the government has made its problem even 
worse because it told Canadians it was listening. The public was 
optimistic that a new day had dawned but now it knows. Now 
Canadians realize that the government was going to do whatever 
it wanted regardless of what it heard in the prebudgetary 
consultations.
<P>
	It is politics as usual in Ottawa. The government pretends to 
listen to make itself look good and assures Canadians it has 
turned a new leaf but the illusion never lasts. This budget is the 
splash of cold water to the face of the public it needed to realize 
where the government really stands.
<P>
	Tax and grab is the name of the game and wishes of the public 
do not matter. Shame on you, Mr. Finance Minister. You sit on 
your gold plated pension while future Canadians are sacrificed. 
Not only is it a huge shame that the government has chosen to 
raise taxes, but when I ask myself if it is at least taking care of 
the debt and deficit properly, my answer is no.
<P>
	Our federal debt is around $550 billion and it is going up by 
$10 billion every few months. The interest on this debt is huge 
and is going up by $80,000 a minute. Every time the interest 
rates go up by 1 per cent the deficit rises by almost $2 billion. By 
the time the next election is held our yearly interest payments 
will be over $50 billion. This is what will really threaten our 
social safety net and nothing else.
<P>
	The international money managers are happy today because 
they have just been guaranteed an ever increasing source of 
cash. Let me put it another way. Even if there were no more 
interest charges on this debt ever and a single Canadian put 
$10,000 per year into paying off the debt they would reduce it to 
zero by the year 55000000 A.D.
<P>
	Faced with this debt problem, what is the government's 
answer? What resolute action is it going to take to save our 
country from economic peril? It has promised to reduce its 
overspending to roughly $25 billion per year beyond what we 
can afford by the time the next election is called.
<P>
	This will mean that Canadians will only have another $100 
billion dollars added to the national debt, bringing it over the 
$600 billion mark. Wow, what commitment and responsible 
action. With those kinds of fiscal skills, maybe the cabinet 
ministers of this government should act as financial consultants 
when they are looking for new jobs after the next election. I am 
sure financial wizards like themselves should have no problem 
finding a job. Maybe the savings and loan companies in the U.S. 
are looking for senior executives.
<P>
<B>(1645) </B>
<P>
	In all seriousness, it boggles my mind how the government 
can think that it has done enough. For months now Canadians 
have told the government that they are willing to bite the bullet 
in order to address the deficit problem, but the government 
continues to believe that it can do things as usual; it can have its 
cake and eat it too. It can spend the country into the ground with 
big government in one breath and pretend to fight the deficit in 
the next.
<P>
	I am sorry, but it just will not do any more. Canadians are 
unwilling to play the old Ottawa game. They want real change, 
real reform, real spending cuts and no more taxes. The message 
is simple but the government is not listening. The actions 
needed are obvious but the government is afraid to act.
<P>
	Over the coming year Canada will slip further and further into 
debt, the dollar will struggle and upward pressures on interest 
rates will be the norm. As interest rates rise our growth will slow 
and unemployed Canadians will continue to be frustrated in 
their efforts to find jobs. In the past the government has been 
fond of blaming such problems on the previous government. 
That time is now over. The government has made its bed and 
now it is time to lie in it. The people of Canada are smart. They 
know the bill of goods that has been sold to them and they will 
not forget.
<P>
	The smoke and mirrors approach of Ottawa will not sell to the 
provinces or to the people of Canada. Enough is enough. Start 
from the top. Reduce MP pensions. Reduce the number of MPs. 
Reform and reduce the Senate. Cut upper and middle 
management and stop offloading cuts on the lower end of the 
pyramid.
<P>
	We have reached a turning point in this government, a 
downward turn, a turn for the worse, and the Reform party will 
not stand idly by. Reformers have got the message, no more tax, 
fix the deficit. Now is the time for us to confront the government 
and force it to listen. We will tell it over and over, as many times 
as it takes, to try to get the message through that we have a 
serious problem and we must address it.
<P>

<B><A NAME="10168"> 10168 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. George S. Rideout (Parliamentary Secretary to 
Minister of Natural Resources, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
listened with interest to my colleague opposite. He said that the 
government did not listen, did not discuss and did not involve 
Canadians in the process of budget and budget reform in trying 
to strike a budget that at one time would deal with our financial 
crisis but at the same time not push the country into recession.
<P>
	Canadians told us that they did not want us to raise personal 
income tax, that they did not want us to touch RRSPs and that 
they did not want us to tax dental plans. They wanted us to make 
substantial cuts in government so that it would function more 
efficiently. This government listened and that is what it did.
<P>
	As I listened to the Reform budget I heard it take on the little 
guy and make it tough. That budget would impose a direct tax 
against Atlantic Canada, would attack ACOA and would attack 
those institutions which make Atlantic Canada function. It 
would attack seniors and senior women who would see their 
income taxes rise because of the budget that was put forward by 
the Reform party.
<P>
	Did the Reform Party listen to anybody when it put forward its 
budget?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mills (Red Deer):</B> Madam Speaker, what we have done is 
really listened to the people. People are saying that they are sick 
and tired of government from the top down. They are saying give 
them programs that will let them take care of themselves at the 
local level.
<P>
	If the hon. member had read the taxpayers' budget he would 
see that is exactly what it does. It puts in place things like RPSPs 
which allow people to take care of themselves, not depend on 
bureaucracy to do it and not depend on government which over 
35 years has failed them; failed to guarantee the social programs 
and failed to provide them with services. That is what the people 
are saying.
<P>
<B>(1650 ) </B>
<P>
	The threat is that $600 billion and that $50 billion in interest 
payment. That is the threat to all the social programs and it is 
going to hit everyone where we presented a budget which was 
going to be fair and equal to all and would have provided a 
solution. It will be too late by the time these people wake up.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, 
I too have to comment on the member's brief speech.
<P>
	The Reform Party had used the time in advance of 
consultation on the budget to go around stirring up so called tax 
revolts and really scaring Canadians by indicating the 
government is going to do this, the government is going to do 
that. As the previous member stated very clearly, the 
government is not taxing RRSPs or health and dental benefits. 
The government did not raise personal income taxes. The 
government did listen.
<P>
	The government reduced its spending. There are $7 in 
spending cuts for every $1 of revenue increase. The member 
now, in trying to salvage some face with regard to the ridiculous 
tax revolt incitement, is trying to rest everything on an excise 
tax of 1.5 cents per litre.
<P>
	I have a very simple question so that all Canadians fully 
understand what that means. Could the member please advise 
the House how much that means to the ordinary Canadian in 
terms of going to a gas station to fill up a tank? How much does 
that tax cost Canadians?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mills (Red Deer):</B> Madam Speaker, the answer to that 
question is $500 million, but there is a lot more to it than that. 
There are a lot more areas.
<P>
	There is that 12.5 per cent to corporations which is going to be 
off loaded on to people. There are all of the changes when the 
money is transferred to the provinces to allow them less money, 
to allow them to increase their delivery of services.
<P>
	We talk about long term. I am from Alberta and we had a 
premier in that province, Mr. Getty, who gave a budget very 
much like this. It was a feel good, be happy, do not ruffle 
anybody's feathers, try and keep everyone kind of balanced 
budget.
<P>
	As far as consultation with the people, I would like to say that 
in terms of this consultation, the number of town hall meetings 
and so on that come about in that consultation I would gladly 
compare with anything that the hon. member does.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Hedy Fry (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Health, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, unlike the last speaker, I think it 
is a great honour for me to stand today and support the budget. I 
am very proud of its very bold and visionary approach to fiscal 
management.
<P>
	Throughout this budget the Minister of Finance had in effect 
courageously redefined Canada's system of government while 
at the same time maintaining the basic principles of fairness and 
equity.
<P>
	There are some specific areas of the budget that I would like 
to address today, especially as they impact on British 
Columbians and on my constituents.
<P>
	I would like to stress that this budget has fulfilled all the 
promises made by our government. It was tough but it was fair. 
This budget has ensured that the financial burdens faced by all 
Canadians will be distributed in an equitable manner. It started 
by cleaning house, by setting an example of frugality and fiscal 
prudence from the top.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10169"> 10169 </A></B>
<P>
	There is no NIMBY syndrome in this budget. We started right 
in our own backyard. We redefined government by downsizing, 
by becoming lean and efficient and by enunciating a more 
appropriate role for government, one that enhances growth 
rather than manages it.
<P>
	We did this by getting out of mega projects, by cutting back on 
subsidies to businesses, to farms, to transportation and to 
mining. We feel that these sectors can sustain themselves and be 
competitive if we just get out of their way. They have told us this 
often enough and now we are doing it.
<P>
	We will commercialize viable sectors like transportation so 
that they can be self-sustaining and so that the users pay for 
their services rather than all taxpayers. We will still ensure that 
public safety and national standards are maintained.
<P>
<B>(1655) </B>
<P>
	This budget clearly comprises a major turning point in our 
economic history. In the last few years we have been straining to 
govern. We have been straining to survive under the cloud of a 
burdensome debt and a dangerous deficit.
<P>
	This economic downturn we just suffered compounded the 
negative impacts of the deficit and the debt by affecting our 
credibility in world markets. Our economic sustenance was at 
the beck and call of investment bankers in New York and 
editorial writers in Washington.
<P>
	We had two choices. We could continue to ride the downhill 
spiral toward indebtedness and even to third world status or we 
could take measures to change direction. We needed a 
revolution and this budget has provided us with one.
<P>
	Over the next two years this budget will create cumulative 
savings of $13.3 billion, $11.9 of which will represent cuts in 
government spending. That equals $7 of spending cuts for every 
dollar of tax revenue. As a result in 1996-1997 our economic 
growth will finally be greater than the growth in our debt.
<P>
	This is a key element. It marks the turning point in our 
indebtedness as a nation. It means that we will be taking in more 
money than we are borrowing for the first time since World War 
II. We have finally turned the corner.
<P>
	Contrary to the rhetoric spawned by the furious and 
impetuous reaction of opposition parties and other groups, this 
budget does not reduce our commitment to social programs. I 
think rather it enshrines it. By taking control of our finances we 
have regained our sovereignty and our ability to make our own 
decisions about the kind of social democracy we want to live in. 
We have empowered ourselves so that we can make decisions 
based on our values as a people; values of compassion and of 
social justice, values that see government's role as one which 
creates opportunity for all, one which removes obstacles and 
one which protects the most vulnerable in our society.
<P>
	This budget will let us protect our social programs from the 
investment bankers and editorialists of the world. By achieving 
our deficit targets we are taking action to prevent New York or 
Tokyo from in effect running our country and defining our social 
programs. A Liberal government could never allow that to 
happen.
<P>
	I am glad to see that this budget, tough as it is, was not 
balanced on the backs of the poor, the sick and the elderly. As 
Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Health, I am pleased 
to note that his budget in no way affects the medicare standards 
and principles that are so dear to us and that are enshrined in the 
Canadian Health Act. Health care delivery across this country 
will continue to be comprehensive, universal, portable, 
accessible and administered by the public. In the red book we 
committed to ensuring that these principles are upheld and we 
are keeping that promise.
<P>
	Yesterday in a typical knee-jerk reaction to the speech by the 
Minister of Finance, the Leader of the Opposition and his 
finance critic stated that the budget was merely another 
confirmation of status quo federalism. It is clear that the Leader 
of the Opposition did not read the document, or if he did he did 
not understand it.
<P>
	The budget does the exact opposite. It clearly marks the 
beginning of a new era of federalism and of federal-provincial 
relations. It is a move in the direction of a leaner, more efficient, 
more accountable system which recognizes provincial 
responsibilities and the ability to redesign and redeliver 
effective services at the local level; the bottom up approach that 
the opposition parties so often tout but are reluctant to 
implement.
<P>
	In reading the newspapers this morning I noticed that much of 
the media has focused its concerns on the new system of block 
funding, the Canada social transfer which will result, it says, in 
fewer services being provided by the provinces. On the contrary, 
with the new system of lump sum transfer payments, our 
government is in effect giving the provinces greater flexibility 
and greater leverage in the administration of their social 
programs.
<P>
	The federal government's role has been redefined but in a 
positive way. I firmly believe that these changes will provide a 
window of opportunity for us to set clear national standards for 
all social programs. This is a move that my constituents and 
groups across this country have advocated for years.
<P>
	Instead of balkanizing the country, this move will allow us to 
set national objectives for education and social security like we 
have done so successfully with health care.
<P>
<B>(1700 ) </B>
<P>
	Since its inception medicare has given over the management 
and administration of health care to the provinces governed by a 
set of principles enshrined in the Canada Health Act. This has 
created a health system that binds us together as Canadians, a 
system of which we are duly proud, a system that has freed the 
federal health department to concentrate on the broader issues 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10170"> 10170 </A></B>
<P>
that  affect the health and safety of all Canadians. This is what 
we intend to do with the devolution to the provinces.
<P>
	I trust that following his consultations with the provinces the 
Minister of Human Resources Development will act swiftly in 
proposing standards and principles that will see us act along the 
lines of the Canada Health Act and the standards for 
administration and national care we see as a nation.
<P>
	The Canada social transfer will do exactly what we want it to 
do. We have shown by our leadership as a federal government 
that we can provide better, leaner and more efficient 
government. I believe the provinces will rise to that challenge 
and be able to show us that they can do just as well as we can and 
as we have done.
<P>
	I would also like to talk a bit about the changes to the 
Unemployment Insurance Act that I feel are very important. I 
believe that one of the key issues of unemployment at the 
moment is in keeping with our Liberal mandate, which is to get 
people back to work and keep them at work. If we can 
concentrate our efforts on employment services and training we 
will do exactly that.
<P>
	Those Canadians who feel very vulnerable now because they 
are unemployed and who are concerned that this will damage 
their futures should not be concerned because our move is to 
give them the tools and skills needed to get them back to work, 
to stay in work and to make us a more competitive nation. We are 
removing the safety net but we are providing a springboard. I 
think most Canadians want a springboard.
<P>
	We are also cutting some funding to the unemployment 
insurance program. By the fall of next year the funding will be 
reduced by 10 per cent. This is only funding that is going to be 
done because of downsizing of administration and because it 
will automatically come from the lower unemployment rates. As 
the House knows, we have been creating jobs and have brought 
our unemployment down by two percentage points, which had 
not been done over the last 10 to 15 years.
<P>
	We are also moving to reduce some of the abuse that I hear 
from all over the country is endemic in the system. That will 
save us $200 million.
<P>
	Furthermore we are looking to do something that is 
innovative and creative. We are looking to build a $5 billion 
surplus in the UI fund so that we do not have to make the same 
mistakes we made the last time. When the cycles of recession 
and downturns in the economy come we will have a buffer to 
start so that we do not have to increase UI premiums and 
therefore hamstring the businesses that need to grow, to help us 
to sustain the economy in bad times. This is just common sense.
<P>
	By maintaining a surplus we will be able to mitigate the rates 
and help in periods of slow economic growth. It will also help us 
to encourage job creation at a crucial time when we are 
recovering from downturns in the economy.
<P>
	In addition, I am very pleased to note that throughout the 
budget the government has remained totally and absolutely 
committed to a fair and sustainable system of protection for 
seniors. It recognizes the important contributions that seniors 
have made to Canada's social and governmental infrastructure.
<P>
	I have a large seniors population in my riding. They have been 
very concerned that their pensions would be destroyed in the 
budget. I am pleased to be able to tell them that the two main 
pillars of the public pension system, the Canada pension and the 
Quebec pension plan, the old age security and the guaranteed 
income supplement will be maintained and improved.
<P>
	In the budget the Minister of Finance has promised to sit down 
with the provinces in the fall to review our very shaky Canada 
pension plan. The Minister of Finance pledged to release a paper 
in conjunction with the Minister of Human Resources 
Development to recommend changes to the system to ensure its 
affordability, fairness and sustainability as many of us baby 
boomers move into old age.
<P>
	Finally, the minister is announcing a change in the method of 
payment of old age security to high income seniors who have 
been subject to the so-called clawback. This is simply an 
administrative, common sense approach. If we pay out our 
benefits to individuals at a time every month instead of waiting 
until the end of the year to give in and pay back, it just prevents a 
lot of paperwork. That is the kind of silliness that has been 
costing so much money in government spending over the last 
few years.
<P>
<B>(1705 ) </B>
<P>
	The budget has also followed through on our red book 
promises to maintain fairness and equity in our taxation system. 
The Minister of Finance has refused to balance the budget on the 
backs of the poor. Rather it seeks to distribute the onus of fiscal 
frugality to those who have traditionally not been paying their 
fair share.
<P>
	Reforms to family trusts are a good example. I firmly believe 
that in times of fiscal restraint all Canadians should pay their 
fair share and not escape through nice old loopholes.
<P>
	The budget eliminates the cap and justly so for family trusts, 
changes to the family trust administration and will terminate the 
preferred beneficiary election for trust taxation years that begin 
after 1995, except where the beneficiary is physically or 
mentally impaired. Again the government has done a sensible 
thing with compassion so that we will not harm those who are 
most vulnerable.
<P>
	I recognize that family trusts have many valid non-tax 
objectives such as helping with succession planning, but these 
changes ensure that family trusts will not be used to defer capital 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10171"> 10171 </A></B>
<P>
gains for income splitting purposes. That is the loophole we 
were trying to get rid of. Once again the budget has shown that 
we are committed to reductions as long as they are fair.
<P>
	There is more good news for my constituents in the budget 
such as changes to the government's role in transportation. The 
federal government's role in transportation is evolving from that 
of being an operator of the system into one that is primarily a 
policy maker, a regulator and a landlord with only limited 
operational responsibilities. Subsidies are being reduced and in 
many cases eliminated. Major operations will be given more 
commercialized forms and remainder operations will be made 
more efficient with greater reliance on users rather than 
taxpayers to pay the cost of the transportation system.
<P>
	Thus the budget reduces net spending by Transport Canada 
and related agencies by over 50 per cent in 1997-98, from $2.8 
billion to $1.4 billion. As a consequence the port of Vancouver 
in my riding and other ports across Canada will have the 
opportunity to thrive under the autonomy they have sought for 
many years now and finally become competitive.
<P>
	Changes to the mining sector will have a positive impact in 
the long run in B.C. In the budget the federal government has 
decided not to renew mineral development agreements, but it 
also likes to emphasize that this non-renewal does not mean it 
has abandoned the mining sector. The mining sector has not had 
a fair system of taxation to assist it in different levels of mining 
such as reclaimed mines versus new mines. We are going to look 
at these issues so that we can give that sector what it needs and 
remove the barriers so it can thrive and become as viable as we 
know it can be in Ontario and in British Columbia.
<P>
	I would like to comment a bit on members of the Reform Party 
in the House who have attacked our budget. They have said we 
have not done the things we should do and they have discounted 
our figures. They have said that we have been hypocritical.
<P>
	The budget tabled by the third party was punitive and 
non-creative. Throughout the history of the country the Liberal 
Party has always been here at times of change. Whenever the 
country has sought to move into new areas, has sought to 
become a greater country or has sought to change the way we do 
things, there has always been a Liberal government in place to 
lead us into the changes.
<P>
	We are moving into the 21st century. There will be many 
challenges for the country. We have seen we need to be 
competitive. We have seen we need to look at training. We need 
to look at employment. We need to look at jobs. We need to look 
at economic growth. We are focusing on economic growth. We 
are focusing on the engines of growth: small business, science 
and technology. We are going to make the country move 
forward.
<P>
	As always, a Liberal government has been there to help 
Canada to manoeuvre its way through difficult times. We will be 
here once again to move us into the 21st century when I know the 
world will look to Canada for leadership.
<P>

<P>
	<B>Mr. René Canuel (Matapédia-Matane, BQ):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I was listening to what my colleague has just said with 
great interest. I do believe her Liberal roots are showing.
<P>
<B>(1710) </B>
<P>
	It is full of sophisms. I will make a comment and then put a 
question to my colleague. How will it be possible to provide 
quality health care when transfer payments to the provinces will 
be cut by $700 million next year? How will it be possible to 
improve health care? She spoke at length about this earlier.
<P>
	If I were a young graduate, I would be very concerned tonight. 
If I were on income security, I would be even more concerned. If 
I were unemployed, I would be extremely concerned. They are 
talking about cutting 45,000 public service jobs, about closing 
military bases in Saint-Hubert and elsewhere. The extremely 
competent workers who will lose their jobs will surely find other 
jobs, but for a 24-year old graduate, it is a different matter. One 
job means one job, not two jobs.
<P>
	Tonight, I would be very happy if I had a family trust as I 
would have until 1999 to avoid taxes. Nothing to worry about. If 
I were the Royal Bank, I would be very happy, too. I would send 
you a dozen roses and we would sing together. The wealthy are 
rejoicing while the most disadvantaged are sad.
<P>
	I would ask my colleague to really explain to these young 
university graduates and unemployed workers how and where 
this budget will help create jobs quickly, when we know that it 
takes $200 million away from infrastructure programs?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Ms. Fry:</B> Madam Speaker, I would like to respond first to the 
statement the hon. member made about health. Many studies 
have shown now that the health care system is appropriately 
funded but that the health care system needs to be managed more 
efficiently. That is what we should be looking at doing.
<P>
	We do not need to continue to pour money into the system. 
The system can provide the best health care in the world that 
Canadians need if we manage it. It has not been managed on 
sound management principles. We have not looked at the 
outcomes of the things we do to see whether they make a 
difference to the health status of the population.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10172"> 10172 </A></B>
<P>
	There are enough studies now to show that we can save 
significant amounts of money that we can put into important 
aspects like prevention and helping to improve the health status 
of the population so our children can grow out of poverty and 
be healthy. We know that poverty is a major determinant of ill 
health in the country. We need to shift our resources where they 
do the best and where they improve the condition. That is what 
we can do if we manage the system better.
<P>
	I do not see that any kind of cutbacks in funding will make our 
health care system worse. It is a challenge for provinces to learn 
how to manage the system appropriately on sound principles and 
guidelines. I think we can do that and I think the provinces are 
equal to the challenge.
<P>
	With regard to young Canadians who are looking for work and 
any Canadian who is looking for work, the unemployment 
insurance system at the moment has shown us that 25 per cent of 
Canadians across the country are functionally illiterate. Forty 
per cent in the maritimes are functionally illiterate. We are not 
looking at the traditional student any more. We are looking at 
adult populations, non-traditional students, who need skills and 
tools to get back to work.
<P>
	On one hand, the government is trying to push the engines that 
will drive the small and medium size business sector which will 
create 80 per cent of our new jobs. On the other hand, we are 
looking at unemployment insurance as an adjustment that will 
help people to get the tools and the skills they need to get back 
into the workforce so they can become independent contributing 
citizens who contribute to the competitiveness of the country. 
That is what we are looking to do, create opportunity; a 
springboard and not a safety net.
<P>
<B>(1715) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay East, Ref.):</B> Madam Speaker, 
when I listen to many of the Liberal members I am reminded of 
Eliza Doolittle. She was getting very frustrated and she finally 
sang a song which I believe was ``Words, words, words. I am so 
sick of words''.
<P>
	I listened to the member talk about the proposal where the 
government is proposing to combine the money it is transferring 
to the provinces for health and welfare and for post-secondary 
education into this Canada social transfer act, then magically 
make $4.5 billion disappear.
<P>
	Members should know Reform made a proposal like that. 
However, when we talked about it, we were talking about 
transferring tax points, transferring the ability of the provinces 
to be able to fund these. This is simply downloading.
<P>
	The difficulty with this plan is that the Canada Health Act and 
the Canada assistance plan are both etched in stone as far as the 
provinces are concerned. Therefore the entity under the Canada 
social transfer that literally goes begging with this $4.5 billion 
is post-secondary education. Post-secondary education simply 
disappears.
<P>
	I have a very specific question for the member. Considering 
that members' pensions are such a monumental issue in the 
province of British Columbia, I know that her constituents, 
certainly all the people in British Columbia, would be interested 
to know if she intends to exercise her option of opting out of the 
members' pension plan, thereby showing the leadership that the 
people of Canada are looking for.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Fry:</B> Madam Speaker, although the member made a nice 
little speech prior to his question that I would like to comment 
on, I will respond to his question first.
<P>
	The hon. member is asking me if I will opt out of the pension 
plan because he sees it as a way of being responsible. There are 
many ways of being responsible. I would like to look at the 
whole issue. I would like to see whether it is feasible to opt out 
or whether I choose to do so.
<P>
	Reform of pensions is a fundamental and basic issue. It has 
been looked at. The Prime Minister was very clear when he 
talked about reforming members' pensions. We have had a 
report from a third party that talked about a lot of reforms to 
pensions and to MPs incomes that I do not see the hon. member 
discussing in total.
<P>
	It is easy to cherry pick, to take one little part of a report and 
comment on it. You have to look at the whole. That has been a 
fundamental flaw in all of the third party's policies. Its members 
take a little piece of a narrow strip and never look at the big 
picture. They never see how it impacts, whether there is a 
domino effect or not.
<P>
	The hon. member should look at the big picture sometimes.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, as 
the official opposition critic on human resources development, 
since the last election campaign, I am today faced with the 
Martin budget. It has been one long obstacle course.
<P>
	Having come this far and despite what the minister says, I 
know from reading his budget and listening to his speeches that, 
far from giving up the idea of implementing major cuts in social 
programs and centralizing powers, the budget before us 
confirms that what the central government wants most of all is to 
withdraw from health, education, social assistance and other 
social services, but to keep the sectors where it feels it must be 
involved, even if they are not under its jurisdiction.
<P>
<B>(1720) </B>
<P>
	Now, without a word of warning, without any concern for 
efficiency, it is about to shamelessly increase duplication and 
overlap. During the human resources development committee's 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10173"> 10173 </A></B>
<P>
recent tour, many groups and individuals, more than 1,000 
Canadians, came and told us basically that what they needed 
most was not training,  although it was often requested, but 
rather jobs, decent jobs.
<P>
	There is strictly nothing in the budget on this matter. The 
budget is silent for some incomprehensible reason. It is silent, 
while budget cuts alone lead nowhere in terms of dealing 
seriously with the deficit and debt problem. Yes, the minister 
made a step in the right direction, but you need only take a good 
look at the budget to see that the debt will not be reduced this 
year, on the contrary, and that a deficit reduction was achieved at 
the cost of great and extremely difficult sacrifices. Considering 
that a single percentage point will make $1.7 billion difference 
in debt charges, it is obvious that we must not look only at cuts.
<P>
	We must not for the sake of the debt, of course, but above all 
for the people whose livelihood depends, right now, on their jobs 
or the hope of getting one. All over Canada, people have told us 
that they were prepared to talk about social programs and social 
reform, but not in the context of further cuts. They told us also 
that Canada was no leader in terms of social programs. Recent 
OECD statistics clearly show that Canada's social expenditures 
are below OECD average, at the same level as that of New 
Zealand's, for the information of New Zealand admirers.
<P>
	What does this budget say? It tells us that another $7,5 billion 
will be cut in social programs between now and 1998. I say 
``another'' because we must not forget that the previous budget 
passed in this House also provided for a $7.5 billion cut in social 
programs. So, this makes two times $7.5 billion, or a total of $15 
billion, in cuts in social programs over a period of four years. 
That is what we learned following a leak, when the Minister of 
Human Resources Development announced his project. In the 
end, after this whole exercise and after the bickering among 
Liberals, we realize that what was the plan in October is now in 
the Minister of Finance's budget, in spite of all these 
consultations.
<P>
	People said: ``The government can no longer cut into social 
programs''. Yet, the expected cut is being made, in spite of the 
problems that it will generate. What else does this budget tell 
us? We see that the federal government is backing away from 
funding in health, education and welfare.
<P>
<B>(1725) </B>
<P>
	I use the term ``backing away'' because the federal financing 
of these sectors is reduced to such an extent that the provinces 
will experience increasingly more serious problems. The 
merging of the old financing, education and health programs, as 
well as social assistance, is called the Canada Social Transfer. 
This transfer hides two realities mentioned in the budget. First, 
because of this Canada Social Transfer, if there is a recession, 
the provinces will have to fully assume the additional costs 
related to the increase in the number of people relying on 
welfare. That is what I mean by backing away, Madam Speaker.
<P>
	The Canada Assistance Plan, which was far from being 
perfect, was based on the financing, by the federal government, 
of provincial programs designed to help the poor. The federal 
government is now eliminating that structure, claiming that it 
will provide more flexibility. But where is the flexibility for the 
provinces? The federal government is not transferring 
responsibilities to the provinces: they already had them. Rather, 
it is transferring costs and, in fact, leaving the provinces to look 
after the problems, while knowing full well that, in the end, it is 
Canadians who will pay the price, and in a very dramatic way.
<P>
	I will repeat a comment made by the hon. member from 
British Columbia who spoke just before me. She said that the 
government was giving back to the provinces the power to spend 
because they are in the best position to do so appropriately. Why 
is it that the government is giving back to the provinces funds 
which are dwindling and about to disappear? The federal 
government is telling the provinces to use their imagination, 
when it is in fact dumping its problems on them.
<P>
	But there is money available, even though that may come as a 
surprise to you. There is a hidden fund which explains why the 
budget may have looked better than expected. I am referring to 
the UI fund and the programs financed through that fund. 
Quebec asked for the control of the whole manpower sector, or 
at least as regards vocational training. There is money for that. 
Where will that money go? Unfortunately, when there is money 
available, the federal government does not think that the 
provinces are in the best position to show some imagination, to 
know what the public's needs are, and to help Canadians. No. 
The federal government only recognizes the ability of the 
provinces when they are forced to live with cuts, to make hard 
decisions and to look like the culprits.
<P>
	However, when the provinces could have the tools to promote 
employment and define meaningful strategies, then the federal 
government prefers to remain in control.
<P>
	Thanks to the UI fund, the federal government can, in its 
budget, make proposals which almost go unnoticed. One such 
proposal is the new investment fund for human resources.

	The House resumed consideration of the motion, of the 
amendment, and of the amendment to the amendment.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, it 
is always difficult to pick up the momentum one had in the first 
part of a speech. I am sure that we lost our listeners and viewers 
during the vote.
<P>
	I just would like to add very quickly that there is something I 
find very surprising in this budget, and that is the role of the 
unemployment insurance fund. As we saw, the federal 
government is withdrawing from funding health care, education 
and social assistance. This spring, it passed Bill C-17, which 
tightened up eligibility criteria so that fewer people were 
entitled to UI, and received smaller benefits for a shorter period 
of time.
<P>
	The UI fund allowed the federal government to pay itself back 
for the loan it had made during the recession and consequently to 
present a more favourable picture. But this is not all. Since the 
government did not lower premiums but reduced eligibility, it 
was able to make some incredible forecasts. This year and next, 
there will be a difference of $5 billion between expenditures and 
revenues.
<P>
	What is this money going to be used for? Naturally, the 
government proposes, first, to reduce the deficit. Does it 
propose to reduce contributions, to help small and medium size 
businesses? No. It proposes to let a surplus of $5 billion 
accumulate. What it also proposes, to finance the creation of a 
human resources investment fund, as the budget calls it, through 
a new reform of unemployment insurance, is to divert money 
from UI to this new fund.
<P>
<B>(1805) </B>
<P>
	In fact, the unemployment insurance fund is the cash cow of 
the federal government. It will protect it from the effects of the 
next recession. By withdrawing from the financing of social 
programs and the CAP in particular, the federal government 
leaves the provinces in a position where they will have to deal 
with the consequences of a future recession and a future increase 
in the numbers of the poor, while insulating itself from such 
consequences. How? By having surpluses in the unemployment 
insurance fund.
<P>
	Who generates such a surplus? Companies, of course. But not 
any company, the ones that are labour-intensive, that is the 
low-tech companies, those where things are done manually. The 
companies where wages are the lowest. These companies and 
these workers contribute in a large part to the unemployment 
insurance fund. Companies with more technology and higher 
wages, because of ceilings, are exempt. And this means that the 
fund is financed by workers and companies which are not the 
main beneficiaries of the fund. Not only do they help give the 
federal government some protection against the next recession, 
they also allow it to show a lower deficit since the money is 
added to the federal budget. We recommended that it not be 
included anymore.
<P>
	Finally, not only do we see more cuts in social programs, 
nothing whatsoever in the way of employment, and continued 
interference by the federal government in areas where there is 
money to be had and where it can call the shots, but in the case of 
manpower training, the federal government no longer says that 
the provinces know best. That is not what it says. It maintains 
control over job training and all manpower issues. As I said, it 
does not want to withdraw from areas where there is money to be 
had.
<P>
	However, the money in the unemployment insurance fund 
comes from labour-intensive corporations employing a lot of 
low-paid workers and from these workers. Let me conclude by 
saying that the workers are really the ones who foot the bill since 
the corporations pass on their costs onto the consumer.
<P>
	It is really a shame to see the federal government use this fund 
to shamelessly guard against whatever the future holds, while 
workers will have to pay more taxes and will run into more 
problems in the areas of health, education and welfare.
<P>
	There is another important issue I want to address and it is 
linked to the new national standards that we can expect with the 
Canada social transfer. Throughout the budget speech, we are 
told ``This is the beginning of a new era in Canada. We have 
finally realized that provinces know best'', especially, may I 
add, in tough times. But there is more.
<P>
	With this new Canada social transfer, the federal government 
will be able to withdraw during the next recession and still have 
the power to set new standards.
<P>
<B>(1810) </B>
<P>
	What are we told? We are told that, for two years, this Canada 
social transfer will be funded at the average combined rate of 
CAP and EPF and that, for two years, health care standards will 
apply, so that the federal government will be able to withhold 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10176"> 10176 </A></B>
<P>
payments to provinces who do not comply. We are also told that 
the Canadian assistance plan, or CAP, the source of half of the 
social program funding in Canada, no longer exists. The only 
responsibility that remains is to make welfare payments without 
minimum residency requirements.
<P>
	The bottom line is that the government, by dropping CAP, 
wants to be seen as generous and mindful, at last, of the role of 
provinces. But the fact is that the government is retreating 
because it can no longer afford CAP. It does not want to invest 
the money needed to give its share to Ontario, a province that 
suffered a lot during the last recession. The government was in a 
bind and either had to find more money, or penalize Quebec. So, 
it decided to put on a show of openness, but at the same time to 
prepare with the provinces new standards applicable, as Mr. 
Martin said, to the Canada social transfer.
<P>
	No more cuts, no more centralizing. Let the people and the 
provinces take care of all the problems and the debt. But the 
federal government got itself some breathing space by using the 
money of workers and small businesses.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Patrick Gagnon (Parliamentary Secretary to Solicitor 
General, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, I find it strange that the 
opposition critic objects to this transfer of some areas of 
jurisdiction to the provinces. Even though the role of the 
opposition is to criticize the government, in this case, it is still 
criticizing federalism.
<P>
	We talked about the surplus in the unemployment insurance 
fund. Certainly, these past few years, we have been forced to 
review our programs, to seriously reevaluate them, in order to 
see where we are in these programs which have existed for more 
than fifty years or so. We certainly must make some 
adjustments. We must face the new challenges of market 
globalization, and I believe that the federal government is fully 
aware of the importance of taking some corrective measures in 
this regard.
<P>
	I would like the opposition critic to tell us what she thinks 
about the fact that the government has decided to do more in 
counselling services, in basic training abilities, as well as in 
training and experience in the workplace. It also intends to do 
more in child care services. It is even looking at the 
opportunities relating to the income supplement. I would like to 
know if, in her opinion, these are not new ways of doing or 
seeing things which are highly commendable and which will 
certainly work towards the well-being of the people of Quebec.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Lalonde:</B> Madam Speaker, I thank my hon. colleague 
for his question.
<P>
	First, I want to say that if I talked about surpluses in the 
unemployment insurance fund, it is because these surpluses are 
due to the cuts that have been made. However, my hon. 
colleague gives me the opportunity to say that what the federal 
government is about to do with its Human Resources Investment 
Fund is to provide itself with a fat account, because it will be 
supplied both by the programs presently financed through the 
Consolidated Revenue Fund and-this is made very clear in the 
budget-by the reallocation of the moneys saved by a new 
reform of unemployment insurance.
<P>
	That means that the government will provide itself with a big 
fund to take action in areas of provincial jurisdiction. It will not 
even bother any longer to try to negotiate or impose its 
standards, it will take action.
<P>
<B>(1815) </B>
<P>
	The last step is the centralization in Canada of social 
programs since the transfer of jurisdictions, because at that time 
at least they sought approval by Parliament. The last step deals 
with direct involvement in day care services, in income 
supplements, because the minister's objective was to be able to 
take up, through federal funds, the assistance, employability and 
job development services, yes, but for people able to work, who 
from now on would not be under provincial jurisdiction but who 
would, because of the long term unemployed provisions, fall 
under the central government's control.
<P>
	So, there is indeed a large reform under way, but that reform, 
instead of going in the direction of recognizing provincial 
jurisdictions, is going in the direction of giving, through 
funding, direct power to the central government. This 
government does not care about overlap and duplication. It does 
not care about co-ordinating its operations and setting a strategy 
with the provinces, which means that in fact the government will 
completely take over the area of manpower. Under the 
circumstances, it is easy to understand why it does not want to 
hand over manpower training to Quebec.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay East, Ref.):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
would like to make my position very clear that I do not believe 
for a second that the people of Quebec, given the opportunity to 
vote in a referendum that is fairly put to the people, will vote in 
favour of separation. The member and I have a very substantial 
difference.
<P>
	I want to put that on record because I would like to ask a 
question that would encompass both the possibility of her 
achieving her dream of Quebec separating and if not. In the issue 
of bringing education, hospital and the Canada assistance plan 
together under one roof and downloading as the Liberals are 
trying to do, at the same time removing $4.5 billion which 
means that if we are going to maintain the same level of service, 
which may or may not be necessary, the taxes would then have to 
go up at the provincial level.
<P>
	If we can just set that aside, I would like to ask a question in 
terms of concept because she did raise the issue of national 
standards. If, as I have already stated, I reject categorically the 
concept of a separate Quebec but nonetheless if that should 
transpire, how would the people of Quebec be better off 
considering that there would be absolutely no national 
standards; in 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10177"> 10177 </A></B>
<P>
other words there would be no joint jurisdiction between Quebec 
and Canada?
<P>
	Second, if, as I believe is going to happen, Quebec people 
choose what is best for them and do stay in Canada, would 
Quebec and the provinces not be better off if they had the ability 
to raise the taxes? In other words, the federal government 
transfers the ability to tax the tax points to the provinces. If they 
were administering the programs, is that not really the 
fundamental problem that the BQ and the PQ are presently 
trying to do, to get more jurisdiction over the areas of health, 
welfare and post-secondary education?
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Lalonde: </B>Madam Speaker, if I understood well the 
question of the hon. member, he is wondering if we are not 
asking in fact for a transfer of tax points. That was the position 
we adopted and the minority report of the Committee on Human 
Resources Development refers to a transfer of tax points.
<P>
	However, it is important to make a point about standards. In 
all regions of Canada where the members of the Committee have 
travelled, il was clear that everywhere, except in Quebec, people 
want strong national standards. As far as they are concerned, 
Quebecers want, with a few exceptions, to have their own 
standards.
<P>
<B>(1820) </B>
<P>
	Quebecers are a people, even though they do not always call 
themselves that way et they want to make their own standards. 
Often, those standards are higher than elsewhere for reasons I 
will not explain here, but it is nevertheless a fact. It is true for 
daycare services, it is true in the case of the Act on handicapped 
people, and I could go on.
<P>
	But being a distinct people with regional differences, it is 
normal that Quebec wants to create its own standards. This is 
what I had to say on that issue. From a philosophical point of 
view, the economic or social organization is different from one 
people to another. You only have to study peoples as a whole or 
even peoples having a comparable level of social expenses to 
see that choices are different according to peoples, their history, 
their priorities or simply because they are different from one 
another.
<P>
	It is therefore on that basis, without explaining it with rational 
arguments, that one can understand and defend the idea that the 
people of Quebec wants its own standards.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Alfonso Gagliano (Secretary of State (Parliamentary 
Affairs) and Deputy Leader of the Government in the House 
of Commons, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, I must say that yesterday, 
I listened to the finance minister's speech with interest. I was 
expecting answers to the many questions put to me in recent 
months and weeks by the people of Saint-Léonard.
<P>
	Indeed, all the people I met with and spoke to on the phone 
gave me much the same advice: ``Make up your mind, do 
something, it is time to take action''. They told me: ``Put your 
fiscal house in order, we are on the road to ruin''. They said: 
``Downsize the government, it is too expensive''. And above all, 
they begged me not to raise taxes. They also said not to touch 
seniors. They said they wanted to continue to invest in their 
RRSPs because they needed them. They told me to cut subsidies 
to businesses, to support small and medium size businesses and 
to tax big corporations and banks.
<P>
	The electorate in Saint-Léonard is realistic. People there are 
reasonable and pragmatic. They know that our future depends on 
the choices we are making now, in the budget the Minister of 
Finance tabled yesterday afternoon. They know that we must 
take the bull by the horns and learn to live according to our 
means. But above all, they know that without a drastic 
about-face this year, our standard of living and our future 
chances at prosperity are in danger.
<P>
	Right at the beginning of his speech, the minister said: 
``Today, we have made our choice. Today, we take action''. Yes, 
indeed. Our government chose to take the most drastic 
budgetary measures ever seen in 50 years to control this monster 
that our deficit has become. The federal government will tighten 
its belt and cut expenditures-all expenditures at all levels.
<P>
	However, we will do so in the greatest respect of the values 
that Canadians hold so dear. We will promote job creation and 
economic recovery. We will protect the most vulnerable in our 
society. We will cut down on our life-style. And we will do all 
this without raising taxes, without cutting the old age pension 
and without taxing retirement savings plans.
<P>
<B>(1825) </B>
<P>
	Today, in Saint-Léonard as in everywhere else across the 
country, Canadians applaud the Minister of Finance. He had the 
guts to do what others had promised to do for almost ten years. 
For too long, we have only had smoke screens. Canadians want 
results, solid and measurable results, and we already have some.
<P>
	Last year, we promised in our first budget to reduce the deficit 
to under $40 billion. Once all calculations are done, our bottom 
line should show that our basic deficit is some $4.4 billion less 
than expected. Now those are tangible results. This is something 
new and exciting. For ten years, there were promises to reduce 
the deficit, but it never happened. And now we managed to make 
it happen, and we did even better than we expected.
<P>
	It has been a long time since anyone saw a government 
overestimate its deficit. The results have been very encouraging 
as well, here in the House of Commons. As you know, Madam 
Speaker, a year ago the Board of Internal Economy adopted a 
plan to restructure the expenditures of the House of Commons. 
This plan, referred to by some-rather ironically, I suppose-as 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10178"> 10178 </A></B>
<P>
the  Gagliano plan, was aimed at cutting our expenditures by $5 
million annually.
<P>
	The big challenge was to make these cuts while at the same 
time providing members and their staff with the tools they need 
to fulfil the mandate they were given by their electorate. 
However, times are changing, technology has become more 
sophisticated and, as a result, members as well as the general 
public must adapt their tools to changing needs.
<P>
	For instance, the advent of fax machines and electronic 
transmission has completely changed our requirement for 
messengers on Parliament Hill. We sat down and methodically 
analysed our requirements. We suggested new approaches and 
implemented our recommendations carefully and diligently.
<P>
	We helped our employees by proposing generous terms for 
voluntary departure, which a large number accepted. We 
redefined tasks and ask the rest of the staff to do their share, each 
employee being asked to do a little more with a little less.
<P>
	This morning, the President of the Treasury Board reported on 
the results of this plan. So far, the House of Commons has saved 
no less than $5,719,500, compared with last year's budget. We 
have not only achieved our objective, we have already exceeded 
it.
<P>
	But there is more. This exercise continues, since yesterday, 
the Speaker announced a reduction of $1 million in the budget of 
the Food Services Branch of the House of Commons. 
Implemented over a period of three years, this measure will help 
reduce the operational expenditures of the House of Commons 
by nearly $7 million annually.
<P>
	That is what I call results. Concrete results that clearly show 
we mean what we say when we want to put our house in order.
<P>
	We are the first to tighten our belts, and we are not asking 
anyone to do anything we are not prepared to do ourselves.
<P>
<B>(1830) </B>
<P>
	The answer is simple, and everyone knows what it is. From 
one end of the country to the other, Canadians are staying within 
their budget by watching their spending every day. The time has 
come for all governments, including our own, to do the same.
<P>
	The Minister of Finance has clearly stated our overall plan. 
For every dollar of additional revenue, the government will 
reduce its expenditures by $7. This is an extremely bold new 
direction, the most cost effective seen in this country in the past 
50 years.
<P>
	To ensure the long term health of public finances, we must 
review the role and structure of government, without fail. We 
must centre the activities of government on the priorities of 
Canadians. With this budget, we are reducing the size and 
structure of government to a level in keeping with our means.
<P>
	As the Minister of Finance put it so well, and I quote: ``Our 
view is straightforward. If government doesn't need to run 
something, it shouldn't. And, in the future, it won't''.
<P>
	The government is therefore going to privatize and 
commercialize its activities whenever possible and desirable. 
We will progressively divest ourselves of our interests in 
companies such as Cameco, a uranium company, CN, 
Petro-Canada, the Air Navigation System and the Canada 
Communication Group.
<P>
	We will reduce our subsidies to business by 60 per cent-I 
repeat, 60 per cent-within three years. Assistance to industries 
which we shall maintain will be targeted to the main driving 
forces behind economic growth, namely expanding trade, 
science and technology and small business.
<P>
	Almost every time I rise in this House, I remind my 
colleagues of the important role played by small business in our 
economy.
<P>
	It is always with great pride that I point out that small 
business is the main source of new jobs in our country. Small 
business is ever-changing, full of vitality and creativity. It helps 
us recover more quickly from downturns in economic cycles and 
makes a major contribution to community development. It 
should therefore be a matter of priority to provide small 
business with concrete assistance to ensure its survival and 
growth. Better yet, we should eliminate obstacles to its success, 
because when it succeeds, we succeed.
<P>
	Last year we announced our plan to review the $500,000 
capital gains cumulative tax exemption for farmers and small 
business owners. We have undertaken this review and have 
concluded that this exemption should be left intact.
<P>
	I would like to go into a few details in this regard. Yesterday 
evening, the Leader of the Opposition tried to plant the seeds of 
fear and confusion in Quebec by criticizing the government for 
wishing to review certain issues which we must face in coming 
years.
<P>
	True, the government does want to review and discuss with 
the provinces how to preserve our old age pension system, 
modernize our unemployment insurance system and maintain 
assistance programs for the poor.
<P>
	The Leader of the Opposition said earlier that when 
governments undertake a review, it is always with cutting in 
mind. I say to my hon. colleague, this is not so. We must be 
careful not to make such generalizations. We must not plant the 
seeds of fear and confusion without any good reason. Reviewing 
means analyzing, examining. Consulting means looking for 
solutions.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10179"> 10179 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1835) </B>
<P>
	The $500,000 capital gains exemption for small businesses 
and farmers proves it.
<P>
	Last year, we said that we would review the matter. After 
reviewing it, we said that we would keep it, that keeping it was 
important. Therefore, we must not scare people and have them 
believe that we are going to change everything and take pensions 
away from people just because the Minister of Finance 
announced yesterday that he will be reviewing the pension plan.
<P>
	These organizations, like the Federal Office of Regional 
Development-Quebec, play important roles in economic growth 
and sustainable job creation. Nevertheless, we will not reach 
these goals by showering businesses with gifts. Everyone agrees 
on this point. Therefore, we are going to reduce business 
subsidies substantially. In the future, most assistance will take 
the form of refundable loans to businesses.
<P>
	The repayment conditions attached to these loans will 
promote true expansion possibilities. They will continue to 
really help our small and medium size businesses, yet get the 
most for our taxpayers' money.
<P>
	Lastly, we are determined to give our small and medium size 
businesses access to the financing they need to remain the 
primary source of job creation in Canada. I have often repeated 
my deep conviction that Canadian banks in particular have 
responsibilities in this area.
<P>
	We have already taken the initiative of working with banks to 
correct their current shortcomings. From now until the fall, we 
will continue our efforts in this area in order to draw up points of 
reference for small business financing. We want to see concrete 
results in that sector as well. This process will be reviewed next 
year, and we have every reason to believe that this collaboration 
will produce valid results for our small businesses.
<P>
	The budget tabled in this House yesterday by the Minister of 
Finance marks the beginning of a new era. It proposes a new way 
to manage the Canadian Confederation. It features a simpler, 
more efficient approach that recognizes provincial areas of 
jurisdiction. That is why we can say without any doubt that this 
budget reflects our progressive, dynamic, co-operative and 
pragmatic approach to federalism.
<P>
	No one can accuse the Canadian government of promoting or 
proposing the status quo. The provinces will now enjoy greater 
flexibility and fewer constraints in managing their areas of 
jurisdiction. The Canada social transfer, which combines into a 
single consolidated block transfer the three separate payments 
the provinces used to receive from the federal government, will 
greatly facilitate operations. This new approach will reduce 
administrative obstacles for the provinces while giving them 
maximum flexibility in adjusting programs to users' needs. 
Provincial governments will no longer have to identify eligible 
expenditures. They will prepare their own budgets and make 
their own decisions.
<P>
	This initiative will simplify bureaucracy at the federal and 
provincial levels. There will be less red tape, fewer regulations 
and more results. That is what Canadians from all parts of the 
country expect from their federal and provincial governments 
alike. I admit that our budget is a tough one. The cuts announced 
are without precedent.
<P>
<B>(1840) </B>
<P>
	But we no longer had any choice. If we want to maintain our 
standard of living and preserve our children's future, the 
government has to take firm measures and implement them with 
determination.
<P>
	Nevertheless, all should recognize that the budget is also fair. 
We have made sure that everyone participates in the effort to 
correct the situation. The residents of Saint-Léonard understand 
that, as do all Canadians. Our budget is tough, but it preserves 
the essential. It respects the fundamental principle of fairness 
between individuals and between regions which guides 
Canadians. That principle forms the very foundation of our 
federation and makes Canada one of the best countries in the 
world. If you will permit me, Madam Speaker, I would like to 
say a few words to my English speaking voters.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The budget the Minister of Finance introduced last night is 
definitely a strong budget. The question we have to ask 
ourselves today is whether we had a choice. In the last few 
months international financial markets and our own financial 
institutions had sent the message that we had to put our financial 
house in order.
<P>
	The Minister of Finance, who has the responsibility to find a 
balance between restoring confidence in the market and not 
being too harsh in cutting measures, was able to ensure that 
economic growth would continue. At the same time, the 
financial markets were looking for a commitment from the 
government that it was serious and meant business about putting 
its financial house in order.
<P>
	The Minister of Finance did a very good job in presenting his 
very balanced budget. This morning we saw the financial 
markets responding, as did the media and the people. I have been 
a member of the House for over 10 years. It is the first time that 
after the presentation of a budget I have seen such positive 
announcements and comments in the media and elsewhere. We 
owe a message of congratulations to the Minister of Finance and 
the government for a job well done.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Lee Morrison (Swift Current-Maple 
Creek-Assiniboia, Ref.):</B> Madam Speaker, after hearing the 
reassuring words of the minister I would like to be able to say I 
will sleep better tonight, but I cannot.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="10180"> 10180 </A></B>
<P>
	The minister referred in his presentation to serving up 
illusions. The inference is that this is no longer happening to 
us with the present government. We have had 25 years of 
illusions, 25 years of rhetoric, 25 years of telling us we are 
going to get tough with the deficit, we are going to really move 
in on it this year, next year or the year after that.
<P>
	What the minister forgets is that it was much easier for 
previous finance ministers to sell illusions than it is for the 
incumbent. Previous finance ministers could actually make 
illusory cuts and sell them, but the present minister, in order to 
sell an illusion, has to make real cuts. The problem is that it 
remains an illusion because the cuts are not deep enough.
<P>
	All that is happening is that the government is making enough 
cuts in the projected spending for the next three years to keep 
even with the additional interest that it is going to have to pay on 
the money it already owes. The government is standing still.
<P>
	It makes me think of a sailor who has been shipwrecked and is 
treading water madly. He sees a lifeboat about 100 yards away. 
Instead of trying to make it to that lifeboat he says: ``That's too 
tough, that's too hard. I'm just going to keep right on treading 
water''. He does and eventually he drowns. This government is 
treading water and Canada is drowning in debt.
<P>
<B>(1845) </B>
<P>
	I ask the minister, what contingency plan does this 
government have for the time when the interest payments on our 
deadweight debt become so great that there is no money left to 
maintain social programs or even basic government services? 
This is the direction in which we are heading.
<P>
	We are heading in a direction where there will be no social 
safety net. There will be no pensions. There will be no welfare. 
There will be no UIC. There will be nothing if the whole rotten 
house of cards comes tumbling down. What contingency plan 
does this government have?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gagliano:</B> Madam Speaker, first I want to thank the hon. 
member for giving me the opportunity to express my thoughts 
on this matter.
<P>
	I understand the member. I have the same frustration. I have 
been in this House for 10 years. Every year we would see the 
Minister of Finance get up and promise to reduce the deficit, but 
he never did. Last year, for the first time in 10 or 11 years, a 
Minister of Finance stood in this House and predicted a deficit.
<P>
	The government fiscal year end is March 31 and we are now at 
February 28. We are one month away from the end of the fiscal 
year and we are predicting, after accounting for everything, that 
the deficit will be reduced by more than what we predicted, $4 
billion more. That was the commitment we made to Canadians 
in the last election. It was the commitment we made to 
Canadians when the Prime Minister took office. We said that 
what we say is what is going to happen because we made that  
commitment and we want to make sure that Canadians know.
<P>
	That is why this morning financial markets and all the 
economic and financial analysts were very satisfied with the 
budget. They finally realize that we are going to have a deficit of 
$24 billion next year, which is our commitment in the red book 
we campaigned on, of 3 per cent of the GDP. It is important to 
our financial markets, our financial and economic system that 
we make the assurance that when we predict something, when 
we estimate and make assumptions that we know what we are 
assuming and we reach those targets.
<P>
	That is the first thing the Minister of Finance did in his first 
budget. He has continued to do it in the second budget. He has 
kept our commitment of 3 per cent and also has reached beyond 
that.
<P>
	There will be a day when we will have no deficit and we can 
start tackling the national debt. There will be that day with this 
government and with this Minister of Finance.
<P>
	Also, the member should not forget that besides having a 
financial deficit there is a human deficit. The government is not 
a business that can just close the door and say: ``Well, too bad''. 
This is a government. We are running a country. Besides the 
financial deficit there are human beings who have to be 
considered.
<P>
	That is what the Minister of Finance and this government are 
doing. We are making sure we keep our commitment to reduce 
the deficit so that we will be able to tackle the debt and have 
economic prosperity in order to assist those in need. We will be 
able to create jobs for the youth of this country so they will have 
a future.
<P>
	The way the Reform Party sees things, everything is black and 
tomorrow is the end of the world.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay East, Ref.):</B> Madam Speaker, to 
the secretary of state, I notice in the document provided by the 
government yesterday called the ``Budget in Brief'' there is a 
quote on page 14: ``This government is absolutely committed to 
providing a fair and sustainable system of protection for 
Canada's seniors''.
<P>
	I wonder if he can help us understand something here. The 
government has just made, I grant, real cuts of $10 billion. The 
payment on interest in the time that this government has been in 
place has increased $10 billion which means that we are treading 
water. Interest charges are increasing at a rate of 17.3 per cent. 
The governments have let our Canada pension plan get into a 
position of being underfunded $487.5 billion on top of the $545 
billion that we are in debt at the national level; in other words, 
over a trillion dollars.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="10181"> 10181 </A></B>
<P>
	Considering all this, I wonder if he would not agree with me 
that the words in ``Budget in Brief'' saying, to quote the finance 
minister, that come hell or high water we are going to look after 
our seniors are not just words.
<P>
	If we are going in the hole that quickly with additional interest 
charges which is interest being paid on money that we have 
already borrowed, we are going backward so rapidly that in spite 
of this government's words we are not going to have the capacity 
to be able to look after our seniors.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gagliano:</B> Madam Speaker, let me assure the hon. 
member and all Canadians watching as of this moment that there 
will be money. The Government of Canada will be able to keep 
its commitments and pay pensions to seniors.
<P>
	The difference is that the Reform Party sees everything black, 
it is the end of the world. The member acknowledged that we 
have made real cuts. We have a balanced budget in terms of real 
cuts and it will encourage economic growth. The deficit will 
disappear. The deficit will be reduced by creating jobs.
<P>
	What the Reform does not understand is that by creating jobs 
people work, pay taxes and will increase the number of dollars 
that will come in. The government will pay the debt.
<P>
	The problem that we had in the past 10 years was the previous 
government committed to certain targets that were never met 
and the expenses were higher than revenues. For the first time in 
Canada our operating budget is in surplus. That is what the 
Reform Party does not want to understand.
<P>

<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu): </B>It being 6.52 p.m., and 
since no member wants to take part in the adjournment debate, 
the House stands adjourned until tomorrow at 2 p.m., pursuant 
to Standing Order 24(1).
<P>
	(The House adjourned at 6.52 p.m.)
