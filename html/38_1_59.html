<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first two petitions are from citizens in my riding stating that  because the majority of Canadians support the current legal definition of marriage as a voluntary union of a single, that is unmarried, male and a single, that is unmarried, female, it is the duty of Parliament to ensure that marriage is defined as Canadians wish it to be defined.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The  petitioners would like to draw to the attention of the House that they believe that the majority of Canadians believe that the fundamental matters of social policy should be decided by elected members of Parliament and not the unelected judiciary, and also that it is their view that Parliament's duty is to ensure that marriage continues to be defined as Canadians wish it to be defined.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore they call upon Parliament to use all possible legislative and administrative measures, including the invocation of section 33 of the charter, referred to as the notwithstanding clause, if necessary, to preserve and protect the current definition of marriage, which is the union of one man and one woman to the exclusion of all others.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I submit that the chair and the committee staff failed to take into account the ruling made by Speaker Parent  on February 12, 1998 when deciding on the admissibility of the amendment from the member for Chambly—Borduas. I submit  a copy of his short ruling.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The crux of the ruling is that a royal recommendation is not required for an initiative for which there is already a statutory authority. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of Bill C-23, I submit that there is a statutory authority for a set number of commissioners. I submit that an  additional royal recommendation is not required for the numbers of commissioners to be changed, even expanded, so long as their  is existing statutory authority.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I specifically call your attention to Erskine May, 21st edition, page 717 under paragraph (c)(6), which states that a  Queen's recommendation is not needed for an expenditure covered by an existing authority, including:</p>
<p>

<td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>Widening the jurisdiction of a court or creating offences although  they may have the effect of increasing the costs of the administration of justice.</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is the quote  relied upon by Speaker Parent in his ruling.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this case the member for Chambly—Borduas was attempting  to widen the membership of the board from 4  to 17. I submit  that this proposed amendment was in order and that the committee should be given the opportunity to consider this amendment in clause by clause on Bill C-23.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Speaker, I am aware of your rulings on committees that state that committees must be and  remain masters of their own affairs, and of course I respect that  ruling, but unless we can have clarity on the admissibility of this amendment, I do not see how we can proceed with the legislation should it be reported back this week, which is the current plan of the committee.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I therefore ask you  to rule on the admissibility of the amendment and transmit your ruling to the chair of the committee before the committee reports, which has already been done and  we have agreed to present it today in the House of Commons. However  I hope  you will give us a decision that will reflect the decision of Speaker Parent in  1998.</p>

This is indeed a very serious procedural question. Allow me to explain.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You know that we currently have 22 operational parliamentary committees. One of their main activities is clause by clause study of various bills. Another function, which has fallen to committees is the consideration of certain reports and certain questions, the manner of which is left to the committees.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not intend to elaborate on this latter mandate of the committees, but rather on their primary mandate, which is the clause by clause study of bills referred to them by the House. We must have more ample instructions from the Chair on matters that entail monetary commitments on the part of the government, which are not amendable by the committees. This would facilitate the whole task. We must in fact draw a distinction with a private member's bill that involves a monetary expenditure. We realize that private members' business involving are not in order.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the purpose of a bill, however, at the time of clause by clause study, it is clear that there are monetary implications. I am informed that the chair of the Standing Committee on Human Resources, Skills Development, Social Development and the Status of Persons with Disabilities has decided that this could not be amended because money was involved. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Consequently, Mr. Speaker, it is for this reason that your decision is important. If committees cannot amend clauses dealing with financial commitments, you will understand the difficulty in justifying the continued existence of parliamentary committees. What will be the use of having them if they cannot amend clauses that have a monetary impact?</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is why I support the point of order raised by my friend from Acadie—Bathurst.</p><A NAME="T1015"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1015"><!-- Hour: 10--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1020"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1010"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1015)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

It is an important issue.  We, from the government perspective, have not had a great deal of time to reflect on precisely the nature of what the member for Acadie—Bathurst is attempting to achieve.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Mr. Speaker, you and many of your predecessors have maintained that committees are masters of their own domain.  From our perspective, you have been very clear on numerous occasions in ruling that committees within their own domain are masters of their own proceedings.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Speaker, I would urge you to consider carefully what the member for Acadie—Bathurst has asked.  We look forward to your ruling.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my opinion, we must now consider the situation. I note that the committee has already reported the bill to the House, which is now at report stage.

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hon. member for Montmagny—L'Islet—Kamouraska—Rivière-du-Loup wants to respond to this question.</p><A NAME="Int-1136012"></A><a HREF="#Int-1136035"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-1136005"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Paul Crête (Montmagny—L'Islet—Kamouraska—Rivière-du-Loup, BQ): </b>Mr. Speaker, I was in fact on the committee.

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe that this matter goes beyond the  internal rules of a committee. In fact, all government operations, ultimately, are being called into question. If this practice, this precedent, is important and definitive, it would alter the whole validity of each committee. So a ruling on this would be important regardless.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, an appeal of the decision was called for, and the decision upheld by a majority vote.</p><A NAME="Int-1136035"></A><a HREF="#Int-1136042"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-1136012"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Yvon Godin: </b>Mr. Speaker, I personally attended the committee meetings this week.

The fact is that the chair of any committee, and in fact all the members of a committee, do rely on table officers to provide them with advice; we can only assume.  But when there is a challenge, the challenge then is a challenge which is voted on by the committee members without the knowledge of the rules. We should not get away from the fact that if there was an error in the advice of the table officers to the chair or to the committee then there must be a remedy to rectify it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also wanted to rise because I am also aware that this problem was brought to the attention of the Table prior to returning the bill from committee and reporting that bill to the House.  I would like to know more about that, because if that bill had not been tabled there could have been a report stage motion tabled in time. Once the bill is tabled, and with, I believe, the restrictions on the timeframe of submitting report stage motions, it could have been a frustration of the opportunity to correct or remedy a possible error at committee. It has happened where bills will have report stage within 48 hours of being reported to the House.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do believe that this is much more than a dispute between parties.  I think the fundamental question appears to be whether or not there was an error in ruling or judgment on behalf of the table officers advising a committee.</p><A NAME="Int-1136063"></A><a HREF="#Int-1136086"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-1136042"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Speaker: </b>I point out to the hon. member for Mississauga South that amendments cannot be moved in the House to a bill at report stage until the bill has been reported from the committee, so I think he has that order incorrect in his argument.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The amendments can be presented now.  The bill is not being called today on report stage, so amendments can be submitted until that happens. We will see what happens in terms of proposed amendments that members submit  for report stage consideration on this bill. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With respect to the committee proceedings, I will examine the record.  I thank the hon. members for their answers to the questions.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said: Mr. Speaker, I feel as if I have been a runner poised in the starting blocks for the last 25 minutes. I hope those watching CPAC have been as riveted by this morning's procedural debate as I have.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are about to enter into an  important debate today around a number of key issues for the government, for this minority Parliament and for the future of all Canadians.  I would like to touch on a number of key topics this morning, around leadership and  promises made and promises broken for all Canadians.  This is about the health of Canadians and the health of our economy. It is about policy and the role of government in making policy to maintain the health of Canadians and the health of our economy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am very proud to stand here today.  I had full intentions and hopes that our leader would be able to present this motion, as this is one of the key reasons he entered the political realm.  His disappointment in not being here is great, but I am sure the House will be happy to know that he is recuperating well and is continuing to push the government for some serious action around climate change in this country.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With respect to leadership and vision about where this country needs to go, the Liberal Party of Canada presented its now infamous red book to Canadians in 1993, with a whole series of promises.  Most of them, we now know, have been broken outright.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In particular, there was a promise made around greenhouse gas emissions.  Yesterday we heard the tone in the House on the most auspicious day of the Kyoto accord coming into effect, where all parties rose, opposition parties at least, and denounced the government for its lack of planning, lack of foresight and readiness for this most important agreement. The parliamentary secretary called it a day of celebration.  I am not sure the minister would agree with him after yesterday's debate.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was not a celebratory mood in the House. It was a mood of frustration shared by all opposition parties and by Canadians over the lack of basic advancement and planning on the Kyoto file. When we look at auto emissions in this country, we see yet another example of lack of foresight, planning and vision on the part of the Liberal government.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We brought this motion forward today to raise the debate to the next level, to remove the rhetoric and start to talk about the actual numbers, the important numbers facing Canadians each and every day as they make decisions about the way they move themselves around this country, about the health of their communities and cities, about the smog, about the important things facing Canadians and not the rhetoric and broken promises that we have heard in election after election.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We know that light duty vehicles are very important with respect to greenhouse gas emissions.  We know there is an important part to be played by the car manufacturers of this country in responding to the pollution problem that is facing Canadians each and every day, these serious effects of pollution that we are seeing in our hospital wards and schools as young Canadians face increasing health risks from the very air we breathe.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Twenty-five per cent of all greenhouse gas emissions come from this sector, about half of that from the vehicles we are going to be talking about today.  Clearly, a significant part of any solution that we are going to arrive at comes from this sector. Looking for the innovation and leadership around this important issue in terms of mandatory fuel requirements is important for us all.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am happy to share a note that was passed to me yesterday, which states that we already have support from a number of corners of the House.  The chief critic for the Conservative Party of Canada, the member for Red Deer, in a response to a questionnaire from the Sierra Club in the last federal election, committed his support to mandatory regulation of car fuel efficiency standards.  This is fantastic.  This is good to hear.  We will be looking for support from that party today for our motion, which clearly outlines the very same thing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have spoken to a number of members of the Bloc who also seem supportive of this notion of finally responding to the needs that Canadians have been expressing for many years, of finally responding to the promise made by the Liberal Party and never acted upon.  We have seen that voluntary standards just do not make it.  We have not arrived.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1993 the Liberal Party promised a 20% reduction in greenhouse gases.  It got the number right, but it got the plus-minus sign wrong: we have seen a 20% increase in greenhouse gas emissions in this country.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. member:</b> Shameful.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Nathan Cullen:</b> Absolutely shameful.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We think we have found a way that makes sense for Canadians and the auto sector  to step into the new economy and into a future that we can be proud of for all Canadians.</p><A NAME="T1030"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1030"><!-- Hour: 10--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1035"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1025"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1030)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some people dispute the seriousness of smog. I would like to quote a few numbers for members so they will understand how important this is to Canadians as they go about their daily business. The Ontario Medical Association states that 2,000 deaths per year in Ontario alone can be attributed to smog. The Government of Canada estimates 5,000 deaths a year attributable to smog, almost five times the rate of murder in the country.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clearly, this is of significance to Canadians and to their health. These are statistics of the people who finally succumbed to the health effects of smog, never mind the people who suffer through the respiratory illnesses and asthma. In many of the major cities smog days are now being seen in February, of which was previously unheard.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We need to do something about the vehicles that drive through our cities. We need to imagine a future in which commuting to and from work or bringing our children to school will not harm us or our children.   We need to imagine a future when we can walk to  the House of Commons and not see vehicles idling in front of the House.  It  would be a novel concept for the government to take on. We need to identify a culture within the House, within the representatives of the country.  We must do something about the increasing amount of smog throughout our cities.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Months ago the Canadian Automotive Partnership Council tabled the need for a national auto policy,  and we are still   waiting.  If the government had the leadership and understood what Canadians needed and wanted, a national auto policy would include some of the suggestions that we will hear today.   With the  lack of leadership in the auto sector and a lack of clarity and certainty in where the government views the auto sector going in the future, we will continue to have greater uncertainty. This hurts business. This hurts investors looking to invest in this marketplace because they do not know where the government wants the auto sector to go. It does not know what profitable partnerships we can form with the auto sector.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1982 the House and Senate looked at mandatory regulations.  The auto sector said not to do it, that it would voluntarily comply.  It said that there was no need to force it because it would get there eventually.   Therefore,  the bill was never passed into law.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 2002, according to Transport Canada, there has been regular violations of the voluntary agreement.  This is the problem with a voluntary agreement. Not only do we not get reports on this because it is voluntary, but if someone breaks the agreement, there is no consequence to it. If we had a voluntary law against murder, depending on the circumstances, would we find out  if  people were being prosecuted for their crimes? We need to get serious about this. Waiting for the Liberal government's inaction on this file is no longer acceptable to Canadians.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An  hon. member:</b> It's like <i>Waiting for Godot</i>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Nathan Cullen: </b><i>Waiting for Godot</i> and others. We might need to rename this Liberal Party.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many people say that we should not have mandatory regulations because this will hurt the auto sector, that this will drive jobs away from Canada.   Drive jobs away to where? We know that California is looking at strict emissions as well as New York, Illinois and Maine.    The United States is one of our main locations for export.  These states are all  looking at the same regulations. That is where many of our cars go. That is the market to which we look.   Clearly,  the industry is moving toward lower emissions coming out of the tailpipes of cars. How could this drive jobs away when the very people who will be buying  these cars will also be under a regulatory regime?</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canada needs to be at the forefront of this. Canada needs to look to the future. We cannot go forward looking back. We need to look  at  what the sector and consumers want.   I searched the websites of Toyota and Honda for  hybrid options, and there are waiting lists.   Imagine the businesses in Canada that would like to have waiting lists for their products, that would like to have people lined up in queue or putting deposits down on their products. Clearly, there is a market for these cars.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canadians clearly enjoy the concept of not only of polluting less as they drive to and fro, but also paying less at the pump.  Our  party has recommended taking the GST off these cars to help consumers out at the front end. </p><A NAME="T1035"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1035"><!-- Hour: 10--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1040"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1030"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1035)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know a number of  people in the auto sector who sell cars.  The appeal they make to their consumers is this.  While the car may cost them $2,000 to $3,000 more, they will recoup that cost in a few months, in  a year to two years, depending on the original consumption of a normal car. After that time they will make money off the price of the car, while helping the environment, and having a clear conscience about what they are doing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Taxi  companies are coming on line and offering hybrid options. If Canadians had a choice between a hybrid vehicle or one that pollutes more, I wager that most Canadians would choose  a hybrid  taxi.  They would feel better about the trip and about the day. Taxi companies certainly feel better about it.  They make more money because they pay less at the pump. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government has decided another tactic, which is the usual one of throwing money at an issue.  It hires a comedian,   puts together a $26 million package and calls it the “One Tonne Challenge”.  Then it tries to convince Canadians that it is their responsibility to lose a little weight, that it is within their jurisdiction and that it is their fault where we are today.  The responsibility clearly rests in the hands and homes of Canadians. If they do not find their way to it, then I guess it is all their fault.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government completely ignores its role and responsibility in this. To enter into a major international agreement with 140 other countries as of yesterday without a significant plan speaks to the greatest irresponsibility ever.  It speaks to the lack of commitment, focus and ability within the cabinet to work out a plan, to find out where the sector can benefit, where our economy can grow and where we can do better by our environment and for the health of Canadians. Instead the government stumbled in backwards to yesterday's most auspicious and celebratory date without a plan.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only announcement is that it will be embarrassed in Montreal in November, when the world comes to Canada to fully describe to Canadians how badly we have done on the environment.  We can only hope that there is not a smog day in Montreal during the COP11. Aside from  that circumstance, the government has completely failed. We  know Canadians were believing and hoping that the government had taken the horse by the bit on the environment, but it has completely failed to do that</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A lot of people decry regulations in general.  They say that we should not regulate business, that we should allow the free flow of commerce and that businesses will find their own way.  The report from Transport Canada has said that the mandatory emission requirements Ottawa has come forward with are not sufficient and that it is breaking those commitments. That is tragic.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I remind the House to hearken back to the debates when seat belts, air bags and unleaded fuel were being suggested as regulations. Some in the auto sector brought forward the same arguments that jobs would be lost if there were seat belt regulations or  because air bags were too expensive, it would drive jobs out of the country. Now we find the sector proudly advertising the effectiveness of seat belts, air bags and the efficiency of cars.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sector finds some benefit in being able to approach consumers and say that they will be safe in their cars. Within every sector there are more progressive elements and there are lesser progressive elements. We need to reward those who seek to be more progressive on this.  We need to reward those manufacturers that have decided to look the future, that have decided to say to Canadians and world that they can produce vehicles  that are better for the environment and better for money in their pockets.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government will try to table the greatest green budget in history, yet to be seen, and  another promise. What Canadians and members of  House have to ask themselves is this. Is there a level of trust with the Liberal government, after the number of broken promises with respect to the environment, that a green budget will actually be a green budget?</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government said that  it had spent $3.7 billion on Kyoto so far.  Then we found out that was allocated and it had not been spent. Did we get good value for our money? The government is not sure of that either. It does not know if the money already has been effective. Clearly not.  Emissions are getting higher and higher.  We need to become more determined and much stricter with the way we deal with our environment.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We seek support for this motion from all four corners of the House. </p><A NAME="T1040"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1040"><!-- Hour: 10--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1045"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1035"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1040)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have spoken to members from all four parties who find within their own constituencies a great concern and a need to be proud of the way we are developing our auto sector.  They want to be proud to get into their cars.  They want to feel good about purchasing another vehicle.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Saving Canadians money means more money in the economy.  It means more purchasing.  It increases the GDP.   When we put more money into the pockets of Canadians, that has a ripple effect on the economy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The NDP, under the leadership of our leader,  has made recommendations.  We have said that we need to put more money into the hands of Canadians with respect to cars.  We need to offer them a subsidy when they purchase cars.   They will recoup the costs through  fuel.    For low and middle income families, how much  money they put in the tanks is a huge part of their weekly and monthly budgets.    Reducing that by 22%, 23%, 24% and upwards, depending on the type of vehicle, is a huge savings for those families.  They then can take that money and put it into  an educational savings account or  buy better food for their families, rather than put it into the fuel tank and pollute the air.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, we will attempt to step away from the rhetoric and talk about the real numbers.  Today,  we will spend our time, ideally, talking about what is good for Canadians.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canadians have been demanding change in this file for a number of years.  The auto sector has said that  it will meet it through voluntary measures.   The time has come and gone.  The time has come for the government and the House to  make directive policy that makes sense for consumers, that makes sense for the health of Canadians and  that makes sense for the sector.  It has to make sense for the sector so it can export its technology and its  products to emerging markets around the world.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If anyone in the House has any notion that we can have the developing world come on line with the same consumption patterns that we have and maintain any semblance of an environment, they are obviously dipping into something they should not be dipping into.  We cannot have China and India, with their massive  middles classes, consuming and polluting at the rates we have over the last number of years.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We need to be at the forefront of this, not the international pariahs as we have been.  The OECD ranks us last.  There are two countries that pollute more per capita than Canada, the United States being one.  Under George Bush, the Americans have done far more on climate change, as 39 states move toward their Kyoto commitments, than  the Prime Minister has.  The Prime Minister has not found his way to achieving even the small measures of success that the Americans have under George W. Bush, who is no great friend of the environmental lobby.  I am not sure if he attends its galas very often.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, under the direction of the Prime Minister, the Liberal government and three majority governments  where all the power was in a few hands, they have been unable to find their way to the progressive changes suggested in this motion.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We need to look to the future.  We need to look to the leadership that Canadians are asking us to hold,  the responsibility that Canadians are asking us to take  along with them in solving and meeting our challenges under Kyoto and meeting our responsibility to future generations.</p><A NAME="Int-1136446"></A><a HREF="#Int-1136475"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-1136086"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Paul Forseth (New Westminster—Coquitlam, CPC): </b>Madam Speaker,  I hope the member will get his pencil out because I have a number of questions for him which I hope will be answered during the day.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His motion states, “legislating mandatory improvements to vehicle efficiency in all classes of light duty vehicles sold in Canada”. We already have all kinds of controls and standards in Canada.  I want to know, specifically, what are the benchmarks he complaining about?  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He mentioned about a GST rebate for some vehicles that perhaps have a good mileage rate.  However, is he also secretly talking about penalties on certain cars?  We have had that in British Columbia.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What kind of pollution is he talking about?  Is he talking about NO<sub>x</sub> and MOX and real poisons or is he talking about CO<sub>2</sub> and water vapour that is related to Kyoto?  I heard him falsely mixing smog and poisons in the environment and real pollution with Kyoto and climate change.  The two are not the same.  Anyone knows that. Again, what does he mean by “light duty vehicles”? That certainly  has to be defined.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is he referring to the California standards for all of  Canada?  Let him be specific. To what plan and schedule is referring?</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The current laws in Canada already conform to his motion.  We could accept this motion because we could say it already exists in Canada.  What specifically is he asking for?  Where are we going? If he truly wants to advance the results for the environment, he  better have a plan and he better have a schedule, rather than just railing against cars.  What are the numbers and where are they?  Where are we going to go with this motion?</p><A NAME="T1045"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1045"><!-- Hour: 10--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1050"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1040"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1045)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><A NAME="Int-1136475"></A><a HREF="#Int-1136505"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-1136446"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Nathan Cullen: </b>Madam Speaker,  I thank the member for his excitable question. The motion has brought forward a great amount of ire.  I am looking to the motion to find out where the great amount of fear is and the specifics of what the member is describing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The member asked what our plans are and what devious contraptions we have hidden within the motion.  The motion is as it stands.  The voluntary regime that has existed within Canada has not worked  according to the government's own reports. We are asking that  the voluntary regime  be  mandatory.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In terms of the numbers, this is what the debate actually entails.  What are the numbers that the sector can live with?  What are the numbers that most benefit Canadians?</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In terms of the California emission standards,  California has done a great deal in helping the environment and  in helping to develop a new sector.   Looking at what sectors actually have sustained an economy while building these emission standards  is very important. Light duty vehicles is a class of vehicles that we have designated in Canada.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In terms of the member's question, the basic premise of the motion is to move from voluntary toward mandatory.  In terms of the actual numbers, clearly the auto sector has to believe that the government and the House of Commons are committed to bringing in mandatory requirements.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since 1982 the spirit has not been there.  The auto sector knows  it does not need to do it because it is  voluntary.  If the auto sector can continue on a voluntary basis, there is no need to make the significant changes  we are asking for and which we  know  can be met.  The auto sector itself has indicated that it has the improvements on the shelf for 17% of the changes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clearly, the point of the motion is a mandatory regime rather than a voluntary one because the voluntary one is no longer working.</p>

However, I find it is somewhat of a catch all and vague. It is impossible to oppose such a proposal, the aim of which  is to increase the efficiency of light duty vehicles. However, why did  my colleague not specify the level of efficiency he intends to propose to government?</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government's climate change plan of November 2002 mentions a 25% improvement in vehicle fuel efficiency, which is not even mentioned in my colleague's motion. This improvement would lead to a  5.2 megatonne reduction in greenhouse gas.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am in complete agreement with my colleague's motion, but would it not have been more advantageous and accurate  to specify in his motion that he is seeking a 25% improvement for light duty vehicles in Canada?</p>
<p>[<i>English</i>]</p><A NAME="Int-1136514"></A><a HREF="#Int-1136535"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-1136505"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Nathan Cullen: </b>Madam Speaker, that is an excellent question and a fair observation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most important aspect of the motion is that it creates the framework for the negotiations between the Government of Canada and the auto sector to say that voluntary standards are no longer an option, that it  must move toward the mandatory.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reason there is a  need for an auto policy in Canada is that clearly we do not have one.  In the absence of one, the industry has little direction as to where it needs to head with respect to the policy of the government.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the government came forward and said that as a result of   a motion in  the House and under the direction of the Canadian people,  there will be  mandatory emission standards, the    number would then be set in conjunction with our partners in the auto sector. Clearly we need to have a number that answers our environmental commitments and allows the sector to survive, while meeting consumers' needs.  What consumers need is something better at the pump; they need something better coming out of the tailpipe.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The motion  sets the framework for that in saying that   voluntary is no longer an option, that it must be mandatory. Then we would work with our partners in the auto sector and the unions to arrive at the numbers,  depending upon the vehicle and class.</p><A NAME="T1050"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1050"><!-- Hour: 10--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1055"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1045"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1050)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><A NAME="Int-1136535"></A><a HREF="#Int-1136563"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-1136514"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Hon. Larry Bagnell (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Natural Resources, Lib.): </b>Madam Speaker, as opposed to suggesting that the motion  raises ire on our side, this is a tremendous motion  for two reasons. First,  this is basically what we are doing already in  going toward those goals. Second, it  gives us the  chance throughout the day to explain all sorts of programs, successes and regulations that we have put in place with respect to  the Kyoto goals.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have great respect for the member. He is a great analyst and a great parliamentarian. I was astonished that he  would suggest that Canadians should not have any role, that they are not interested in reducing greenhouse gases. It is a very small part of our plan. We are working with auto companies and large emitters and industry, but a small part is that Canadians want to help out. We are showing them some ways they might do that.  I am surprised that he thinks Canadians are not interested in helping  out or having guidance on how to help out.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;People are constantly saying there is no plan. The member  has been saying that. People should know that in October 2000 there was a $500 million Government of Canada action plan 2000 on climate change. It is amazing that members in the House who are interested in climate change, especially the critics, are not aware of the plan. There was a second plan to improve it in November 2002, the climate change plan of Canada. In August 2003 there was another $1 billion announced.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In talking about our selling greenhouse gas reducing coal technologies to China and that it is  one of the worst polluters, the member talked  about our  being one of the worst polluters in the world. However,  we are third out of 12 in improvement of energy in the 1990s as decided by the International Energy Agency.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just to make sure that people are aware of the issue of auto emissions today, I would like to ask the member some  questions, and he can answer any one of them, just to ensure that the critics, the ones who should know the most, are up to speed on this topic.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On January 1  this year we introduced new sulphur reduction emissions as the opposition said. How much will that reduce sulphur emissions? Roughly how many lives did the federal-provincial study on that say it would save?</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are going to reduce smog by a large amount by 2010. Approximately what percentage of auto emission smog will be reduced by 2010 by the many regulations that Her Majesty's Loyal Opposition has said that we already have in place?</p><A NAME="Int-1136563"></A><a HREF="#Int-1136579"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-1136535"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Nathan Cullen: </b>Mr. Speaker, it is interesting that the government is asking me to analyze the effectiveness of its own policies. Clearly if the plans that the hon. member mentioned were effective, we would not have had a 20% increase instead of the promised 20% decrease.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We talk about the plan constantly. Yesterday was the day for  the plan to come into force. Yesterday was the day of the exam and the students did not show up. They were still cramming for the exam. The day that Canadians were expecting something, a coherent policy and plan, we were told to wait, that it was coming. It sounds like the foreign policy review to me; it is coming, do not worry, it will be there. We cannot wait any longer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In terms of international standards, the OECD  ranked us 24th out of 24, and 144th out of 146 in terms of exporting our pollution around the world. I would suggest that one actually has to make an effort to end up at 144th out of a list of 146 in terms of environmental standards and  exporting one's pollution overseas.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While I have great respect for the hon. member as well, when he speaks to plans and the effectiveness of plans, simply stating how much money went out the door does not a plan make.</p><A NAME="Int-1136579"></A><a HREF="#Int-1136700"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-1136563"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Hon.  R. John Efford (Minister of Natural Resources, Lib.): </b>Madam Speaker, I will be sharing my time with my hon. colleague, the Minister of the Environment.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am pleased to have this opportunity to address the House on the important issue of climate change.   </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The world knows that climate change is real.  We can already see the evidence:  hotter, drier weather in some areas, less ice in the Arctic, and rising sea levels. The science is clear.  Canada takes its responsibility to be part of a global solution very seriously. From the major investments we have already made to the leadership role we will take in the future, Canada's efforts to address climate change will be second to none in the world.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Minister of Natural Resources I am keenly aware that at its heart climate change is largely about how we use energy.  In Canada about 85% of carbon dioxide emissions, the leading greenhouse gas, come from producing, transforming and consuming energy.  Canada has a dynamic energy framework focused on the continuing prosperity of Canadians, assuring Canadians access to a reliable and competitively priced supply of energy, and ensuring the production and use of energy is consistent with our environmental objectives.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Within this framework Canada has prospered and is positioned to continue to do so.  Energy represented 5.6% of our gross domestic product in 2003.  It accounts for nearly $50 billion worth of exports and a fifth of all business investments.  Canada is the world's biggest producer of hydroelectricity and uranium.  We are third in gas production and also are a major producer of coal.  Our oil reserves are second only to Saudi Arabia. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must recognize that Canada's energy context is changing rapidly, beginning with opportunities and challenges, particularly on the environmental front. The 21st century will be the century of sustainable development, development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is the responsibility of the government  to blaze the sustainable development trail for Canada.  That means balancing our economic activities and our environmental goals.  We must ensure our continued economic and social prosperity through the development of our natural resources while protecting our environment.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sustainable development is a challenge, but it is a challenge that brings opportunities for Canadians.  It allows us to benefit from resource development and  fuel innovation. It ensures that future generations will be able to enjoy a high quality of life.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Climate change is the ultimate sustainable development issue and fundamentally an energy issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Between the Kyoto baseline year of 1990 and 2002, total energy production in Canada grew 43%.  It is projected to achieve a cumulative growth of about 42% over the next 15 years.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fundamental issue is how to break the link between energy and emissions.  This will require technological change, but until these technological goals have been accomplished, we need to keep our feet to the fire.  We need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from energy production and use, while at the same time ensuring an abundant supply of competitively priced energy for the prosperity of our children and grandchildren.  This is not an easy challenge.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canada has a relatively high energy intensive economy due to a combination of factors that make it unique among industrialized countries: a cold climate, distance between population centres, and Canada's resource based economy.  As well, Canada's economy and population have been growing.  Between 1990 and 2002 our gross domestic product grew by 40% and our population grew by 20%. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The main thrust of the action we have taken to date has been through measures aimed at reducing emissions during the Kyoto commitment period of 2008 and 2012.  We have committed to invest close to $3.7 billion in that effort and have implemented programs all across the Canadian economy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are experiencing tremendous success with a number of programs.  For instance, we are working toward significantly increasing energy efficient housing.  The EnerGuide for houses program has been a great success. It is the same story with our programs aimed at improving the efficiency of commercial and institutional buildings.</p><A NAME="T1055"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1055"><!-- Hour: 10--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1100"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1050"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1055)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are building on success.  The Canadian industry program for energy conservation was launched 30 years ago, and Canadian industry is now saving some $3 billion a year, thanks to the energy management practices that are part of CIPECs efforts.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Emissions from houses, buildings and manufacturing have been essentially flat since 1990 despite robust economic and population growth.  This is a significant accomplishment with important ramifications.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Taking the country as a whole, energy efficiency has improved by 13% since 1990.  This has resulted in energy costs in 2004 that were $12 billion lower than they would have been if these energy efficiency improvements had not taken place.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Energy consumption has slowed while the economy has grown during the past decade.  Canada's economy grew by 40%.  Energy demand grew by 18%.  This is a significant gain in energy efficiency between 1990 and 2002.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are a world leader in improving energy efficiency.  A recent study by the International Energy Agency ranked Canada in the top third among  IEA member countries in improving energy efficiency, ahead of the United States, the United Kingdom and Japan.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Much of this improvement is due to deliberate policy decisions and program resources furnished by the Government of Canada.   We have made great improvements to be sure, but we cannot stop now. We have momentum on  our side and we have progress in our future.  More can be done, more needs to be done and more will be done.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fundamentally, improving energy efficiency helps reduce GHG emissions.  It also reduces, or at least moderates, the demand for energy.  Improved energy efficiency cuts operating costs and increases industrial competitiveness.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government of Canada is equally committed to reducing emissions in the transportation sector.  We are building on a record of success and more progress is being made.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are working with our auto manufacturers to ensure this sector does its part to reduce emissions by making available to Canadians vehicles that are more fuel efficient and produce fewer greenhouse gas emissions.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are also making good progress on renewable fuels.  The ethanol expansion program, with $100 million in funding, has already allocated contributions to six projects that together will almost quadruple the Canadian ethanol fuel supply by 2006. We have an aggressive target to see ethanol blended in 35% of the Canadian gasoline supply by 2010.  Through initiatives like the ethanol expansion program and the continuing federal excise tax exemption on alternative fuels, we are getting closer to realizing that target.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canada's position in oil and gas production is unique.  We are one of the few industrialized countries that is a net exporter of energy.  More than half of the energy we produce is exported.  While those exports are an essential part of our economy, they also cause us to incur the emissions associated with energy we produce but do not use ourselves.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most of our competitors in the oil and gas industry are not signatories to the Kyoto agreement and we are constrained in this sense.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this context, carbon dioxide capture and storage is an important technology for us.  It will allow us to continue to benefit from our energy resources while minimizing the impact on the environment.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In January I announced support to four projects under the first round of funding of the CO<sub>2</sub> capture and storage incentive program.  These projects will demonstrate the feasibility of this important technology.  Along with this announcement, I issued a call to fund a second round of proposals under the program.  The application deadline to submit proposals is February 22.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On clean electricity, Canada is already a world leader. Within the OECD we are second only to the United States in total electricity production from renewable sources, mostly because of our vast hydroelectric and forestry resources.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are also making notable progress in emerging renewable energy. For example, our wind power production incentive has started a wind power revolution in Canada with projects completed, under way or under consideration in every single province.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government has already announced its intention to respond to the success of this program by quadrupling its size to encourage a total capacity of some 4,000 megawatts of wind power.</p><A NAME="T1100"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1100"><!-- Hour: 11--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1105"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1055"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1100)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However the Government of Canada cannot address the challenges of climate change alone. That is why we are working closely with industry to establish a regulatory system to reduce industrial emissions and partnering with provinces and territories on innovative measures to reduce emissions. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We signed a number of MOUs with provinces and territories identifying prospective areas for future collaboration. Very shortly, we will be announcing the first round of funding toward a number of initiatives under the opportunities envelope, a $160 million partnering mechanism designed to fund the most cost effective emission reduction ideas put forward by provinces and territories.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These efforts are about much more than short term results. Addressing climate change will transform our energy economy to bring about a real long term solution for our environment and our economy.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government talks about blazing the trail. I am curious as to why  I did not hear support for the motion  in the hon. member's speech.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have heard the rumours that various ministers are involved with negotiations in the auto sector  seeking to have an actual number put in place. When can we expect those regulations to be brought in  and, if they are not brought in, what will the consequences be? Will they be brought in this week, next week or will Canadians have to wait while the government continues to dither? </p><A NAME="Int-1136778"></A><a HREF="#Int-1136782"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-1136766"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Hon.

When I was on the opposition side from 1985 to 1989, I never asked a question or made a comment in the House in those days when I did not know the answer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hon. member should do some research, and the number is 5.2 megatons.</p><A NAME="Int-1136782"></A><a HREF="#Int-1136825"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-1136778"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Peter Julian (Burnaby—New Westminster, NDP): </b>Madam Speaker, I found the comment of the Minister of Natural Resources that he is inspired by the work of the Minister of the Environment very interesting. We have a 20% increase in greenhouse emissions when the plan calls for a 20% decrease. If that is inspiring, then obviously he is inspired by failure.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He also talked about momentum. We actually have an increase in emissions. In Ontario, 20% of hospital admissions for bronchitis in children under the age of one can be attributed to smog. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In terms of the energy efficient homes that he talked about, fewer than 10,000 homes have been constructed. That is less than 0.6% of new housing starts in Canada. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no momentum, unless we are talking about momentum backward, going down the slope.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like the minister to comment specifically on this failure of any sort of real presence in energy efficiency of homes, the failure to deal with smog and the failure to deal with greenhouse gases.</p><A NAME="Int-1136825"></A><a HREF="#Int-1136848"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-1136782"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Hon.

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What the hon. member should keep in mind is that while Canada has made major improvements in reducing greenhouse gas emissions, the economy has grown by 40%.  Therefore  we have to look at the balance.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is he suggesting that we should shut down every single industry in this country?  Members from western Canada would have something to say about that, as well as people from all over Canada.  Canada is doing a great deal to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, but we all realize, as the Minister of the Environment will say, there is more to do.</p><A NAME="T1110"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1110"><!-- Hour: 11--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1115"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1105"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1110)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><A NAME="Int-1136848"></A><a HREF="#Int-1136871"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-1136825"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. James Rajotte (Edmonton—Leduc, CPC): </b>Madam Speaker, I would like some clarification from the government on its actual position on this motion and on mandatory standards.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us look at what is happening in the United States.  I think that is where there is a bit of confusion.  We are very happy with what is going on in Canada today.  We should be talking more about what we have actually accomplished with the Kyoto protocol, the amount of emissions that is actually being reduced from the atmosphere compared with the growing economy.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For anyone to  say that nothing is happening in Canada is absolutely wrong. Canada is leading in the world in what we have already accomplished, but we certainly will need to do more and we will continue to do more.</p>

Stéphane Dion (Minister of the Environment, Lib.) </b>Madam Speaker, I would to tell the hon. member for Skeena—Bulkley Valley why the Government of Canada obviously cannot support this motion as an adjunct to  the excellent speech by the hon. Minister of Natural Resources. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first reason is that we are somewhat surprised the opposition did not present a motion congratulating not only the Government of Canada, but also the entire country of Canada, on hosting the most important international conference in the field of climate change, that is the 11th  Conference of the Parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, which will also be the first Meeting of the Parties to the Kyoto protocol. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think the hon. member should have asked his leader, who was with me in Buenos Aires, as was the Conservative critic, why Canada was approached to take on this conference. Perhaps then he would have learned that, as the Minister of Natural Resources said, the world is impressed by the fact that the Canadian economy, while growing strongly, has been able to begin to break the link between economic growth and greenhouse gas emissions. In fact, while greenhouse gas emissions have increased by 20% since 1990, the economy has grown by 40%. That is the first stage.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second stage will be to reduce—</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Some hon. members:</b> Oh, oh!</p>

Stéphane Dion: </b>The second step, Madam Speaker, will be to ensure that emissions decline. That is why we have a plan with more teeth, which will be more effective and which the opposition will be able to comment upon in a very polite, respectful way, I am sure.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second reason we cannot support this motion is that it interferes in current negotiations through which we hope very much to reach an agreement with the automobile industry so that it will do its share in the Kyoto plan. The worst thing we could do would be to have parallel negotiations here in this House. I think, therefore, that it is wrong to start immediately trying to interfere in negotiations that are underway and that, we hope, will result in an agreement with the automobile industry, rather than our having to regulate. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We know that agreements can work when they are voluntary. Voluntary agreements have worked with this industry in the past. I would also remind the House that Europe reached a voluntary agreement with its automobile industry, which works fairly well. There is therefore no reason to dispose of a voluntary agreement at the outset. Negotiations are going on. Soon we will have the results. Let us hope that we will not have to regulate.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now smog is certainly a major topic. Had the motion been on it, of course the Government of Canada would have been happy to work with the opposition. However, a certain knowledge of the progress that has been made regarding air quality is still important.</p><A NAME="T1115"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1115"><!-- Hour: 11--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1120"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1110"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1115)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to cuts to the sulphur content in gasoline, as of January 1, 2005 the federal government has reduced the sulphur content in gasoline by 90% from 2002. It is quite a result. This is one of the most strongest sulphur in gasoline regulations in the world.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have fast-tracked on road vehicles and engine emission regulations for 2004 and later model years. While these regulations were being developed in 2001, the federal government signed an MOU with the auto industry providing for the production of low emission vehicles. On average these regulations, together with the MOU with the industry, will reduce the allowance emissions level from new on road vehicles by close to 90% from the standards that applied in 2003.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have cut the sulphur content on road diesel fuel reducing the allowable limit of sulphur from the current regulated limit of 500 parts per million by 97% to 15 parts per million in 2006. These regulations will enable the introduction of advanced emission control system diesel vehicles, trucks and buses.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have a long list of incredible accomplishments that have been done in Canada and we must congratulate our country for that.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new emissions standards regulations passed for small engines such as those found in lawn and garden machines will reduce smog forming emissions from these engines by more than 50% from current levels starting this year.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regulations for off road diesel engines such as those that power construction, agriculture and forestry machines, will come into effect January 1, 2006. Canadian emissions standards for off road compression ignition engines align with the U.S. standards currently in place. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Emissions regulations covering recreational marine engines such as outboards, personal watercraft and recreational vehicles which includes snowmobiles, all-terrain vehicles and off road motorcycles are currently being prepared. Formal publication of these off road regulations is expected this year, and I could go on.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Much remains to be done, of course. We are going to strengthen our air quality policy, but what has been done cannot be denied. We must tell Canadians that we are all in this together, and it is no good to have a negative opposition, which wants to paint everything as black as possible.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Conservative opposition, which is against the Kyoto protocol—it must be said—fails to understand that, in reducing greenhouse gases, we  end up with positive effects too. </p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We need to decrease smog,  mercury and other non-greenhouse  gases. The plan that we will release soon will be an improved plan if we compare it with 2002. It will be an opportunity to decrease greenhouse gas emissions in Canada and at the same time address these issues that are so important for air quality in Canada.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canada is going to host the most important conference on climate change in Montreal at the end of the year, because the world is counting on Canada. The opposition does not understand that, but it is the truth.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, of all the countries that signed the Kyoto Protocol, none has such a demanding target  or is going to have such an impressive plan as ours for reaching this demanding target. Canada is very well placed to be the link between the United States, Europe, the countries with emerging economies and the developing countries.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the other problem is that the government is so focused on greenhouse gases that it is ignoring all the other environmental problems. It is ignoring problems like smog. I want to ask the minister a very simple question to see his awareness of this issue. He talked about reducing sulphur in gasoline. Is he aware that to reduce sulphur in gasoline, it actually has to be refined more which actually increases the CO<sub>2</sub> levels? It shows that we have to address environmental problems in a holistic sense, address the whole environmental issue, rather than just focusing on one like CO<sub>2</sub> which is what the government is doing but not even doing well because it is not tabling a plan.</p><A NAME="Int-1137068"></A><a HREF="#Int-1137087"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-1137057"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Hon.

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we are negotiating with the automotive industry today in order to have a voluntary agreement to improve fuel efficiency and to ensure that the automotive industry will do its share for the Kyoto plan, it is because there is a plan.  It is supposed to deliver 5.2 megatonnes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This has not been recently invented.  This is a policy since 2002.  We are concluding these negotiations.  This will not nullify the other regulations that the industry will have to cope with.  We are going together.  The Government of Canada has a compelling policy for the quality of our air.</p><A NAME="Int-1137087"></A><a HREF="#Int-1137105"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-1137068"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Ms. Libby Davies (Vancouver East, NDP): </b>Madam Speaker, I would like to thank the Minister of the Environment for at least clearing up one mystery. We now know why we do not have a plan.  It is because the government thinks that everything is voluntary. Canadians only have to look at the government ads to know that it is about participating and being voluntary.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is some confusion here.  The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Natural Resources left the distinct impression that there was support for the motion today.  In fact, the other parties here actually understood that from his comments.  We will get the blues to actually examine that.  He did leave that distinct impression.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then we have the Minister of the Environment saying that we do not support mandatory requirements for emissions and that we are into the voluntary thing. The real question here is, why after 15 years are we still at a point where we do not have any emissions standards?  We are still working on voluntary standards that have not been put into place. The voluntary standards clearly are a failure and we still have no plan.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The minister said the plan will be released pretty soon.  That is what he said a few minutes ago.  I would love to know and Canadians would love to know, what does he mean by pretty soon?  Five minutes after that he said that we do have a plan.

This is why the increase in emissions is not at the same speed as the increase in the economy.  This is because under our government the economy is going very well and it is growing.

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The minister has, moreover, just come back from California.  He saw what is being done there.  Can he make a commitment today in this House to table regulations to bring Canadian automotive manufacturing standards in line, not with U.S. federal government standards, but with California's?</p><A NAME="T1125"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1125"><!-- Hour: 11--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1130"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1120"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1125)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><A NAME="Int-1137166"></A><a HREF="#Int-1137202"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-1137145"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Hon. Stéphane Dion: </b>Madam Speaker, that is two questions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First of all, the automotive industry must not be confused with the major final emitters.  The auto industry is not one of them, because the emissions are not produced by the auto industry in the manufacture of automobiles, but by the consumer products, the cars and trucks.   This is why we are trying to conclude a voluntary agreement with the auto industry.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moving to the second element of the question, California tried the voluntary route and moved on to the regulatory when no voluntary agreement was forthcoming.  This is exactly the same approach as Canada is taking.  We are quite confident that we will not have to resort to regulations because we will have concluded a voluntary agreement, as has Europe.      It may well work.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past, we have sometimes used the regulatory approach and sometimes the voluntary.  We know both can work. The advantage of the voluntary approach is that it is far less complicated to administer.  Very often, voluntary agreements concluded with the auto industry have yielded excellent results.  That is what we are working on at the moment.  I would ask the opposition not to interfere in these negotiations because, if they are successful, it will be good news for all Canadians. </p>
<p>[<i>English</i>]</p><A NAME="Int-1137202"></A><a HREF="#Int-1137342"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-1137166"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Colin Carrie (Oshawa, CPC): </b>Madam Speaker, the Conservative Party believes in cleaning up the environment. We believe in clean air and clean water, and we believe that this should be a priority for government. We also believe that we can do this without decimating our key industries and without implementing unrealistic legislation, placing our key industries at an economic disadvantage internationally. Therefore, I rise today in opposition of this NDP motion.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the representative for Oshawa, I cannot believe that the opposition party would put forth such an irresponsible, short-sighted proposition. If this motion were to pass, it would have a devastating effect on Canada's auto industry. Canada's Kyoto protocol-defined reduction is very aggressive and not possible to achieve.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oshawa is famous for producing the best quality automobiles in North America. A big part of the reason we produce such excellent quality vehicles is due to the quality people who put together these cars. Oshawa's auto workers are dedicated professionals whose eye for detail has contributed to a prosperous auto industry in Canada. Today I rise in defence of auto worker jobs and union jobs. The truth is that numerous auto jobs in my constituency will be put in jeopardy if this motion passes requiring mandatory improvements to vehicle efficiency.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The NDP has put forth a motion that does not address the realities of the auto industry and the economic implications of the proposed legislation. This motion proves that the protection and the retention of auto jobs in Canada and the global competitiveness of the auto industry are clearly not a priority of the NDP.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Canada we build mid to large size vehicles, minivans, cars and trucks. If this motion goes through, it will mean that virtually every car, truck and minivan built in Canada could not be sold here. As chair of the Conservative auto caucus, I had the opportunity to visit each of Canada's five vehicle manufacturers. They were unanimous in what they told me. They told me that legislating a mandatory reduction in fuel consumption of 25% by 2010 would have a devastating effect on the auto industry. As one auto exec bluntly told me, “If we cannot sell the cars here, why would we build them here?”</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What the NDP is trying to do is akin to legislating the garment industry into making size two dresses only and demanding that everyone fit into them.  That should fix the problem. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the NDP motion is put through it would greatly restrict Canadian consumer choice. It would mean that Canadians could only drive subcompact cars, such as the Chevy Aveo and the Toyota Echo. What would my constituents who are in the trades drive? I actually have a friend who is 6'3”. His wife is 6'1”. He has two rather tall kids. On the weekend he drives to the cottage with his family, his gear, the dog and sometimes grandma. Which car does my NDP colleague want him to drive, the Aveo or the Echo?</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam Speaker, I want to let you know that I am splitting my time with my colleague from Edmonton--Leduc.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is essential that we improve emissions standards, but that we do so in a manner that strengthens not weakens the auto industry. The NDP motion calls for legislation that will undermine the economic and competitive position of the Canadian auto industry. As the representative for Oshawa, I refuse to let auto workers in my constituency be unduly affected by legislation that disproportionately penalizes the auto sector. Look at the time and resources it has taken to elicit a voluntary commitment from one industry to deliver less than 1.8% of the national greenhouse gas reduction obligations that Canada accepted in ratifying the Kyoto protocol.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fact is that mandatory improvements for the auto industry under Kyoto are unrealistic. The plan calls for a reduction in emissions by 5.2 million tonnes by 2010. A 25% fuel reduction approach is touted as a means to achieve that goal. The lead time for design change in automotive manufacturing is roughly four years. Product plans are already underway for vehicles that will be manufactured by the end of 2010. Product development takes time: time to plan, engineer, design and manufacture. Efficiency improvements are typically implemented as new vehicle programs are initiated and are not suited to mid-product cycle.</p><A NAME="T1130"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1130"><!-- Hour: 11--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1135"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1125"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1130)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The NDP is looking to legislate mandatory improvements when it clearly does not understand the challenges  the automotive industry faces today, such as unfair competition from offshore manufacturers and challenges identified in the  CAPC report.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mandatory improvements are unlikely to take into account important variables like differences among  the many vehicles various companies produce. Regulation and legislation insensitive to the industry could lead to disproportionate effects on the sector, with devastating effects on workers, plants and dealerships.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reality is that the Canadian auto industry represents 9% of an integrated North American market.  If the NDP members had bothered to check, they would have realized that the United States, Canada's largest trading partner, has not signed on to the Kyoto accord.  Canada deals with a 90% auto export rate to the U.S. Attempts to make substantial engineering changes solely for the Canadian market would result in excessive costs, restricted consumer choice and a competitive disadvantage.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is also a reality that the NDP motion calls for mandatory emission standards when there is no agreed upon cost analysis for the new technology.  Independent research by Sierra Research Associates estimates costs based on North America wide application of technologies at as much as $2,600 for cars and over $4,600 for trucks and says that the lead time for compliance with a 25% requirement by the end of 2010 is not sufficient.  If the 25% is required on a Canada only basis, the cost would be much higher.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The auto industry has committed to drive greenhouse gas reductions through new technologies,  publicly partner with the government in the fight for climate change and  support automotive R and D in Canada.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to reach those goals, the auto industry is prepared to partner with the government to continue to aggressively pursue the introduction of cost effective, energy efficient technologies and alternate fuel offerings that use lower carbon fuels, and it is committed to a joint government-industry committee to measure progress toward its 5.2 million tonne goal.  The industry also has agreed to a joint reporting committee with the government to monitor annual progress.             </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The industry's voluntary integrated agreement addresses the reality of the continental industry. It  combines new vehicle technologies that save fuel with the broader availability of alternative fuels such as ethanol and biodiesels and provides communication support to help consumers adapt driving behaviours and enable them to afford more efficient vehicles in Canada.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The NDP has argued that we should adopt California standards.  If the NDP would bother to step outside today and get some fresh air instead of the hot air they are promoting today, they might realize we are not like California.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, Canada is colder than California.  Driving in colder climates consumes more gasoline.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, California does not have an industry to speak of.  It has one plant.  It has little to  risk.  Canada has a dozen plants and much to risk by adopting unrealistic legislation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, according to the CAW, Canada employs over 150,000 people directly in auto assembly and parts, with a spinoff of seven jobs for every one; this means that for every assembly job seven other jobs are created. Over 500,000 Canadians owe their jobs directly to the auto industry.  Is it sensible to risk these  jobs for little actual improvement to global greenhouse gas reduction?</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, CAW findings show that the Canadian auto industry generated a positive trade balance for Canada of $20 billion in 2001.  This trade balance is fragile and depends on the free flow of goods across the Canada-U.S. border.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The NDP has not presented any economic impact studies indicating the cost to industry and    costs in jobs in making such drastic legislation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canada alone is responsible for only 2% of global greenhouse gases.  It is irresponsible to bet our entire auto industry in order to fulfill an ideological mandate.  To legislate mandatory emissions standards at this time would be careless.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Conservative Party is committed to cleaning up the environment while acknowledging the realities of the auto industry and what is attainable within it.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The industry itself is also deeply committed to producing cleaner cars.  In fact, the industry has already reduced smog emissions by 99.6% since 1970 through sophisticated emission control technology.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My colleague needs to come clean and admit that not only is this motion irresponsible at this time, but it puts the well-being of the Canadian auto industry and its workers dead last on the list of national priorities for the NDP.</p><A NAME="T1135"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1135"><!-- Hour: 11--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1140"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1130"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1135)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We in the Conservative Party want to use common sense in  reaching our greenhouse gas targets. What the NDP is promoting is something that would be reckless and irresponsible.  It is the same with the government.  It is not releasing any cost or impact studies of the effects this would have on the industry. As the member for Oshawa I feel it is reckless to bet the entire industry on legislation that is unproven in regard to what the results would be.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regarding the comments by the member from Quebec, GM and Hyundai used to build cars there, and we had better believe that if they still built cars there he would be fighting for this issue too.</p><A NAME="Int-1137385"></A><a HREF="#Int-1137403"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-1137362"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Hon.

Obviously I do not agree with the motion and I will not be supporting it, but what I said was that I am delighted it is on the floor, for two reasons.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, the Government of Canada is already working to reduce auto emissions in a number of ways.  The second reason is that it gives us a chance today to outline, which has already been done by the two ministers, with great content, the various items that Canada is working on to reduce greenhouse gases looking toward the Kyoto plan. I think that is why this is a very illuminating debate.  We are winning this debate for that reason.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to ask a question of the two critics from the Bloc and the Conservatives, because the NDP could not answer this. There are a lot of provisions in place to reduce emissions. Perhaps the members can outline what some of them are.</p><A NAME="T1140"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1140"><!-- Hour: 11--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1145"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1135"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1140)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><A NAME="Int-1137403"></A><a HREF="#Int-1137423"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-1137385"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Colin Carrie: </b>Madam Speaker, right now there are voluntary things put in place by the auto industry.

What we have going on with the voluntary emissions decrease is working the way it is supposed to.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What I would like to talk about for a couple of minutes, though, is the economic impact and the devastating effect the motion would have if it were to pass. Auto workers in Canada pay over $2 billion in taxes. The GST and PST collected from automobiles total over $7 billion.  To put such legislation into effect would be devastating to the economy and devastating to my community. We cannot support this reckless legislation.</p><A NAME="Int-1137423"></A><a HREF="#Int-1137619"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-1137403"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. James Rajotte (Edmonton—Leduc, CPC): </b>Madam Speaker, it is my pleasure to take part in this very lively debate.  It is good for the House to be debating this issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the outset, I want to read the motion from the NDP into the record:</p>
<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td width="15" align="right"></td>
<td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>That, in the opinion of the House, the government should recognize the public health impacts of smog and the failure of voluntary emission standards by legislating mandatory improvements to vehicle efficiency in all classes of light duty vehicles sold in Canada.</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As my colleague just said, we certainly recognize that smog is a problem, a huge problem, particularly in our larger centres.  We need to recognize that sulphur dioxide and nitrous oxide are the main contributors to this. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our party supports, and in fact our environment critic, the member for Red Deer, has called for, a clean air act and environmental legislation that would address this.  We put this forward before the last election, calling for the government to take action on NO<sub>2</sub> and SO<sub>2</sub> in particular.  In fact, we should not stop with clean air; we should address clean water and obviously some of the land issues as well.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before I get to the specifics of the motion, I want to address the issue of Kyoto because we have just heard from the Minister of the Environment  and the Minister of Natural Resources. Members of the Bloc, of the NDP and certainly of my party have pointed out that the government in fact has no plan. It was basically admitted by the Minister of the Environment as recently as this week in an article in <i>The Globe and Mail</i>.  The article stated:</p>
<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td width="15" align="right"></td>
<td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>The federal government admitted yesterday it has no plan in place to meet its commitments under the Kyoto Protocol....Ottawa had promised to have a comprehensive implementation plan ready no later than next week's budget, complete with the regulatory or tax measures needed to meet the Kyoto targets for greenhouse gas emissions. </small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>
<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td width="15" align="right"></td>
<td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>But [the] environment [minister] said yesterday it will be “several more weeks” before anything is ready. Cabinet ministers have made no firm decisions, he said.</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is completely unacceptable.  The government signed on to Kyoto in 1997 and ratified it in 2002 and still has no plan.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government references a plan from 2002.  The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Natural Resources  and the member from Windsor know full well, because they sat on a committee that studied the implementation plan at that point, that even members of the government would have to admit the plan was lacking in detail.  The then minister of the environment was before us as we were asking about things like whether there would be tax credits for vehicles to allow people to buy hybrid vehicles.  The response was that the government did not know if it was going to do that.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a mention in the plan of a CO<sub>2</sub> sequestration and pipeline.  What is the government planning to do with this? This could actually reduce CO<sub>2</sub> emissions substantially.  The minister at the time said he did not know what was being done with that and that the government would have to see where that goes.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will have to see where that goes? These are the sorts of answers that the committee received, which basically revealed that the government has absolutely no idea what it is doing on Kyoto, and it has caused some serious problems. It is a matter of international standing when one signs on to an agreement with absolutely no idea of how those commitments are going to be fulfilled.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government should be honest with Canadians and start to address environmental problems as a whole issue, as I was mentioning about the gasoline industry. The gasoline industry has reduced sulphur, and we certainly support that, but in doing so it increased some of the CO<sub>2</sub> emissions.  We need to look at addressing environmental issues overall, especially the more noxious toxins like NO<sub>2</sub> and SO<sub>2</sub>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to address some specifics  of the motion.  My colleague from British Columbia raised this earlier.  I think NDP members should perhaps in their future speeches talk specifically about what they are calling for in the motion with regard to greenhouse gases, NO<sub>2</sub> and SO<sub>2</sub>, with some plans, some specific mandatory measures to be put in place.  As members of the House know, there already are a lot of mandatory measures on that industry.  In fact, the industry would argue, and I think this party would agree, that there are too many regulations on this industry.  There are too many regulations that are different from the North American regulatory market.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why are we only addressing this industry?  Why the focus on this industry, particularly in regard to the members from Windsor?  We should look at why we are only addressing and targeting the auto industry, particularly when the two members from Windsor have an awful lot of auto workers in their ridings who rely on this industry.  Why are they targeting it and singling it out for what is in my view unfair attention? Why only vehicles sold in Canada?  This is something that I think the members should look at closely: “legislating mandatory improvements to vehicle efficiency in all classes of light duty vehicles sold in Canada”.</p><A NAME="T1145"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1145"><!-- Hour: 11--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1150"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1140"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1145)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members should know that 80% to 90% of the vehicles manufactured in Canada are exported primarily to the United States.  Is the NDP arguing that we should have two assembly lines, one with regulatory emission standards for  the 10% to 20% of  vehicles sold in Canada   and the other with different standards for the 80% to 90% of vehicles that are exported? Perhaps members opposite could clear that up with respect to the motion.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In our view there is a need for regulatory harmonization with this industry.  I would like to quote a spokesperson for the Motor  Vehicle Manufacturers' Association who said it very well in 2002 when he addressed the fuel efficiency target of 25%.  Mark Nantais, president of the Motor Vehicle Manufacturers' Association, said:</p>
<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td width="15" align="right"></td>
<td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>The government's choice of a 25% target, without due diligence for what is achievable in the stipulated timeframe, given the other very important considerations of consumer safety, technological feasibility, and economic impact, is a major concern. It creates, quite frankly, unrealistic public expectations for both government and our industry. If we put it another way, we're being set up for failure. </small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That was said back in 2002 when members of the industry and others were raising  this issue and saying that  it was an unachievable target and that it    would    harm the industry.  The government, unfortunately, did not listen to their concerns and  did not recognize what the industry had already done.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The member for Oshawa,  the chair of our auto caucus, pointed out very well what the industry has already done in a proactive way to address its emissions.  Emissions coming out of its assembly plants between 1990-99 and  the energy intensity of its plant operations were reduced by nearly 18%.  We should recognize that and celebrate the fact that the industry has taken action by and of itself.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We need to understand that the automobile industry in Canada is within the context of a North American industry. However, the NDP,  with its motion today, seems to have no clue that we are within a North American market and  that we do export most of our vehicles to the United States.  It would be nonsense for us to create further regulatory disharmony between our regulations and the regulations in the United States. It would  harm the industry and the workers in Windsor, Oshawa, Cambridge, Alliston and elsewhere.  What the NDP does not understand   and will never understand is that to create regulatory burdens on the industry   drives people out of work.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me address some solutions.  We in the Conservative Party do support a clean air act.  We would deal with nitrous oxide and  sulphur oxide.  Our environment critic will be here this afternoon and he can present it to members then.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We support infrastructure spending.  We have called for the government to share the federal fuel tax with communities across Canada   to address the issue of congestion.  One  only has  to go to areas like Windsor, Toronto and Edmonton to see the congestion caused by a lack of available infrastructure.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are   three approaches to the environment that the  government could take.  First, it could  impose further regulation on the industry, but we believe  that would harm the industry and not lead to overall economic growth or  environmental stewardship.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second approach would be  through program spending.  Some program spending may be necessary. The government will be outlaying $3.7 billion.  Members of the environment committee are studying this issue.  I know the member for Essex is also involved in this.  However the government has not been very forthright about where the money is going. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third approach could be  through incentives.  I am speaking about incentives  to encourage the industry itself to innovate and change consumer  habits.   The Conservative Party believes the government should head in that direction.      We think providing tax credits for buying  hybrid vehicles would be a sensible thing.  It is something the government should do and we hope the government will do so in the budget.  It should encourage people to change their habits and reduce some of the emissions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another thing that could be done by the government, which I referenced earlier,  is that instead of putting $3.7 billion into these various funds and having the people go to it, the government should work with the industry, particularly those  in western Canada, and look at a CO<sub>2</sub> sequestration and a CO<sub>2</sub> pipeline.</p><A NAME="T1150"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1150"><!-- Hour: 11--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1155"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1145"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1150)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we were to combine that with a clean air act that addresses NO<sub>2</sub> and SO<sub>2</sub> , we would address the CO<sub>2</sub> by sequestering it and  using it to filter out more of the oil from the ground.  This would actually address CO<sub>2</sub> emissions in a very substantive way and it is something we hope the government looks at as a solution to environmental challenges, rather than just focussing on Kyoto, and in fact not focussing very well by not in any way tabling a reasonable plan.</p><A NAME="Int-1137619"></A><a HREF="#Int-1137659"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-1137423"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Hon. Bryon Wilfert (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of the Environment, Lib.): </b>Madam Speaker, I always appreciate listening to my colleague's observations.  I think we both agree that the timing of the motion is curious.     Why was it  brought in today given the fact that there are ongoing negotiations with the auto industry?  The issue is one of voluntary or   mandatory regulations.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clearly, if one were  negotiating one would assume that one would not want to bring in a motion like this, to bring a hammer down when there are presumably discussions being held in good faith.  However that is up to them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The member across said that we did not  have a plan.    I would be more than happy to take him outside later and give him a copy of the climate change plan for action that was developed in 2002.  The government has admitted that any good plan often needs revision and we are prepared and are working on revisions.  The minister has been very clear on that and it will be released very soon, along   with the upcoming budget.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fact that the Conservative  Party has only recently discovered the environment is better late than never.  That  is the party, of course, that said that carbon dioxide, while linked to global warming, was not a threat to air quality.  It also said that  carbon dioxide did  not cause or contribute to smog.  Maybe the members of that party  have had their heads in the clouds a little too long.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the member  has critiqued, although not very well, what he thinks is not our plan, could he tell us what his party  is proposing for dealing with the auto sector? How would his party   deal with the emissions issue?   Why does he believe  that the approach his party presumably has, given the fact that we believe we can have a strong economy, a strong auto sector and a strong environment, are   compatible?</p><A NAME="Int-1137659"></A><a HREF="#Int-1137675"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-1137619"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. James Rajotte: </b>Madam Speaker, obviously the CO<sub>2</sub> pipeline sequestration is a huge issue that addresses CO<sub>2</sub> generally.  In terms of the auto sector, I think incenting consumers to buy hybrid vehicles is a legitimate policy suggestion that we would look at quite favourably.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is capital cost allowance.   It is kind of abstract.  People may ask how this would  impact  the environment.  In fact, if we were to allow companies to write-off their machinery at a quicker pace and allow them to replace and upgrade their manufacturing process at a quicker pace, they would  move to more environmentally sensitive machinery and assembly line processes.  That is how   the auto industry has reduced some of its emissions from the plants.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another issue that the auto industry has raised is that Canadians drive their vehicles for longer periods of time in Canada because of the disposable income gap between Canadians and Americans.  It was highlighted by Don Drummond in his recent report for the TD Bank. If the government were to  reduce taxes on an overall level, it would give Canadians   more disposable income which in turn would allow them to replace older vehicles with  newer vehicles that are more fuel efficient and    better for the environment.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those are three policy options I would suggest the government should take a serious look at.  I do have to tell  my hon. colleague that when we were on the industry committee we studied the plan in 2002 and, frankly, it was not much of a plan at all, but even the good things that were in the plan, the government has done nothing whatsoever to implement them.</p><A NAME="T1155"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1155"><!-- Hour: 11--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1200"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1150"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1155)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><A NAME="Int-1137675"></A><a HREF="#Int-1137721"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-1137659"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Brian Masse (Windsor West, NDP): </b>Madam Speaker, it is almost insulting to hear     the parliamentary secretary say   that this House has no role to discuss one of the most important industries in Canadian history and also the future prosperity of this country.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The citizens of this country are sick and tired of waiting for backroom Liberal deals to try to address crises in this country.  It is reprehensible that this chamber should not have a voice and an opportunity in a democracy to openly discuss this.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have a question for  the member opposite who sits with me on the industry committee.   I  understand, and I am sure everyone understands, his concern about the job factor.    I come from an area that represents many auto workers.  The CAW supports movement toward mandatory standards.    I think it is an unfair criticism to our motion that we actually are calling for that movement and creating some flexibility for negotiations as part of it.  This is a motion,  not legislation.  The member for Oshawa   does not seem to understand what is happening here.    I would like  the member to  comment on that in terms of why can we not have flexibility to do that.</p>

In our view, it must be said that this motion is vague and inadequate. Why is it vague? Because it fails unfortunately to specify the extent to which we expect the automobile industry to improve the efficiency of light duty vehicles. Is the standard 25% or 10%? No one knows.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course we must take a regulatory approach. That is what we think on this side of the House. However, we must never forget that our regulations must be consistent, not with the American government standards—as is currently the case in the  Canadian Environmental Protection Act and the regulations under it—but rather with the practices and regulations recently adopted in California. It is important to remember that. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Smog has been a reality in Canada for a number of years now. However, Quebec was alerted to it more than ever recently during several days in early February when Montreal and the Outaouais were hit by a smog alert. This was quite unusual. How could Montrealers and the people of the Outaouais possibly expect a smog alert in February? This points to a major problem which reminds us that we must change our ways of doing things and our consumption patterns.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before I go on to the automobile industry and its impact, we must remember, first and foremost, that it is not just vehicle exhaust that causes this smog. Wood stoves and wood heating are also responsible for smog. As recently as between 1987 and 2000, there was a 60% increase in  wood heating in Canada compared to only a 20% increase in rental housing. This means that the number of people who decided to heat their homes with wood  more than doubled in 15 years. Naturally, that has a major impact on air quality, especially in urban areas like Rosemont—La Petite-Patrie, which I represent in this House. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a mandatory five-year review of the Canadian Environmental Protection Act. At present, wood stove manufacturing standards have been harmonized with EPA standards. It may be time to consider, during our examination of the relevant sections of the Canadian Environmental Protection Act, if stricter standards on wood stove manufacturing could not be implemented.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The crux of the problem is the transportation sector as a whole. We must remember that this sector is responsible for 25% of all greenhouse gas emissions in Canada.</p><A NAME="T1200"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1200"><!-- Hour: 12--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1205"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1155"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1200)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, this is not an inconsequential sector. Just before I started my intervention, I was looking at the figures, and the oil and gas sectors are responsible for 18% of these emissions. So, the transportation sector  is the primary emitter of greenhouse gas in Canada, with 25%.   It is even expected that by 2010, there will be a 32% increase in greenhouse emissions in the transportation sector compared to the 1990 levels, if nothing is done, and I want to emphasize that point.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This means that we have to make some choices. If Canada decides to maintain the  status quo and not implement any measures, greenhouse emissions will have increased by 32% compared to 1990 levels. So we are forced to take action.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until now, the government has chosen to take a voluntary approach with the auto industry, among others. Ultimately, this approach means that the auto industry is being trusted to improve vehicle fuel efficiency.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But that begs a fundamental question. Since there are quite a number of sectors in Canada—I am thinking of manufacturing, pulp and paper, steel—how come the federal government has decided to exclude the auto industry from the large industrial emitters?</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When 25% of emissions are generated by the transportation sector—and there is a major correlation between greenhouse gas emissions and motor vehicle use—why was it decided to exclude the automotive sector from the large industrial emitters?</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the government, through its Minister of the Environment or Minister of Natural Resources, had announced to us today that the automotive industry was excluded from the large industrial emitters because the technology did not exist, I might almost understand. That is the case in certain industry sectors, such as cement manufacturing, for example. There we have substantial greenhouse gas emissions, and the technology to improve the energy balance of that industrial sector unfortunately does not exist.  If that were the case for the automotive sector, I might almost understand.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But no. The technology to improve the energy efficiency of vehicles is available. So why are we not forcing the automobile industry to make better vehicles? When the technology exists, why do we continue to apply a voluntary approach which in recent years has produced no results? Some will say it is for economic reasons. I was listening to the hon. members from the Conservative Party telling us earlier that we had to understand that the vehicles produced in Canada were being exported.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is as if to say that what has been done in California, which has a population of over 25 million and a market comparable to Canada's—so it has similar economic conditions—is good for California but not for Canada.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The economic argument does not wash, because the Canadian market is comparable to the California market. So what can be done in California can most certainly be done in Canada.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I look, among other things, at the action plan on climate change that was tabled in November 2002. The section on energy efficiency states that the automotive sector would be required to make an effort to reduce greenhouse gases by 5.2 megatonnes and improve automobile efficiency by 25%.  The plan is that specific. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, the New Democratic Party motion does not contain this level of effort that we are demanding of the automobile industry. We would have liked to see that 25% threshold in this motion. What the automobile industry has been telling us lately is that it is not interested in any norm for improving vehicle efficiency by 25%.</p><A NAME="T1205"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1205"><!-- Hour: 12--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1210"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1200"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1205)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That industry tells us that it is certainly prepared to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 5.2 megatonnes, but it does not want to have a standard comparable to California's.  It prefers the status quo.  The status quo, what we have at the moment, is a harmonization of the vehicle manufacturing standards with those of the federal government, the EPA.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a flagrant injustice being imposed on the various industrial sectors at this time.  For example, the manufacturing sector—not the Quebec manufacturing sector, but the sector as a whole—has made a 7% reduction in its greenhouse gas emissions and the reduction imposed on it  is 15%.  How can anyone claim that what is being negotiated at this time is fair?</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An industrial sector that has reduced its greenhouse gas emissions by 7% gets a 15% reduction imposed upon it, while an industrial sector like the auto industry, which has the technology, would not be included among the major emitters.  There is something inequitable here; the government's proposed approach is unfair.  A few months ago, the government announced a multi-million aid package for Ford.  No problem, if they want to help that sector, and that particular company, that is fine with me. But, how can that company use the taxpayers' money without being prepared to apply more stringent energy efficiency standards?   Ought this assistance to Ford not to have been conditional on improved manufacturing so as to produce more energy-efficient vehicles?</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the Commissioner of the Environment  speaks of strategic environmental assessments, that is exactly what she is referring to.  What does she say  about this?  That tax measures, financial assistance, is being  provided to certain companies without due consideration of sustainable development and environmental protection. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Take Bill C-48. This is a bill that gives some $250 million a year in tax incentives to the hydrocarbon industry. Fine. The industry gets tax incentives and financial assistance and what do we get in  return from these sectors that do not even have to sign a voluntary agreement with the federal government to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions by 15%? What do these sectors have to say about this?</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was reading the steel industry agreement. It is worth a read. Two agreements were signed by the federal government: one  with the pulp and paper industry and the other with the steel industry. If you take the time to read the agreement, you will see that it says that the industry will enforce a 15% reduction of greenhouse gas emissions provided the competitiveness of the industry is not affected. This is based on industry studies. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, the industry is prepared to accept federal assistance—that is the case with Ford—but it is not prepared to enforce stricter standards to improve vehicle efficiency by 25%.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What should be our direction in the coming years? In my opinion there are two approaches. It takes a fiscal and budgetary approach together with a regulatory approach. Let us develop a regulatory approach to make—and this is the case in the automobile industry—existing technologies more energy efficient.</p><A NAME="T1210"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1210"><!-- Hour: 12--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1215"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1205"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1210)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are not talking about research and development in this economic sector. We are talking about technologies that already exist. The government has a responsibility when faced with an industry that refuses to make the manufacture of vehicles more efficient.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us implement  regulations that harmonize with California's, a regulatory approach, as the New Democratic Party proposes, so that, at the end of the day, new vehicles that come on the market will be more energy efficient and thus will help reduce smog. That is not enough: this regulatory approach must be accompanied by a tax-based approach to assist  the public choosing to use sustainable transportation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sustainable transportation is help for public transit. How can the government not have included the very simple measure of  making the cost of a public transit pass tax-deductible in its budget?</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On February 23, let us hope that the Minister of Finance, who has been described as green by the Minister of the Environment—I have faith in what  the Minister of the Environment says about  the Minister of Finance—but if he is serious, he will announce on February 23 that the cost of a public transit pass will be deductible. That is the first step.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a second step, there must be a tax  incentive for people who decide to use a hybrid vehicle. A few months ago I bought a hybrid vehicle, which cost me $10,000 more than a conventional vehicle of the same make with the same options.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While the federal government is giving tax incentives to the oil industry, through Bill C-48, a responsible individual must spend an additional $10,000 to buy a more ecological vehicle. That makes no sense.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this budget there must be a tax incentive for the citizen making a decision. What is $10,000 for a person who decides to live a cleaner life, when $250 million per year is given, with one stroke, to the oil industry? There must at least be some balance in tax policy between the aid given to these polluting industries and the aid given to the environmental industry in Canada. That must be our approach.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canada could decide to adopt this strategic environmental assessment.  As we know, in 1994 there was a directive from Cabinet—not the members of the House of Commons—to the effect that all departments ought to apply strategic environmental assessments to measures they were deciding upon.  Plans, policies and programs should all be subjected to that test.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, this is not the case.  If the government decided to enact legislation here in this Parliament to force all departments—among them Transport Canada and Finance in particular—and the commissioner was not very kind toward the latter, indicating that it was dragging its feet—to apply strategic environmental assessment to departmental plans, policies and programs, we would likely not be where we are today.   It would be very likely that Canada could be presenting the Montreal conference in September with a better record as far as energy and greenhouse gas emissions  are concerned than the one we have at present.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will again point out that my party will be supporting the NDP motion.</p><A NAME="T1215"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1215"><!-- Hour: 12--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1220"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1210"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1215)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

Larry Bagnell (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Natural Resources, Lib.): </b>Mr. Speaker, I have great respect for the member opposite. He has been working on the environment file for some time. I would like to ask him about transit subsidies, but  before doing so, I would like to put   two points on the record.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I said earlier, the great thing about this debate is  we can get out on the table a lot of the things we are doing relating to Kyoto, which  members in the House and people across the country apparently are not aware of. The loyal opposition member suggested in his speech that we were not doing anything on CO<sub>2</sub> sequestration and  that we should. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am happy to announce  that on January 17 we provided $10.8 million to Anadarko Canada, Apache Canada Limited, Penn West Petroleum and Suncor for CO<sub>2</sub> sequestration. Just so everyone knows, the next round of proposals for $4.2 million is available and people can apply before April 2005.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The NDP complimented us earlier that the next budget would be the greenest in history. However,  we already have the largest environment program in history by any government in Canada, including NDP governments, of $3.5 billion for contaminated site cleanup. I am delighted that 60% of that is going to the north.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My question for the member is related to transit, which of course we support. The government has put hundreds of millions of dollars toward transit and continues to do so. Why would the member suggest that we put it into transit fare subsidies, which is what I think he said, as opposed to the  contributions we are making directly to  transit systems, which have proven to have even more effect? That would expand the system so it reached more riders and more people could use it, rather than   rebating money to people who already use it, which may have some effect but not as much effect.</p><A NAME="T1220"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1220"><!-- Hour: 12--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1225"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1215"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1220)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

I would, however, like to remind him that Canada ranked 28th out of 29 OECD countries in a study involving 25 environmental indicators. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So the government is trying to tell us that it has an excellent environmental record and an excellent program, while in reality it has no plan whatsoever as far as greenhouse gas emissions are concerned.  If the government had turned up at Kyoto with a plan in 1997, as the Europeans have been able to do on numerous occasions, we would not be where we are today.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Need I remind the parliamentary secretary that Canada is the only OECD country not to have a public transportation policy.  That is pretty unbelievable, since Canada is supposed to have a good environmental record.  Canada has, in fact, been harshly criticized, and not by some NGO.  By the OECD.  And why is that?  Because the transportation sector is responsible for 25% of greenhouse gas emissions in Canada.  This is the largest share by any one sector.  If nothing is done, that figure is going to be 32% by 2010.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why must such measures be promoted? It is precisely because if we do not, the transportation sector will produce 32% of all greenhouse gas emissions in Canada. So immediate action must be taken.</p>

He is  one of the most passionate advocates for environmental action on Parliament's environment committee.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have a simple question for him and I think it will exploit some of the absurdity in the government's handling of the fuel efficiency standard. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With 80% of the vehicles purchased in Canada being built in either the U.S. or Mexico, the government is negotiating with the Canadian auto industry about a fuel efficiency standard. Does my colleague in the Bloc think that government discussions on a fuel efficiency standard should be a common North American standard? Therefore should the government be negotiating with the United States and Mexico toward a common standard for the continent?</p>
<p>[<i>Translation</i>]</p><A NAME="Int-1138068"></A><a HREF="#Int-1138099"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-1138050"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Bernard Bigras: </b>Mr. Speaker, of course, we should be negotiating with our partners. Except that, between you and me, the number one problem is that we have to negotiate with one trading partner, the United States, which has decided not to sign on to Kyoto. So, that poses a significant problem.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, I want to add that stricter standards in terms of manufacturing, such as those California has adopted, do not constitute an economic disadvantage, but rather added value. There is a definite advantage, in terms of international competitiveness, to having stricter manufacturing standards for vehicles.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, if we do not want Japan and Asia to impose new more fuel efficient models and  take the lead over North America, we must realize that the countries able to successfully compete on international markets will be the ones that adopted stricter standards. So there is an advantage—called a “comparative advantage” by economists—to being able to adhere to stricter manufacturing standards.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Instead of thinking that the Kyoto protocol represents a significant economic cost, we must view it as an economic opportunity to improve environmental protection and  add value to new vehicles that, tomorrow, will probably set  the international standard.</p><A NAME="T1225"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1225"><!-- Hour: 12--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1230"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1220"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1225)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><A NAME="Int-1138099"></A><a HREF="#Int-1138117"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-1138068"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Nathan Cullen (Skeena—Bulkley Valley, NDP): </b>Mr. Speaker, I thank the Bloc member for his comments.

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Liberals have said that they are unable to support this motion, due to ongoing negotiations with the industry. I would like him to comment on this.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the Conservatives, they say that it is very easy for the Bloc to support this motion, because there is no industry of this type in Quebec, and that this is why the Bloc will vote in favour of the NDP motion.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, I would like the member for Rosemont—La Petite-Patrie to comment on the reasons why the Bloc is supporting this motion. Also, I would like  to know if the two reasons mentioned by the two parties are true and whether this adds to the quality of debates in the House?</p><A NAME="Int-1138117"></A><a HREF="#Int-1138137"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-1138099"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Bernard Bigras: </b>Mr. Speaker, I will start with my colleague's second statement repeating what my colleague from the Conservative Party said, namely that if we support the motion, it is because there is no automobile industry in Quebec.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is rather facile to say this. What explains the fact that, yesterday, the Bloc was the only party in the House to propose legislation applying the Kyoto Protocol to all industrial sectors? Are they saying we propose that the manufacturing sector, which is the basis of  Quebec's economy, should be excluded from the Kyoto protocol and should not have stricter standards? No, not at all. Quite to the contrary, if the automobile industry were the basis of Quebec's economy, we would call for exactly the same thing we are calling for for the manufacturing industry. That was the first thing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, the government cannot go on negotiating forever with an industry that refuses to apply existing technology. I remind the House that, if the automobile industry said to the government, “We cannot improve the efficiency of our cars by 25% because the technology does not exist”, I might understand. But the technology does exist. If it exists, why does the industry not voluntarily use it? If the industry agreed to use it voluntarily, we would not be compelled today to debate a motion aimed at regulations. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are debating stricter regulations for vehicle manufacturing precisely because the automobile industry has not been willing so far to incorporate  existing technology in its manufacturing methods.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is time now to stop shilly-shallying, to do something and introduce regulations, which, in my view, must go further than those proposed by the NDP, which must specify that vehicles have to be 25% more efficient, within a reasonable amount of time, of course, for the industry.  The standard will have to be gradual, but it will have to be imposed. </p>

Bill Blaikie (Elmwood—Transcona, NDP): </b>Mr. Speaker, I first want to respond very briefly to my colleague in the Bloc. He mentioned being able to deduct transit passes. Even though  it is not in our motion, that is something the NDP has supported in the past. Members will recall that a private member's bill or motion sponsored by the former NDP member for Kamloops, Nelson Riis, which  called on the government to do that actually passed in the House.  This  is all the more reason for us to be critical of succeeding Liberal finance ministers and Liberal budgets for not putting into a budget something which the House of Commons itself at one time encouraged the government to do.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will start my speech with a bit of a historical overview. Mr. Speaker, I  also want to indicate that I will be splitting my time with my colleague from Windsor West.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I remember when the first mention of greenhouse gases was made in the House. It was  around 1983. At that time 90% or even higher of the members of Parliament thought that maybe the member who raised it, an NDP member from Regina, Simon de Jong, was talking about some kind of new greenhouse in which to grow tomatoes or something. There was a look of absolute bafflement on the faces of many members of Parliament, at least those who were paying attention.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here we are 22 years later, the day after a major international accord on greenhouse gases has come into effect and I wish that we were better positioned as a country and better positioned as parliamentarians to have something to celebrate. We celebrate the accord, but we have nothing to celebrate in the Canadian context yet, because we do not have a government that is fully committed to implementing that accord. We have a government which is committed to the appearance of implementing the accord, but not a government that we get the feeling at all is committed in its gut to really making this happen. It is absolutely critical that this be made to happen.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I  want to tell a little story which I read in a book years ago when I was reading about the environmental crisis as it was seen then in the 1970s. The story may have been in Barry Commoner's book <i>Closing Circle.</i></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anyway, I  ask hon. members to imagine  a lily pond. The lily pond will be covered in lily pads in 28 days, but it will be covered in the following way. It will start off with one lily pad, then two lily pads, then four, then eight, then 16, then 32 , then 64. I do not want to go any higher lest I tax some of the Tory backbenchers, but members can see what I mean. These problems tend to grow exponentially. This is the problem with climate change and a lot of other environmental problems.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If that   lily pond is to be covered in lily pads in 28 days and that process is taking place  exponentially, on the 27th day of that 28 day process, how much of the pond will be left? Fifty per cent. We are sitting there on the 27th day and somebody is saying that if we do not do something about this, some day the lily pond will be covered and we will have a problem, because it is important to us to have open water. There will be people, whether they be Liberals, Conservatives or others, who will say, “What is with you guys? Half the pond is left. What are you worrying about? There is nothing to worry about”. Then on the 28th day, bingo, the game is over. The system has collapsed and it is too late to do anything about it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the kind of process we are in when it comes to climate change. I do not know whether we are at the 27th day, the 26th day or the 25th day; I hope that we are at the 19th or  20th day, but we know that we are in a position where things could happen very fast. We  could be putting the whole planetary environment at risk.</p><A NAME="T1230"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1230"><!-- Hour: 12--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1235"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1225"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1230)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am not under any illusions about the fact that Canada can do this by itself,  but it would be a shame if a country with the resources that  Canada has, the political, civil, spiritual and other resources that we have, could not bring itself to meaningfully implement the only global environmental accord that is there at the moment and on which the future of the planet depends. If we cannot do that, what kind of message does that send to the rest of the world? Countries that have fewer resources than we do, in that comprehensive meaning of the word resources, why should they even try?</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have a responsibility to the world, to the world's environment, even if we do  not feel a responsibility to ourselves.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is why we have urged the government to finally get serious about this. Getting serious about this means regulation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have already tried voluntary compliance. We have had this same story from government after government over the time that I have been here, “Let us just have those in the industry do it on their own”. They do not do it and they are not doing it now.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It does not bother us to regulate individual behaviour. We have regulated smokers almost out of existence. Why is it that it is okay to regulate and mandate the behaviour of individual Canadians, but when it comes to corporate behaviour, that is a different story? That would have economic effects.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Banning smoking has had economic effects on community clubs, on legions, on all kinds of things, but that is okay.  Why is it okay? Because there is a higher environmental goal or health goal to be met and we expect those organizations, many of them community organizations that are being hurt by this, to abide by that in the name of the larger interest, but not corporations, no. When it comes to mandatory fuel emission standards or other kinds of emissions, whenever corporations do not like it then all of sudden, let us make it voluntary. What if we did that with the smoking bans that have been put in place across the country? Some restaurants can have smoking bans and others cannot. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the face of it there seems to be a double standard. This is what bothers us. It bothers us because the empirical evidence has accumulated to the point where we know that depending on the industry to come up with voluntary emission standards and to actually implement them is just a fool's paradise.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to think it is a fool's paradise, but it is actually a cynic's paradise.  What it is is a Liberals' paradise, pretending that they are doing something when we know full well that it is not going to happen and therefore they are never going to have to answer to their corporate friends for making them behave in a way that they should be behaving anyway.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apparently the Minister of Natural Resources said that they do not want to pass this motion because they are right in the middle of negotiations. Would it not be something for the Minister of Natural Resources and the Minister of the Environment to have in their back pockets a motion passed by the Parliament of Canada, by the representatives of the people of Canada, which  says that we want mandatory regulation of emission standards? Would that not be something to have on the table when they are negotiating? What kind of negotiator is he anyway? Does he want to go there with his hands tied behind his back, or does he want to go there with something in his hand that matters; the will of the people of Canada to have their government finally do something about this problem?</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister of the Environment apparently said that  California brought in compulsory emission standards but it only  did that after voluntary emission standards did not work. Where has the Minister of the Environment been? He thinks it is working here.  Apparently he said, “We are not there yet”.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why should we have to wait? It is almost an admission that he has to go through this process. He knows in advance that it is not going to work, but he has to go through this process first.  In the meantime the air gets dirtier, more people have asthma, more people die, but that is okay because we would not want the Liberals to have suffered any discomfort in their relationship with their corporate friends.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For all these reasons, and  lots more could be said, I would certainly  encourage individual members to support this motion. Even if their parties cannot bring themselves to support this motion, perhaps there are Liberal and Tory backbenchers who could bring themselves to support the motion because they know that ultimately this is what is going to have to happen, and the sooner it happens, the better.</p><A NAME="T1235"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1235"><!-- Hour: 12--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1240"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1230"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1235)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He asked about a backup plan.  Presumably when  we  negotiate, we negotiate in good faith.  When we negotiate in good faith, we indicate  the target that we have set, that   we want the auto industry to meet it and that we are going to be able to monitor that target. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If in fact there were failure, then I would presume we would have to go to the next step. However,  the fact  that this motion is before the House suggests somehow that there will be failure.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have more confidence in our negotiators. We have more confidence in the fact that the industry, which has signed 14 MOUs over the years,  is prepared to work with the government.  Members have talked about  major contributors to parties. I guess they have not heard of Bill C-24.  I guess they do not  know what the    workers in the auto sector clearly have indicated. As far as I am concerned we  want to have jobs and  a strong environment.  If   they cannot live with that, that is their choice.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What kind of negotiations  is the member  looking at when  in  fact we have set a target and we are asking the industry to meet it?</p><A NAME="Int-1138300"></A><a HREF="#Int-1138310"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-1138287"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Hon.

Yes, we do not have any confidence in the people who are negotiating on behalf of the government.</p>

Of course the Liberal answer to that is to have a conference in Montreal.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not know whether the member had a chance to watch CPAC last night, but   Jay  Myers of the Canadian Manufacturers and Exporters said, and I am paraphrasing,   that if we took every car and truck in Canada off the road today, we would not meet Canada's Kyoto target; if we were to shut down every manufacturing plant in Canada today, we would not meet Canada's Kyoto target.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My question for the member for Elmwood—Transcona is, if  the NDP agrees with these statements,  and it  probably will not,   is the New Democratic Party living in a dream world?</p><A NAME="Int-1138327"></A><a HREF="#Int-1138347"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-1138310"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Hon. Bill Blaikie: </b>Mr. Speaker,  no one has ever suggested that any one particular sector by itself, even if it was completely removed, could meet the Kyoto target.  To me, this is kind of a straw man set up by the Canadian Manufacturers and Exporters  or anybody else who  simply does not want to engage in the kind of change that is required in order to prevent climate change.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the end, those people's children and  grandchildren are going to live in the same screwed up environment as the rest of us.  Why can they not see that?  Why are they caught in this  paradigm paralysis that they cannot see beyond the way they have always done things to see that we have to change our way of doing things instead of coming up with these rather petty <i>reductio ad absurdum</i> arguments that are supposed to lay us to waste.  We are supposed to listen to them    and say, “Oh, wow, let us forget it then. Let us just go on doing things the way we have been doing them”.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fact of the matter is that we can meet our Kyoto commitments by having the kind of comprehensive plan that the NDP itself has put on the table. It is  a combination of things, from  very simple things like having a tax system that  would allow people to deduct the cost of their bus passes, to massive retrofitting of buildings, to building the east-west hydro grid that has been waiting to be built for so long,  to getting serious about   public  mass transit. The list goes on of things  we could be doing.  We could  invest in renewable energy, solar and wind power, instead of continuing to subsidize the oil and gas industry. No one thing is going to do it.  We need to do all these things together.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To do that, we need to have a government that has the will and a government that has a plan.  So far we have neither.</p><A NAME="Int-1138347"></A><a HREF="#Int-1138443"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-1138327"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Brian Masse (Windsor West, NDP): </b>Mr. Speaker, it is a pleasure to rise to speak about this issue.  This motion is very important.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To continue with the thoughts related to the fact that there are negotiations going on right now, I think it would be a position of strength for the negotiation team to have Parliament and the House actually interested in their industry, interested in the future of it, and want to play a role in ensuring that it would be successful not only for our country but also for exports across the world. That is the important aspect that has not been raised.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NDP members have been characterized as attacking the industry.  It is far from it.  We are talking about the future of the industry. The future is going to be like engine plants in my riding, such as Ford. It has no replacement right now. It will be replaced with another one that has standards or emissions that are in the current format of today.  The future would be a hybrid in that plant.  The future is ensuring that those workers are going to have employment.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are losing jobs because we are not manufacturing some of the newer technologies that are attracting the eye of the world, other states and other consumers.  We are losing that opportunity now.  That is what is really important. There is a critical timeframe for this industry.  It is changing and government has a role.  This is a sad excuse on behalf of the Liberal Party.  It is trying to wiggle out again on a national auto policy.  That is what this is really about, to wiggle out of a responsibility.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us look at the CAPC recommendations that have been made, the Canadian auto parts strategy that was created over two years ago.  I have not contacted it to see if it supports this motion or not.  If we look at what it has come up with and how it relates to this motion with regard to emission standards and creating an environment not only where vehicles emit less and we have less pollution, cleaner air and on top of that jobs, its recommendations match up quite nicely.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are five main recommendations and I would like to talk a bit about them.  One of them is large scale investment incentives which states: </p>
<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td width="15" align="right"></td>
<td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>Ensure Canada’s competitiveness in attracting automotive investment by improving the focus, flexibility and accessibility of government incentives which are now essential to win large-scale automotive investments or re-investments. These incentives can be linked to innovation, technology implementation, skills enhancement and sustainability.</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That fits with this motion. It is sad that Canadians right now have to import the Prius, with the Canadian technology in terms of the hybrid engine, as opposed to having it manufactured and assembled by Canadians. What if that hybrid was in the Ford plant that everyone is going to watch in my community potentially go down if we do not procure a new product real soon?</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have the University of Windsor with Auto21, the Ford Centre for Excellence at St. Clair College, and we have training and development programs that do not only just talk about the new fuel efficiency and standards. I give credit to the government for funding these initiatives and starting more as needed.  These are important first steps.  They are also opportunities for new employment for students as well as the assemblers, who could very much use re-investment.  That was the number one point it had.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second one was infrastructure.  I have spoken many  times in the House of Commons about the Windsor-Detroit border crossing and infrastructure.  Ontario is being punished and hammered, as well as the rest of this country, by the government's refusal to implement the recommendations of the Schwartz report  unanimously passed by the city of Windsor and the county council to get gridlock off of our streets, Despite the Prime Minister's promises, which he makes a lot of everywhere else, he has yet to deliver.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The solutions are there to unplug the gridlock, but the government has yet to act on it.  Despite this report being ready for weeks, despite crying foul for a long time and asking when the report was going to come forward, the government has not acted on it yet.  There has not even been a political statement about the report from the Prime Minister, who said in our community that he would support a local solution.  That is lack of leadership.</p><A NAME="T1245"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1245"><!-- Hour: 12--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1250"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1240"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1245)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third recommendation made by CAPC states:</p>
<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td width="30" align="right"></td>
<td><small>--auto-focused innovation incentives such as early commercialization tax credits, consumer supports to encourage the purchase of environmentally friendly vehicle technologies and more effective supports for manufacturing process innovation.</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once again, that is all in line with reducing emissions. I am not surprised that the industry is a little bit timid on this and saying that it is not sure whether it can go to mandatory from voluntary in the time frame.  It does not have the government backstopping it.  This is what this is about.  It is about the government trying to weasel out of an auto policy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the industry had the confidence that the government had an auto policy, then it could say that the political will of the people of Canada wants to have reduced emissions and wants to have auto jobs.  Then there is a role for our government to participate in the renewal of the industry that would benefit our citizens in terms of employment and also cleaner air. The public support out there is unanimous for that.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is why there is support for the Kyoto agreement among the public.  The public knows that the status quo and the system that we have in place right now is a recipe for disaster, not only as we lag behind in terms of environmental issues that we pay for personally and collectively in our communities, but also by the lost opportunities in jobs as other nations surpass us time after time on newer technologies for manufacturing and development. We cannot bring that time back.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those markets become saturated and those opportunities are lost.  The innovation is a constant catch-up game from our side and that gives other nations too much of an advantage, especially when this government has no interest in dealing with other issues around fair trade.  The government is not concerned with perhaps the deplorable practices that other countries have with regard to the disposal of materials after manufacturing and production.  We have higher standards over here.  That is not something other countries are concerned about.  It gives them a cheaper ability to manufacture goods.  They are not concerned with that.  Thus we are falling behind.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fourth recommendation deals with regulatory harmonization.  This is interesting, it states:  </p>
<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td width="15" align="right"></td>
<td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>Take action to coordinate and streamline regulations (including those pertaining to vehicle safety, certification and emissions) between Canada and the United States, and within Canada, in recognition of the integrated nature of the North American industry and the need to coordinate automotive-related investment marketing by Canadianjurisdictions.</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We know California and a series of other states are moving to high emissions standards.  Canada is losing those markets.  Are we going to see them regress?  Will we see other states regress?  The answer is no. Standards will increase more and more.  Our production has to meet those standards if we are to continue to export to those markets.  Our auto workers are the most productive and have the best quality in the world.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canadian auto workers can face the challenge of ensuring that the newer technologies get into the vehicles and are a quality product that will meet the demands of the markets they need to penetrate.  I am confident in their skills and abilities if we provide them with the tools. The industry is changing.  The world is changing.  Let us be in the front of it, not in the back seat. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a fifth element on human resources. It states:</p>
<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td width="30" align="right"></td>
<td><small>--review existing training programs and opportunities; address the impact of demographic trends on the skilled trades workforce; strengthen apprenticeship programs; and attract more young people to careers in the automotive industry</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here is a great opportunity for employment for young people.  If we can get some of the newer vehicles out there, then the newer technologies will require people in service garages across this nation.  There will be new standards, new skills and new opportunities for employment that we did not have before.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us give those young people those opportunities.  Let us ensure that they are at the forefront of servicing these new vehicles, as well as the vehicles that are coming into Canada.  The government has no auto policy and wants to give away our technology as it has done in other sectors, as opposed to having the manufacturing done in Canada.</p><A NAME="T1250"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1250"><!-- Hour: 12--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1255"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1245"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1250)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><A NAME="Int-1138443"></A><a HREF="#Int-1138463"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-1138347"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Gary Goodyear (Cambridge, CPC): </b>Mr. Speaker, I take complete exception with the NDP member making negative comments and connotations about Toyota. Toyota has a plant in my riding of Cambridge and that plant is not only the cleanest plant, it produces the cleanest vehicles, the most fuel efficient vehicles, and employs over 4,000 of the most intelligent automotive manufacturers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a difficult motion not to support. Who would not support a cleaner environment? I would like to announce that the Conservative Party had a very complete platform. We had a plan for a clean environment, cleaning brownfields, and negotiating border state emissions. If we were the government right now, we would have a plan in place. We would not let the deadline go by for Kyoto.  It is very easy for a party which has no potential of putting in place that kind of a plan to sit here and talk about all these great ideas.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am the Ontario caucus chair and on a tour recently there was no doubt that there has been no leadership. The auto industry has expressed to us a number of ways to fix the environment. Although we support those ways, I must ask the member why this party would want to pick on not only one industry, but one type of vehicle? </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That kind of lack of forethought and lack of complete solution is going to devastate the light vehicle market. Some 80% of these vehicles go outside of Canada and rather than creating harmony and regulations, we cannot support this motion simply because it complicates things. It is not workable and I would like to ask the member, why does the NDP insist on picking on one industry and one type of vehicle?</p><A NAME="T1255"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1255"><!-- Hour: 12--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1300"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1250"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1255)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><A NAME="Int-1138463"></A><a HREF="#Int-1138466"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-1138443"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Brian Masse: </b>Mr. Speaker, I do not think the hon. member was listening when I talked about our auto workers in this country and that included all of them.

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government is going from crisis to crisis and negotiating in backroom deals for auto investments. It is not out there with a public policy that shows Canadians that we are going to have an investment, a strategy based on certain principles, and that we are actually going to procure that for our country. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government is going behind the scenes, the most recent being the GM Beacon project. Who knows what is happening with that right now? I think it is good because we have not had a call lately but who knows? Why is there not an auto policy so all Canadians can understand how their tax paying money is being spent?</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are not picking on this industry.

By way of setting the stage, I would like to remind members that I represent the riding of Whitby--Oshawa in the region of Durham.  The region of Durham is home to General Motors and to the head office of BMW Canada.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My constituents are concerned not only about the health of the auto industry in Canada but also the health of the environment. The government has made a commitment to Kyoto and to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.  In terms of working with all sectors, it is extremely important that we get a general buy-in from the public.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My problem with the motion on the floor today is the notion that the only way to achieve any reduction in greenhouse gases and  the only way to get the auto industry to comply is through a mandatory regulatory regime.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I spent a number of years in the education profession working with people.  It has always been my view and understanding that if parties can sit down and negotiate a settlement, they feel they are part of the solution.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I talk to members of the automotive industry on a regular basis.  They have never suggested that they do not want to be a part of the solution.  The fact that we are currently in negotiations says something about the state of the relationship between the auto industry and Canadians and government. I am not just talking about General Motors or Ford.  These negotiations involve all groups.  The member across has told us that Toyota is in his riding.  It is one of the parties at the table, together with Ford and General Motors and many others.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The automotive industry is a very competitive industry, but it has managed to get by that for the common good.  It understands that good economic policy is not exclusive to good environmental policy.  The industry wants to be a part of the solution.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A voluntary company average fuel consumption program has been in place for many years.   I would like to give the House a couple of facts which the opposition does not want to acknowledge. Since 1986, passenger cars have averaged 8% better than the voluntary CAF targets; 2003-04 passenger cars averaged 8% better than the voluntary targets; and light trucks were 3% better.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There has been an improvement, but perhaps not as great as we would wish. That is why we are now currently at the negotiating table.  We are talking about approximately five megatonnes.  Nobody in the industry would say that is not an appropriate amount to be asked to reduce.  Industry is asking us to find ways to do it, and it may not necessarily be through a regimented mandatory system.  There should be an opportunity to put various things on the table.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The suggestion that somehow industry is bad and never wants to do its part belies the fact that currently there are about 14 memorandums of agreement in place with respect to the automotive industry.  Industry is not reneging on those.  There has been compliance.  To suggest that if we do not have mandatory requirements, there will not be compliance shortchanges the industry.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A suggestion was made that we on the Liberal side are only supportive of big business and big corporations to the exclusion of the environment.  I would remind members that big business needs the very people that they say they represent,  workers and families.  They are my constituents.  I want them to have good jobs.  I want them to have a clean and healthy environment.  I am a mother with a child who has asthma and allergies.  I want to see a better and cleaner environment. All sectors need to work together to see that happen.</p><A NAME="T1300"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1300"><!-- Hour: 1--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1305"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1255"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1300)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We should also put on the table that while no one is suggesting that the emissions from autos are not causing some problems to the environment, I would also indicate that one cord of wood burned in a fireplace this winter will create more smog-causing emissions than the entire lifetime emissions produced by 10 Tier 2 SUVs. In fact one would have to drive 37 new Tier 2 SUVs around the earth's circumference to equal the emissions from one cord of wood that is burned. There are a number of things that we are doing in every day life that are adding to smog or emissions.  Any approach we take has to take all these things into consideration.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One could paint a room, use one gallon of oil-based paint, and that would generate more smog than a Tier 2 vehicle moving from Toronto to Vancouver and back. Are we going to suddenly say that there are mandatory limits on  how much paint an individual can use? No, but it is important and appropriate that we get the message out in terms of some of things we are doing with the one tonne challenge, to indicate to individuals what they can do.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It does not matter what kind of a vehicle an auto industry produces. The fact is someone has to buy it.  I do not think we want to limit people's choices.  What we should be doing is putting forth the options that if a person buys this, these are the benefits to the environment. At the same time, I am encouraging my government to look at ways  we can encourage people to do the right thing, to look at making comparisons about the advantages of buying vehicles that are much more fuel efficient. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To suggest that we do not have an auto strategy is ludicrous. Talk to Ford. It knows we have an auto strategy. General Motors will soon know that we have an auto strategy. We are working very closely with those people, and part of it is for research and development so they can continue to put  a better, more efficient vehicle on the market for all of us.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am a little concerned that somehow we are painted as being anti-environment and against reduced emission strategies. I want to see this happen. I want to see it happen in many areas, but I do not think we should be picking on this one and saying it has to be mandatory. We need to work together. I would encourage us all to continue to work together to try to get what is best for our children and future children. That is part of the reason why Canada signed on to the Kyoto accord.  It understands and appreciates that if we sit back and do nothing, what will we leave to future generations?</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One party across the way says that this is job-killing, that this is inappropriate and that we should not be doing it.  The other says that we have to regulate and make it mandatory, that we should not have a buy-in, that we should not get people to  understand that everybody needs to do their part. I would challenge members on one side to say, “Have you met the one tonne challenge? What are you doing to promote it? What are you doing in your own daily lives to assist?”</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am not here as an apologist for the auto industry. I am not saying that we should let it off the hook in terms of coming to the table, of doing its part to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and of meeting the challenge that we have put before it in terms a five megatonne reduction. We absolutely need to do that. Do we need to be tough at the negotiation tables? Absolutely, but we do not need to be so entrenched that there is only one way to do this. I think through voluntary negotiation we could achieve the very targets the member wants to see happen.</p><A NAME="T1305"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1305"><!-- Hour: 1--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1310"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1300"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1305)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><A NAME="Int-1138587"></A><a HREF="#Int-1138589"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-1138495"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Jeff Watson (Essex, CPC): </b>Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the hon. member's comments that it is important to get all the people to the table. The North American market is integrated, yet we have a government that is negotiating a fuel efficiency standard with the Canadian part of the market. The reality is that 80% of the vehicles that are purchased in Canada are built in the United States or Mexico.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Should the government's negotiation of a fuel efficiency standard include discussions with the United States and Mexico? Could the government confirm that  it is currently negotiating with the United States and Mexico on a common fuel efficiency standard, and if not, why not?</p><A NAME="Int-1138589"></A><a HREF="#Int-1138591"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-1138587"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Hon.

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Hon. Judi Longfield:</b> Yes, it is 20% of the market, but it is an important part. We are sitting down at the table negotiating. When they talk to us, they understand that they are 20% of the market. We are asking them what they believe is achievable and what will meet common goals. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think through voluntary negotiation, given that they understand that they are only 20% of the market, and given that they understand what our needs and requirements are, we can come to a solution that is satisfactory to both.</p><A NAME="Int-1138591"></A><a HREF="#Int-1138622"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-1138589"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Charlie Angus (Timmins—James Bay, NDP): </b>Mr. Speaker, I was very upset to hear that she thought we were accusing her party of being an apologist for the auto industry. I think it is fairly clear what we were saying. The government stands up in the House and says that it loves little children, dogs and balloons, as we all do, and, therefore,  why do we not all make the world a happier place?</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are saying that the government has absolutely no intention of coming through on anything to do with Kyoto. It would have us talk about the one tonne challenge and how we should not open our cans of paint because it would spend more than driving my car to Vancouver and back. I will go home this weekend and paint to see if that is true.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I like the idea of voluntary standards. For example, why do we not have a voluntary gun control registry?  With the hundreds of millions of dollars we have spent, I think a lot of Canadians would like a voluntary gun control registry. No, the government said  that it could not have voluntary standards.    What about voluntary drinking and driving regulations?</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How about if we take the voluntary drinking and driving regulations and turn it into this idea of credits? If people are sober, then they should be able to sell their drinking and driving credits to people who are drunk. With the logic of the government, what a fantastic idea. If I  drive nine times sober, I should for the tenth time be able to drive through drunk because I can buy a credit from someone who does not like to have a couple of shots before he goes home from work.  That is the idea of voluntary credits.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to ask the hon. member this.  Where in this world have we ever seen voluntary emission standards? The government brought in voluntary labelling of genetically modified foods, and we have not seen a single company comply. When we talk about mandatory, it so we can get something done.  I would like to see if we will get it done.</p><A NAME="T1310"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1310"><!-- Hour: 1--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1315"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1305"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1310)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><A NAME="Int-1138622"></A><a HREF="#Int-1138626"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-1138591"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Hon.

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe that at the end of the day they have to come to an agreement.  When they have agreed upon the levels, they will indeed live up to their agreement.

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would indicate to the member opposite that we are in negotiations, that we are working.  This is not something that the Government of Canada can do solely on its own. It deals with the city of Windsor and other governments.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everything is easy when members are in opposition.</p><A NAME="Int-1138631"></A><a HREF="#Int-1138667"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-1138628"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Hon. Bryon Wilfert (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of the Environment, Lib.): </b>Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to participate in the debate today.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The issue clearly is that some of us in the House have recognized the fact that climate change is a reality. The fact is that this government signed the Kyoto protocol. It came into effect. The fact is that some in the House did not even believe that Russia would sign on. It did. Some of them did not believe it would ever come into effect. It has.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We on this side of the House are taking our responsibilities very seriously. In fact, as the Minister of the Environment and the Minister of Natural Resources have indicated, there is  a long list of achievements by the government with regard to dealing with this issue. This issue is not, however, solely a federal issue. It is a federal-provincial-municipal issue and obviously an individual issue. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fact is that some in the House  ridicule the one tonne challenge. It is a comprehensive approach, and clearly the one tonne challenge is one element to engage Canadians. Apparently some in the House do not believe we should engage Canadians directly. I believe that is important. Everyone has their own part to play. I would suggest that this is a good way to do it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would  also point out that we are fully engaged with municipal governments. The announcement by the minister of state dealing with infrastructure clearly shows that  in the $5 billion proposal over five years on the gas tax aimed at green infrastructure. Whether we are talking sewer improvements or water treatment plants, et cetera, it is obviously very important in helping in the battle.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet another element is working with the provinces. Again, somehow the suggestion is that we do not have a plan. Maybe some of the members should read the climate change plan for Canada 2002 and also look at the fact that in any plan there are needs for refinements. We have already said that. The minister has said that. A budget is coming out. I would suggest that after the budget some of these members take a look at the plan as it has been refined and then try to say to us that we do not have a plan. It would be very hard.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Government is about choices. It is about making the right decision. We made the right decision by signing the Kyoto protocol. We announced in Montreal just yesterday that the United Nations framework conference on climate change will be held  in Montreal at the end of November. It  will focus very strongly on Canada and Canadian leadership. This is an opportunity where we will have 7,000 to 10,000 delegates coming to Canada. It is an opportunity for the Minister of the Environment and the Prime Minister to certainly showcase and talk about the initiatives Canada is doing. Obviously Canada cannot and is not doing it alone; over 140 countries have signed on to the Kyoto protocol, but it is a first step.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We  are going to be looking beyond Kyoto as well. The Minister of the Environment has talked very clearly about the need for a competitive economy, the need for a strong economy. Therefore, a strong economy and a strong environment can be married together.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We understand the importance of the auto sector. We have a very active and engaged auto caucus on this side of the House. Under the leadership of my colleagues on this side of the House, we have understood and have worked collaboratively with the industry. I am delighted to hear that the Conservatives have an auto caucus. I think it is important that we all engage. We do not all have the definitive answers, but I hope that we can work together.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would suggest that our mission is to deal with the issue of greenhouse gas reductions. It is important that we do that. Clearly, working with the auto sector has been and continues to be an important aspect of government policy. We have signed 14 MOUs with the auto sector. The auto sector has adapted. One of the strengths is the Canadian workers in this country. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gentleman across the way talked about the Toyota plant in Cambridge. I had the pleasure of visiting that plant last summer and I can tell hon. members that it is probably cleaner than a hospital. I must tell the hon. member that when the Japanese were looking around the world to produce the Lexus outside of Japan for the first time, they picked Canada. They picked Cambridge because of the quality of the workmanship, because of the standards of the workers and in fact because of the social programs, et cetera. We could go on and on. The fact is that our auto sector in this country is second to none. </p><A NAME="T1315"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1315"><!-- Hour: 1--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1320"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1310"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1315)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would suggest that  whether it is in Cambridge, Windsor, Oshawa  or Oakville, wherever it happens to be, the fact is that we understand and the auto sector understands that we need to be fully engaged on this topic. Clearly that is in the auto sector's interest. It knows what the consumers are looking for in terms of fuel efficient vehicles.  We know what they are looking for  and the auto manufacturers know that.  That is why they have been responding, and I think very effectively, in that regard over the years.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the suggestion that we are looking for a voluntary agreement, there are many voluntary things that go on in our society.  In this case,  there is a notion that somehow we are not going to make an agreement.   Let me say that in 1998 the EU came to a voluntary agreement with its car makers and in fact on the whole issue of reduction of CO<sub>2</sub>: 140g/kilometre by 2008.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fact is that we have an opportunity to work with the industry.  We are negotiating with the industry.    Obviously I am not going to be able to  say at this point, because I have no crystal ball, how it is going to work out, but I am   very confident that the negotiators at the table understand what we want. I believe very strongly that we will see this.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The member for Oshawa  has indicated  that he is concerned about jobs in his community. Naturally so. We are not trying to put people out of work.  What we are trying to say is that we want to make sure the economy is strong and the environment is strong, working in ways which are effective. Let us look at other jurisdictions, including Australia, which did not sign the Kyoto protocol but which as well has voluntary standards committing  its industry by 2010. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fact is that in our discussions we have to remember  that climate change is in fact something which is not only in the auto sector, with the large emitters. We and the Minister of the Environment have taken the approach of working with industries, saying “this is what we are looking for”, and I think setting a standard, which is very important  in the sense that rather than scaring people we are saying,“We are prepared to work effectively and if in fact certain things do not happen, then we will go to the next step”.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think the reality is,  no pun intended, that the whole climate has changed in terms of how we are dealing with industries in this country.  People are saying that we are in fact recognizing the role of a strong economy and  a strong environment.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No one is more committed to ensuring that we have a strong environment, with clean air and clean water, than this Minister of the Environment. I want to make it very clear that on this side of the House we agree with the objective, and I am sure all members do.  Some of us may differ on how we get there, but the reality is that we do agree. We need to have a cleaner environment.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clearly the synergy   is needed with stakeholders and with all orders of government. I think there are certain incentives.  On that side of the House, people talk about incentives.  We agree.  Obviously we need to have incentives.  Whether it is dealing with hybrid vehicles,   hydrogen or the economy, incentives are important.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We talk about wind power and its importance. Again, we have    4,000 megawatts to power one million homes in this country.  The fact is that this is extremely important. It is something that this government is committed to and has demonstrated in budget after budget  and, I would point out, it will do so in this next budget.  I know that those members are somewhat like little kids at Christmastime; they are anxious to get in there and see what is under the tree.  The fact is that all departments have a responsibility. Once the budget is released, I would suspect that we will see some very positive elements there as well.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of my colleagues mentioned the fact that in government  we actually have to be responsible for what we say. I would point out   that we have made it very clear that this government is looking at a comprehensive approach in dealing with climate change, not in just one sector but in many sectors.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I welcome the fact that the New Democratic Party has put this issue before the House, because clearly we all are interested in the same objective. The hon. member who serves on committee with me knows that there is no one more committed in terms of moving this agenda forward,  I would suspect, than this Minister of the Environment. Certainly as his parliamentary secretary  I  want suggest to those members that, rather than criticism, if they have constructive alternatives they should put them forward.</p><A NAME="T1320"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1320"><!-- Hour: 1--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1325"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1315"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1320)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><A NAME="Int-1138667"></A><a HREF="#Int-1138669"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-1138631"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Nathan Cullen (Skeena—Bulkley Valley, NDP): </b>Mr. Speaker, I am deeply saddened to have missed the beginning of the parliamentary secretary's speech.  I was on a call-in show in Victoria and another one in Vancouver.  Canadians are deeply impressed with this motion and the concept of finally bringing forward mandatory regulations.  I am glad to see the Liberals applauding it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question, the premise or the philosophy of this motion is between mandatory and voluntary regulations.  The Liberals are asking us to trust them after these many years of promises and budget after budget showing that emissions have gone up in Canada, popping us to the back of the OECD and making us an international pariah with respect to Kyoto.  Who else shows up on the day of the exam without a plan or any concept of how to get there?</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My question is with respect to the voluntary requirement.  I will take the Americans as a quick example.  In 1975 the American Environmental Protection Agency was requiring that the big three automakers make public the mileage their vehicles were getting. They said, “No, we cannot do that.  It is going to expose us to unfair practices and unfair competition.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The EPA threatened with regulations and said it would make this mandatory.  Of course then the big three automakers started to disclose their mileage rates and now the rates are part of purchasing a car.  Canadians and Americans clearly understand that when they purchase a car they  find out what mileage they will get from the vehicle.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why is the parliamentary secretary so resistant to the idea of increasing the strength of the government's hand in the negotiations with automakers?  We say that it has been a long time and there has been a lot of waiting. This government has not had the foresight to just enforce mandatory regulations and then bring about actual change rather than just rhetoric.</p><A NAME="Int-1138669"></A><a HREF="#Int-1138671"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-1138667"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Hon.

Otherwise it is easier to mark, and it is a lot easier to mark because there is nothing on the paper if someone has not studied.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This member talks about the need to regulate.  The NDP's solution to a lot of things is regulate and regulate. What the government and I are suggesting is that we are in negotiations.  We are in negotiations and I cannot at this point say what the conclusions will be.  Perhaps the hon. member already knows.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reality is that we are in negotiations.  Obviously we would like to have a voluntary agreement, but one in which we are able to assess that agreement.  Somehow the member thinks that we have a voluntary agreement and then the government says to come back in five or six years.  The reality is that we measure the trajectory.  If it goes up we are in fact then able to assess it.  I would suggest that we assess it.</p><A NAME="T1325"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1325"><!-- Hour: 1--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1330"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1320"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1325)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><A NAME="Int-1138671"></A><a HREF="#Int-1138686"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-1138669"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Jeff Watson (Essex, CPC): </b>Mr. Speaker, we have no agreement on a fuel efficiency standard with Canadian industry yet.

Would the hon. parliamentary secretary answer with regard to the other 80% purchased here in Canada but produced in the United States and in Mexico?  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why has the government not brought the U.S. and Mexico to the table in negotiating a continental standard for fuel efficiency, one that would allow the entire industry to abate its costs across the industry over a defined period of time and share that? Is it because this government does not have the credibility with the United States to bring the Americans to the table and bring them into a common continental agreement?</p><A NAME="Int-1138686"></A><a HREF="#Int-1138688"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-1138671"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Hon. Bryon Wilfert: </b>Mr. Speaker, I would not use the word “credibility” coming from a party that in fact until very recently denied the issue of climate change, a party which seemed to suggest that Kyoto would not in fact be ratified and that in fact Russia would not ratify.  The fact is that in the United States about 42 states are working on Kyoto standards, to meet them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On an international agreement, the member used the word “continental”, but I will avoid the word “continental”.  I would suggest a collaborative approach.  The fact is the industry itself has talked about this.  There is harmonization that has gone on in terms of certain safety standards in certain areas of the industry. The fact is that may be an option, but at the moment the issue before the House is whether or not it is voluntary.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If in fact this was really being pushed and was really needed I am sure the United States would have put it on the table, but the reality is that the Americans are doing their part.  We are doing our part and at the moment we are going to have a clearly made in Canada solution, dealing with an industry which we have been able to work with very well.</p><A NAME="Int-1138688"></A><a HREF="#Int-1138738"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-1138686"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Joe Comartin (Windsor—Tecumseh, NDP): </b>Mr. Speaker, my colleague from Winnipeg North and I will be sharing this time slot.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I was getting ready to speak today I was going to start this somewhat differently but, having listened   to some of the comments from the member for Oshawa,  I decided I should talk a bit    about our responsibility, both as a party and as a government, in terms of dealing with this issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have to do that in the context of the history of the auto industry, and I am  intimately involved in that history. My father worked on both   the U.S. side and the Canadian side of the border before he passed away. I have extended family members who currently work in the auto industry. For the last 15 years before I was elected, I was   directly responsible in my legal work and the legal plan that I administered in Windsor was directly connected to the auto industry. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The comments  I   heard from the member for Oshawa,    that we do not care about jobs,that we do not care about the industry and that we do not understand the industry, are accusations that I totally refute. The reality is that if we do not get serious about dealing with the environmental consequences that flow from the use of motor vehicles in North America, if we do not play a significant role in cleaning up the use of the vehicles, we will  get left way behind. We will continue to see Toyota, the Chinese industry that is coming very rapidly, taking more and more of our market share. Those imports will continue to swamp this market in both Canada and the United States. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are at the cusp of one of those times historically when we have to act and we do not have a lot of time. Our concern is all about maintaining the industry, but even more important, about growing the industry, making the Canadian part of that industry stronger, not weaker. The do nothing attitude that I am hearing from both the Liberals and the Conservatives is not acceptable. It will not get us there.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canadian workers, as we heard from my colleague from Windsor West, are among the best in the world if not the best. They have no superiors, although they may have some peers. When we look at the history of what has happened with the auto industry in North America, particularly in the last 50 years,   there has been a significant advancement, especially in  protecting workers' rights and their right to organize. My father was probably part of the Ford strike that finally forced Ford, by way of that strike, to have compulsory recognition of the union. It is the basis in many respects for our collective bargaining arrangements in this country, not just in the auto sector but right across the board.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There have been advancements  on health and safety issues.   I think of the strikes that my family went through during the sixties to get parity with workers in the United States. I think of what went on in the sixties and the seventies to get the auto industry to address the issues of auto safety. I think of the fight to get smaller vehicles built in North America after the oil crises of the early seventies. In every case, if one studies that history and understands it or lives it as I have, we cannot talk voluntary. We do not tie our hands behind our back. As the government, as the representative of the people of this country, it is often necessary for us to say that we will mandate these standards.</p><A NAME="T1330"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1330"><!-- Hour: 1--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1335"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1325"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1330)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Liberals have repeatedly told us today about the 14 MOUs  and how great it has been  that the auto industry has met the requirements under those MOUs.   What the Liberals have not told us is that   not one of those MOUs was signed before the industry was compelled to meet those standards in the United States  under a different administration than is in that country now.  In every single case those  standards were met and     agreed upon in Canada only after they were made compulsory in the United States.  We all know how integrated the  industry is. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nothing new was going on  there.  Nothing voluntary was being achieved in the way of advanced standards.  They were already compulsory.  However, because we form such a small part of that market, roughly 10%,     what was going on in the U.S. mandated  that those standards had to be implemented and met.  No pluses for that.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reality is that right now the U.S. administration is not pushing either fuel efficiency or emission standards.  It has abandoned the field.  As a consequence of that, the field has now been taken over by individual states in the  United States, led by California   but followed closely by Massachusetts, New York, Ohio, Rhode Island, New Jersey and, just last week, Washington.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As of the first of this year, California made certain standards compulsory.  We will probably hear more today about the 25% solution, which is to  increase fuel efficiency by 25% and reduce noxious emissions by roughly the same amount.   Illinois has signalled that it too will sign on to the plan. When we add up the population of those states, it  adds up to more than half the population of the  United States. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we  sit  on the sidelines, which could be the consequence of the negotiations that are going on now, and if they turn out to be voluntary, all of those states will be ahead of us.  This begs the question:  Will the Chrysler minivan, which we build better than anyone in the world and which is assembled in Windsor, have access to those markets as a result of our dithering here in Canada?  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we talk about job security, we should be thinking about what in fact is happening and not some fearmongering coming from the opposition, the government  and, to some degree, from the auto industry.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is very interesting is that California has shown us technology that will  let  us meet those standards. We are  not talking about future patents or future inventions.  The technology exists right now.  California has shown us that we not only have that technology but that  it is affordable and can be installed in the average vehicle. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have a list outlining some of the material from California, but depending on which one we use and how many we use, we can get that  25% solution  by spending roughly $1,100 to $1,200 Canadian per vehicle. That money would be recouped by the savings on fuel of about $1,000 a year.   The initial capital expenditure on the purchase price could be paid off in a year or a year and half and additional dollars would be saved after that. If that technology were  put on the minivan that is assembled in Windsor, it  would open up markets in both Canada and the United States. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am quite confident in Canadian workers, whether they be engineers,   plant managers,   supervisors,   skilled tradespeople or the man  or woman working on the line.  They have the ability to do this. What we are saying is that we must make sure that the auto industry performs and  that the people who make the decisions allow this to happen.</p><A NAME="T1335"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1335"><!-- Hour: 1--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1340"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1330"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1335)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><A NAME="Int-1138738"></A><a HREF="#Int-1138742"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-1138688"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Ms. Bev Oda (Durham, CPC): </b>Mr. Speaker, I have a question for the hon. member. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is talking about voluntary and mandatory, but obviously what we all want is meaningful change to better our environment.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The department's memos indicate that Kyoto has serious problems and design weaknesses, namely, that it would not stop or even slow down global warming and fails to provide proper incentives for technologies that may transform the energy sector over the long term.  We are not just talking about our environment in Canada.  We understand that the auto industry is an international industry and marketplace, et cetera, but our air, water and environment also cross borders.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to know what the motion being proposed would  do to deal with the fact that there is nothing in the Kyoto accord that obligates developing countries to improve their environments.  Only 32% of the global emissions are currently covered under Kyoto.  What does this motion do to address the other 68%?</p><A NAME="Int-1138742"></A><a HREF="#Int-1138746"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-1138738"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Joe Comartin: </b>Mr. Speaker, the first thing I would point out is that the motion is about the auto industry.  The question has more to do with the Kyoto standards for all sectors of the economy and the whole of the environment. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In  answer to the member's basic question, I think she has missed the point regarding the motion.  The motion   is about whether we are going to approach the problem that 25% of all of the carbon dioxide being released in this country is coming out of the tailpipes of our vehicles.  Are we going to require that issue to be dealt with in a quick, efficient fashion and thereby mandate the regulations  or are we going to allow the industry to continue on as it has for the better part of this last decade by not seriously addressing this issue? That is what it is about.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coming out of this, if we do the job right  we   will begin to address emissions right across the globe because we will be developing and deploying the technology that will deal with those emissions in the undeveloped world.</p><A NAME="T1340"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1340"><!-- Hour: 1--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1345"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1335"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1340)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><A NAME="Int-1138746"></A><a HREF="#Int-1138749"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-1138742"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Hon. Larry Bagnell (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Natural Resources, Lib.): </b>Mr. Speaker, I was astonished to hear the member from the loyal opposition say that  we did not provide support for technology when the rest of her party  constantly criticizes the technology partnerships program. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have   put funds into technology related to reducing greenhouse gases, such as ethanol, renewable energies like solar and wind, and biological solutions for greenhouse gases.  Hopefully the NDP will support the money that we are   investing in renewable energies, even if the other opposition members do not.</p><A NAME="Int-1138749"></A><a HREF="#Int-1138782"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-1138746"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Joe Comartin: </b>Mr. Speaker, I have two points that I want to make in response to the hon. member's question.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, on one hand we hear about the amount of money that is going into research, but what we do not hear, because it is not happening, are  the   resources being deployed, the tax system being amended and subsidies being deployed.  We need to   deploy the technologies that we have.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I spent the last four years in the House as the environment and energy critic for my party.  Everything I learned in that process tells me that we can deal with our environmental problems with existing technology and know-how. That is not where the problem is.  We really do not need more research and development. We need to deploy the resources, the knowledge and the technology that  we already have. No one can tell me  one problem that we cannot resolve with what we already know.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point I want to make quickly is that as long as we continue to subsidize the fossil fuel industry to the tune of $1 billion to $1.5 billion a year, we are not being very serious about dealing with climate change and global warming.</p><A NAME="Int-1138782"></A><a HREF="#Int-1138877"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-1138749"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis (Winnipeg North, NDP): </b>Mr. Speaker, I am very pleased  to join my colleagues in this debate and to follow the member for Windsor—Tecumseh who gave us a very good perspective on this whole issue.  I want to thank our leader, the member for Toronto--Danforth,  and the member for Skeena—Bulkley Valley for their leadership on this very important matter of the future of the planet and for their vision in bringing forward the motion that is  before the House today.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am proud to be associated with the motion which is visionary, very decisive, substantive and I must say very timely. Given the fact that yesterday  was the day that the Kyoto protocol came into effect and given the clear revelation  that the government to this day  has no plan in place to seriously meet our targets under Kyoto, it is critically imperative that we give direction to the government on how to do just that.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is also important to note that we are debating  this matter at the same time that  the alternative federal budget was released in Ottawa. The alternative federal budget is sponsored by the Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives. For  10 or more years it has been far more accurate in predicting budget forecasts than has been the government itself with all 19 of its so-called big bank economists and forecasters.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we are going to take advice from anywhere, let us take it from the document “Alternative Federal Budget 2005: It's Time”, because as my colleague has said, the centre knows what it is doing. I cannot think of a more appropriate subject matter for relating part of that title, “It's time”, than the environment and the future of this planet.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These individuals,  who are so accurate in their forecast and so visionary in their recommendations,  clearly point us in the direction of decisive action on the environment.  The document, which is hot off the press, states  on page 55:</p>
<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td width="15" align="right"></td>
<td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>Canada's emissions of greenhouse gases are among the highest in the world on a per capita basis and are now 20% higher than our Kyoto baseline level in 1990.  Serious action--and not just more hot air--is now needed for Canada to meet its Kyoto commitments--</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Absolutely this is what is needed: action, timelines, decisive action like that outlined in our motion, not hot air, the hot air that we have seen from the Liberals over the last number of years time and time again. The document also states:</p>
<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td width="15" align="right"></td>
<td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>The environment and the economy are inextricably linked. Decisions taken in either realm will inevitably have a lasting impact on both. Unless Canada takes decisive steps to make our economy and industries more environmentally friendly, then both our environment and economy will deteriorate over the longer term.</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those are prophetic words.  I do not think anyone could disagree with those words.  We are talking not only about the future of the planet; we are talking about our economy and what kind of future we are handing over to future generations.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While we are on the topic of the alternative federal budget and the   accuracy in its forecasts, let me point out that this year the alternative federal budget is forecasting a $45 billion surplus over the next three years.  Let us remember that the alternative federal budget has been accurate over the last six years, or five budgets. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us remember that the government over those five budgets has been out $61 billion. As a result of that lowballing exercise, that is money that has disappeared, gone off as automatic payments against the debt without consideration to the huge deficit we have today in terms of human needs and our environment.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us juxtapose the $45 billion projected over the next three years with the $21 billion predicted by the Minister of Finance in his last economic forecast.  </p><A NAME="T1345"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1345"><!-- Hour: 1--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1350"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1340"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1345)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us remember that the government is pretending  to be honest in terms of this year's surplus. It has acknowledged that we are talking about a minimum of a $9 billion surplus this year, which more likely is $11 billion, but then it is prepared to slip back into its old ways of trying to pull the wool over the eyes of Canadians and give us false numbers, lowball forecasts, so in fact we end up with the exact same problem we have had for the last number of years.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canadians want accountability. They want  Parliament to ensure that first and foremost we invest in saving this planet, in dealing with building a sustainable economy for now and future generations.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to refer to the hard work of the finance committee in the prebudget process. That process was instrumental in building the case for the  motion  before us today. Some 400 groups and individuals came before us to give us their views about what needs to happen in this country. They were all clear about the importance of ensuring the survival of the planet. These people were  from all types of groups, not just environmental organizations. Everyone spoke with one voice. They know that the quality of the air we breathe and  the atmosphere in which we live affect us whether we are young or old,  in our businesses, our schools and universities, our jobs, our homes. All of it literally impacts on every aspect of our lives and the lives of our families.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to focus specifically on some of the environmental groups' presentations to our committee. We heard from so many. The Green Budget Coalition, which represents some 20 national environmental and conservation groups,  gave us an excellent report and an excellent plan of action. I want to refer to the Canadian Urban Transit Association, which represents more than 100 of Canada's public transit systems, and other organizations whose roots also extend into small and large communities right across the country. These groups described a neglected environmental situation requiring urgent attention and federal leadership. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development ranks Canada's environmental performance 28th out of 29 member industrial countries. Imagine that a country as rich as Canada,  with the kind of energy and creativity that is so obvious all around us, is  28th out of 29 industrial countries when it comes to environmental performance.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The real life impact of that record was hammered home last week in eastern Canada by an extensive off-season pollution health warning. One paper described the local scene here as “by far the worst air pollution episode since pollution measurements were first kept”. Goodness gracious, is that not enough for members opposite to act? Is that not a call to  arms when it comes to the future of the planet? Air quality was categorized as poor. Asthmatics and those with heart conditions were especially warned to exercise caution. In February, in the heart of this country, in the middle of winter, there was a smog warning of significant and serious proportions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That Canadians are faced with this situation today with a Liberal government that still claims it has been doing everything it can to improve our air quality is absolutely appalling. It is time for the Liberals  to step aside,  or to decide finally to do something. We are ready to take over and do what is necessary to ensure that the kind of plan  we have produced, the Kyoto plan and a plan to sustain our economy and build on that,  is adopted as soon as possible.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The David Suzuki Foundation reminded us that the OECD has found that Canada relies too heavily on voluntary programs and incentives and not enough on regulations and economic instruments. This is from the market friendly OECD. This is not from some left wing think tank. An organization that is concerned about the free market says that we have to do more in terms of regulations and use of economic instruments.</p><A NAME="T1350"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1350"><!-- Hour: 1--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1355"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1345"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1350)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My time is almost up and  I have barely touched the tip of the iceberg in terms of this very serious issue. I hope above all that I have left a clear message that today's motion is offered to Canadians as a constructive instrument to help ensure that  we sustain our planet, that we stop very serious health problems from  arising because of greenhouse gas emissions. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are ready to take decisive action that calls for mandatory emission standards. We cannot rely on voluntary standards because they have not worked. We cannot wait.  The situation is too dire and the needs are too urgent. We have to act now with political courage and great determination.</p><A NAME="Int-1138877"></A><a HREF="#Int-1138880"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-1138782"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Jeff Watson (Essex, CPC): </b>Mr. Speaker, we are a little more than three and a half hours into the debate on today's motion.

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is the timeline for achieving the 25% increase in fuel efficiency? Would we get existing technologies to new products quickly enough to meet that timeline, or do we need more time to hit a 25% fuel efficiency increase standard?</p><A NAME="Int-1138880"></A><a HREF="#Int-1138885"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-1138877"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis: </b>Mr. Speaker, I want the members on the Conservative side to know that  if the motion is approved, which we hope it will be, we believe it can be brought into effect almost immediately. We can move expeditiously toward the implementation of mandatory emission standards.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We believe that  will achieve the 25% target, if we are committed to doing this and we do it immediately, by the year 2012.  We are certainly in a hurry.  Time is moving on.  We do not have time to lose.  We have to do this now in order to achieve those targets in another six  or seven years.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have heard very little from the Conservatives on  any specific timelines, goals or targets in terms of dealing with the situation.  They have no plan.  Like the Liberals, not only do they refuse to accept our motion but they also have no plan, period.    They prefer to look to the past instead of to the future.  They prefer to leave it to the market to handle our future instead of taking full responsibility and  guiding us toward a future of prosperity and tremendous potential.</p><A NAME="T1355"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1355"><!-- Hour: 1--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1400"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1350"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1355)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><A NAME="Int-1138885"></A><a HREF="#Int-1138890"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-1138880"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Hon.

There is also the millennium scholarship, the biggest scholarship in Canadian history. There is also the  record health care agreement we made with the provinces.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My question is related to employment in the auto industry.  The opposition suggested that reducing emissions would be of great harm to the auto industry.  We are making the point that we are looking at autos that are sold here, not made here.  Of the autos made in Canada, 80% are exported anyway so this is not going to hurt the auto industry from our perspective.  I would like to know from the member if she thinks that her party's motion would hurt the auto industry.</p><A NAME="Int-1138890"></A><a HREF="#Int-1138894"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-1138885"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis: </b>Mr. Speaker, before I answer that  question I cannot help but respond to the member's assertion that the government has done great things such as the millennium scholarship fund.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We just heard from the Auditor General yesterday who said that $7 billion in foundations is sitting there untapped.  In terms of the scholarship fund, students are dying to get into university but cannot because the tuition is too high, and the government is allowing the foundation to sit on $690 million in interest alone because of inaction.  It could have used that money to pay the tuitions for  200,000 students.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shame on the Liberals when it comes to education. Shame on the Liberals when it comes to the environment. We have heard nothing but empty rhetoric from Liberals and no decisive plan of action.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question about the auto workers is a very important one. The parliamentary secretary   should know that we have been working with both the   environmental community and representatives of the  auto workers.  We have developed a win-win plan for climate change.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The auto sector is vital to our economy.  We have had great success and continuing that success will be based on Canadian auto producers taking the North American lead on future manufacturing, design and production.  The future of this production is green.  What would  hurt the auto dealers and the industry generally is not tax disincentives.  It would be refusing to leap at the opportunities lying open at this critical moment.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, she and her party support only one approach to helping parents care for their children while they are working. Tax cuts are not a program but a mechanism that disproportionately benefits high income parents. Where is the choice in this?</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, the Liberal approach offers real choice for parents by providing a safe, regulated, and supportive environment that incorporates early learning with care.

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I commend all the pioneers of Quebec astronomy and astrophysics, including Mr. Racine, who have made the Mont-Mégantic astrolabe a scientific research centre that responds to the aspirations of Quebeckers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To keep its research at the leading edge and to uphold the prestige of its institutions, this sector needs proper  long-term funding. The Bloc Québécois urges the federal government to support the long-term plan of the Coalition for Astronomy in the next budget in order to help astronomy flourish and retain its position as one of the world's best. </p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How can a farmer put a crop in the ground when he is not able to purchase seed for the upcoming season? </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The agricultural industry in Saskatchewan has been devastated over the past few years by factors beyond farmers' control, such as drought and frost. Farmers are expected to pay 2004 expenses with 1972 incomes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When other industries are devastated by factors outside their control, the government has been there to bail them out. The airline industry and the tourism industry in Toronto are perfect examples of this. Is it so unreasonable to expect that agriculture would benefit from similar assistance when it is racked by factors outside its control?</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Conservative Party has urged the government to drop the cash on deposit requirements for CAIS. This will free up a large amount of cash and do much to allow farmers to pay off their debts and purchase seed for a new crop year.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I urge the government to move quickly on a plan before the spring seeding. Do what is right to help save rural Saskatchewan.</p>

The government claims to be interested in increasing the numbers of Canadians involved in physical activity, yet Sport Canada seems to be uninterested in helping thousands of Canadians who are already very active in a sport they love. We already have the ball fields, teams, coaches and leagues in place.  How much does it cost to run a tournament?</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would ask that your honour consider this matter, review the blues and perhaps be more judicious in permitting questions which clearly are out of order coming from government members.</p><A NAME="T1505"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1505"><!-- Hour: 3--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1510"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1500"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1505)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><A NAME="Int-1139485"></A><a HREF="#Int-1139487"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-1139477"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Hon. Tony Valeri (Leader of the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.): </b>Mr. Speaker, I would like to comment. I sense a little  sensitivity across the way.  I am just wondering whether the hon. member took the time to make his point, which was I think rather a point of debate. In any event, when hon. members in the House ask questions of ministers, they often do so in contrasting what is being said in the House and at the same time ensuring that their questions are reflective of the administrative duties of ministers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Speaker, I certainly expect that while you are reviewing this  you will do so in a way that reflects your great judgment, as in the past.</p><A NAME="Int-1139487"></A><a HREF="#Int-1139489"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-1139485"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Speaker: </b>I appreciate this merciless buttering up on the part of the government House leader, but I do not mind saying that I did listen to the question. It seems to me that the Minister of Justice does have administrative responsibility for the bill that is currently before the House dealing with the issue that he was asked about.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know that the member for Calgary Southeast probably did not like the fact that the question was phrased in such a way as to ask the minister to comment specifically on arguments advanced by the Leader of the Opposition, and he, of course, was keen to answer the question himself, but it was not directed to him. As I said at the time, I could understand his enthusiasm. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the question was asked of the Minister of Justice and it seems to me that it is within the administrative competence of the government to answer questions about legal matters concerning bills in Parliament, particularly the Minister of Justice.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am having trouble finding anything on which I could hang a hat to support the argument of the member for Calgary Southeast that this question was out of order. I did consider the matter because there was a lot of yelling at the time suggesting that perhaps the question was out of order. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While it may have been unpopular, I am not sure that it is improper to ask the Minister of Justice about legal arguments concerning a bill before the House of Commons. For that reason, I allowed the question to proceed and the minister to give his answer, despite the enthusiasm of the Leader of the Opposition for answering the question.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I appreciate the good advice from the hon. member for Calgary Southeast as always, and of course I will bear his comments in mind in future. However, I think in this case the question was in order, but of course I am always glad to hear his argument.</p>

<h5 align="center"><i>[Privilege]</i></h5><A NAME="Int-1139501"></A><a HREF="#Int-1139529"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-1139498"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George—Peace River, CPC): </b>Mr. Speaker, I rise on a question of privilege to charge the Minister of International Trade and the Minister of Foreign Affairs with contempt for misrepresenting and dismissing the role of this House.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As you are aware, Mr. Speaker, on Tuesday, February 15, the House defeated Bill C-31, an act to establish the Department of International Trade and to make related amendments to certain acts. The House also defeated Bill C-32, an act the amend the Department of Foreign Affairs and International Trade Act and to make consequential amendments to other acts.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill C-31 proposed to establish the Department of International Trade and Bill C-32 proposed to amend the Department of Foreign Affairs and International Trade Act and other acts as a consequence of the proposal from Bill C-31 to establish the Department of International Trade. I use the word “proposed” because, as we know, until Parliament establishes or amends an act, the act is not established or amended.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government or the two responsible ministers have dismissed the legislative process.  The trade minister is quoted in the <i>Globe and Mail</i> as saying:</p>
<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td width="15" align="right"></td>
<td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>I was disappointed [the Conservatives] went against what they said they were going to do, but having said that, we are continuing to work head on.</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The article also goes on to report:</p>
<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td width="15" align="right"></td>
<td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>Trade Minister...yesterday shrugged off the defeat of a bill that would create a new international trade department separate from the Department of Foreign Affairs, saying the two branches of government will continue to operate independently without Parliament's blessing.</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The <i>Ottawa Citizen</i> reported the minister as saying:</p>
<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td width="15" align="right"></td>
<td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>We're not going to undo all the work we have done to become a functioning department.</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The minister's comments show total disregard and disrespect for the role of the House.  If the House is to function with authority and dignity, then it must be respected, especially by its own members, and particularly by the cabinet  which is responsible to it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While such disrespect is not new, the severity of this case is.  Speakers have warned the government in the past for its dismissive view of Parliament.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am very certain that the government will rise, be unapologetic and claim that it has the authority to do what it is doing.   However,  that is not the point. Why would the government introduce legislation pretending that it matters when it does not?  Then, when the outcome is not favourable to it, the government ignores the outcome. The government is making a mockery of Parliament. What is the public to think?  The passage or defeat of bills does not matter. Parliament does not matter.   Members of this House are irrelevant.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is all that matters, what decisions are made in the PMO?  What happened to the Prime Minister who wanted to end the practice of getting things done based on who  one knew  in the PMO? What happened to the Prime Minister who wanted to slay the democratic deficit? His ministers have just bankrupted democracy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to submit a ruling from October 10, 1989, on a similar matter.  While it was a similar matter in comparison to the case I am presenting today, it was less offensive, I conclude. Notwithstanding, Speaker Fraser took it very seriously. The issue was regarding an advertisement put out by the government which made it appear, and I stress the word “appear”, that the GST was approved by Parliament before Parliament actually approved it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of Bill C-31 and Bill C-32, there is no appearance.  The government has already implemented the measures in Bill C-31 and Bill C-32.  The bills have been defeated, and that outcome has been ignored.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Getting back to Speaker Fraser's ruling, the Speaker quoted the former member for Windsor West, the Right Hon. Herb Gray.  Mr. Gray said:</p>
<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td width="15" align="right"></td>
<td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>When this advertisement--says in effect there will be a new tax on January 1, 1991,--the advertisement is intended to convey the idea that Parliament has acted on it because that is, I am sure, the ordinary understanding of Canadians about how a tax like this is finally adopted and comes into effect. That being the case, it is clearly a contempt of Parliament because it amounts to a misrepresentation of the role of this House.</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I mentioned, the case I am presenting to the Speaker today goes beyond appearance. If that is not offensive enough, the attitude of the Minister of International Trade and his intentions and the intentions of the Minister of Foreign Affairs to forge ahead are grounds enough for contempt. Where is the respect for the institution of Parliament?  How can a minister of the Crown, who is responsible to the House, show such disregard and disrespect?</p><A NAME="T1515"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1515"><!-- Hour: 3--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1520"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1510"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1515)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While the Speaker in 1989 did not rule a prima facie question of privilege, he did say this:</p>
<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td width="15" align="right"></td>
<td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>I want the House to understand very clearly that if your Speaker ever has to consider a situation like this again, the Chair will not be as generous.</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would argue that the situation I am presenting today is very much like the situation from 1989.  The obvious difference is that it is far worse.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not understand why this sort of situation has not been addressed in the past.  This government has a sordid past in these matters, and because the House has never dealt adequately with it, the government continues to make a mockery of Parliament. It has now gone to new heights and has taken it to a point where it can no longer be ignored.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To illustrate this point let me review some of the past disrespectful acts of the Liberal government.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On March 30, 1998, the minister of international trade sent out a press release announcing the establishment of a Canada-China interparliamentary group. At that time there was no Canada-China interparliamentary group.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government named the head of the Canadian Millennium Scholarship Foundation before there was even legislation to set up the foundation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was another case presented to the Speaker on October 28, 1997, relating to the actions of the Department of Finance.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On February 3, 1998, I raised a question of privilege condemning the government for its dismissive views of Parliament on a matter regarding the Canadian Wheat Board.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These complaints resulted in many warnings from the Chair, Mr. Speaker.  One of the warnings came from Speaker Parent on November 6, 1997.  It was as strong as Speaker Fraser's warning and it went like this:</p>
<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td width="30" align="right"></td>
<td><small>--the Chair acknowledges that this is a matter of potential importance since it touches the role of members as legislators, a role which should not be trivialized. It is from this perspective that the actions of the Department of Finance are of some concern....This dismissive view of the legislative process, repeated often enough, makes a mockery of our parliamentary conventions and practices....I trust that today's decision at this early stage of the 36th Parliament will not be forgotten by the minister and his officials and that the departments and agencies will be guided by it. </small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If a warning from the Speaker is to mean something, then the Speaker must be prepared to follow through with it.  The Speaker's job is to ensure the House is given the opportunity to protect its authority and dignity.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I ask that you,  Mr. Speaker, rule this matter to be a prima facie question of privilege at which time I will be prepared to move the appropriate motion.</p><A NAME="Int-1139529"></A><a HREF="#Int-1139544"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-1139501"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Ms. Libby Davies (Vancouver East, NDP): </b>Mr. Speaker, on the same question of privilege.  I thank the House leader for the opposition for raising this  because the NDP has a  similar sentiment.   </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These two bills were defeated by a democratic vote in the House a couple of days ago.  Now we have read that the two ministers and departments in question are going to go ahead anyway. This completely disregards the vote held in  the House, and it is a very serious question.  Surely it gets to the fundamental premise of why we are here in this place.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was  point of order before you this morning, Mr. Speaker, about something that happened in committee, and about how things can become frustrating.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A vote in the House is a definitive act.   The most basic thing we do in this place is vote on a bill either yea or nay.  When those two bills were defeated, it was the voice of Parliament speaking.  For the two ministers in question to basically thumb their noses at Parliament is a matter of contempt.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would urge you,  Mr. Speaker,  to take this question seriously.  This is a minority Parliament.  This is a Parliament where we take our business very seriously in terms of working together and being constructive.  We expect to see the kind of respect and the  proper consequences as a result of  a vote taken place in the House.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a serious matter.  For the reasons I just gave, it should be reviewed by the Speaker, a decision made and followed up.  </p><A NAME="Int-1139544"></A><a HREF="#Int-1139546"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-1139529"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Hon. Tony Valeri (Leader of the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.): </b>Mr. Speaker, I am sure my hon. colleague, the House leader for the official opposition, was in question period when I said that the government was presently considering other parliamentary options to present to the House. Presently, both departments are working under the parliamentary sanction of the appropriations act.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More specific, I would draw to the hon. member's attention that in the 2004-05 main estimates, again the estimates voted by Parliament, there is specific moneys earmarked for the specific function of the two ministers and those two departments.  The moneys were voted specifically for their function.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would just draw the member's attention both on the general summary, item 10, for foreign affairs and international trade;  foreign affairs, which is money appropriated for that purpose. Item 17 in the general summary, again, international trade, dollars were voted for by this Parliament specifically for the continued operation of those two departments.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would not at any point in time want to suggest to the House, nor to my colleagues, that the defeat of both Bill C-31 and Bill C-32 are in any way being disregarded.  They are not.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I clearly stated in question period  that we were presently looking at other parliamentary options to bring back to this House.

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am Parliament's first auto worker by profession.  I understand this industry in a way that is entirely unique.  I understand by firsthand experience the human face of our decisions in Parliament. I know what it is like to live and work day after day, year after year, with the anxiety of job insecurity.

I see their faces, I know their families, and I take their future seriously.  I vowed to fight for their jobs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think about the communities I serve, built with the tax dollars of auto workers.  I think of the institutions that serve our communities, funded through agencies like the United Way, by the generous giving of auto workers.  I think of the union members that work to build the community and preserve auto jobs, and how their political cousins in the NDP have ignored some of their most important advice on Kyoto. This motion before us today will hurt, not help, auto jobs and the communities they support in Canada.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The motion would regulate fuel efficiency improvements in all classes of light duty vehicles sold in Canada. I will give credit where credit is deserved.  The fuel efficiency standard by weight class is a better standard than the Liberal government has been pursuing, a standard averaged across the fleet.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the motion before us today does not provide Canadians with the information they need to make a real informed choice on this matter. The NDP has left out a target, a timeline and a full accounting of all the costs.  It is not just health costs that are talked about in this motion, but the costs of programs, industry costs, threats to jobs and the loss to community institutions if those high paying jobs leave our communities for foreign labour markets.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What the NDP should really tell Canadians is that it wants a 25% increase in fuel efficiency to make the 2010 averaging year under Kyoto.  It hopes to achieve this without the U.S. and Mexico partnering in a common standard.  It further hopes to achieve this while maintaining auto jobs and investing in a Canada that has lost virtually all of its comparative advantages against other global manufacturing jurisdictions, and without  losing further market share to foreign auto manufacturers who have environmental cost comparative advantages on us. This is entirely unrealistic.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The NDP member for Skeena—Bulkley Valley, who I have a lot of respect for and spoke earlier this morning in defence of this motion, said at the environment committee this week that in business he would never forget a target or timeline.  It makes it impossible to get where one needs to go. In proposing the motion before us today, his party forgot both.  We need a target and a timeline, but we need the right target and the right timeline.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 25% fuel efficiency improvement by 2010 is a good target and timeline if we had started immediately in 1995.  That is what Japan and the European Union did.  It makes cost abatement for the industry easier and gave both Japan and Europe  a comparative advantage against Canadian manufacturers in the move to a carbon constrained economy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In all fairness, the NDP is not to blame for this.  This is the fault of the Liberal government.  It has dithered rather than delivered on significant tax measures and signals to industry and consumers to usher in the green economy.  The Liberals have squandered five crucial years on negotiating a fuel efficiency standard to bring new technologies into current vehicle production and allow automakers to spread out their costs to do this.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To remedy this deficiency, I recommend that the government add the five years it has squandered to the 2010 timeline for lost opportunities.  The NDP motion insists on compounding Liberal mistakes with the great mistake of adhering to a 2010 average timeline instead of a 2015 timeline. Further, the NDP motion insists on 25% improvement without telling Canadians what it will cost them to get there.  </p><A NAME="T1530"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1530"><!-- Hour: 3--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1535"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1525"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1530)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I suspect when it comes to the auto industry and fuel efficiency regulations for Kyoto commitments, the NDP is afraid of taxpayer sticker shock. There are additional and more hidden costs: more jobs lost, lower tax revenues to all levels of government to fund social programs, more strain on programs like EI, and fewer charitable dollars for community programs. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With 180,000 Canadians, including tens of thousands in my communities employed in auto manufacturing and parts jobs, and a further 350,000 in related sectors from dealerships to financial services to transport, we cannot gamble with people's lives over implementing Kyoto. We must  get it right.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A further deficiency in the NDP motion is that it ignores the North American integrated market. The motion proposes fuel efficiency regulations for vehicles sold in Canada. Only 20% of vehicles built in Canada are sold in Canada; 80% are sold to the U.S. and Mexico. Canada imports most of the vehicle supplies from the U.S., so the NDP motion, if adopted, is a pyrrhic victory  for the slayers of climate change because if acted upon it will have a negligible impact on reducing greenhouse gas levels toward Kyoto commitments.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To make a real impact across the Canadian fleet, U.S. automakers would need to incorporate the same fuel efficiency standards for vehicle exports to Canada. With the Canadian market so small for vehicle sales, there is no prospect for the redesign and retooling costs to accommodate such a standard being recouped by U.S. automakers. If my NDP colleagues do not believe me, perhaps they will consider this from Buzz Hargrove. I call it a Buzz word of wisdom: “It's unrealistic to think that automakers will engineer unique vehicles just for the Canadian market--”. The only other option is to restrict products to the Canadian market and consumers will not tolerate a lack of vehicle choice.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We already have tremendous disharmony with the United States, and Mexico too, on regulatory standards that hurt our competitiveness in attracting and retaining auto investment. Mexico has capitalized on this to become a serious export competitor to Canada  by supplying U.S. markets. China will become the next serious export competitor. We need more regulatory harmony to keep and compete for auto jobs and investment in Canada.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here is where the Liberal government has also failed the test. It has already squandered five years to negotiate a fuel efficiency standard to move new technologies into new vehicles. It has spent a marathon 21 days negotiating with Canadian auto manufacturers on a proposed fuel efficiency standard. Thankfully it has failed to deliver.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A sensible understanding of the integrated North American market means a fuel efficiency standard must be achieved commonly with the U.S. and Mexico. Sadly, the Liberal government has squandered so much credibility and clout with the U.S. President and congress by its toleration of anti-Americanism that it could not ensure the U.S. would join us in Kyoto to level the auto investment playing field. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I doubt whether it could bring them to the table to negotiate a common North American fuel efficiency standard that moves us to lower greenhouse gas emissions. Nevertheless, I recommend it does so immediately so our domestic producers can share Kyoto costs and reposition our North American market from slow integrators of environmental technologies to overcome the comparative disadvantage versus Japan in the EU in the move to a carbon-constrained economy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not only should the government add five years to the 2010 timeline for its slow start with domestic auto producers to bring technologies on stream, it must add the additional delay to negotiate  a common North American fuel efficiency standard. It will be well worth it though when we move together to regain the global lead in auto technologies, and if the Liberal government cannot achieve it then the people will have to elect a Conservative government to get the job done right.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our NDP colleagues across the way would do well to support collaboration with the U.S. and Mexico. Consider a further Buzz word of wisdom: “Our strategy for improving fuel efficiency must be implemented carefully and thoughtfully, with fuel efficiency standards set in concert with those of U.S. and Mexico”. The motion before us today should have recognized this. It does not.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, the NDP motion before us today fails to account for the fragile position of Canadian auto manufacturers in a globally competitive industry or the opportunities that their environmental regulation creates for foreign labour markets and automakers to seize our markets and end our jobs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Global auto production has become fiercely competitive for a myriad of reasons. Automakers in Asia and Europe have gained considerable market share and the traditional big three employers are in a financially precarious position heading into the new green economy. Auto investment decisions that affect Canadian jobs and communities are made in Stuttgart, Germany; Dearborn, Michigan; and Tokyo, Japan, not in Canada. </p><A NAME="T1535"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1535"><!-- Hour: 3--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1540"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1530"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1535)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past six years Canada's cost advantages have virtually disappeared. Kyoto means additional cost pressures to auto production in Canada from higher energy costs, higher costs for steel, plastics and chemicals because they come from energy intensive sectors, and increased costs for trucking vehicles to markets and parts to assembly.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The NDP motion today proposes that vehicles sold in Canada should incorporate technologies for higher fuel efficiency. While Toyota and Honda are at or within reach of incorporating these technologies, the big three manufacturers will face higher costs to comply which they fund from the sale of trucks, minivans and SUVs. While the NDP motion will--</p><A NAME="Int-1139582"></A><a HREF="#Int-1139584"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-1139567"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Acting Speaker (Hon.

Bryon Wilfert (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of the Environment, Lib.): </b>Madam Speaker, if I understood the hon. member correctly, and I am sure that he would want to clarify it for the House,  he suggested that somehow Canada was responsible for the United States not signing on to Kyoto.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The United States acts in its national interest.  We act in our national interest. The United States did not sign the Ottawa convention.  It did not sign the small arms treaty. It has not signed on with regard to International Criminal Court. The fact is it was not Canada's decision. Canada makes its own decisions and the United States makes its own decisions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The member suggested somehow that we have not done anything.  I want to again dispel in the House the notion that $3.7 billion has been assigned.  In fact, we talk about the $250 million for the green municipal funds, the $1.7 billion in terms of technology and innovation.  We talk about public education.  We talk about climate science, all of these things that are necessary in a broad approach.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the member suggests that nothing has been done, a lot of things have been done in collaboration  with various stakeholders across the country including cities and the provinces.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even though the United States has not signed on, 42 states are moving toward Kyoto targets. Therefore, I would like him to clarify his suggestion that the Americans have done nothing and that it is our fault.</p><A NAME="Int-1139624"></A><a HREF="#Int-1139631"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-1139584"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Jeff Watson: </b>Mr.  Speaker, the hon. member opposite does a lot of linguistic gymnastics. Let me clarify for the House. I said that the federal government has bungled the relationship with the United States and could not exert the proper influence to ensure that the United States would come on board with regard to Kyoto.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Canadian government does not have  the proper leadership, the clout or the ability to curry favour with the United States or Mexico in order to bring them into some discussions or negotiations on fuel efficiency standard that would be continental wide.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is important that we have a continental wide standard.  We do not have 42 states yet that have the standard.  They may be moving toward it or looking at it or whatever, but we need to move in concert.  That is what Buzz Hargrove has said.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is reasonable to assume that if a continent that is out of step with Europe and Asia, and needs to compete with Europe and Asia to overcome a comparative disadvantage, that it do so in concert, and not segment the market further into chunks. We want a whole market, a whole standard that will allow us to not only compete but to overtake Europe and Asia in this regard. </p><A NAME="Int-1139631"></A><a HREF="#Int-1139634"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-1139624"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Nathan Cullen (Skeena—Bulkley Valley, NDP): </b>Madam Chair, I am disappointed the hon. member did not get to finish his speech.  I was looking forward to the conclusion and summation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The harmonization aspect that he is talking about is exactly what we are looking at. When we have California, New York, Maine, Washington and a number of other states starting to sign up, we start to look at 50% of the auto market.  This is harmonization. Having George Bush at the table would not help us.  It is not controlled at the federal level.  It is controlled at the state level.  This is what harmonization is about.  This is the market that we are going toward.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Buzz Hargrove also supported our green auto policy. We are going outside the focus and  mission of the motion that has been put forward by our party today which is the debate between mandatory, which we are suggesting and which the critic for the member's party has also agreed with, versus the optional system that the Liberals have been pushing for years without any results.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question I have for my hon. colleague, for whom I have great esteem, is this. Is he in support of mandatory emissions standards? If so, why not support this motion? That is what it specifically calls for.</p><A NAME="T1540"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1540"><!-- Hour: 3--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1545"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1535"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1540)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><A NAME="Int-1139634"></A><a HREF="#Int-1139638"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-1139631"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Jeff Watson: </b>Madam Speaker, the direction with respect to my comments, very clearly, has been to indicate that this is not simply a debate with no context.  The motion does have some context.       The party opposite has a position with respect to what the fuel efficiency standards should be and what the timelines should be.  Those are important things to consider, but whether they are  workable and realistic is something else. The motion, however,  does not go into any of those details.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, I think some details would have been pertinent to pushing the government in the direction in which it needs to go because it has really bungled this.  A lot of time has been lost and it could have delivered something. Time is ticking away.  We need to have specifics, not abstract debates.</p><A NAME="Int-1139638"></A><a HREF="#Int-1139736"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-1139634"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Bob Mills (Red Deer, CPC): </b>Madam Speaker, it is a privilege to speak to the motion today and to clarify something for the NDP critic.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I appreciate the motion today but I have one problem with   the word “mandatory”. I do not feel that mandatory demonstrates a cooperative approach, the  approach we have to use  if we want to achieve this kind of work with our industries and with Canadians.  What we are lacking is a long term plan and a vision. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members on the  other side have talked about how much the government has done and what a wonderful record it has in terms of the environment.  We need to continually remind them what the environment commissioner said in her last six reports, that the government talks a lot but accomplishes very little.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We need to remind them that when the OECD looked at 24 of the  top industrialized countries it said that  Canada rated at the very bottom, that it was 24 out of 24.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We need to remind them that there are over 300 boil water warnings at any given time in Canada.  Who would have thought that Canada, that pristine, clean place that many of our international friends think we have, would have 300 boil water warnings?  One  might   attribute that  to some poorly developed countries, but not to Canada.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cities are dumping raw sewage into the oceans.  Landfills are spewing waste which is entering into aquafirs and spreading into our waters.    We have   brownfields in every city and  about  50,000 contaminated sites in Canada. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have  a Kyoto plan to which we have committed to   6% below 1990 levels. The member mentioned that we have committed $3.7 billion.  Let us examine that $3.7 billion.  Canada committed to 6% below 1990 levels. By 2000 we were 20% above 1990 levels and today we are 30% above. That $3.7 billion went down the drain with nothing to show for it.  If that is accomplishment in the eyes of the Liberals, then they are the only ones thinking that way.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The big problem with this whole environmental issue is that the government does not have a plan nor does it have a vision.  It does not know how to deal with water or the whole issue of air pollution.  A major battle is going on between NRCan and environment. They  are more interested in protecting their turf  and fighting with each other than they are with accomplishing anything.  I hope that will change soon and that we  will be the ones  to do that.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An important point to mention to our NDP friends is that cooperation rather than confrontation will get them a lot further.  Industry knows it is good to be green. Industry understands what that means.  It is good for business.  All of the ads for Ford,   DaimlerChrysler,   GM and  Toyota talk about being green.     It should not be a big stretch to sit down and work with them and show them a vision. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As my colleague mentioned, had this been done in 1992 when climate change was first identified as a problem, we would be a lot further down the track  than we are here in the last weeks of Kyoto  trying to accomplish something. Those guys just do not know where they are going, and that   is the most important point.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What has been mentioned in  today's debate is   that this is a global market.  No longer are we isolated into planning for one country.    We cannot isolate ourselves from our number one trading partner.  There are $1.4 billion a day  crossing the border.  Like it or not, that is the reality of Canada.  One in four jobs, and in some places higher than that, depend on that. We  work in a cooperative manner to accomplish something, and that is what this is all about.</p><A NAME="T1545"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1545"><!-- Hour: 3--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1550"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1540"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1545)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was working on the Sumas 2 project in the Fraser Valley, looking at the building of a power plant right on the B.C.-Washington border.  After spending  time in that community I realized just how bad the  pollution was.  That is the second most polluted smog belt in Canada. The first is in southern Ontario, which I have visited as well.  We realize that Canadians want us to deal with the smog and pollution problem.  It is only common sense.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have  higher incidences of asthma and other  health problems associated with pollution.  Industry understands that.  People understand that.  The only ones who do not seem to understand are  the government members across the way. Instead, they sign  an international agreement with targets that they have no idea how they might achieve.  Their solution will  be to send the money offshore, buy that hot air wherever they can find it, instead of dealing with the technological solutions that we could find here in Canada.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I really believe  Canadians  want us to deal with the smog problem,  the smog days in Toronto, in Ottawa and in the Fraser Valley, which  is caused by sulphur dioxide, nitrous oxide, particulate matter and  surface ozone.   </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is the government doing?  The government is attacking carbon dioxide.  The government is thinking about, believe it or not, making CO<sub>2</sub> a toxic substance and regulating it under CEPA.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CO<sub>2</sub> is a plant food.  CO<sub>2</sub> is what we give off as animals.  CO<sub>2</sub> is what one pumps into   a greenhouse to get  more plant growth.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Technology is moving quickly.  There is the  sequestering of CO<sub>2</sub>.  I saw a situation where a plant in Denmark was capturing the CO<sub>2</sub>, gasifying the CO<sub>2</sub> and  selling it in tanks to greenhouses to pump into the greenhouses.  It was also being sent to Norway to pump down oil wells to increase the removal of oil and gas by 30%.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What are we doing in Canada?  We are using water, pure  clean water and  pumping it down wells.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are so many things that the government could show some leadership in and yet it is basically doing nothing.  We are signing an international agreement and we have no plan.  We are going to send the money off and companies that  would have liked to have cooperated on a plan will not be able to.  They will be deprived of that money for research and development and all of those good things on which   we could become leaders.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is the government occupied with now?  Again, we have the players of Environment Canada and NRCan having a battle over whether  it is a poison or not. I do not know, but I know my background in biology would certainly have a difficult time finding CO<sub>2</sub> to be classified as a poison by anyone.  Anyone who understands photosynthesis would know how important  CO<sub>2</sub> is to life.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We need to move forward technologically.  We need to look at hybrid vehicles.  We need to look at fleet vehicles, using natural gas, using various forms of hybrids or  using propane.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government could be doing so many things but  what is it preoccupied with?  It is going to force the auto industry into some kind of regulations that in fact will handicap them.  The end result will be  auto jobs here in Ontario will be lost. There is no other answer to that.</p><A NAME="T1550"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1550"><!-- Hour: 3--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1555"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1545"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1550)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the government had    sat down with the auto industry 10 years ago and   told the industry what had to be done, told the industry what happened in Rio  and what was in the Kyoto accord, then maybe together they could have come up with a solution.    Instead, it  holds a hammer over the industry's head, the hammer of mandatory regulations,   with no help and  no other solutions.  That is just not the way to go.  We have learned that and we have seen that.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Companies  do have an option.  They have the option to leave Canada, to leave Ontario  where those jobs are.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I could take a lot longer to elaborate on the environmental hazards of what the government is doing.</p><A NAME="Int-1139736"></A><a HREF="#Int-1139746"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-1139638"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Joe Comartin (Windsor—Tecumseh, NDP): </b>Madam Speaker, I want  to take issue with my colleague from Alberta because he criticized some of the comments our environment critic made with regard to his support on the mandatory regulation of standards.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Elizabeth May, the   executive director of the Sierra Club, in reference     to a survey done over  the course of the last election, to  which that member responded,  said that one of the biggest surprises they had was his commitment to regulate fuel economy and “abandoning the voluntary approach”.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During  the same period of time,   five days before the last election,   Simon  Tuck and Greg Keenan from the <i>Globe and Mail</i> said that  the Conservatives “were abandoning the voluntary approach with regard to fuel economy and emissions and were going to the mandatory”.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wonder if he could tell us, in terms of his opening comments to our environment critic this afternoon, what  his position is.  Is he in favour of mandatory or is he opposed to it?</p><A NAME="Int-1139746"></A><a HREF="#Int-1139760"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-1139736"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Bob Mills: </b>Madam Speaker, I sort of feel like the Prime Minister today.  He gets quoted and all those things.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We sit down with the industry and   we  take the fuels. What we were  talking about were fuel cells,   the hybrid vehicles and what the auto industry could  do.  For instance, when we go up a hill we use six cylinders, when we go down a hill we use two cylinders.  If we were to ask the industry to put regulations on those   kinds  of things, I am sure, if they are intelligent regulations that will make the industry competitive wherever it went, then   the industry would agree to them.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The whole idea is to work with the companies, put the regulations in which then  keeps out foreign competitors who will not agree to those kind of things. Those are the kind of off the shelf technologies that, yes, we can regulate and we can control.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those members  can imply that is massive regulation  that  would  put all  Canadian businesses out of business, which  is probably what they would do, but how do they equate that with their union buddies when they talk about throwing these regulations on and having that industry leave the country? How do they stand   in front of  auto workers and tell them that sort of thing? </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must work with them   and put in those kinds of regulations with which  they agree.</p><A NAME="Int-1139760"></A><a HREF="#Int-1139773"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-1139746"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Hon. Peter Adams (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Human Resources and Skills Development, Lib.): </b>Madam Speaker, with respect to my colleague's remarks, I suspect   that anything can be a poison if  it is taken at the wrong time, in  the wrong place or in the wrong quantity.    However he is talking about smog.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am the member for Peterborough which  is downwind of the general Toronto area. Many years ago, smog was a phenomenon of downtown Toronto.  It no longer is.  The air in downtown Toronto is quite clean.  It moved out to the suburbs and for quite a long time  there was smog in the suburbs.  However, today  in Ontario, where I live,  on several occasions  the peak smog, the peak pollution has been in Peterborough and villages like Omemee and Lakefield, places which perhaps my colleague does not know.  These are tiny rural communities.  One of the reasons for that is  that we are downwind of Highway 401. Ground level ozone, which he mentioned and which he knows is a poison, now develops around our lakes where we have cottages and things of this type.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know he is tied to the oil industry, but would it not be better   environmentally and better economically for the oil industry, which he so well represents, to use oil as  a base in the petrochemical industry rather than simply burning it and polluting the environment?</p><A NAME="T1555"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1555"><!-- Hour: 3--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1600"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1550"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1555)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><A NAME="Int-1139773"></A><a HREF="#Int-1139861"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-1139760"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Bob Mills: </b>Madam Speaker, in reality maybe I understand a little   what it is like to be a Quebecker and how people sometimes trash them. It is a little bit like that being an Albertan; just because a person is an Albertan, somehow he or she is  hooked to the oil industry. I have never worked for that industry. I have never had anything to do with it. I have no connections with it, so I really do not know what the member is talking about. That is the problem; people just assume things. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reality is, I believe, that the future of technology is fantastic. Whether it is wind, whether it is solar, or  whether it is geothermal, biomass and ultimately hydrogen, that is where we have to end up. When we do that, we will preserve the oil and gas industry by doing value added things with it, such as  pharmaceuticals, fertilizers and  petrochemicals of various kinds. That is where the oil industry's future is, certainly not burning it in cars.</p><A NAME="Int-1139861"></A><a HREF="#Int-1139898"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-1139773"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Peter Stoffer (Sackville—Eastern Shore, NDP): </b>Madam Speaker,  I will be splitting my time with the hon. member for Winnipeg Centre.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam Speaker, I thank my hon. colleague from Skeena—Bulkley Valley very much for bringing forward today's motion, which is very important not only for today's society but for our children's future.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I keep hearing from other sides of the House about the cost.  What is the cost of all of this?  The cost right now is 16,000 lives in this country every year. The cost is hundreds of millions of dollars in medical treatments for people with asthma, breathing problems and  lung problems.  There are two words that come to mind which as a kid growing up I had never heard of.  One is Pulmicort and the other is Symbicort. I use Symbicort now.  It is a puffer, an inhaler used by   people with bronchial or asthmatic problems.  My daughter has one as well.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not recollect seeing very many children with heavy breathing problems when I was attending school.  There may have been one or two in the whole school with asthma and who  required specific medical attention, but it was very rare.  Many children now have breathing problems.  Today's motion will not cure it all, but it will go a long way in clearing the air for many generations down the road.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cost of not doing something is death.  That is what will happen if we sit idle in the House and expel more hot air at each other, if we sit on our hands and say we cannot do anything because of all of these other factors. The debate is over now. It is time we took the bull by the horns and worked with everyone to get this thing done.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was very pleased to attend a conference which  the hon. member for Red Deer held a few months ago with a congresswoman from California.  She told us how she had fought for years in the halls of the California legislature in order  to get mandatory legislation on car emissions in that state to be the best and strictest in North America.  Eventually she won her argument.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She came to Canada and the hon. member for Red Deer, a member  of the official opposition, invited us to a presentation she was making. I had assumed by that invitation   to see her that quite possibly the hon. member for Red Deer  was interested in what she was saying, having no idea that members of his own party would say that what she was saying really had no merit at all. If that  woman could pursue that and have  the state of California accept  the toughest emission controls in North America, we in Canada should be able to follow suit fairly quickly.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am very proud to be a member  of the  New Democratic Party which  has worked with labour, industry and environmental groups to develop a green car strategy, and which we released prior to the last election. It is a successful program.  New Democrats had this idea.  It is free.  The government can take it and run with it.  We know it is a success.  We know it will create jobs now and in the future.  We think this is the way to go.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am rather concerned about the Conservatives always switching the debate over to the government's lack of responsibility on what it has done on things like Kyoto. I want to remind the Conservatives that everything they were against before, they now seem to support. In the flag debate 40 years ago, the Conservatives voted against the new flag.  They voted against medicare.  They vote against everything that members in the NDP have pushed for and which  Canadians wish to have.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tommy Douglas was hung in effigy when he brought in medicare in  Saskatchewan. He has been inducted into the Canadian Medical Hall of Fame.  When Ed Schreyer brought public auto insurance to Manitoba, people screamed and yelled and said that it could not be done, that it was against their rights.  Now Manitobans love public auto insurance.</p><A NAME="T1600"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1600"><!-- Hour: 4--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1605"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1555"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1600)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today in debate the Conservatives said that they were concerned about day care, that they did not like public day care and that the money should be given to the parents. They are right in that regard. Parents should have more money in order to make the choices they want. Then they said that  $5 billion was not enough for day care. We in the NDP are really stymied  as to exactly where they stand. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If and when day care gets in, which cannot happen fast enough for members of  the NDP, I can guarantee that 20 years from now, Conservatives, if there are any left in this land, will stand up and defend day care. I can just see it again.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is one other thing. The Conservatives  talk about a free vote on the issue of same sex marriage. They blame the Liberals for not allowing a free vote for members of  cabinet. I remind them that Mr. Mulroney, during the abortion debate, ordered his cabinet to vote a certain way and allowed the backbenchers to vote freely. It is amazing how quickly the Conservatives can forget their own history and move on to other issues.</p><A NAME="Int-1139898"></A><a HREF="#Int-1139901"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-1139861"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Kevin Sorenson: </b>Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of order.  I have listened to the member, for whom I usually have a great deal of respect, and  his speech has nothing to do with the motion. He has talked about same sex marriage.

He has talked about everything except the motion.</p><A NAME="Int-1139901"></A><a HREF="#Int-1139902"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-1139898"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Acting Speaker (Hon.

I appreciate the comments of the  hon. member, who did not want to stick around to hear that.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are talking about a very serious issue of mandatory regulations on auto emissions. We have said it should be 25%. It could probably be a lot higher, but we have said  it should be 25%. We did not put a date on it because we want the government to make it mandatory and tell  the industry what the target is and  ask industry when conceivably  it can be done and ask industry what it needs in order to do it. That is the whole essence of the motion.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We encourage the Conservatives to vote for the motion. If they are against the Liberals on all the other arguments, that is fine, but they should vote with us on this one. They should show once and for all that they truly are against the Liberals on this one. The reality is that  their own environment critic indicated support for mandatory controls. He said it twice. Are they now saying that the  Conservative Party's environment critic was wrong prior to the election? Was it an election ploy maybe? The fact is he said it not once, but twice. We only assume that somebody in the shadow cabinet would be able to speak clearly on whether something is mandatory or voluntary. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When it comes to the government, we would not have to have this debate today if the Liberals themselves, when they became the government in 1993, realized the escalating problem of  air pollution and smog in this country. There is no excuse in the world for 12 years of dithering on this file and many other files. The reality is that  we have been promised and  assured  that the health of Canadians is a number one priority. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other day my colleague from Elmwood—Transcona said very clearly that emissions have raised by 20% in this country. They are not 20% lower. That is disastrous. Our children are breathing in this stuff. They are getting sicker because of it. Because of this health care costs are  increasing and increasing. We can either pay now and do the right thing and bring in mandatory 25% emission reductions, or  we can dither and do nothing and spend all that extra money on funerals, on medical problems and everything else that happens when we do not pay attention to our natural environment.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This particular initiative has  great support from many environment groups throughout the country. We know that many within labour support this initiative as well. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are asking the government for leadership on this file. We are asking that our colleagues in the government   and our other colleagues in  the House support this motion. If we leave anything for our children, it should be cleaner air, cleaner water, and a cleaner planet for many years to come.</p><A NAME="T1605"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1605"><!-- Hour: 4--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1610"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1600"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1605)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><A NAME="Int-1139928"></A><a HREF="#Int-1139941"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-1139902"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Hon. Bryon Wilfert (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of the Environment, Lib.): </b>Mr. Speaker, as always, I appreciate the comments of my colleague from the New Democratic Party. I want to make it very clear to my colleague that the government is in ongoing negotiations with the automobile industry.  We are working toward a voluntary agreement which will be good for the environment and good for the economy. If we fail to get a voluntary agreement, we will have to look at other options including regulatory options. However, the government is committed to deal with emission reductions, not only to 2010 but well beyond 2010.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know the member appreciates the importance of the automobile industry in Canada.  I would like him to note the fact that the government has worked very closely with the automobile industry, including the establishment of a national automobile strategy, and we have dealt with a motor vehicle fuel concentration program.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hon. member is a good listener. Unfortunately, his colleagues are not.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hon. member talked about maybe 25% or beyond. Could he tell us what technology he believes is currently available or in the pipe that would  take us well beyond 25%, realizing the importance of the auto industry and jobs to people who support political parties in the country and who need the jobs?</p><A NAME="Int-1139941"></A><a HREF="#Int-1139956"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-1139928"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Peter Stoffer: </b>Madam Speaker, with the great respect I have for the hon. member, I am amazed that was able to say all that with a straight face. The Liberal strategy on the auto sector is absolutely an oxymoron, if I ever heard one. It is incredible.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I  have a simple question for him. We know from history that every time the automobile sector is asked to do something voluntarily it fights it tooth and nail. It fought tooth and nail against the air bags.  It fought tooth and nail against seat belts.  Anything that meant added costs, it did not want it. Now the automobile sector is a proud proponent of these.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The technology exists.  We have hybrid cars, we have smart cars, we have the industry and we have the will.  We just need leadership from the government to make it happen. The member says that he wants to be very clear. That is what we want. We want a clear environment, no smog, so we can all breathe free and easy in the years to come.</p><A NAME="T1610"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1610"><!-- Hour: 4--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1615"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1605"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1610)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><A NAME="Int-1139956"></A><a HREF="#Int-1139967"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-1139941"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs. Bev Desjarlais (Churchill, NDP): </b>Madam Speaker, our colleague from Ontario was commenting on how we would proceed to go beyond the 25%.

A lot can be done.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are there other aspects along those lines in Manitoba and other provinces that can be done to at least get something started and to give the Liberals an idea where to start because they do not seem to know how to do that.</p><A NAME="Int-1139967"></A><a HREF="#Int-1139976"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-1139956"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Peter Stoffer: </b>Madam Speaker, my colleague comes from the great province of Manitoba which is showing leadership in the area of the environment.

We take the issue of climate change very seriously.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yesterday, the first day of the implementation of the Kyoto accord, should have been cause for great celebration in the land. I am surprised there were no people dancing in the streets.  We would like to think this was the first day on the road toward a cleaner, healthier environment.  The reason we have not seen cross-country jubilation and celebrations in the streets is no one has given the general public any indication that there is a plan in place which may lead to improving the quality of our air and therefore the quality of our life. There is an absolute dearth, a paucity, an absence of any concrete plan whatsoever.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to table today something for the Liberal Party. If the Liberal government is devoid of any plan or any idea on how to achieve the Kyoto goals, the NDP has a concrete plan.  We are willing to share that with the government of the day. It is even costed out clause by clause. I will be happy to go through some of that should time permit.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Liberal government is not even at kindergarten level in terms of how we might achieve our Kyoto goals. The Liberal government is being out-greened by a guy who drives a Hummer.  Arnold Schwarzenegger, the Governor of California, is light years ahead of the Government of Canada. The Prime Minister of Canada is out-greened by a guy who drives a Hummer.  This is shocking to me.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;California has taken seriously the fact that  voluntary compliance for reduction of emissions will not work, which essentially is  the content of our motion today.   If we are waiting for the air to clean up through voluntary compliance or voluntary measures, we had better pack a lunch and a puffer because we will be wheezing like my colleague from Sackville—Eastern Shore, complications that we do not wish on anyone.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our excitement about the advent of the Kyoto accord is tempered greatly by the fact that we do not see a plan on the part of the government to help us get there. We do not have a road map to get to where we need to go. We have soiled our nests so badly that our kids cannot breathe, and it can only get worse unless we take drastic measures. I do not accept that what we are proposing is drastic at all. We believe it is reasonable, achievable, cost effective and necessary. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our motion simply states:</p>
<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td width="15" align="right"></td>
<td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>That, in the opinion of the House, the government should recognize the public health impacts of smog and the failure of voluntary emission standards by legislating mandatory improvements to vehicle efficiency in all classes of light duty vehicles sold in Canada.</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not rocket science. The industry and Canadians should have been going in this direction all along.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There has been reluctance in the industry to accept regulation.  It is not in its nature to willingly accept limitations on how it conducts business. However, there is a duty and an obligation on the part of government to ensure that businesses act in the best interests of Canadians. I remind members that voluntary compliance to ethical guidelines in the accounting industry is what gave us Enron and Nortel, et cetera, until the government in the United States  swept in and introduced strict regulatory measures.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this example there is perhaps something even more important at stake, and that is the air that we breathe. What could be more important and what could be more natural than the government to intervene on behalf of the well-being of all Canadians? If some people are unwilling to accept that we should do these measures for the right reasons, then  they can look at the monetary reasons.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canada's Commissioner of the Environment and Sustainable Development has calculated that the benefits, when compiled about achieving air quality standards contemplated in Kyoto, would be valued at $10 billion annually.    That is a $10 billion net benefit for doing the right thing and making our air safe to breath.  Do we need any more arguments about why we should take steps now? There are secondary impacts that are not even usually factored into the equation of air quality.</p><A NAME="T1615"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1615"><!-- Hour: 4--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1620"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1610"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1615)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Research shows that in the greater Vancouver regional district, improving the quality of air would prevent $74 million a year in crop damage.  That is something we do not consider.  As we soil our nest and pollute our environment, it has an effect not only on the air  we breath for human consumption, but the residue hurts agriculture and that industry sector.   The B.C. Medical Association estimates that 2,000 premature deaths per year in B.C. are the result of air pollution.   I will not bore the House with those statistics because shocking as they are, I think we are all quite aware of them.  That is only one province alone.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There has been a pattern of reluctance of the industry to even implement research and developments to the auto industry without regulation.   There was opposition to even publication of  car-gas mileage in the early years.  In 1975 the American Environmental Protection Agency wanted car companies to start listing what mileage one could expect from the cars they were selling.   They baulked at that.  They did not want to do  it  because they thought it would interfere with their ability to market certain models of cars. Now, after a threat of action from the EPA, car companies stamp right on every product what mileage one can expect from X, Y and Z car.  This has been a net benefit.  It now becomes a marketing advantage for companies to brag that their vehicles achieve X, Y and Z kilometres per litre.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Environmental Protection Agency met with car companies to try to implement reduction of smog causing tailpipe emissions.  The industry was not crazy about it.  Some even claimed that such a rapid change would lead to bankruptcy.  Some of the big three car companies said that if they had to reduce tailpipe emissions, it would be the road to bankruptcy.  That was not the case.  Now Ford and other companies claim that they go beyond regulatory requirements and that is part of their marketing strategy as well, to promote what they make.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We argue that there will be no negative impact on the industry if we raise the bar and expect a higher standard of fuel efficiency. In fact, the industry will rise to those new expectations, meet them and we will all benefit from that.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have a number of points that we put forward in a comprehensive package on how Canada would meet its Kyoto obligations.  As I alluded to earlier, I am glad to share these good ideas with all Canadians, and specifically with the ruling party of the day.  We not only have the ideas, through consultation and canvassing right across the country,  but we costed them out.  We did an analysis as to what the impact would be on jobs.  I am happy to report that there are far greater job creation possibilities in the demand side management of our energy resources than there is  in the supply side of natural resources.    We should all take note of this.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I used to work on the oil rigs and it does not take very many people to produce a barrel of oil.  Once the well is pumping, there are very few people involved at all.    However, it takes a  lot of person hours to energy retrofit a building envelope to save energy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As we clean up the environment,  we will be creating jobs.  This will be jobs and the environment, not jobs versus the environment.  This is something to celebrate as we implement these things on our way to Kyoto.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yesterday is a day we are celebrating, the first day in the survival of the planet.  Let us put a road map in place.  Let us implement motions like this and clean up together for a better world.</p><A NAME="T1620"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1620"><!-- Hour: 4--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1625"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1615"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1620)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><A NAME="Int-1140058"></A><a HREF="#Int-1140077"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-1139976"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Hon. Keith Martin (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of National Defence, Lib.): </b>Madam Speaker, I want to compliment the member from the NDP for this motion. I think it is an excellent motion that speaks to a challenge we are all facing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will just ask him to be perhaps a little patient. As the parliamentary secretary for the minister said very clearly in his comments, currently we are engaging in negotiations with the auto industry. They are at a sensitive time right now, but I hope that he will be pleased in the near future with what will come out of those deliberations. I know that the minister, the parliamentary secretary and the government are working very hard to resolve this conundrum.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me just say we know that the transportation industry is the fastest growing industry. It is a significant contributor to greenhouse gas emissions. The interesting thing is that the technologies to actually implement this change already exist today. If we look at the experiences of Europe, California and Japan, we see that they have done an excellent job in reducing those emissions, not based on technologies that we hope we have but on technologies that we have today. Interestingly enough, that does not include the very expensive hybrid cars we have now, which is a good move. We can actually accomplish the 25% goal with what we have, without hybrids, and  I am sure that in the future hybrids will become more popular.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My question to the hon. member is this. With respect to a Kyoto plan, a significant but under-reported and unrecognized element of what ought to be a part of that plan is not so much how much we burn. It  is one factor, but there is another way in which we can actually meet our Kyoto requirements and indeed go beyond them, and that is in the area of conservation. In other words, we burn fuel and we emit energy, but how do we manage to conserve that energy, which obviously affects the amount of carbon materials and fuel products we burn?</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is the hon. member aware of and does he support the notion that we should adopt better ways of conserving energy through the way in which we build and insulate our homes and buildings? Does he agree that this is a significant way in which we can meet our Kyoto requirements?</p><A NAME="T1625"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1625"><!-- Hour: 4--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1630"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1620"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1625)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><A NAME="Int-1140077"></A><a HREF="#Int-1140095"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-1140058"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Pat Martin: </b>Madam Speaker, the motion we are debating today deals specifically with the mandatory emissions standards for the auto industry, but my colleague from B.C. is absolutely correct in that on the demand side management of our energy resources there are in fact job creation opportunities and unbelievable energy savings that could take us on the road to meeting our Kyoto obligations.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One such idea is the energy retrofitting of our public buildings. I will put this to him as he is a member of the ruling party. The federal government owns 68,000 buildings, many of which are absolute energy hogs because they were built in a time when energy was not an issue in the 1950s and 1960s. With the  current energy retrofit program for the government's own buildings, it will take 150 years to actually retrofit all those buildings because they are doing a handful per year. I challenge him and his government to escalate the federal building initiative tenfold and do 5,000 buildings a year. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It will still take the government 12 or 15 years to get anywhere near full compliance, but it could serve as a demonstration to the rest of the country, to both the private sector and the public sector. It could show people how to save costs in operating buildings, conserve energy, reduce greenhouse gas emissions, create a gazillion jobs, and even create a whole new industry in terms of the new developments in technology, which we could commercialize and export.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are things that the government could do tomorrow morning. I am trying not to be too critical of the current government, because I appreciate the tone and the content of my colleague's question, but there are things we could do tomorrow that would get us well on the way to meeting our Kyoto commitments. We can start with our own publicly owned buildings.</p><A NAME="Int-1140095"></A><a HREF="#Int-1140103"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-1140077"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Acting Speaker (Hon.

I will be sharing my time with the hon. member for Yukon.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, I think it is very important to establish very clearly that the good faith with which the motion has been put is underscored by the overall plan that the New Democratic Party has put forward, of which there are several  key components. I would like to briefly mention what they are.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The New Democratic Party's climate change plan, to which it has referred, has one section on energy efficiency, in particular of buildings, and that is what my colleague who preceded me talked about.  He also talked about federal buildings and sustainability through a green purchasing plan.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House will be interested to know that the Minister of Public Works and Government Services will be appearing before the Standing Committee on Environment and Sustainable Development. He will be responding to questions which I am sure will be raised in respect to programs of energy efficiency in government buildings and in fact in government procurement policies with respect to hybrid vehicles, vehicles powered by alternate fuels and so on.   That is a very important component of the NDP's plan, the intent of  which I am sure the government and all parties would agree with.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another section in the NDP's plan is about sustainable power for the century ahead.  It talks about wind power and solar power and about meeting our carbon reductions through investments in those kinds of technologies. In fact, I could read chapter and verse on those areas where the government has, with the support of the House, been investing in those kinds of technologies, but that was done prior to my remarks. I hope that in the budget there will be an acceleration of those investments.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The New Democrats' plan also talks about investments in transit infrastructure, in particular on the side of rapid mass transit.  There would be no argument there.  In fact, many components of the GST reduction, what is characterized as the new deal for cities and is in fact the portion of the gas tax, will be aimed at investment in and the attempt to change behaviour with respect to mass transit.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another aspect is sustainability.   I think this is important: maximizing employment benefits.  My colleague who preceded me also talked about employment benefits.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reason I mention those components of the NDP's plan is that they are all in keeping with what I think is a good faith, straightforward approach, with elements of that approach already undertaken through initiatives of the government and supported by all sides.  In fact, I would venture to say that no party in the House would disagree with anything in what I have just said.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my perusal of the NDP's plan, and I may be wrong on this, I did not see any reference made in the transport section to the motion that is before us today.  I stand to be corrected if I am wrong, but if I am right then I would like to attempt to extrapolate why I think that has happened.   And if I am wrong, I ask members to take what I say at face value and see if I am right.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems to me that when we are dealing with the automotive sector or the transportation sector it is very important to enter into those negotiations, if we can call them that, in good faith and with every measure of goodwill that is in keeping with the complexities of that sector and the enormous implications with respect to the jobs, not only of the people directly employed in the sector, but of the people employed indirectly in other subsidiary and secondary parts of the sector.</p><A NAME="T1630"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1630"><!-- Hour: 4--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1635"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1625"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1630)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, parts of the automotive sector are all part of the sectors that are supported by the New Democrats and this government and that form part of the innovative and technical and technological capacity of our country. We have to be very careful that what we do to the automotive sector we do not inflict in a multiplier effect, in a domino effect, onto the rest of our economy and our workers.  Indeed, if we do the wrong thing, if we get it wrong, possibly for what we think are the right reasons, then we will inflict great damage on our economy and in fact we will not go in the direction that we want to go.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is the history of that good faith and goodwill relationship that we have had with the automotive sector? The record shows very clearly that we have had numerous agreements of a voluntary nature which have produced substantial benefits, not only with respect to carbon reductions but with high value added right through our economy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would just like to talk about fuel efficiency for a moment and go through what the record states. Members may not be aware that the voluntary company average fuel consumption program   has been in existence for 25 years.  There has been a 25 year contractual relationship with the automotive sector that has  the following record of accomplishments:  steady gains in fuel consumption in the Canadian market vehicles; since 1986, passenger vehicles have averaged 8% better than the targets that were voluntarily agreed on; 2003-04 passenger car fuel consumption was 12% better than the targets; since 1990, light trucks have averaged 3% better than the targets; and then last year, light trucks bettered the targets by 6%.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What this indicates is just a case in point of a 25 year relationship that set targets where the industry was able to meet those targets and in fact do better than the targets. I would submit that the fact the automotive sector is so competitive, so integrated and so strong  has resulted from this kind of relationship we have had.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recently we have seen the kinds of multi-million dollar investments we are making in various parts of the automotive sector to keep it vibrant and that invite shareholder and worker response in terms of support to keep the sector strong.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus, whenever we are looking at motions dealing with a degree of arbitrariness, let us look at that in comparison to the relationship we have had and whether it is necessary at this point to take out the hammer and use that degree of force through backstop regulation or any other kind of regime.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As we know, there are negotiations going on which I think we should not fetter by prematurely imposing something that has not been in character with the traditional relationship we have had with the automotive sector, with both its corporate and its labour representatives, who are presently meeting to look at some form of regime that  would be in keeping with both their desire and our public's desire to meet the carbon reductions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There have been opportunities to approach it in this way in Europe,  an  approach that uses what is called eco-covenants.  These  eco-covenants are developed so that the degree of buy-in  and the  accountability that comes with it are so obvious it is more than just a memorandum of understanding; it is a commitment that technologies in keeping with the kinds of technologies we have seen out of California will continue to be committed to, technologies that are presently being developed and implemented  on   the assembly line.</p><A NAME="T1635"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1635"><!-- Hour: 4--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1640"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1630"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1635)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think it is in total keeping to allow that process to play itself out. The end result will be a strong automotive sector that will continue to add value and jobs and at the same time meet the environmental objectives that we all want to see attained.</p><A NAME="Int-1140164"></A><a HREF="#Int-1140188"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-1140103"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs. Bev Desjarlais (Churchill, NDP): </b>Madam  Speaker, my colleague seemed  to be supportive of the NDP's plan and the motion. Quite frankly often the government talks along those lines.  The issue we have is that the Liberals  have not followed through.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We now have the official implementation date of Kyoto and  the government is not moving ahead with  any plan.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The minister from Manitoba indicated yesterday that the failure of the federal government to have a plan is an issue. The federal Minister of the Environment said that Canada does not have a detailed plan to meet its Kyoto commitments, although it ratified Kyoto in 2002.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the government's minister admits there is no plan, if the government members know there is a plan out there that will do the job, then the government should follow that plan. We do not have any problem with that.  Go ahead and plagiarize our  plan. We want to see it get into action. Plagiarize it.  The government can  have the copyright on it.  We want to see the action. That is the problem.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;People think that  greenhouse gas emissions  do not affect them. I represent the riding of Churchill. People  are feeling it in Churchill, Manitoba. They are seeing it in  the polar bear population. They are seeing issues with weights of polar bears.  There is a risk  that polar bears will become extinct. There is a conservation group now that is calling for the polar bear to be listed as possibly becoming extinct. If greenhouse gas emissions are not attacked aggressively now,  polar bears could become extinct. The group is hoping that by calling for the polar bears to be listed in that category it will force the U.S. to get on line with the Kyoto plan.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sad reality is we have to force our own government here in Canada to get on line and not just talk but put it into action. Why has the government not taken any   action? Why would it not support this motion? We did not even give a timeline.  We are saying to  put the mandatory rules in place so we can get some action started to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.</p><A NAME="T1640"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1640"><!-- Hour: 4--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1645"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1635"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1640)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><A NAME="Int-1140188"></A><a HREF="#Int-1140224"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-1140164"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Alan Tonks: </b>Madam Speaker, I have no problems with plagiarizing because really, plagiarizing is  only a sin  if one does it and does not admit to it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In mentioning the plan, I have said that there are many elements of the position  that have all-party support. I listed what they were and  that should stand on its own.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second thing is with respect to a plan. We do have a plan. The fact is we had a plan in 2000 and we had a plan in 2002. There really was not the degree of collaboration that should have taken place in establishing that plan. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The environmental and sustainable development committee is having that collaboration now.  It is my hope that at the back end of that process and with  the budget that will come out very shortly, the committee will use  its  oversight function. The committee    will be able to   compare what is being done with many of the suggestions that will be brought forward, including elements of the NDP's plan and those of the other parties to see whether further corrections are required. That is the approach.  That is the process.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I tried to give a historical overview of  my understanding of how we entered into negotiations in good faith. We have accomplished a great deal with respect to the automotive sector. We should let that play itself out because it has served us well in the past.</p><A NAME="Int-1140224"></A><a HREF="#Int-1140296"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-1140188"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Hon. Larry Bagnell (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Natural Resources, Lib.): </b>Madam Speaker, as a Yukon resident I have witnessed  first hand the impact that climate change is already having on our land and our community. I would like to speak to two issues of strong importance to northerners, but equally important to all of Canada: reducing emissions and adapting to climate change.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me begin by saying that Canada is committed to the Kyoto protocol and the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. These call for actions to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere and for actions to adapt to the changes in climate. Our success at reducing emissions and responding to climate change will come through broad efforts to forge new thinking, build alliances and invest in knowledge and innovation to advance sustainable development.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government is committed to developing and promoting the adoption of green technologies that will help Canadians, including northerners, develop their economy while addressing greenhouse gas emissions. For example, we are focusing research on helping northerners decrease their reliance on diesel generators. While diesel provides needed energy to remote communities and installations, it also results in greenhouse gas emissions and has several other drawbacks such as high transportation costs and storage issues.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are working with northerners to look at lower emissions alternatives, such as the combination of biomass, wind and photovoltaic technologies. Wood based biomass centralized heating technologies are being assessed where wood biomass is readily available. Small wind turbine technologies are being considered where suitable conditions prevail and installation and maintenance is feasible.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Photovoltaic technologies are being investigated as alternative energy sources for unique applications such as communications facilities. These examples illustrate how the Government of Canada is supporting innovation to find low emissions solutions suited to unique regional circumstances. It is clear in the Kyoto protocol that adaptation is not an alternative to emissions reductions, but is a necessary complement.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Kyoto protocol recognizes that the global climate is changing even as nations make efforts to begin reducing their emissions. A changing climate presents us with complex challenges and  many risks, but also some opportunities. Through innovation we can find ways to reduce risks and take advantage of opportunities.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Adaptation is an approach  to managing risks to protect people, the environment and the economy. Emissions reductions and adaptation are two equally important elements of sustainable development. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dealing with a changing climate is important for all Canadians. As a northerner I already see the evidence of a changing climate that we need to deal with. Some examples of the changes a warmer climate is bringing to the Arctic regions are: the melting of sea ice, glaciers and permafrost; rising sea levels and coastal erosion; increased forest fires and insect outbreaks; the movement of animal species north of their traditional ranges; and shifting vegetation zones.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These and other changes affect the ecosystems and natural resources that northern and aboriginal people have always depended on and could lead to major economic and cultural impacts. This has numerous implications for human health, transportation, infrastructure, environmental management and economic development.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Arctic climate impact assessment, commissioned by the Arctic Council and released last November, describes in detail the impacts of climate change on the polar regions and the implications for the world. The north may be the leading indicator of things to come, but it is not the only region of Canada or the world that will have to adapt to climate change.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The broad issues faced by Canadians are well described in a Government of Canada report published last year, “Climate Change Impacts and Adaptation: A Canadian Perspective”.  This report details the state of knowledge on what a changing climate will mean for water resources, agriculture, forestry, fisheries, coastal zones, transportation, and human health and well-being.</p><A NAME="T1645"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1645"><!-- Hour: 4--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1650"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1640"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1645)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Federal leadership on these issues is important because the issues are complex and cross domestic and international boundaries.  They will require a sustained long term effort in the face of uncertainties. The government in which I have the honour to serve the people of Canada is showing this leadership.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To succeed at adapting to climate change, communities, businesses and citizens need better information on how the climate is changing, and better tools to assess the risks and plan the most effective way to respond. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our government is supporting a great deal of research to build an essential knowledge base for Canadians.  This demonstrates the government's commitment to informing Canadians of this important issue and helping them prepare for the future.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Natural Resources Canada is investing in science to help reduce the vulnerability of Canadians, their communities and the country's infrastructure to reduce climate change.  For example, our earth sciences program conducts and publicizes research aimed at improving our understanding of the sensitivity to climate change of Canada's land mass and coastal areas, including permafrost, floods, landslides and storm surges. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Canadian Forest Service is examining the impact of climate change on tree growth, forest fires, pest outbreaks, and ways to manage our forests more effectively in the face of a changing climate.  Scientists work closely with partners across Canada to assess ways to further reduce impacts and costs, and to help them incorporate new knowledge into planning and resource management.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We also work closely with other federal departments, the provinces and territories, and experts across the country to create building blocks for adaptation to climate change.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are investing $37.5 million over five years in the climate change impacts and adaptation program.  Under this program we have supported more than 130 research studies across Canada to examine the climate change risks and opportunities for a range of sectors and issues, from transportation to traditional food supplies.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government also established the Canadian Climate Change Impacts and Adaptation Research Network,  C-CIARN.  Today this network reaches across Canada and into major economic sectors. The network is connecting the insights of researchers with governments, industries and communities which need to plan for a changing climate.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have witnessed the good work of the northern node of C-CIARN. Led by Yukon College it promotes dialogue and facilitates new research on climate change impacts and adaptation measures throughout Canada's three northern territories, Nunavut, Northwest Territories and Yukon.  I am proud to say that we are working very closely with other governments to develop a long term approach to responding to climate change.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 2002 ministers of the environment and energy from the federal government, provinces and territories agreed to flesh out a national adaptation framework to guide intergovernmental collaboration.  This work will soon be completed, setting the stage for more detailed planning between governments.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Together the efforts I have described make Canada one of the world's leaders in addressing adaptation as part of its climate change plan.  We are in the early stages of understanding the issues and of identifying ways to deal with them.  There is much more work ahead of us.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We need to sustain the development of knowledge.  We need to encourage collaboration and planning to apply this knowledge. We need to engage Canadians to deal with risks and opportunities.  All of these things need to be part of a sustained effort to enable prudent decision making over time.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Climate change is not just an issue for the future.  Many of today's decisions and investments will last long into the future, so we need to make sure they are sustainable as the climate changes. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, we will pursue practical ways to build climate change impacts and adaptation into the government's sustainable development and strategic and operational planning.  We are committed to supporting continued technology innovation and collaborating with all levels of government, industry and Canadians.  Addressing the emissions reduction and adaptation challenges are both important goals of Canada's climate change plan.</p><A NAME="T1650"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1650"><!-- Hour: 4--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1655"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1645"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1650)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><A NAME="Int-1140296"></A><a HREF="#Int-1140308"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-1140224"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Brian Masse (Windsor West, NDP): </b>Madam Speaker, I appreciate the comments of my colleague who I serve with on the industry committee.  I know that he takes all of his speeches here very seriously.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have a couple of questions for him. What are his thoughts about the effects of this issue on human health?  I want to use Ontario as an example. I know the member is from Yukon, but the Ontario Medical Association, for example, has done a study and estimates that smog and pollution will cost the Ontario economy about $1 billion each year.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Given that absolute loss to the economy, setting aside the issues of how it punishes our children, seniors and other Canadians by having this infectious attack on their human health,  why has the government not produced or procured an auto strategy to give confidence to the industry?  Where is that?  We would certainly like to see that because it was promised.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister of Industry told me that he hoped to have a document in front of cabinet.  Has the actual auto strategy been given to cabinet at this point in time and when are we going to see action?  It has been about three and a half years since the CAPC report was initiated.  It has been completed for months.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Could the hon. member shed any light on that subject matter because I believe the industry would be much more supportive if it was confident the government was behind it 100%?</p><A NAME="Int-1140308"></A><a HREF="#Int-1140325"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-1140296"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Hon. Larry Bagnell: </b>Madam Speaker, I complimented the member earlier for knowing many of the provisions the government has put in place when numerous other members of the opposition were not aware of all the programs and services.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In relation to health, I totally agree with him.  The government totally agrees that smog and air pollution are very detrimental to people's health.  That is why I was very disappointed, when I asked the first question this morning related to the programs and regulations, that no one was aware that the particular reduction I was talking about would save 2,100 premature deaths, 93,000 incidents of bronchitis in children, reduce 5 million other health related incidents of asthma attacks, and 11 million acute respiratory symptoms.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many of the items in our plan are to get Canadians off fossil fuels, such as: wind energy, which was big in the throne speech and the budget; ethanol; solar energy; biomass; work on geothermal and hydrogen; green infrastructure for municipalities; education of the public; the EnerGuide program, where 140,000 people have taken advantage of; and $10 million for carbon sequestration. All these things are important to help reduce the greenhouse gases and the concomitant smog, and to reduce the health risks that the member raised.</p><A NAME="T1655"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1655"><!-- Hour: 4--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1700"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1650"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1655)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><A NAME="Int-1140325"></A><a HREF="#Int-1140328"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-1140308"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Hon.

The Arctic climate change report came down in November 2004. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the member is from Yukon, I am sure the member has seen the effects on habitat, polar bears, ice floes, et cetera, and how pollution issues from southern areas of Canada have had an impact on the north.  I wonder if he could make some comments with regard to these impacts, particularly in light of those reports.</p><A NAME="Int-1140328"></A><a HREF="#Int-1140335"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-1140325"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Hon. Larry Bagnell: </b>Madam Speaker, it is ironic that I spoke at a conference partly funded by the Government of Canada two weeks ago on climate change.  It was great to work with 400 scientists. Canada has some of the leading scientists in the world at Environment Canada.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the people who spoke before me said climate change was still just a theory.  I departed from my notes and explained how the permafrost is melting the ice roads that we depend on for the economy in the north, how species are  moving away from the aboriginal villages that have need of them, how building foundations are collapsing causing all sorts of expenses, how mud is pouring into the Arctic Ocean where the permafrost is melting, and how Alaska is taking away an entire island to save a community on the coast.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Climate change is already in the north, which was a point in my speech.  In the south, it is important, as per this motion, that we reduce greenhouse gases, but in the north we also need pillar 2, which is the adaptation to the changes that we are facing so severely in the north.</p><A NAME="Int-1140335"></A><a HREF="#Int-1140383"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-1140328"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Peter Julian (Burnaby—New Westminster, NDP): </b>Madam Speaker, I will be sharing my time with the member for Hamilton Centre.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to begin my speech on this important motion on mandatory emission standards and talk about  why voluntary emission standards have not worked. We have seen this in other areas as well. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have seen it in the voluntary program for energy efficient  homes, a program that was started in 1982 and that members of the government raised a number of times in the debate today. That program to promote energy efficient homes, which was started in the 1980s through a voluntary program, has resulted in less than 10,000 R-2000 energy efficient homes actually being built over a 20 year period. That means about .6% of Canada's new housing starts have involved these energy efficient homes. In other words, that is a failure rate of over 99%.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us talk about voluntary standards in another sector, which is voluntary greenhouse gas reduction efforts announced with loud acclaim by the Liberal government in 1995. Companies were invited to report greenhouse gas emissions and actions taken to reduce them. At the end of 1999 there were 1,000 companies registered with these voluntary standards. Only 10% of the companies that registered actually provided detailed greenhouse gas information. In other words, the failure rate of those voluntary standards was 90%.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have talked today and other hon. colleagues have raised the fact that we have had a total failure by the Liberal government to actually deal with greenhouse gas emissions.  The supposed plan that was put into place was supposed to result in a 20% reduction and we have actually seen a 20% increase. Today members of the government seem to be proud of that deplorable fact that our greenhouse gases have actually gone up when their plan called for a reduction.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What should be a source of shame to all members in all corners of the House is that the OECD has indicated, for 25 environmental indicators, Canada's overall ranking to be 28th out of 29 OECD nations. So much for success on the environmental front. So much for success in putting the plan into effect. We are 28th out of 29 and members of the Liberal government are actually proud of that fact. It is deplorable and that is why the NDP and the member for Skeena--Bulkley Valley, who is very concerned about our environmental future as a nation, brought forward this motion today. Canadians are crying out for decisive government action in this area.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have seen Liberal failures. I would like to talk about the Conservatives for just a moment because it is unclear exactly what position they are taking this time. My colleague from New Westminster--Coquitlam did mention that he could support the motion. Certainly, coming from the area that he does, neighbouring my riding of Burnaby--New Westminster, I can understand he is aware of the concern about the growing pollution problems. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, two other members, the member for Oshawa and the member for Essex, actually said they would be opposing this motion. If so, obviously neither the member for Oshawa nor the member for Essex actually had their speech vetted by the leader of the Conservative Party because this is what the leader of the Conservative Party said in the last election. This comes from the public domain, the CTV website. The leader of the Conservative Party told supporters during the election campaign last June that the Tories would pass a new clean air bill that would include mandatory limits on emissions, with targeted levels.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Very clearly, we have the leader of the Conservative Party, who obviously did not vet the speeches from the member for Oshawa or the member for Essex, speaking in favour of mandatory emissions. That is not all. We have the environment critic from the Conservative Party making the commitment again in the June 28 election to regulate fuel economy in automobiles in order to attain 25% improvement in efficiency.</p><A NAME="T1700"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1700"><!-- Hour: 5--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1705"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1655"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1700)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What we have are members of the Conservative Party saying very clearly in an election campaign that they supported mandatory emissions, and some members at least of the same Conservative Party are now, after the election is finished and obviously after the voters have chosen, saying that they oppose mandatory emissions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is wrong with this picture?  I think it would be charitable at best to say it is deceptive to support mandatory emissions during an election campaign and then not support them in this House when the time comes to actually make a decision and support the Canadian environment.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also like to mention that the Conservative environment critic said that the position on mandatory fuel efficiency was party policy.  This was in a reply to a questionnaire sent to the Sierra Club of Canada. Clearly, we have failure on the government's part.  We have some incoherence from the official opposition.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What do Canadians say? In a poll that was done last year just prior to the election, and that is perhaps why at least in two corners of this House there was lip service paid to the environment, 94% of Canadians showed support for fuel economy. In other words, 94% of Canadians supported mandatory fuel efficiency regulations, including requiring better mileage and lowering greenhouse gas emissions from Canadian cars and trucks.  We are talking about a widespread consensus within the Canadian population that this has to happen.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would suggest woe is the member of Parliament who comes away from this House having voted against what 94% of Canadians support.  In the next election, whether that is in a month or a year, those kinds of issues will be part of the public domain.  Woe to those who go against what they committed to as members of the Conservative Party or as members of the Liberal Party in the last election.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since there is widespread Canadian support right across the country, including British Columbia, it is obvious that Canadians understand what is at stake.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The B.C. Medical Association estimates 2,000 premature deaths per year in British Columbia each year as a result of air pollution. In Ontario, 20% of hospital admissions for infants under the age of one for bronchitis and pneumonia can be attributed to smog. We are not talking about a small issue.  We are talking about an issue that Canadians understand.  Canadians understand the consequences of not acting. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have already talked about voluntary standards being a failure.  Let us talk a bit about what has succeeded in the past. The NDP government in British Columbia put in place a clean air program.  That program up until the year 2000 succeeded in reducing common air contaminants by 40% over the period of the clean air program.  It actually succeeded in reducing per capita emission reduction by 60%. What we saw was clear action by the provincial NDP government in British Columbia. It succeeded in having a substantial impact on the state of air in British Columbia, particularly in the Lower Mainland.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is why when we look at the polls in B.C., the New Democratic Party is leading. Since then, of course, we have stumbled backwards under the Gordon Campbell Liberals.  I think British Columbians are feeling this issue as strongly as any other Canadians and will be voting accordingly in the election to be held in May of this year.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Given that the clean air act brought in by the B.C. NDP government was able to actually reduce the smog provoking emissions, what do we have to contend with when we talk about greenhouse gases and carbon dioxide emissions? In the Greater Vancouver Regional District, part of which I represent, we are looking now at 17,766,109 tonnes of carbon dioxide emissions.  This is up from 12 billion in 1995. If we do not take action, that situation will get worse.  </p><A NAME="T1705"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1705"><!-- Hour: 5--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1710"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1700"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1705)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is why the member for Skeena—Bulkley Valley as well as the member for Toronto—Danforth, our leader, and members of Parliament for Windsor—Tecumseh and for Windsor West have been pushing a green car strategy. We believe in a green car strategy. We believe in saving Canadian jobs by expanding our technology and dealing with this worldwide trend and we will continue to that.</p>

Is he aware of what happened in Ontario with a New Democratic government? That government made every effort to slow down construction of the Darlington nuclear station, with the result that the coal-fired power plant north of Lake Erie is still in operation and will be until 2007. It is the biggest source of pollution in North America. It is still there because we had a New Democratic government in Ontario.</p>

We know very well that Ontario inherited a debt of over $2 billion from the Liberal Party.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, after all the tricks by the Liberal Party in Ontario—which we continue to see here, at the federal level—we notice  that the hon. members of the Liberal Party are still trying to shift their responsibilities onto someone else.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The members and hon. members of the Liberal Party are responsible for a 20% increase in greenhouse gas emissions. They could have changed something, they could have acted. But no, instead of acting, they do nothing, they try to blame others. That is no longer good enough. I think that Canadians showed very clearly at the end of June they are no longer satisfied with the Liberal Party's casting blame on anyone and everyone across the country.</p>

I do not think we have a lot to learn from the B.C. government.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What we do have a lot to learn is the fact that   this government has said that greenhouse gas emissions is  very important. We know that single cars play a very important role as they are largest source of emissions.  We have said that we want to negotiate a voluntary agreement  which has clear targets   and timelines.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those people over there are obviously not listening.  I understand why. They do not want to learn anything. Having clear targets and    actions are important.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to point out to those members that if  we have to bring in regulations, we will.  Unlike that party, we are concerned about jobs in the country.  We are concerned about having a strong economy and a strong environment.</p>

Don Boudria (Glengarry—Prescott—Russell, Lib.) </b>moved that Bill S-3, an act to amend the Official Languages Act (promotion of English and French) be read the second time and referred to a committee.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Speaker, it is an honour and a privilege for me to speak again about Bill S-3, an act to amend the Official Languages Act (promotion of English and French). You will recall that I sponsored the same bill, known as S-4, during the last Parliament. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, allow me to name the instigator of this bill, the former senator—I think that I will say the senator for the rest of his life—the hon. Jean-Robert Gauthier. He used this bill to fight for the entire francophone community in Canada, and of course, for the anglophone minority in Quebec as well, because it applies to both minorities. The bill is aimed therefore at both minorities and is equal in this regard.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The senator has retired now, at least in theory. However, he continues to actively follow the development of francophones outside Quebec, the progress of his bill, and of course, he also continues to work and campaign for a number of causes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill S-3, like S-4 before it, is intended to give the Official Languages Act more bite, to repeat an expression that Jean-Robert Gauthier always uses. Senator Gauthier has gone to bat four times on behalf of this bill since 2001 with bills S-32, S-11, S-4 and, of course, the one before us today, S-3.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before turning to  the broad outline of this bill, allow me to use this opportunity to highlight all that Jean-Robert Gauthier has done as a parliamentarian, in both this chamber and the other.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I was a new MP in 1984, Jean-Robert Gauthier had already been a parliamentarian here for 12 years, having been elected in 1972 and re-elected in 1974, 1979, 1980 and, like me, 1984. Some people say now that I have learned a little about parliamentary procedure. If that is true, it is thanks to  Jean-Robert Gauthier, who kind of adopted me in this regard and taught me the rudiments of procedure in the beginning. Most of all, he inculcated the values into me of being a good parliamentarian, spending a lot of time in the House of Commons and learning to love this institution.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I thought today that I would take advantage of this opportunity to congratulate and thank Jean-Robert Gauthier, not only for what he has done for the linguistic communities and for Canada in general by serving in both chambers of our Parliament, but also personally for all the help he gave me.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Bill S-3 focuses on three major principles: first, it provides that federal institutions must implement Part VII of the Official Languages Act and that regulations may be made  in respect of procedures for carrying out obligations under section 41 of the Act.</p><A NAME="T1720"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1720"><!-- Hour: 5--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1725"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1715"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1720)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, the bill obliges the government to take the necessary steps to implement the commitments provided for in Part VII of the Official Languages Act, and finally, it provides the  right to apply to the courts for remedy against a violation of Part VII of the Official Languages Act.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill S-3 takes account of most of the recommendations made by the Commissioner of Official Languages. I think it is very important to add this. The Commissioner of Official Languages has raised these issues on many occasions. For example, in her annual report for 2003-2004, an entire section entitled “Clarification of Part VII of the <i>Act</i> needed” was devoted to section 41. That is the title of this section recommended by the Commissioner of Official Languages. It is not only Jean-Robert Gauthier—which is already saying a lot—and your humble servant who say so, but also the Commissioner of Official Languages. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In her previous annual report, the same commissioner again recommended that the government clarify the legal scope of the commitment set forth in section 41 of the Act and take the necessary measures to effectively fulfil its responsibilities in this regard. Once again, that was the Commissioner of Official Languages speaking, an objective person in whom we have confidence, an officer of this Parliament, whom we chose unanimously.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So it is time to go further. It is time to give the Government of Canada the tools to enhance the vitality of the francophone and anglophone minorities, given that the phenomenon applies to both, although it may have extra significance for francophones. It must be said that services in our language are by no means  offered on all occasions. It is time to ensure government takes the necessary steps to carry through on its commitment.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill S-3 takes account of most of the recommendations made by the Commissioner of Official Languages. It has been amended several times, precisely in order to improve it and make it better. In the constituency of the hon. member for Acadie—Bathurst, the courts have delivered a ruling on the implementation of the Official Languages Act. Now, it is not always clear whether the Act has this enforceable character or not. The government's position has always been that it was declaratory only, and not enforceable. The Commissioner of Official Languages says that this is not clear. This bill aims to clarify this very point.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If some say that this goes too far, I would even be prepared to accept recommendations on this point. We shall see in committee whether certain of the suggestions made initially by Senator Jean-Robert Gauthier and now by myself have to be modified. The views of anyone are reasonable in this regard.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whatever the case, it is the Commissioner of Official Languages who recommended that Part VII of the Official Languages Act  be clarified, together with the imperative nature of the commitment imposing obligations on federal institutions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Commissioner maintained that the bill should provide for the adoption of regulations, so as to ensure the implementation of an appropriate regime and a right to judicial remedy under section 10 of the Official Languages Act. This aspect of the bill derives directly from a recommendation by the Commissioner. As our good friend Senator Jean-Robert Gauthier used to say so well, a statute without regulations is like a watchdog without teeth. It is now time to give more bite to this Official Languages Act by adopting the measures provided for in the bill. </p><A NAME="T1725"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1725"><!-- Hour: 5--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1730"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1720"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1725)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is time to go further; it is time to give the Government of Canada the tools it needs to foster the development   of francophone and anglophone minorities. It is time to ensure that the necessary steps are taken to implement the government's commitment.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also want to highlight the contribution made by a young man who worked for Senator Jean-Robert Gauthier for a long time, municipal councillor Sébastien Goyer. He drafted much of the text and  did extraordinary work as an employee of the Senate, at the same time, as we all know, he has been a municipal councillor in the township of Russell, in the electoral district I have the honour and privilege of representing. I just wanted to take a moment to congratulate Sébastien Goyer. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is rather symbolic that we are discussing this bill today. It was one week ago that I reported to the House on the intolerance of a newspaper toward the francophone minority in Ontario. I am speaking of the <i>Ottawa Citizen</i>. Unfortunately, this paper used appalling language to describe a municipal bylaw in the town of Rockland in my riding.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That article stirred up the public. There were death threats. Bomb threats  were made to the town hall and the child care centre. Unfortunately, I must report that today, again, the Rockland child care centre had to be evacuated for the same reason.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All of that, unfortunately, was incited by a newspaper, a formerly respectable one, which is celebrating 160 years of existence this year, and which refuses even  to apologize for its actions   to the francophone community. The  final words I have to say on this bill I am sponsoring will be addressed to the <i>Ottawa Citizen</i>.</p>
<p>[<i>English</i>]</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to take the last few minutes I have to deal with my bill today to tell the <i>Ottawa Citizen</i> to wake up and smell the coffee and apologize to my constituents for its inappropriate actions in the past, which have caused damage as late as today in the great riding of Glengarry--Prescott--Russell.  I speak to it directly again in repeating this.</p>

Is he saying that the Commissioner of Official Languages is wrong when she says we need to clarify and give teeth to Part VII of the Act because it lacks enforceability?</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am not sure if that is what he is trying to say. I hope I misunderstood when he said we currently have enough tools. In my speech I referred to the three consecutive reports. Four bills have been tabled in the Senate that make us realize this is not true. It is not the case. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope the hon. member misspoke or that I did not hear him properly when he said the legislation gives the federal government enough authority. That is not the case.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The member for Acadie—Bathurst is here and he knows the situation in his riding. I am sure he does not think the Official Languages Act has enough enforceability in his riding. We saw what happened a few months ago. It happened here and we talked about it in the House. Questions were asked and cases were made at the Standing Committee on Official Languages, which I chaired not so long ago.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Act clearly lacks authority. This fact has been brought up many times.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Some hon. members: </b>Oh, oh!</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Hon. Don Boudria:</b> The heckling opposite will not change this fact.</p><A NAME="T1730"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1730"><!-- Hour: 5--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1735"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1725"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1730)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><A NAME="Int-1140472"></A><a HREF="#Int-1140474"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-1140470"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Yvon Godin (Acadie—Bathurst, NDP): </b>Mr. Speaker, my question is for my colleague from Glengarry—Prescott—Russell, who said that the act needs to be given “more teeth” in order for the government to ensure that the official languages are respected.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my riding, it is true that the case involving  Le Forum des maires de la Péninsule acadienne and  the Canadian Food Inspection Agency was before the courts. It is also true that the Forum des maires won in Federal Court and that the Food Inspection Agency, i.e. the federal government, is continuing to appeal to the Supreme Court in the hope that the Forum des maires will lose its case. If the federal government just kept quiet when we win a case in court, maybe minorities could make some progress.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can see that the law needs “more teeth” and agree with Bill S-3. But why does the government appeal every time that the communities win cases in the courts? It is the federal government, the Liberal government, that is not doing its job and does not respect minorities in Canada. </p><A NAME="Int-1140474"></A><a HREF="#Int-1140477"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-1140472"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Hon. Don Boudria: </b>Mr. Speaker, I agree in part but not totally with what the hon. member said. I do recognize that the legislation is not entirely clear. Witness, the fact that we have been forever hearing about the declaratory nature of this act. A court has determined that it was enforceable. The government agency in question, which continues to maintain that it is declaratory, is once again going before the courts to seek clarification. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hon. member and I am saying one and the same thing:    let us give the Official Languages Act clarity—I am not alone in saying so; the Commissioner to Official Languages said so repeatedly—to put an end to this once and for all. This way, it will be made clear in the act that a part to be determined will be enforceable, as I indicated in my bill, or amendments can be made in committee, as required. Still, it will be clear now, and we  will no longer face the kind of situation faced in Acadie—Bathurst. It is even worse elsewhere, because, at least,   in the Acadie—Bathurst case, some say it is enforceable, including  the  trial court that made the determination in the matter. Elsewhere, the opposite  decision was made.</p><A NAME="Int-1140477"></A><a HREF="#Int-1140481"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-1140474"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Stéphane Bergeron (Verchères—Les Patriotes, BQ): </b>Mr. Speaker, listening to my hon. colleague from Glengarry—Prescott—Russell  respond to the hon. member for Saint-Lambert, I  admired his remarkable parliamentary skills, which  were coloured by some degree of demagoguery, however. He addressed at length one aspect of the preamble, but trying to avoid answering the question.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My hon. colleague from Saint-Lambert said, in different words, exactly the same thing  as the hon. member for Glengarry—Prescott—Russell, as we heard a moment ago: until now, the federal government considered that part VII  was declaratory only,  which was enough as far as it was concerned to protect the francophone and Acadian communities of Canada.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What the hon. member for Saint-Lambert was asking is: why is it that, after so many years, are we now realizing that part VII needs to be made enforceable, because the federal government was unable to properly protect francophone and Acadian communities? My question to my hon. colleague is the following. Why is it that the objectives set under the Official Languages Act were not achieved? That is my question.</p><A NAME="T1735"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1735"><!-- Hour: 5--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1740"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1730"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1735)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><A NAME="Int-1140481"></A><a HREF="#Int-1140519"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-1140477"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Hon.

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. member:</b> Oh, oh!</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Hon. Don Boudria: </b>Mr. Speaker, I am giving the hon. member an explanation. I cannot do more than that.</p><A NAME="Int-1140486"></A><a HREF="#Int-1140493"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-1140520"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Benoît Sauvageau (Repentigny, BQ): </b>Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to have this opportunity to speak to Bill S-3.      I would be remiss if I did not begin by paying tribute to the role played by former Senator Jean-Robert Gauthier, his exceptional devotion and untiring efforts on behalf of francophone minorities and the promotion of their rights.  Senator Jean-Robert Gauthier is the very soul of this bill.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I had the privilege of sitting on the Joint Committee on Official Languages, a committee where partisan politics were very often set aside in order to focus our efforts on promoting the francophone communities.   Throughout our debates and deliberations, I was able to witness the efforts of francophones living in minority situations as well as their marvellous tenacity.   They deserve our total admiration.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since its inception, The Bloc Québécois has been a staunch defender of francophone minorities.  My friend and colleague, the hon. member for Verchères—Les Patriotes,   is also a strong defender of the Acadians in particular.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Implementation of Part VII of the Official Languages Act has been hotly debated for close to 20 years.   At this point it is important to read section 41 of the present Official Languages Act, along with its proposed replacement in Bill S-3.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 41 at present reads: </p>
<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td width="15" align="right"></td>
<td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>The Government of Canada is committed to enhancing the vitality of the English and French linguistic minority communities in Canada and supporting and assisting their development; and fostering the full recognition and use of both English and French in Canadian society.</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The words “is committed to” are extremely important here. However, Bill S-3 stipulates:</p>
<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td width="15" align="right"></td>
<td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>Section 41 of the Official Languages Act is renumbered as subsection 41(1) and is amended by adding the following:</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>
<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td width="15" align="right"></td>
<td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>(2) Within the scope of their functions, duties and powers, federal institutions shall ensure that positive measures are taken for the ongoing and effective advancement and implementation of the Government of Canada’s commitments under subsection (1).</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>
<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td width="15" align="right"></td>
<td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>(3) The Governor in Council may make regulations in respect of federal institutions, other than the Senate, the House of Commons or the Library of Parliament, prescribing the manner in which any duties of those institutions under this Part are to be carried out.</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, the aim of this amendment, as our colleague from Glengarry—Prescott—Russell mentioned, is to section 41 enforceable and provide guidance for its interpretation by the courts.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Subsection 43(1) currently states:</p>
<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td width="15" align="right"></td>
<td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>The Minister of Canadian Heritage shall take such measures as that Minister considers appropriate to advance the equality of status and use of English and French in Canadian society and, without restricting the generality of the foregoing, may take measures to—</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If Bill S-3 were passed, this subsection would read as follows:</p>
<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td width="15" align="right"></td>
<td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>The Minister of Canadian Heritage shall take appropriate measures to advance the equality of status and use of English and French in Canadian society and, without restricting the generality of the foregoing, may take measures to—</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, the words “such measures as that Minister considers appropriate” are being stricken and replaced with “appropriate measures”.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Part VII is being added to subsection 77(1) of the Official Languages Act, which would read:</p>
<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td width="15" align="right"></td>
<td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>Any person who has made a complaint to the Commissioner in respect of a right or duty under sections 4 to 7, sections 10 to 13 or Part IV, V or VII, or in respect of section 91, may apply to the Court for a remedy—</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, I want to give a historical overview of Bill S-3.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the fourth bill that Senator Jean-Robert Gauthier presented in the Senate during the 37th and 38th Parliaments. During the 37th Parliament, he had first proposed Bill S-32 in the first session, then Bill S-11    during the second session, and finally Bill S-4 during the third session. These three almost identical bills preceded Bill S-3, which is before us today. The previous bills died on the order paper when the House prorogued.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After reading and thoroughly studying the bill before us, we must state that we cannot accept it as is. First, we could not accept S-4 during the previous legislature. Moreover, this version of the bill only removes the word “nécessaires”—after the words “mesures positives” in the French text— in sections 41 and 43. In Bill S-4 we read, and I quote:</p>
<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td width="15" align="right"></td>
<td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>Within the scope of their functions, duties and powers, federal institutions shall ensure that positive measures are taken for the ongoing and effective advancement and implementation of the Government of Canada’s commitments—</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Bill S-3 we read:</p>
<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td width="15" align="right"></td>
<td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>Within the scope of their functions, duties and powers, federal institutions shall ensure that positive measures are taken for the ongoing and effective advancement and implementation of the Government of Canada’s commitments—</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the French text, the word “nécessaires”—meaning necessary— has been removed.</p><A NAME="T1740"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1740"><!-- Hour: 5--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1745"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1735"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1740)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regarding section 43,  the English version of Bill S-4 reads “The Minister of Canadian Heritageshall take appropriate measures—” and in Bill S-3, it says “The Minister of Canadian Heritageshall take appropriate measures—” but in the French, the word “nécessaires” has been removed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nothing was changed in section 7, where the new bill continues to direct that Part VIII be added.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reasons the Bloc Québécois opposed Bill S-4 have not changed. We believed then that the scope of section 41 was too broad and too vague and lacked definition.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is another aspect that one forgets in a debate like this, and that is the fact that the two minority language communities in Quebec and in Canada are not on an equal footing. They do not have the same needs. Some francophone communities in Canada are still very fragile. The rate of assimilation of francophones continues to be very high.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One major flaw in the Official Languages Act lies in the fact that it does not recognize the asymmetry between the linguistic minorities in Canada at this time. The situation of francophones outside Quebec is much more worrisome and precarious than that of anglo-Quebeckers, and the act should recognize this.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am sure that the sponsor of this bill, the member for Glengarry—Prescott—Russell, and Senator Gauthier, if he was watching, recognize this fact, but unfortunately this reality is not reflected in the bill and that poses a problem.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The architect of the official languages action plan wrote, in reference to anglophone rights in Quebec, that French Canadians in other provinces can only dream of having the same conditions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Council of Europe wrote in its political affairs report that the minority anglophone situation in Quebec is an excellent example of protecting a minority language group's rights.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Commissioner of Official Languages said something along the same lines during an RDI interview when she said that we must recognize that Quebec—which is where most French Canadians live—is nonetheless a minority in the Canadian federation and therefore a certain asymmetry exists. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, some departments already use an asymmetrical approach in terms of implementing responsibility pursuant to part VII of the Act. Look at the way Citizenship and Immigration handled the parity committees, which exist only for minority Francophones and Acadians.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet, in the fourth version of this bill, the concept of asymmetry is still not included.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These are the main reasons we conclude that, as it stands today, Bill S-3 does not meet the laudable objectives it had set for itself, that is, to encourage the development of minority francophone communities and protect their rights.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bloc Québécois recognizes the particular situation of French-speaking minorities and it hopes the Liberal government will recognize this particularity as well.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bloc Québécois cannot support Bill S-3 unless it is amended to include the concept of asymmetry, which has been recognized by everyone involved in this issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to point out, in closing, that the federal government may now and for some time past feel obliged by section 41 to take measures in support of the development of francophone minority communities. It is obvious, however,  that the federal government chooses not to see  anything binding in part VII of the Official Languages Act and does not really impose any obligations upon itself to take positive measures. This brings us to this bill designed to twist its arm and force it to assume its responsibilities in terms of supporting francophone minorities. It is because of the government's lack of political will that we are finding  ourselves in this situation today.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bloc Québécois believes that applying  the same measures across the board, in Quebec and in Canada, would prejudice the uniqueness of the heart of francophone Canada. The government knows it very well.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bloc Québécois opposed Bill S-4 previously. Well aware of that fact, the government still introduces an almost identical bill. Why?</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sometimes, I wonder if the government is not  purposely introducing legislation it knows full well to be incomplete.The government keeps introducing legislation that makes no room for asymmetrical needs, as recommended by the likes of the Commissioner of Official Languages, the father of the government official languages action plan, the president of the Fédération des communautés francophones et acadienne. But why does it do that?</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps this explains why the bills in question always have names like S-3, S-4, S-11 and S-32, which means that they originated in the Senate, instead of being called C-3, C-4, C-11 and C-32, as bills inspired by the government would be.</p><A NAME="T1745"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1745"><!-- Hour: 5--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1750"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1740"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1745)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><A NAME="Int-1140493"></A><a HREF="#Int-1140498"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-1140486"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Guy Lauzon (Stormont—Dundas—South Glengarry, CPC): </b>Mr. Speaker, first I want to congratulate the author of this bill, Senator Gauthier, now retired. I also want to thank my hon. colleague opposite, who represents the riding next to mine, for defending this cause in the House.</p>
<p>[<i>English</i>]</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The major purpose of the bill is to make the commitments set out in part VII of the Official Languages Act binding on the government. The way the act is worded now, the fulfillment of the objectives in part VII is left up to the discretion of the government. The bill before us today would allow the courts to enforce the implementation of part VII.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can understand why Senator Gauthier felt this bill was necessary. Section 41 of the Official Languages Act commits the federal government to:</p>
<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">

<td width="30" align="right"></td>

<td><small>b) fostering the full recognition and use of both English and French in Canadian society. </small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government has failed dismally on both counts. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 2004, the Federal Court of Appeal stated that:</p>
<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td width="15" align="right"></td>
<td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>Section 41 is declaratory of a commitment and does not create any right or duty that could at this point be enforced by the courts, by any procedure whatsoever.</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In other words, the court ruled that section 41 of the Official Languages Act was a broad statement of principle and not an actual legal obligation. The court went on to say:</p>
<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td width="15" align="right"></td>
<td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>The debate over section 41 must be conducted in Parliament, not in the courts.</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill S-3 addresses this ruling in two ways. First, it would add subsections requiring all federal institutions to take “positive measures...for the ongoing and effective advancement and implementation” of section 41. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, it would add part VII of the Official Languages Act to a list of specific sections of the act that are justiciable which is contained in section 77.</p>
<p>[<i>Translation</i>]</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Simply put, this bill would clearly establish that, if the government does not carry out its duties under part VII of the Official Languages Act, it can be taken to court and forced to do so.</p>
<p>[<i>English</i>]</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Simply put, the bill would make it clear that if the government does not live up to the obligations under part VII of the Official Languages Act it could be taken to court and forced to fulfill these obligations.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a general principle I am very supportive of legislation that removes wiggle room for ministers and holds them to their commitments. However I am afraid the bill might not be drafted in the best way to achieve that goal.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My first concern with Bill S-3 involves section 41. Provincial governments have complained in the past that this section of the Official Languages Act infringes on their jurisdiction. The Bloc Québécois members made the same argument the last time the bill came before the House and I expect  them to raise the same objection this time around.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My concern is that making section 41 justiciable, allowing it to be the subject of court action would clear the way for court challenges that might result in section 41 and the rest of part VII of the Official Languages Act being struck down on the grounds that it was ultra vires, outside the jurisdiction of the federal Parliament.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This concern was raised in committee in 2002 by the Minister of Justice at that time.  To prevent this from happening I would like to work with my colleagues in the Standing Committee on Official Languages to amend the bill, perhaps by adding a section that explicitly respects the provinces and limits the federal government to its own jurisdiction in the way it fulfills section 41 of the act.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My second concern involves another section of the Official Languages Act that is affected by the bill, section 43. While Bill S-3 seeks to make the government's commitment under part VII of the Official Languages Act more enforceable, it does not clarify the scope of these commitments. As a result I fear that unless the bill is amended, it could result in a wave of court actions and the loss of parliamentary control over the nature and extent of the cost of the government's official languages program.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 43 currently states:</p>
<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td width="15" align="right"></td>
<td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>The Minister of Canadian Heritage  shall take such measures as that Minister considers appropriate to advance the equality of status and  use of English and French in Canadian society and...may take measures to (a) enhance the vitality of the English and French linguistic minority communities...; (b) encourage and support the learning of English and French in Canada; (c) foster an acceptance and appreciation of both English and French by members of the public; (d) encourage and assist provincial governments to support the development of English and French linguistic minority communities--</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill S-3 would change the wording of section 43 to clarify that the heritage minister “shall take appropriate measures to advance the equality of status and  use of English and French in Canadian society”. However while it removes the minister's discretion when it comes to that general goal, it still leaves subsections (a) through (d), the list of specific measures totally up to the discretion of the minister.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What that means is that the minister does not have to do any of the specific things listed in section 43, but if someone is unsatisfied with the minister's performance when it comes to a very general objective,  the person could take the matter to court regardless of whether the minister takes any or all of the specific measures listed.</p><A NAME="T1750"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1750"><!-- Hour: 5--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1755"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1745"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1750)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This bill is supposed to reinforce implementation of the government's commitments under part VII of the Official Languages Act. However, with regard to section 43, only the most general provisions would be binding, while the specific obligations identified in that section would remain discretionary.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To me, this is completely backwards. It would be much more logical to leave the first part of section 43 discretionary and make the specific measures binding. The legislation would then give clear direction to the minister, and a specific legal framework by which the courts could determine if the minister was carrying out his duties or not.</p>
<p>[<i>English</i>]</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This bill is supposed to make the government's commitment under part VII of the Official Languages Act more enforceable.  However, in the case of section 43, only the most general provisions would be mandatory while the specific obligations in that section would remain discretionary. That seems totally backwards to me.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It would make far more sense to have the first part of section 43 discretionary and make the specific measures mandatory.  That way the act would give the minister clear direction and it would give the courts a clear framework for deciding whether or not the minister was fulfilling his or her obligations.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In other words, it would better if we could change the last part of section 43 to say “the minister must” instead of “the minister may” take measures to enhance the vitality of official language minority communities, encourage and support the learning of English and French,  and so on, while leaving the more general part as a statement of principles.  That would make it much easier to implement the act.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is something my hon. colleague from Lanark—Carleton suggested the last time the bill was before us.  I think it is a shame that Senator Gauthier did not see fit to make these changes before making another attempt to get the bill through Parliament.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope we can make suitable amendments to the bill in committee to make it more effective in meeting the goals.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will support this bill in principle. I will encourage my colleagues on this side of the House to do likewise, although they will be free to vote as they see fit since this is an item of private members' business.  I think the intention of the bill is something that many members would consider to be reasonable and worthwhile.</p><A NAME="T1755"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1755"><!-- Hour: 5--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1800"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1750"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1755)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will agree in principle with this bill and I invite my Conservative colleagues to do the same. I believe that a good many members consider the intention of this bill to be reasonable and valid.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having said that, I am afraid some of the bill's specific provisions may be seriously flawed in the ways I have described.  I hope to work with all members in committee to improve the bill and perhaps to make it achieve its goals more effectively.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I look forward to hearing from witnesses, looking into the wording of the bill, bringing it back to the House and if necessary, amending it and sending it back to the Senate.  It would be a shame to rush this legislation through, only to find that it had the opposite of its intended use.</p>

I would like to thank the hon. member for Glengarry—Prescott—Russell for sponsoring this bill.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before going into the topic in depth, I would like to thank Senator Jean-Robert Gauthier, now retired from political life, for his legacy.  He always worked very hard for the francophone cause in this country, to eliminate injustices and to ensure the equality of this country's two official languages.   Thank you, Senator Gauthier, and happy retirement.  Although he is retired, I am sure the senator is still working hard on behalf of Canada's minorities.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are three major components to Bill S-3.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, there is the federal government's commitment to enhancing the vitality and supporting the development of the English and French linguistic minority communities of Canada and to fostering full recognition and use of English and French in Canadian society;encourage the official  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, the Minister of Canadian Heritageshall take appropriate measures to advancethe equality of status and use of English andFrench in Canadian society.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, any person who has made a complaintto the Commissioner in respect of aright or duty under sections 4 to 7, sections10 to 13 or Part IV, V or VII, or in respect ofsection 91, may apply to the Court for a remedyunder this Part.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the very essence of this bill is to reinforce the enforceable rather than declaratory nature of the obligations incumbent on the Government of Canada under part VII of the Official Languages Act. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the past 17 years, the Government of Canada has had an Official Languages Act in order to remedy injustices within the francophone and anglophone communities. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet the problem has always been the government's failure to recognize the executory nature of its obligations under section 41 of the Official Languages Act. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once and for all, we need to ensure that the government will honour its obligations in this respect.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Commissioner of Official Languages has, moreover, recommended clarification of part VII, that is clarification of its mandatory nature and the commitment of the federal government.  The problem encountered within federal institutions as far as bilingualism in the public service is concerned is that bilingual service to the Canadian public is poor.   Francophone organizations end  up having to deal with unilingual anglophones.  Examples of this abound, the SANB and the SNA for instance., so there is a problem. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On that subject, I would like to add that not long ago the Standing Committee on Official Languages heard from the president of PSAC. She said there had been a complaint in the public service because an employee had received a letter of reprimand. This public servant, in Ottawa, in a federal office, had spoken in French. That is the point I want to raise.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Imagine what things would be like today if the government ignored the fact that senior managers in the federal government had reprimanded a francophone because he or she had used his or her mother tongue. The senior manager is the one who should be reprimanded. It certainly does not give an anglophone, who has worked hard to learn French in order to be able to serve the public in both official languages, a chance to put that second language into practice. It makes no sense.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The problem is really the government itself which does not respect the two official languages here in Canada, since it lets a senior manager act this way.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, it is true that the law needs more teeth. At the same time, we need a government with more backbone.</p><A NAME="T1800"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1800"><!-- Hour: 6--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1805"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1755"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1800)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the federal government, the Liberal government, opposes Bill S-3,  the message will be sent that it does not wish to respect our country's two official languages. This is the fourth time such a bill has been introduced in Parliament.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, Bill S-3 has come to us from the Senate. The senators thought  voting in favour of this bill was the right thing and the wise thing to do.  There were Conservatives there who agreed with it. We hope that the Conservatives here in the House of Commons will take a lesson from those older Conservatives, the ones that were called Progressive Conservatives. They must remember  we have two languages that we must respect.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the action plan for official languages, $751 million is earmarked to support the official languages. Each time, the francophone communities win something in court. They have had to go to court in order to obtain  their rights and respect. The federal government goes to the appeal court.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will give you an example. This morning's <i>L'Acadie nouvelle</i> reports:</p>

</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Canadian Food Inspection Agency is the Government of Canada. The Government of Canada is the one not recognizing both official languages in order to help the communities to develop. It is the Government of Canada that continues to go to court. In the meantime, Le Forum des maires de la Péninsule acadienne, an agency without means, has to use its savings to be heard in court and the Federal Court has ruled in its favour. The food inspectors are returning, but the federal government disagrees with the ruling and is appealing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My colleague, the member for Glengarry—Prescott—Russell, said that the government would like to respect both official languages, but the legislation does not allow it to. Stop appealing. Accept the court decision and the problem is solved. That is why I think it is the government that does not want to act. I have a hard time believing it will accept Bill S-3, because it does not want it. Bilingualism costs too much. I think that is the real issue. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There needs to be a desire to follow through and take the time. We have been waiting for 17 years. It is time for something to happen.</p>
<p>[<i>English</i>]</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government has the responsibility because there are laws in this country about bilingualism.  We have two languages and we have to respect both languages and get services in both languages.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the government continues to go to the appeal court or the Supreme Court saying it does not have any rights, then do not tell me it hopes and wishes for laws it could respect.  The government has to respect  the court's decision, but that is not what it is doing. I hope that attitude will change. </p><A NAME="T1805"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1805"><!-- Hour: 6--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1810"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1800"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1805)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Liberal government has always maintained that it recognizes the enforceability of the Official Languages Act, but never gave it any real recognition, because that would result in too many court cases. That is what it is saying. That is ridiculous. It wants legislation, but does not want it to be too good, because this would mean that minority communities would go to court.   </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Parliament passes legislation but the government does not want it to be    strong legislation, because it does not want people to go to court. What is this nonsense? The government made this point on many occasions. If part VII of the Official Languages Act is strengthened, everyone will want to go to court.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If everyone goes to court, that means that there is a big problem. It means that the Official Languages   Act was never respected. That is enough. The government has to show the political will to change that.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, we heard a group that appeared before our Committee on Official Languages. It was a group of parents, anglophone parents,    who support the French language. They told us that they wanted to send their kids to immersion schools.</p>
<p>[<i>English</i>]</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They said they want them to go to school to learn French.  That is where we are in 2005.   As for the people of this country now, when we go into the field, into the community, the majority of people understand that we need services in both languages in our country.  They want to learn French, but we are not giving them the tools to do it, not the schools, not the teachers and, after that, not the follow up. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We had a situation, which I said was a shame, where a francophone was working in a public establishment in Ottawa and was reprimanded because she was speaking French. I can tell my friends in the House that if that is what is happening, what can we expect from an anglophone who worked hard, went to school, learned the French language and sees a francophone being reprimanded because she is speaking her mother tongue language? Why will he want to speak French at the age of 16? </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The little bit of English I speak today I learned in Ontario when I moved here.  I know this little bit of English today because I had the opportunity to practise it.  That is what the English parents were telling me today.  They were saying that they do not have that opportunity, that they do not have the tools.  If we want the two communities to work together in order  for people to speak their own language and learn the other language, then we are going to have to respect that.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us look at other countries.  They do not fight over language.  People learn six languages in some countries, five languages in others; it is a goal to learn different languages.  As a Parliament, we have to provide the tools to do  it  and we will support Bill S-3.  It is time to deal with it. It is time the government is forced to deal with it because we have a law in our country and there are two bilingual communities, the English and the French.</p>

Raymond Simard (Parliamentary Secretary to the Deputy Leader of the Government in the House of Commons, Minister responsible for Official Languages and Minister responsible for Democratic Reform, Lib.): </b>Mr. Speaker, it is a privilege for me to take part in the debate today in the House on Bill S-3, an act to amend the Official Languages Act (promotion of English and French).</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As members are no doubt aware, I represent the unique riding of  Saint-Boniface, Manitoba. This riding has an extremely dynamic francophone community currently experiencing significant development in a minority situation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From my active involvement in Manitoba's francophone community, I can tell you that I am extremely concerned by the challenges and opportunities this community faces. This subject has held a special interest for me since my arrival in the House. So, it is a pleasure for me to speak on something close to the heart of those I represent.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This bill was presented in the other place by Senator Jean-Robert Gauthier and was adopted by the senators on October 26, 2004. Today, it is being sponsored by my colleague, the hon. member for Glengarry—Prescott—Russell. All the members in the House recognize the commitment of the hon. member, who has worked tirelessly to move the official languages file forward.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The intention of this bill amending the Official Languages Act is to reinforce the equal status of the official languages of Canada and Canada's commitment in this regard.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Gauthier introduced an initial version of this bill, S-32, on September 19, 2001, in the Senate. Subsequently, Bills S-11 and S-4 were introduced. Each time, the bill made it a little further in the parliamentary process.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The same thing can be said about the government's action with regard to the official languages. Much has changed since the end of 2001. The Minister responsible for the Official Languages has been appointed, the action plan for official languages has been officially unveiled, and the accountability and coordination framework that was part of the action plan, is starting to show results. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government of Canada's commitment to linguistic duality is unequivocal. The throne speech of October 5 reaffirms that the government will work to implement the official languages action plan and continue to promote the vitality of official language minority communities.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What then is the nature of that commitment?  Section 41 of the Official Languages Act includes a formal statement of the commitment of the Government of Canada: promote linguistic duality and support and assist the development of minority francophone and anglophone communities. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a solemn commitment, permanent and visible to all Canadians, because it is formulated not only by the government but by the act itself.  Only another act of Parliament could alter that commitment by the federal government. </p>
<p>[<i>English</i>]</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How is this commitment to be implemented?</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Official Languages Act provides in section 42 that  it is the Minister of  Canadian Heritage who is responsible, in consultation with other ministers, for coordinating the implementation by federal institutions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, section 43 of the act sets out the specific mandate of the Minister of Canadian Heritage to take such measures as the minister deems appropriate and “to advance the equality of status and use of English and French in Canadian society”. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This mandate, like part VII as a whole, is clearly built upon the principle of advancement of official languages that underlies subsection 16(3) of the charter.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The commitment of the federal government in section 41 and its implementation under section 42,  as well as the specific mandate set out in section 43, are very broad.  Their realization depends not only on establishing and managing priorities and allocating funds and other available resources. To a large extent, we depend on the cooperation of many other actors, including provincial and territorial governments, private sector enterprises, voluntary organizations and other institutions and associations which do not fall within the legislative and regulatory control of the federal government.</p><A NAME="T1810"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1810"><!-- Hour: 6--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1815"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1805"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1810)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>[<i>Translation</i>]</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If Bill S-3 were not amended to limit the scope, it could create obligations that would be impossible to meet and would affect our relations with the provinces and territories.  This is why, while supporting the underlying principle of Bill S-3, we would like to be sure that it will not have the effect of hampering relations with the provinces and territories.  The Government of Canada works in close cooperation with the provinces and territories in this regard, and that cooperation must continue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clearly, the Government of Canada assumes the commitment set out in part VII of the Official Languages Act, but this does not mean it cannot be proactive.  That is why we support the underlying principle to Bill S-3, while wishing to restrict its scope.  We must not lose sight of everything that has happened since the first version of this bill was tabled in 2001.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In April 2001, the Prime Minister gave the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs the new mandate to  “consider strong new measures that will continue to ensure the vitality of minority official-language communities and to ensure that Canada’s official languages are better reflected in the culture of the federal public service.”  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a result, on March 12, 2003, the Government of Canada announced that it would be investing $751 million over five years in an official languages action plan.  It also made a commitment, through that action plan, to improve accountability and horizontal management and to provide better support to official language minority communities. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am pleased to have had this opportunity to speak on Bill S-3.  May I express my thanks in closing to Senator Jean-Robert Gauthier for his defence of Canada's official language minority communities over so many years. </p><A NAME="T1815"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1815"><!-- Hour: 6--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1820"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1810"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1815)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><A NAME="Int-1140504"></A><a HREF="#Int-1140507"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-1140510"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Marcel Proulx): </b>The hour provided for the consideration of private members' business has now expired and the order is dropped to the bottom of the order of precedence on the order paper.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The compassionate care benefit program started a year ago in January 2004.  The brochure reads:</p>

</table>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have a true story to tell but  to respect the confidentiality and privacy of the family I will be  using the name Sue. Sue is a 43 year old woman from Langley who  has been caring for her 73 year old mother for a number of years now. It is a very close, loving family. Sue was recently diagnosed with terminal cancer and given two to eight weeks to live. Sue is no longer able to care for her mother so her sister left her job and home in  Okanagan, British Columbia  to come down and care for Sue. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On January 17, Sue's sister and family applied at the EI office for the compassionate care program, which  is there to make it possible for family to take care of one another in a situation like this. Sue's family was told that the sister could not qualify for the compassionate care benefit  because a sister was not considered family under the  legislation. Sue has no husband and  no children  and, as I said, her sister is her family. The EI staff said that they could not make the assumption that she was family. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another portion of this compassionate care program   says that “other” could also qualify for this, and I will share further on the word “other”. The problem with “other” in the legislation is that it  was never defined.  The EI staff said that they did  not have the authority to define “other”, and therefore Sue's sister did not qualify for this package.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The family was told no on January 17  and on  January 19 they   visited our Langley office.  On January 20, I sent off a letter to the Minister of Human Resources regarding this urgent matter. On February 2, I personally delivered a copy of that letter to the minister.   On  February 4, I stood in the House and asked  the minister to do something on this. On February 7, I received a response from the minister in which she said that she did  not have discretion to help this family.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have been working with the minister and with this family for about a month now and to this point nothing has happened. We have been  told that the minister does not have the discretion. The Library of Parliament has shared that the EI Commission does have the discretion. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am here today to ask the minister when  she will do something.  Will she direct the EI Commission to look at this in a timely manner so that the needs of the family can be met and the compassionate care program can truly meet what it is there for?</p><A NAME="T1820"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1820"><!-- Hour: 6--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1825"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1815"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1820)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><A NAME="Int-1140509"></A><a HREF="#Int-1140512"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-1140507"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Hon. Peter Adams (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Human Resources and Skills Development, Lib.): </b>Mr. Speaker, the Government of Canada and the minister and I understand the distress experienced by anyone who has a family member with a serious illness, the sort of case described by my colleague. That is why we are committed to supporting working Canadians to ensure that they are not forced to choose between their jobs and caring for their family during a serious medical crisis. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is for these very humanitarian reasons that the government introduced the compassionate care benefits program in the year 2004 to help Canadian workers faced by these situations, the program to which my colleague refers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Research shows the vast majority of Canadians facing these types of crises are caring for a spouse, parent or child. These benefits ensure that eligible workers can take a temporary leave of absence from work to provide care or support for a gravely ill child, spouse or parent who are at a significant risk of death.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The six weeks of benefits can be shared among family members and can be taken consecutively, concurrently or one week at a time by family members over a 26 week period. This provides families with greater choice so that they will contribute to quality care of gravely ill Canadians.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The six week benefit was found to represent a balanced approach that would meet the needs of Canadian families and establish a sound foundation for the compassionate care benefits. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In determining an appropriate duration for the leave, a variety of evidence was examined, including medical evidence on the duration and cause of grave illnesses, as well as best practices in the public and private sectors.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However  my colleague will be glad to know that an evaluation is being conducted in 2005-06 and part of this evaluation will include an assessment of the adequacy and scope of the benefits. As of December 31, 2004, 5,383 workers had filed a claim for compassionate care benefits, an average of 449 a month. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Canada Labour Code and most provincial and territorial labour codes already provide job protection for workers in this type of situation. Even in those provinces that do not, workers can still receive the federal compassionate care benefit.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Employers recognize the importance of providing a balance between work and family. Of the firms surveyed on this question in 2001, 73% indicated that they did not have to change their practices or operations to accommodate the enhanced leave. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a relatively new benefit. It is too early to know if the initial pattern of demand will continue. As I said, we are working to ensure that Canadians are aware of the program. We will work in consultation with the health care community to ensure that patients and their families are aware of the compassionate care benefit, and aware that it is a resource that they can call on.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Evidence based analysis and ongoing monitoring and assessment will ensure the compassionate care benefit responds to the pressures faced by workers caring for a gravely ill family member,  such as the tragic case mentioned by my colleague.</p><A NAME="Int-1140512"></A><a HREF="#Int-1140514"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-1140509"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Mark Warawa: </b>Mr. Speaker, I am not rising in the House today to hear an hon. member read from a brochure. I am here for answers. Dying people cannot wait.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have some statistics.   The annual budget for this program is $221 million. It has been  in operation for one year and  only $7 million of that $221 million have been spent.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a category of “other”. I am asking  the minister to define “other”. Is a sister family? Is a brother family? I believe they should be  because these are the types of Canadians who are taking care of one another. A sibling is family. The sloppy legislation that we have here  where “other” is  not defined, needs to be dealt with in a timely fashion, not an hon. member reading from a brochure.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ministers do have discretion. We have heard that ministers have had discretion to bring strippers into Canada. We have heard that ministers have discretion to fast-track legislation, like trying to undemocratically redefine marriage. We are hearing now that ministers do not have discretion and they will not be dealing with compassionate care in a timely fashion.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I ask the minister to do the right thing, to  represent Canada and provide compassionate care so families can stay together.</p><A NAME="T1825"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1825"><!-- Hour: 6--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1830"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1820"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1825)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><A NAME="Int-1140514"></A><a HREF="#Int-1140516"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-1140512"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Hon.

The legislation, which is still relatively new an which passed by the House, clearly states that these benefits are open to eligible workers providing care or support to a gravely ill child, spouse or parent who has a significant risk of death.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I have mentioned, it is still new legislation, but already an evaluation is being conducted and part of that evaluation will include an assessment of the adequacy and scope of the benefits prescribed in the legislation. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I repeat again, I feel strongly personally and as does the minister with respect to the case described by my colleague. He has done fine work on that behalf. We are dealing  with a prescription of legislation.</p>

Both the officials of the Department of Citizenship and Immigration and the minister are still dragging their feet in this case.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Mohamed Cherfi's case there are several important elements. Mohamed Cherfi is an Algerian who fled his country and sought refuge in Canada. His request for refugee protection was turned down in 1999. He was able to remain here because of a moratorium on the deportation of Algerians. Like his countrymen, Mr. Cherfi lobbied to have his status recognized. It has been his bad luck to become the spokesperson for these people treated so unfairly by Canada.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Faced with such lobbying, the then Minister of Citizenship and Immigration had no other choice but to give in. An amnesty was declared for non-status Algerians, but in a vengeful gesture, their spokesman, Mr. Cherfi, was excluded.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only solution remaining to him was to hide out in a religious sanctuary. In an unprecedented move, Citizenship and Immigration Canada insisted that the Quebec City police force violate the sanctuary of the Église unie de Saint-Pierre, on Saint-Ursule Street in Quebec City. From there, Mr. Cherfi was taken to the American border and ever since, he has been held in the United States.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These actions by Citizenship and Immigration have mobilized  the community.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To help Mr. Cherfi return, five upstanding citizens of Quebec, including Marc Ouellet, agreed to sponsor him as  a person in need of protection. Mr. Cherfi has a great deal of support in the community in Quebec.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since he went public with his position on non-status Algerians, the risk to his safety has increased tenfold. He is now perceived as someone who has tarnished Algeria's image abroad.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Citizenship and Immigration Canada promised the sponsoring group it would make its decision quickly so that Mr. Cherfi could return, if possible, before he is deported from the United States.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A coalition was created to support him and his family at every turn.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They have received support from the Civil Liberties Union, the Amnesty International French Canadian chapter,  the Table de concertation des organismes au service des personnes réfugiées et immigrantes, the International Civil Liberties Monitoring Group, the Centrale des syndicats du Québec, the  Fédération des femmes du Québec and many others.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have the following question for the Minister of Citizenship and Immigration: why did the Government of Canada not allow Mr. Cherfi to return?</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Has his department lost all human sensitivity? Is the presence of a non-status Algerian in Canada, who exercises his freedom of expression, an embarrassment to Canada?  </p><A NAME="T1830"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1830"><!-- Hour: 6--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1835"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1825"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1830)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

Hedy Fry (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Citizenship and Immigration, Lib.): </b>Mr. Speaker, as I think the hon. member is aware, I cannot comment on the specifics of this case or in fact of any other case.  Nor do I intend to comment on the U.S. immigration system because Canada is a sovereign nation and like every country is guided by its own domestic immigration laws and regulations.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can assure the member that all levels of due process are followed in Canada.  At the same time, I would like to thank the hon. member for her question which allows me to emphasize the important role Canada plays in providing a safe haven for genuine refugees.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canada has a long-standing tradition of generosity toward those seeking our protection, people who are fleeing persecution, torture or risk to life in their home countries.  Canada has in place one of the most generous refugee determination systems in the world.  The principle of fairness, openness and transparency form the core of Canada's refugee protection program.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To maintain the integrity of this system, it is imperative that once all levels of review have been exhausted, unsuccessful candidates leave Canada when required or they are to be removed.  Anyone who wants to live in Canada must go through the appropriate channels.  When a visa officer looks at an application, it is processed according to existing, clear and transparent guidelines.  Each case is judged and decided on its own merits and on the individual circumstances.</p>

The current minister has  approved such applications and granted special status.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of Mr. Cherfi, Citizenship and Immigration Canada violated the sanctuary. Mr. Cherfi   enjoys very wide support from various people, people who knew him and well-known community figures.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, Mr. Cherfi has been accused of not working. A man who volunteered so much time to help his people deserves at least to be considered on humanitarian grounds. The work he has done must be taken into consideration.    We must not forget that he has made a life for himself here, that he is a part of Quebec's society now and, also, that has a spouse impatiently waiting for him here.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, his life is threatened because this matter has caught media attention.  We ask the minister to approve his application.</p>

Hedy Fry: </b>Mr. Speaker, church sanctuary is a tradition.  We all know that.  However, it is not a law. Canada's refugee determination system is a fair and generous one that follows clearly defined processes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government is committed to ensuring that our refugee determination system reflects the values of Canadians and that it has their confidence.  In cases where there are humanitarian and compassionate grounds, that is again determined on a case by case basis, weighing all of the issues.  Therefore, we cannot comment on that individual case or process either.  When all avenues of due process have been followed and a final judgment has been made, we expect the individuals to return home.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If a visa officer receives an application for resettlement as a refugee, the officer has an obligation to review it against the standards outlined by the United Nations convention.  Our system must continue to provide protection to genuine refugees, but it must also continue to follow clear and transparent due process.</p>

I put the question to the Minister of Finance, but it was answered by the Deputy Prime Minister, concerning the thousands of RCMP officer vacancies that are across Canada. In my particular case, I was most concerned about the province of Saskatchewan.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I referenced an earlier quote from the current Minister of Public Works which said that $1 billion would be better spent on the RCMP rather than wasting it on the gun registry. That was an admirable thought.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the justice committee of the House, the Conservative members of the committee had brought forth the motion to transfer $56 million from the gun registry to training for the RCMP. The motion was defeated in committee with the support of the Bloc Québécois  and the NDP supporting the government. So I put the question to the minister to encourage him to put more resources properly where they should be, to the RCMP.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the election campaign I ran into eight or nine RCMP officers door knocking and campaigning.  If I may say so proudly, they all pledged to vote for me. I asked  them, “What do you need, what do you want?  Is the government adequately supporting you?” </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We find in the province of Saskatchewan that we have severe problems with crime. It is unfortunate that the province has a high murder rate and in particular, the city of Saskatoon has one of the highest which is not something we are proud of. We need more police services to deal with the crystal meth problem and the drug abuse problem.  We need more police services to deal with break and enters. I realize that some of this has to do with cities and so forth, but the RCMP needs more resources.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would go out and talk to the individual members, not in front of the cameras, not for consumption, so that they would tell me face to face what they would say to someone who they were viewing as their potential member and now is their member of Parliament. I would ask, “What do you really need?”</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Mounties told me that they needed more basic equipment. The buildings used by their rural detachments were falling apart.  They needed better cars and just the basic equipment to handle their jobs. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They did not need the gun registry. They found it burdensome and a nuisance.  In fact, one of the RCMP officers who first questioned me was in civilian dress and questioned me about the gun registry. I of course explained why I was saying it was such a disaster.  He said, “Good, because we need that money for more proper and useful things.  We have to actually deal with crime in the community and we need money resourced and reallocated. It was not the entire waste of the gun registry that we were asking for but just a portion”.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, my question for the government is, why not take the money and put it into filling  these vacancies, and put it into something that the communities and the RCMP rank and file officers are calling for? </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know the parliamentary secretary will recite what the government has done, but the need is so great. The need continues and the need is not met. Irrespective of what the government will claim to have done, there is still a need for more funding. I wish the government would address that by transferring it from waste to proper spending.</p><A NAME="T1835"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1835"><!-- Hour: 6--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1840"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1830"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1835)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><A NAME="Int-1140532"></A><a HREF="#Int-1140535"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-1140530"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Hon. Peter Adams (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Human Resources and Skills Development, Lib.): </b>Mr. Speaker, the RCMP has a long-standing reputation for providing Canadians with policing services at the federal, provincial, territorial and municipal levels in over 750 detachments across the country. The government has made a significant investment in the RCMP on the federal side, as well as by meeting our contracts with the provinces.  Indeed, the RCMP is now recognized internationally as a modern, sophisticated police force.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We provide the RCMP with a spending authority of almost $3 billion.  In fact, since 1999-2000, the RCMP's annual spending authority has increased by about $850 million, from just under $2 billion to more than $2.8 billion.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The funding provided permits the RCMP to fulfill its obligations under the various police services agreements.  Under these agreements, the provinces are responsible for the appropriate level of policing service in consultation with the commanding officers.  The provincial police services agreement includes a cost share formula, 70% provincial, 30% federal.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since 1999-2000, the RCMP has been authorized to spend an additional $505 million amount for the provision of contract policing services, an increase on the federal side alone of $225 million.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the upcoming fiscal year, we will support the RCMP with additional spending authority of $88 million and more than 500 new officers for contract policing services.  The federal share of this increase is $33 million, with the remainder being paid by our contract partners.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The RCMP is also a responsible partner with the provinces.  The force addresses vacancies in consultation with the provinces and municipalities for detachments across Canada on a continuing basis. In fact, the RCMP is processing requests for more than 180 additional contract officers in Alberta and 142 new municipal police officers in British Columbia.  In addition, the RCMP continuously works with provincial governments and municipalities to address resource issues.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Saskatchewan there are currently 1,100 RCMP members providing contract policing services.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The RCMP is committed to ensuring that necessary resources are available and allocated to fulfill its policing requirements.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As has been previously indicated in this House, the RCMP's Depot Division in Regina, Saskatchewan is training a record number of cadets this year.  In comparison with the 586 newly hired RCMP members in 2001-02, the RCMP has hired well in excess of that number of regular members every year since: in 2002-03, 649; in 2003-04, 839; and a total of 850 regular members to be hired in 2004-05.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, the RCMP is currently conducting a review of all recruiting processes to identify strategic improvements to its recruiting program to ensure that the RCMP continues to meet its law enforcement commitments.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is strong public support from local and national public health and community safety organizations and workers for all aspects of the firearms program.  This government is committed to providing the RCMP with the tools it needs to do their work. This speaks directly to the reference to the Canadian Firearms Registry.  The registry is an important tool for the RCMP.  It queries it on average 2,000 times a day.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Canada Firearms Centre costs have been coming down for several years.  In 2004 the government announced improvement to the firearms program and measures to control costs, with a commitment to the centre's annual funding of approximately $85 million starting next fiscal year, including a cap of $25 million on registration related costs.  This is half of what the funding of the centre was in 2000-01. In fact, there have been major improvements in terms of the organization of the firearms centre and the firearms program in recent years.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, the Canadian Association of Chiefs of Police and the Canadian Professional Police Association support the licensing of all firearms owners and the registering of all firearms.  Indeed, the police association passed a motion in 2004 saying just that.</p><A NAME="T1840"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1840"><!-- Hour: 6--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1845"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1835"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1840)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><A NAME="Int-1140535"></A><a HREF="#Int-1140537"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-1140532"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Bradley Trost: </b>Mr. Speaker, I heard a lot of numbers over there.  I heard a lot of posturing about they had done this and they had done that. I urge the parliamentary secretary to get out there, talk to the rank and file police officers and talk about their needs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am a Conservative.  I do not like spending money by and large, but there are certain things the government  has a need for, and spending for police services is one of them.  It is an economical way to spend money.  If we cut down on drug use, it will save our health care costs.  If we cut down on property crimes, it will allow for more productivity in our economy.  This is a wise and prudent use of resources, but spend it to meet the needs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government rattles off all these numbers.  Talk to the police officers.  What do they really need?  I have asked those officers.  They are not asking for any luxury.  They have said that their rural detachments are declining.  They have problems with their equipment.  They need real resources.  They do not need posturing.  They do not need statistics.</p><A NAME="Int-1140537"></A><a HREF="#Int-1140538"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-1140535"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Hon. Peter Adams: </b>Mr. Speaker, I know it is inappropriate for me to say that the member is a liar and I am not going to say that.  However, if he goes out and talks to people and says that the cost of registration is $1 billion and then asks them what they would do with that  $1 billion, he is going to get a certain response.  That is wrong.  It is completely wrong and if he listened to the figures, he would know it is wrong.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The firearms registry has never cost $1 billion.  Even in the full 10 years of startup it was nowhere near it. Members heard my figure of $25 million. If the member gives false information, he is going to get a very different response than if he gave the real information.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The police associations support the registration of firearms.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government has also invested $112 million to fight organized crime, $100 million to update the criminal record and fingerprint analysis technology, $34 million to address criminal exploitation of children, and $27 million for the DNA data bank alone.  These are expenditures for law enforcement which help the RCMP and the people the member was talking about.</p><A NAME="T1845"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1845"><!-- Hour: 6--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1840"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1845)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
